CNN reporting from Port-au-Prince where the crisis of gang violence is deepening, leaving the country virtually paralyzed. In Gaza, the Israeli military launches a raid on the Al-Shifa Hospital complex, where tens of thousands of civilians have been seeking safety. A doctor says the hospital's surgical building is on fire. Oman is stressing the need for a ceasefire before Israel's planned operation in Rafah begins. We'll bring you my exclusive interview with Oman's foreign minister about the global calls for de-escalation. And unexpected victory for Vladimir Putin after an election that offered Russian voters no real alternatives and no real choice. Well, the security situation in Haiti is growing ever more dangerous. It is by far the largest gang uprising in years there and it shows no signs of stopping. As we've been reporting, gangs have been launching a series of coordinated attacks against government institutions for weeks now. They currently control 80 percent of the capital according to the United Nations and they are also choking off critical food supplies, water and other essential items pushing Haitians into a humanitarian crisis. CNN's David Culver and his team have been in Port-au-Prince, the epicenter of the gang violence conditions for them have been extremely dangerous. Earlier, they filed this report on how the police are now relying on community vigilantes to help them combat the gangs. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Reinforcements have been built up, not only because of the police, but because of the community. They built barricades all around here. For the police station to function properly, they need to rely on the community and to have these almost vigilantes building a lot of the barricades to keep out any gang members. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And as you can see, a lot of them are following surrounded are curious of what we're doing, because for them it's a distraction, really. And you talk to a lot of these folks, and they've come here in the past couple of weeks because of the most recent surge in violence and gangs taking more and more territory here in the city. But these folks have also been on the run from their own homes, for months, if not years. She just got this small bag of rice, and she's going to cook it up for seven people. And a lot of them tell me, they don't know where their next meal is going to be. One little girl, 8 years old, saying, she goes to bed every single night hungry. And a lot of that is because in the past two weeks, in particular, supply lines, especially for programs of international aid like the World Food Programme have been severed. So, while these organizations are trying desperately to get to them, it's not just about getting them into Port-au-Prince, it's been about giving them into communities like this. The challenges logistically are immense. They're dealing with this at a level that they have not faced prior. I mean, it's unprecedented. And the pain, you can sense it in the kids' eyes and their parents who feel helpless at this point. But for them, it's about pushing forward. I ask one woman how you get up every day and move ahead.

And what can the international community do andhave they turned a blind eye effectively and allowed this to happen? Let's start with what is going on in the ground. I mean, 80 percent of controlled now by gang, certainly in the capital. That is a frightening statistic. I spoke to Wyclef Jean (ph) recently who said any solution needs to have those who are armed. He was talking about the gangs at the table having discussions about what happens next. Do you buy that as an argument? O'NEILL: No, not at all. I completely disagree. I think it's -- they can do a negotiating future role for them as you would -- like as we would -- you wouldn't do with Hamas. You wouldn't do with these people either. These gang leaders are killers, they're cruel, they're murderers, the rapes, the sexual violence. No, they need to be arrested, tried and spend some time in prison. The gang members and here maybe it's what Wyclef is alluding to -- is alluding to, most of the -- not the leaders, but the members of these gangs are teenagers in many cases, often forcibly recruited, often with no options in their futures. I know a Catholic nun who works with gang members. And she said they will come up to her, the teenagers, and say, sister, help me get out of this. I don't want to be doing this. But I get a hot meal a day, I get $10.00 a week, I get a rifle. And I have -- but I have no other options. So, for those, yes, we have to have massive programs immediately, as soon as it's safe to get them into schools, job training, they have to do something to pay for what they did in terms of restitution, planting trees, cleaning canals, there's so much that needs to be done. They don't belong in prisons. But for the leaders, no, the only negotiation with them is lay down your arms, and you will be kept in a safe prison and you'll go to trial.",

O'NEILL: Well, that where -- that's where the international multinational security force that's supposed to, this was so frustrating. I don't think the international community has turned a blind eye on Haiti far from it. But the international really has not been nearly quick and forceful enough to deal with this crisis in Haiti, which has now been going on. It's not just the last two weeks, it's 2.5 years since the president was assassinated, was even getting really pretty bad before the president was assassinated. So, the Haitian national police need help. They should take the lead. They actually are doing -- I'm amazed that even with all this problems they have, the shortages, they're being outgunned because most of these weapons and arms come to the United States, which is another issue. Why can't United States stop the importation of bullets and weapons to the gangs? But the HNP, the Haitian National Police are actually doing fairly well. They've had a couple of recent victories against the gangs. If we could get them some support from the international led by the Kenyans but other countries too, with intelligence, with helicopters, with tactical planning, and with support and operations, I think these gangs are not quite as powerful as the media sometimes makes them out to be.",

Sir,it's good to have you, thank you very much indeed. Gaza's largest hospital is at the center of a major Israeli military with health officials saying civilians have been killed and injured. This video of Al-Shifa hospital complex coming from the Gaza health ministry. Witnesses say, the raid is ongoing. One tells CNN, Israeli bulldozers and military vehicles are demolishing and excavating at the edges of that complex. Now, the IDF says the operation began after intelligence indicated senior Hamas leaders had been operating in the hospital and that its troops responded when they were fired at. Well, ahead of that, it dropped leaflets warning civilians to evacuate. The broadcaster Al Jazeera has said that one of its reporters and his crew covering the raid were arrested and severely beaten by Israeli forces before being taken to an undisclosed location. CNN has asked the IDF for comment and so far has had no answer. Jeremy Diamond is with us this hour from Jerusalem. You have been following this extremely closely from your position there in Israel.

They argued that it was a sign that Donald Trump wants another January 6th, they said that it's dark and violent rhetoric that many voters will reject at the ballot box come November. The Trump campaign, however, also rushed to clarify those remarks. They insisted that he was talking about the impact on the auto industry, the impact on the economy, they called it an economic bloodbath. That is what Donald Trump was referring to. We also heard the former president today respond himself directly on True Social, claiming that the media and Democrats were trying to twist his words, and that he was referring, again, to the impact on the auto industry. But look, regardless of what the meaning was there, Donald Trump on Saturday delivered a very dark speech. He really used the type of fear mongering we saw him implement on the 2016 campaign trail. And he used that effectively to instill fear in Americans that if he were not to be elected, that America would be worse off. That's the same type of rhetoric we heard him use on Saturday. And, you know, from my conversations with the Trump campaign, I think he's going to continue to use that on the trail and throughout the general election. And as you mentioned, Becky, he also made some other comments that were concerning both to Democrats and Republicans. At one point, he used dehumanizing language to talk about migrants, he argued that he doesn't think of them as people, particularly those who were imprisoned for violent crimes and as you said, calling them animals. He also repeated a vow that he's made before which is that a day one priority for him if he were to reclaim the White House would be to release those imprisoned for their role on January 6th, he referred to them as hostages. And one of the leading critics we heard on that was his former Vice President Mike Pence. Mike Pence speaking on some of the shows on Sunday said that he disagreed with that word. He thought it was an inappropriate word to describe those who were convicted for their role on January 6th, arguing especially that it's inappropriate, given there are so many Americans being held hostage in Gaza, Becky.",

So, the Mossad director, David Bernea are coming here to Doha to start those talks this Monday, knows exactly how far he can go and what he can agree to, and where he has to walk away. So, we have heard the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu call this counter proposal from Hamas. absurd and unlikely, but he has still sent a delegation here, he is still pushing forward with this. So, that is giving some hope that potentially there is something to be done. Now. The counter proposal from Hamas, we've heard from a senior Hamas leader, they believe that it is logical, they believe that they have clarified their position. And we've heard from Hamas officials in recent days as well that they believe that they have been flexible. So, the latest they have is they want to see in phase one because this would be a multi-phase negotiation and ceasefire is within the six weeks ceasefire that's expected they want 700 to 1000 Palestinian prisoners to be released. And in return, there could be all female hostages, including IDF soldiers, the elderly, the injured, and the sick would be released. That's according to other officials and sources that could amount to some 40 hostages. So, that potentially is phase one. We have heard though from an Israeli diplomat, our diplomats are familiar with these talks that they believe this will be a hard sell for Israel. And we've heard in Israeli officials say that they believe that there are very tough negotiations ahead. But what we're hearing is a similar set of conditions that we have been hearing for some time as certainly. The sticking point and the significant gaps we see between the positions of Hamas and Israel is, of course, when it comes to a potential permanent ceasefire. Israel simply does not want that at this point. Israeli Prime Minister making very clear again on Sunday that he intends to go into Rafah, and that that could take several weeks, that operation.
