Brand new CNN reporting is straight ahead.Plus, the Laken Riley murder trial is underway right now. We'll take you live to the courtroom. And later, mass exodus, why users are leaving Elon Musk's social media platform X and where they are going. Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. All right, let's start the hour on the already rocky rollout for Trump's cabinet picks. Joining us this morning is Democratic Congressman Robert Garcia of California. He joins us live up on Capitol Hill. Congressman, thanks so much for being here with us. I want to ask you first about President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Defense Department, former Fox News Host Pete Hegseth CNN is reporting Hegseth was involved in an investigation into an alleged sexual assault in California back in 2017. What's your reaction to this? REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA):  I mean, it's very disturbing. I think it's pretty clear that Donald Trump is making completely irresponsible picks to his White House. I mean, you're talking about someone that's a Fox News host. There's serious allegations against him. No experience running any sort of major organization. The Department of Defense is our largest organization and agency in the federal government. You add Tulsi Gabbard to that. You add Matt Gaetz to that. And now RFK Jr. to that. I mean, this is It's completely irresponsible people with no experience that want to essentially destroy our agencies, the people that work there and the services they provide. So, I'm shameful, quite frankly.",

Donald Trump isn't doing even just the basics to hire these folks to government.The idea that he wants to bypass security checks, he wants to bypass FBI security checks, including folks at the highest levels of government, like at the Department of Defense or National Security, should be incredibly concerning to us. We know that Donald Trump already has relationships with authoritarians and dictators around the world. We know how irresponsible he has been with classified information. And yet we're going to have picks of his come into our government? They're going to have unfettered access to information to our nation's secrets without going through a basic FBI background check? That should concern every single American, and these folks should be rejected by the Senate, and certainly the Senate should absolutely mandate that they go through this kind of background check.",

Let's listen to that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

His actions, as we all know, have already actually caused measles epidemics in other parts of the world. And we're going to put this person in charge of our health? We just went through the single largest loss of life event, the pandemic, just a couple of years ago. And now Donald Trump wants to put a vaccine skeptic, vaccines, by the way, that saved millions of lives around the world in charge of our health system?

He told me repeatedly that his team is going to be doing their own vetting. He was noncommittal on whether or not he was going to request or even need this ethics report.

And you need about a 94 percent -- above 94 percent vaccination rate in the community to have herd immunity against that particular virus. And it's starting to drop below that. In Florida, now it's about 93 percent. So, if we start removing these requirements for school-age kids to be vaccinated, we're going to see the return of things like polio and measles and other completely preventable, sometimes potentially fatal childhood illnesses.
