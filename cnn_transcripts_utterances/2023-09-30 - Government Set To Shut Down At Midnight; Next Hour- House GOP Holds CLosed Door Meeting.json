It's not looking like House Republicans will be able to do anything to get this done. We will see, though, because we're learning in the next hour, they will have a closed-door meeting, hoping to at least start the process toward a last-minute plan and to sway those hardline holdouts.

After last night when the House again failed to pass a short-term spending bill.There were 21 Republicans who voted against it. Just to keep a reference, only four can actually vote against the bill for it to still pass. That just gives you a sense of how far the divide is. After that vote failed last night, republicans met behind closed doors and they left still without an agreement. So we'll see in this next hour if any progress has been made since last night. But I can't emphasize enough how frustrated Republicans are. Take a listen to how some Republicans have been talking about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE GARCIA, (R) CALIFORNIA: It's a very dangerous tactic to take to say, hey, I want to shut the damn thing down, because it literally benefits no, and it especially doesn't benefit the conservative platform. STEVE WOMACK, (R) ARKANSAS: We're the governing majority. This is what we're supposed to do as a governing majority. We're supposed to lead. And it's kind of hard to lead when you got a, you know, significant number of people that are on the wrong snap count when you call a play. So that's where we are. DAN CRENSHAW, (R) TEXAS: They killed the most conservative position we could take and then called themselves the real conservatives, which is like, make that make sense. (END VIDEO CLIP) [08:05:09] GRAYER: So that's what's going on in the House. Meanwhile, in the Senate, the Senate will also be in today taking a procedural vote on their short-term spending bill. But because of how logistics work in the Senate, that won't be ready until the clock strikes midnight tonight. The bigger issue with that bill, though, is it includes funding for the war in Ukraine, which many Republicans in the House do not support. So we'll have to see what comes out of this meeting coming up at 9:30. But this just gives a sense of how uncertain things are on Capitol Hill right now.",

But it is clear over the course of the last few days that the administration is bracing for a government shutdown. And that means federal agencies sending notices to their workforce telling them of the procedures in the event of a shutdown and also notifying some employees that they will be temporarily furloughed, while others may have to continue to work without pay being deemed essential. But that also has impacts on the services that the federal government provides.For example, the Small Business Administration will stop processing new business loans for small businesses. There will be delays and long-term disaster recovery projects. Millions of women and children could go without food assistance. And of course, as you mentioned there at the top, millions of federal workers as well as active duty troops will not get paid. And that is of concern because it does hit their pockets. And I have been talking to administration officials over the course of the week and they remain concerned about a shutdown, not only because of the work that they do, but also because it's unclear that if this happens, how long it would go. And to give you a little bit of a practical sense of what this means, at the White House, personnel also received notice this week about their instructions in the event of a shutdown. And in some cases, senior aides will have to learn the jobs of junior aides who will be furloughed to just get by in the event of a shutdown. So there are impacts on the American people as well as across the federal government and here at the White House as well as federal agencies. They are bracing for this to happen, although all trying to signal or at least provide or hope that there could be a deal that would avert this.",

Could have a significant effect. You know we're at a point in the economy right now where a lot of people are wondering if we might be ready for a recession. This is the sort of thing that could push you into a recession. You know, at this point, most economists think there's about a 90% chance this is going to happen. What's interesting is how long it could last. I mean the political opinions here have become more entrenched. We saw situations like this during the Clinton administration, during the Obama administration where Republicans came in and tried to force the administration to take really conservative fiscal positions. I think this is going to last a while because the President has really been doubling down on his own plans and his own positions. Recently you see him walking in a picket line with workers.

Those are kind of the basics.And we have to remember as Americans that our economic security is in large part about how the rest of the world and our creditors view us. And I will say that as we've begun to see over the last few years, really decades, these rolling shutdowns, you're seeing fewer foreign creditors wanting to buy U.S. Treasury bills. Not a huge deal yet, but you're seeing just incrementally a little bit of a pullback within the international community from really believing in the U.S. as an economic powerhouse.

JFK Airport breaking an all-time record yesterday, picking up over eight inches. Valley Stream, New York, topping out at over nine inches. And several other locations, not just in New York, but also New Jersey, Connecticut, surrounding areas picking up at least six inches of rain.

It's been a while since we've had one of those. Now one thing to note is we are still anticipating at least up to an extra inch of rain.

So barring an 11th-hour deal, government funding will expire at midnight, and that will immediately trigger an avalanche of impacts across the country that will affect all of us. 2.2 million federal workers and more than 1 million active duty military personnel will either be furloughed or forced to work without pay.We could see major impacts at the nation's airports because of TSA worker and air traffic controller shortages. That's important to note that both of those jobs are considered essential, so those workers will be expected to show up even though they're not getting paid, leading to concerns that workers will simply call in sick and refuse to show up, just like they did in the last shutdown. Also, most national parks will close. The FDA says food safety inspections could be disrupted. Transportation and infrastructure projects in cities across the country could be put on hold. And WIC funding that's the program that provides food and nutrition benefits for women, infant, and children could immediately be at risk. According to the Biden administration, 7 million pregnant moms new mothers, and their children rely on WIC benefits every single day.

Now backing up a little bit. When the migrant search first started taking place, the mayor of Piedres Negras conducted an audit of all these migrants as they were heading in. And each one of them had in their pocket anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 in their pockets because they know that's how much they have to pay the cartel or the human smugglers to get them across the coyotes.And so, we have created by our own very actions at the state and federal level an industry, a billion dollar industry for the cartel and the human smugglers. We need to take that industry away from them. And the state of Texas needs to take the lead, take that by the horns, and actually initiate this processing and jobs plan where we would make certain mandates and certain conditions and requirements from these migrants. First of all, we need to stop using our rivers to get them across. The program is all wrong. We need to use our dry land ports so that we can protect our law enforcement from the elements out there. And we can also treat migrants humanely. There's nothing humane about having rows and hundreds and hundreds and thousands a day crossing through the river and exposing them. We've lost migrants. We've lost law enforcement personnel as a consequence of that. And the process and the plan that would be implemented would be once they get through customs, then there would be like a Texas Department of Emergency Management or a DPS tent that would then be able to process them for the state residency. They would be able to obtain a non-voting purple in color ID card with an RFID chip in it so that it's harder to forge. We could keep track of them because that's one of the conditions. And then also we would be able to charge a $2,000 initial fee knowing that from this audit that took place that they have that money rather than paying and exposing them to the cartels and the human smugglers. Let's use the dry land ports, get them across, initiate this processing fee. Just in some years ago, were having 1,600 crossings daily just in the Eagle Pastel Rio sector alone, that would generate $3.2 million a day and over $1.2 billion annually. As you've mentioned earlier, we now have 8,000 total crossings that are taking place a day. That would generate $16 million and over $5 billion to the state of Texas. Now, I understand that this program or this plan may draw the ire of the Department of Justice, but unfortunately, I think that with the invasion clause that the Texas constitution has, we have some meat and some teeth in there to be able to say and justify ourselves why we had to take action since Congress has failed us in over 30 years in passing effective immigration reform policies. In addition, we would impose a state migrant income tax, and there would be renewal fees as well. And then we would make conditions like they couldn't get anything over a class C misdemeanor or risk deportation or Governor Abbot busing them to another state.",
