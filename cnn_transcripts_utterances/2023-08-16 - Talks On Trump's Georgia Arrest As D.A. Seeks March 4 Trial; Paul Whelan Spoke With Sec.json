Stand by for our exclusive new reporting. And as the death toll from the Maui wildfire climbs above 100, there are now growing questions about the cause of the disaster and the government response. The Hawaii governor, Josh Green, will join us live this hour. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Tonight, the wheels are in motion for Donald Trump's arrest, arraignment and trial in the Georgia election subversion case, the Fulton County district attorney proposing some key dates amid negotiations with Trump's lawyers about details of his surrender. Let's go to CNN's Sara Murray, who is just back from Atlanta where she's covered the indictment and done an excellent job. Sara, tell us about the D.A.'s proposed trial date and how it fits into this already very busy legal and political calendar for the former president.",

In the beginning of January is when the Justice Department has proposed a potential trial in the federal election interference case. Again, that's the Justice Department's proposal. So, it's not clear that's actually going to be when it happens. As you move through January, there's the civil trial involving E. Jean Carroll that happens to be on the same day as the Iowa caucuses. When you get into March, you're looking at Super Tuesday falling just a day after this proposed trial date that Fani Willis has put forward in Georgia. As you move through the month of March, you get into the Stormy Daniels hush money trial. When you get into May or into the trial date that's been proposed for the classified documents case, where Donald Trump has, of course, been indicted and then into July for the Republican National Convention.And, Wolf, as you know, there are going to be plenty of other Republican primary dates scattered on this calendar that we haven't even seen yet.

Look, I mean, the big hold-up, as far as my sources are concerned, in terms of finding a solution to this problem, and a deal that would allow Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich to be swapped out and returned back home to the United States, has been who to get the Russians in return. First and foremost, they want this FSB operative. Vadim Krasikov is his name. He's serving a prison sentence in Germany at the moment for murdering a Chechen dissident. I think it was in 2019. The Germans have been very reluctant or outright refused, you might say, to swap Krasikov for American citizens. And so that's one of the reasons that I'm told a deal has not gone through yet. What is also a possibility, and this may explain the Blinken conversation today with Paul Whelan, it may be a possibility that some other kind of route is now being discussed with the Russians that doesn't involve Krasikov and doesn't involve German involvement.

Wade and constitutional abortion rights protections. And now, this case is headed right back to the Supreme Court. It involves FDA approval for the abortion medication drug, Mifepristone. [18The FDA's approval dates all the way back to the year 2000. The Food and Drug Administration has said that the drug is safe and effective for women. And, in fact, it is the most common way that women end pregnancies in America. Now, just so you know, nothing changes today in terms of the availability of the drug but it could based on developments in lower courts. Last April, a judge in Texas completely suspended FDA approval of the drug and, frankly, just challenged in a very broad way FDA authority for any kind of approval of drugs. And today, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees Texas, reversed part of that ruling but importantly allowed a key part that would roll back availability to pre-2016 protocols. And the protocols involved relate to how quickly the woman would be able to obtain the drug, how late in the pregnancy they could get it, moving all the way up to ten weeks as opposed to pre-2016 seven weeks. The new protocols, again, dating back to 2016, permit non-physicians to prescribe the drug and they let the pills be dispensed by mail. So, immediately, the Department of Justice said this kind of approach from the lower courts second guesses FDA's scientific expertise and they said that they are going to the Supreme Court to appeal this decision. And the Supreme Court in an earlier chapter of this litigation, Wolf, had said everything will remain in place until all appeals run out. So, even though the decision today certainly leaves in doubt women's availability and timing for when they can get Mifepristone and how they can get Mifepristone right now, nothing changes because it's yet to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.",

I would believe that it would be accepted for Supreme Court consideration in this upcoming term with oral arguments held in a few months and ultimate resolution likely by the end of the session that would complete in June of 2024.

Security Council meeting on North Korean human rights, the first in more than five years. North Korea often cites racial discrimination and gun violence in the U.S. to distract from its own dismal human rights record, making Private King a valuable, political pawn, analysts say, an American soldier in North Korean custody with no end in sight.
