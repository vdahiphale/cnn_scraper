Vance's about face on Trump is emblematic of the broader transformation in the GOP over the last eight years. The Republican Party gathering here is unmistakably the party of Donald Trump.RNC Committee Member and GOP Strategist Henry Barbour is with me here. You have been on the Republican National Committee for almost 20 years. You have seen and been a part of that transformation. First question is, what does the selection of J.D. Vance tell you about where your party is right now?",

Vance to be a very compelling story. Here's a guy who grew up in poverty. His mother was an addict. He was raised by his grandparents.He worked hard in school. He joined the Marines. And he has, you know, he's told his life story through this New York Times bestseller. I think it's a great American story, and it's the kind of story that I think Republicans and Democrats and Independents all will find appealing. And --",

You know, you got 82 percent of Americans in a Harvard poll that said they want a new president. And so the big opportunity, not just for Donald Trump, but for the Republican Party overall with the congressional races, governor's races.And so Donald Trump has this big opportunity Thursday night to talk about how he can bring the country together, talk about ideas, and he needs to focus on what I call the politics of addition and not the politics of division, which sometimes is his natural sort of DNA. And, you know, bullets whizzing by your head can have a real impact. And so I'm excited about what I'm hearing from President Trump and he's got a big opportunity. And I will say if he does this, we're going to have not just will we win the electoral college, but I think we'll win the popular vote. And we haven't done that since 2004.",

We're waiting for the judge to get on the bench to then bring the jury in and then hear this verdict. But there's certainly a lot at stake in this case. This is coming on the third day of the deliberations.The jury has been deliberating for about 13 hours since they got the case late Friday afternoon. They only asked two questions that had to do with the specific elements of the charges, but nothing about the testimony or about any evidence. So we expect to have the jury be brought back into the courtroom shortly, where we will learn what this verdict is. The senator has been charged with 16 counts in this vast conspiracy of bribery allegations. Prosecutors have charged him with bribery, with extortion, with wire fraud, with acting as a foreign agent for the government of Egypt, with obstruction of justice, and with multiple counts of conspiracy. Prosecutors say that Menendez had obtained and form of bribes, gold bars, nearly half $1 million in cash, Mercedes Benz convertible. And in exchange, he took steps to pressure two law enforcement agencies in New Jersey about criminal investigations involving one of the co- defendants in this case, and associates of another member of this alleged conspiracy. Also, he allegedly took steps to help the government of Egypt while he was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Now, Menendez's lawyers urged the jury for an acquittal, saying that he took steps that were normal, that were routine for the job of a senator, that he is advocating for his constituents. So we're waiting to hear now what the jury's verdict is in this case. If Menendez is convicted of the most serious charges, he could face as much as 20 years in prison. Dana?",

Joe Biden, as you well know, has a decades long record of being one of the most pro- union politicians in America, the first president to walk a picket line with striking workers.You were there when he announced a $36 billion rescue plan for pensions for 350,000 Teamsters. And yet you are the first major union to -- or the last major union to endorse and you haven't endorsed him. Why is he not automatically your pick? O'BRIEN: Well, because, look, I mean, he is definitely the most pro- labor president we've ever had, we've ever seen. And you're correct, he did fund -- he did fix pensions nationwide not just the Teamsters with $100 billion. So he has done a lot of work on behalf of the Teamsters union and we're very proud of the work that he did. But the reality of it is I represent 1.3 million members very diverse membership. We've got a lot of Republicans, we've got a lot of Democrats, we've got some Independents, so we have an obligation to do our due diligence and just not serve one part of our membership. We've got to hear from all of our membership. And you know, historically, I think we've been very clear that we have not endorsed a presidential candidate until both respective conventions have been concluded. And that's why we asked to speak at both the Republican and Democratic National Convention.",

We brought every single candidate in, had a round table discussion with rank and file members, ask them all the same questions, obviously, various answers on a lot of our issues. But, you know, the reality of it is, look, what you've done in the past doesn't dictate what's going to happen in the future and often two times, you know -- and I'm not suggesting this with President Biden or President Trump, you know, what we've been promising what's been delivered have been two different things and we want to make certain that we respect everything that's been done in the past.

He implemented rules making it easier to fire unionized government workers. During the UAW strike, he visited a non-union plant and urged them not to pay union dues. Why is -- he's somebody you're even considering endorsing given that record.O'BRIEN: Well, I don't think we're considering endorsing anybody at this point in time, but I will say this, if we're not having the discussions, how can we change people's opinions? Look, there is no doubt he has made some decisions that is not favorable to labor, it's not favorable with me. However, if we're not having discussions and pointing out how important it is to make certain we have the right people at the NLRB, make sure we have the ability to organize without threats of retribution and retaliation, then we're not doing our jobs. If you can't have conversations -- I mean, look, we've had conversations with Josh Hawley. Josh Hawley changed his opinion on national right to work. Josh Hawley went out and walked picket lines with the UAW and the Teamsters. And that's someone who, you know, if we didn't have that conversation --",
