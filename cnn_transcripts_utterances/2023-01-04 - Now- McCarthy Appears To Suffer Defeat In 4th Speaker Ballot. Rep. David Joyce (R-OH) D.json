It doesn't appear to be Congressman Donalds or Jordan or Biggs. Is there someone you think might also be able to be an effective speaker? REP. DAVID JOYCE (R-OH): Well, there's plenty of people in here who could be an effective speaker. But Kevin deserves the opportunity because he's been a hell of a leader throughout the process and put together with all of us and laid out the guidelines for the commitment to America. He's the one that helped raise the money to help a lot of candidates voting against him stay alive in their races and he put this majority together. He deserves the opportunity to lead it. You know, there are other people who can step up, sure. You know what, they keep playing games. It could be Hakeem. Let them keep playing that game. But they're delaying all the things we told Americans we were going to do, all the reasons that if we took over the majority we would make happen. And all we do is sit here and twiddle our thumbs while they continue to play games, beat their chest and fundraise off the fact they're blocking the natural progression of our leadership.",

Are there deals being cut or are people just saying along the lines of what we just heard from you, you're just standing in the way of progress here, you're just standing in the way of a conservative agenda, cut it out?",

They probably sprayed it out there in the first round.Then they solidified on Jim Jordan who actively said he didn't want to be speaker and so had to go through a couple rounds of that. Then today, they were on Byron. Tomorrow, who knows. Maybe they'll put up Gaetz. But they'll continue to go down a list. But anybody in their right mind would have to look at this situation and say, do I want to be the speaker? I mean, I would hope that sometime, knowing my dear friend Pete Aguilar and Hakeem Jeffries, they would do that. I'm a Cleveland Browns fan and hope springs eternal. But it would start to get it moving and go back to the days of Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan. You can talk to each other and you can have debate on issues and still come to the center of agreement where you're not getting everything. But in the majority, maybe get 80 percent, good, let's move forward. Our country needs that and our voters demanded that. And that's what we were supposed to be doing with our majority.",

When we do the split screen of it -- we're doing it right now -- you see Democrats, Republicans on the left side of the screen in Covington, then complete dysfunction in Capitol Hill among House Republicans on the right side of the screen.

Our bridges, our ports, they just continue to get in a state of disrepair because we can't do simple things like elect a leader and move on. We got to get back to having true leadership and making committees and things happen. And again, you know, Byron Donalds, this morning, I watched him as I was working out, go across all the different camera screens in the gym. You know, if you're going to fundraise off this tell people you want to be a fundraiser and get out of the business. This business is serious negotiation among real legislators.
