I'm Fredricka Whitfield and we're following breaking news on this Memorial Day weekend.Right now, more than 100 million people are at risk of severe weather as deadly and destructive storms sweep across the Central U.S. from Texas to Michigan and Kansas to Pennsylvania. The storms bring a risk of tornadoes, large hail, damaging winds, and flooding. At least ten people were killed, including children after or possible tornado struck Texas and Arkansas overnight. Homes were obliterated, 18 wheelers flipping over and power lines knocked out. Storm victims say the damage is astonishing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, it's been a crazy busy two months for us from April and May. The storms have seemingly been nonstop.I mean look at some of the video that we have of this tornado that just passed Wichita Falls and northern Texas. I mean, just remarkable some of the images we were getting from yesterday's storm. At least 25 tornado reports. And you can see the tracks there in northern Texas, just north of Dallas. And then another string of tornadoes from Oklahoma that scraped through northern Arkansas as well. Lots of surveys going on today to figure out the damage, what happened and how strong were these tornadoes? This is the threat right now. You see that red? That's the latest tornado watch, goes until 3:00 Central Time includes places like Nashville and Louisville. And then all the yellow is severe thunderstorm watches that go through the afternoon, evening until about 9:00 Eastern Time. We have this line of storms that continues to push through, it will be capable of damaging winds and a couple of tornadoes. And we've seen that on this line from Cincinnati down south of Lexington. You see how the line is kind of bending? When you have that bend in a line a storm that's where you're going to push of damaging winds up to 70 miles per hour. Thats why there are all those warnings there. Plus you can get some embedded tornadoes. We do have some tornado warnings as well, because you can get some spin up along this line. So the threat continues. This is a threat for today that big orange area, that enhanced risk level three out of five from Louisville to Nashville. This is where the threat is today. Again, stretches from Texas, even up into parts of the northeast. There are touching (ph) Pennsylvania and then tomorrow continues to head to the East Coast. We're talking about places like D.C., Richmond, Charlotte, and then even down towards Baton Rouge and the line of storms continues. It could also come with some flooding rain. Flood watches in effect from Missouri down into Tennessee where we could see two to four inches of rain. So here's how this plays out. You can continue to see the line of storms dive south into parts of Kentucky then going into Tennessee. You wake up to storms in Atlanta by tomorrow morning. And then that threat continues to kind of reignite with daytime heat and humidity up and down the East Coast. Rainfall can be again two to four inches from parts of Tennessee there and that's where we've got that moderate flood risks there in the red where we could see some flash flooding from some heavy rains. So just continuing to track what's been an incredibly active April and May for us we've had way more than the average amount of tornado reports or more than 900 in average. Today it would be closer to 700.",

At this point though there's no confirmed injuries and very little damage, we understand. But it's the very fact that Hamas is still able to carry out these rocket attacks that is significant. Hamas did admit to it. They said it was a large barrier barrage of missiles and they say that it was against massacres against civilians in Gaza, which is why they carried this out. Now the IDF, the Israeli military, has since said that they have targeted the rocket launcher that they believe carried out this attack. And it was in Rafah, they say it was located close to two mosques pointing out that this proves once again that Hamas does hide behind the civilian population. So we're hearing from both sides of this at this point, but more than seven months into this war, into a devastating war, much of the country is destroyed in Gaza. We've had more than 35,000 Palestinians killed since October 7. And yet Hamas is still able to carry out these kind of attacks. And that will worry those inside Israel. It'll certainly worry the military. It will increase as well the criticism that we've been hearing as to the military strategy that Israel is carrying out at this point. Many in the world, including the Biden administration is saying there needs to be a political plan to go alongside this military strategy. Otherwise, it's simply won't work. And many more are saying Israel's plan to destroy Hamas completely simply isn't practical, Fred.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So as it was set up before I came on it, it's a historic day for the NCAA, and this guise of amateurism is officially going away. You know, it hasn't really been, they haven't been amateurs for the past 20 years when you look at the TV contracts and the millions of dollars that these athletes bring into these schools. Now, they're able to finally get a piece of that, there's a couple of big points that need to be hammered out in terms of the settlement. But off the top, the money that these schools will get as around $22million. That's kind of a rough figure. Some have said close to 20 or 21. 22 seems to be the number and these schools can distribute that money however they want. The NCAA is letting them use it at their discretion. So that creates the opportunity to have more scholarship opportunities in place. A program like an NCAA baseball team, typically only he has a lot at about 11 right now. Now they're able to say, look, we can put all 20 to 30 players on scholarship if they wish. There's also the opportunity apparently for players to be able to sign multi-year contracts, which might help the massive roster movement that we see in a given year into the transfer portal. But as the previous segment mentioned, Title IX is a big, big issue here because if you divide that money unequally, which is how most athletic departments are set up now, the revenue producing sports they bring in the money and fund the lesser sports. A lot of women's sports fall under that umbrella. If you keep the revenue that way, that's a title nine lawsuit potentially. And even if you divide it equally amongst all the athletes, that's what the potential for lawsuits as well for the revenue producing sports players to say, well, wait a minute, we're the ones that bring in the bulk of this money anyways, why are we not receiving a full piece of the pie? The other big question is NIL is not going away. The settlement does not have anything or change anything to do with NIL. The NCAA has really been in competent with trying to enforce it. They're actually barred from enforcing any type of NIL reductions or policing NIL because of a separate antitrust lawsuit filed by the states and Tennessee and Virginia. So that's the other big thing is they need to figure out a way to regulate that. There's been conversations about having it being a separate office like the NFLPA does. The NBA does that separately, so those the two big issues the settlement is a big deal and its great for the athletes, but there's still a few things that are really unresolved still.",
