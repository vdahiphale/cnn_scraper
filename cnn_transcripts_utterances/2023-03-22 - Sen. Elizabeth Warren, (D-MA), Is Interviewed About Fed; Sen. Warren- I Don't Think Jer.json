The appeals court is saying he needs to go back before a grand jury, provide additional testimony, and he has to hand over documents which include things like hand written notes and transcriptions of verbal calls.Now, this all came to because he went to a grand jury previously and he declined to answer some of the questions put before him. He cited attorney client privilege. Prosecutors went to a judge and said, look, we have evidence that the former President Donald Trump may have committed a crime, essentially using his attorney to do so. They showed surveillance tapes. And by making that argument, they convinced the judge to pierce this attorney client privilege shield. The appeals court agreed with the lower court judge and said, look, Evan Corcoran, you got to go back and testify. You got to hand over these notes.",

We've seen these giant corporations, particularly industries that are very concentrated, really pushing their prices up. So there are three things that are helping push prices up. And do how many of those three can be affected by raising interest rates? None of them. The whole point is that Powell is using the one tool the Fed has, and that is raise interest rates.

I predicted five years ago, the consequence of that kind of weakening would be that we would see these banks load up on risk, build their short term profits, give themselves ginormous bonuses and big salaries, and then some of those banks will explode.

CNN's Jessica Schneider reports for us now.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A Delaware judge now weighing whether the $1.6 billion defamation case against Fox News should go to a jury trial. RUPERT MURDOCH, EXEC. CHAIRMAN NEWS CORPORATION/CO-CHAIRMAN FOX CORPORATION: It's my distinct honor to introduce the commander in chief and the President of the United States, my friend Donald J. Trump. SCHNEIDER (voice-over): And if Fox Corporation Chairman Rupert Murdoch should be called to testify. Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis told lawyers Wednesday, \"He holds a special role at Fox Corporation, that he may be able to be compelled to be here.\" Lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems have already asked the court to let them call Rupert Murdoch and his CEO son Lachlan, if the case goes to trial next month. Fox is resisting the effort, saying the Murdochs have limited knowledge of how Fox News made editorial decisions and would be burdened by having to appear in person. The judge said it is possible they could appear over video conferencing if called. Both have already given depositions in the case, with Rupert Murdoch acknowledging some Fox News hosts endorsed election conspiracy theories and then saying, I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it in hindsight. In the days after the 2020 election, Fox News repeatedly featured guests like Sidney Powell. SIDNEY POWELL, TRUMP ATTORNEY WHO CHALLENGED 2020 ELECTION RESULTS: It is one huge, huge criminal conspiracy. SCHNEIDER (voice-over): She and others accuse Dominion of using its machines and software to rig the 2020 election. Fox News says it can't be liable for airing inherently newsworthy allegations from public figures like Powell and Trump's former attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Judge Eric Davis questioned a Fox lawyer asking if top executives had the power to block the network's hosts from booking pro Trump attorneys that they knew would promote false claims about Dominion. Fox's lawyer said that even if the Murdochs or other executives were aware of the bookings, they can't be held liable because they weren't directly involved in the decision making to put the guests on shows. \"It's not enough to show that these executives have the ability to step in,\" Fox lawyer Erin Murphy argued. She also said the Murdochs and other top executives don't control what goes on the air. But Rupert Murdoch, in his deposition, acknowledged that he could have stopped Trump's legal team, which peddled election lies, from appearing on the network's air, but didn't. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

About 6,000 people die each year waiting for transplants.And because of testing errors, there were 70 deaths between 2010 and 2020 and about 250 infected organs were transplanted. Now, as you can imagine, as you said, there's been this monopoly. The United Network for Organ Share and known as UNOS, they've been running the show for more than 30 years. They've had the sole contract with the federal government. So what the Biden administration is saying is, look, we're going to seek out other groups to have that contract and they're hoping that that can improve things. Let's take a look at what a Senate Finance Committee said last year about what needed to be improved. They said, \"From the top down, the U.S. transplant network is not working, putting Americans lives at risk. The UNOS information technology system is outdated, mismanaged and insecure.\" They then went on to call it decrepit and said that there was no apparent solution in sight.
