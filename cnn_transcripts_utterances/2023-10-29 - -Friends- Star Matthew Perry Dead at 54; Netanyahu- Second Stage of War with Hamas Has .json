He struggled with various addictions for years.CNN's Camila Bernal has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Amara, Victor, shock and sadness, that has been the reaction from Hollywood and from fans to the death of Matthew Perry. Police here in Los Angeles say that they are investigating his death and this is according to a law enforcement source that spoke to CNN, they responded to his home at 4:10 p.m. local time on Saturday. The Los Angeles Fire Department also telling CNN that the 911 call came in at 4:07 p.m. and this was for a water rescue emergency. Now, \"The Los Angeles Times\" is reporting that he died in an apparent drowning accident at his home here in L.A., and they cited a law enforcement source and said no foul play is suspected. Now, we are, of course, waiting for more details on exactly what happened. We know Perry developed a love for acting in his teenage years. He started with smaller roles and eventually landed higher profile roles, but it was being cast as the funny and very sarcastic Chandler on \"Friends\" that truly made him famous. Offscreen, the actors became as close as the characters on the show and they famously negotiated together to become some of the highest paid actors on a television series at the time. And despite the joy he brought to audiences, he also shared his struggles with addiction. He eventually was able to share many of those details with his fans and said that he wanted to share this in his book, because he wanted to help people -- Amara, Victor. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That he had attended over 6,000 AA meetings, he had over 14 surgeries and had been in rehab numerous times, spending millions of dollars on his struggle to sobriety. This is a disease, as we know. The opioid epidemic is a major issue in our country. And Matthew Perry was part of that. But still, with the news of his death yesterday, as you said, at just the age of 54, so young, after his memoir, after that press tour for the book, it seemed like he was really entering a new chapter, where he was helping people.

And of course, I don't mean that literally, there were more than one network at the time, but Thursday nights when \"Friends\" was on, if you were not watching, what were you doing? This was truly must-see TV. That's why NBC had that tag line, must-see TV. And you're absolutely right, Victor. That \"Friends\" streaming, of course, we know it's on Max, and people are watching it all the time. There are new generations, kids and teenagers are discovering it today. They're seeing Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing when he was in his 20s today, discovering the show for the first time. In fact, \"Friends\" is even credited with teaching many people around the world how to speak English. There have been so many people who have said that they've watched the show in different countries and that's how they learned to speak the English language.

They have been pillaged, because people are so desperate at this stage to get anything they can get their hands on.I think that breakdown of civil order is an important measure of what's going on in the Gaza Strip. It's certainly what we've been hearing who have been working inside the Gaza strip for decades now. It is their warehouses that are now being pillaged. And, of course, that breakdown of civil order, Sara, is the result of the fact that over the course of the last three weeks, it isn't just the air strikes, and I could show you also some of the aftermath of the latest overnight air strikes on one of the refugee camps inside the Gaza Strip, the Al-Nuseirat camp, a mosque had been built there a few years ago. People had in the last few days been sheltering there. People who had left the north of the Gaza Strip, according to the instructions that they had heard over the course of the last few weeks, trying to get to safety who had been sheltering around that mosque as best they could, a strike overnight, 13 people killed. Many more wounded. And again, the images that we're seeing coming from the journalists that are working with CNN inside the Gaza Strip show families desperately -- people desperately trying to find survivors under the trouble. That is pretty effective, the airstrikes that have gotten so much worse these last few days. But to your question, Sara, about the humanitarian situation, what the U.N. estimates is that 100 trucks should get into the Gaza Strip every day to see to the needs of the more than 2 million people who live there. Over the course of the last week, we've had just under a hundred, last three weeks, just under a hundred. They've included medicine, they've included some of the food supplies that are so desperately needed. They've included no fuel at all. And that's why the U.N. agency say they may only have a few more days to continue, the situation on the ground, desperate. The aid trucks, we're being told, will be able to go in faster, but for now, it's been desperately slow, Sara.",

We thought we had the privilege to stand at the side and not be part of, and now we realize, it's just not sustainable. He says most of the ultraorthodox here believe their jobs are to keep the Jewish religion alive and well, spending their days studying the Torah. The Israeli military reported between 2019 and 2021 only about 1,200 or so ultraorthodox Jews were conscripted annually. That's out of 12,000 potential applicants. Why do the Hassidim, the ultraorthodox, not want to serve in the army? The ultraorthodox people in Israel have an ethos, according to which, studying the Torah gives the nation a metaphysical layer of defense, he says. But he says he cannot see how that is enough now. He says he knows many other Hassidim feel the same. I personally sat in my living room and just cried for a day. We can't just go on with our daily lives. We said never again after the Holocaust, and if we want to be able to say that again to the next generation and promise our children a sustainable future, we have to solve this issue. In Hebrew, this sign says, \"together we will win\", it's very rare to see this kind of nationalistic language in ultraorthodox neighborhoods like this one in Israel. You're also seeing a lot of Israeli flags plastered all over the place. That just doesn't happen during normal times. It gives you some sense that opinions among the ultraorthodox have changed. Leitner's wife opinion has certainly changed, but she does worry about one thing.

Because Israel has to think about a lot of things. If it goes in completely on the ground, will it have to try and run Gaza itself if that's what they intend to do at some point?

So I think the objective right now is to defang Hamas, to get rid of the military leaders of their weapons, which obviously they still have. They're still firing into Israel. I think they will -- one of the reasons that it took so long for this operation to begin is, in my view, they were trying to figure out what to do assuming that they remove Hamas from power, what goes in next because I do not think that Israel wants to be in charge of Gaza again. It was -- they did it for many years and it was difficult, nobody wanted it. It's going to be very difficult to find a different set-up, so that Israel can have security and Hamas is not in power. And you know, having said that, in addition to the military situation, in addition to what happens in Gaza, Israel needs to launch some kind of an alternative for the Palestinians. Hamas has been a nightmare for Palestinians and for Israelis. And Israel needs to provide an alternative for the future. I think we're going to see more of that once the political winds start blowing harder. The Netanyahu government has shown itself incapable of keeping Israel safe.

And I think what we've seen in this past week really encapsulate where this Republican Party is at which is that the House Speaker that was just newly elected, Mike Johnson of Louisiana, was one of the leading -- excuse me -- was one of the leading architects of trying to overturn the 2020 election and supported lawsuits against it. And he is now the Speaker of the House. And someone who stood by the constitution, the former vice president, sees that he has no ability to increase his standing or any support among the Republican base and had to end his presidential campaign.",

She, of course, has been gaining more traction, I think because she is trying to show this other route for the Republican Party, particularly one that is not isolationist, one that shows that America needs to lead in these global conflicts and she continues to lean into that, and is having some success, but again, she still is more than 40 points behind Trump.",

Scenes of incomprehensible loss, shrouded bodies the latest among thousands of victims. Israel says it has targeted Hamas, now also expanding its ground operations. A retaliation they say to the Hamas terror attacks of October 7th, that left almost 1,400 dead and more than 200 held hostage inside Gaza. But in the besieged strip of land, the number of Palestinians killed also rises with each and every air strike. \"The situation here is dire. Our homes were destroyed in the air strikes. Six of our family members were killed. What can we do? We are all living through this.\" This was the scene on Friday at the Al Shifa Hospital, the largest in Gaza. Now not only a lifeline to thousands of patients, but a sanctuary to tens of thousands, including children displaced by the war. \"We're not even asking for food, we're not asking for water. We're asking for safety, for security. Our men, women, our children -- they've all been killed.\" Many have come in the hope that hospitals will remain a safe haven, but this safe haven is now being characterized by Israel, with no verifiable evidence as a potential target.",
