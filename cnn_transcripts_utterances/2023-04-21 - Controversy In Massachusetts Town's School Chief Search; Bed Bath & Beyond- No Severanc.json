DeSantis has been making trips across the country ahead of an expected bid and collecting some not-so-great headlines along the way. Conservative allies have questioned some of his recent moves.CNN's Jessica Dean has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JESSICA DEAN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  When it comes to political battles Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis usually finds himself on the attack. GOV. RON DESANTIS, (R) FLORIDA:  I said I'm not going to sit back and try to skirt issues. I'm going on offense. I'm going to take the bull by the horns. I'm going to go in there and we're not going to leave anything left to chance. DEAN (voice-over):  But as DeSantis nears an official entrance to the 2024 race he's hit a rough stretch with potential allies expressing concern about his policy stances and others questioning his approach to wooing GOP lawmakers to back his not-yet-announced candidacy. DeSantis' recent move to sign a six-week abortion ban during a late- night private ceremony after returning from out-of-state travel prompting concern from top GOP donors, including billionaire Ken Langone, who told The Washington Post he wants the Florida governor to moderate his stance on the issue and to, quote, \"Be a little more conciliatory.\" Some of DeSantis' political rivals also criticizing his action on abortion. GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU, (R) NEW HAMPSHIRE:  Of course, that's a horrible position to be. And it's upsetting a lot of folks because a lot of Republicans are realizing it's going to hurt our message and hurt our ability to win. DEAN (voice-over):  DeSantis also visited Washington this week where he met with Republican lawmakers seeking to build support for an expected campaign. REP. DAN MEUSER (R-PA):  He's got a lot of factors to consider and one of them is his constituent, the former president, Donald J. Trump. DEAN (voice-over):  But former President Donald Trump and his team are one step ahead, planning a separate dinner at Mar-a-Lago with lawmakers and locking down support from several members of the Florida GOP delegation.",
