Of course, as you mentioned, they had agreed months ago to two debates. The first of which, of course, was on June 27th with CNN and set off that distinct chain of events that led to Biden ending his campaign and Harris now becoming the likely Democratic nominee, but they also agreed two months ago this September 10th debate with ABC News. Now, I think we all know we've watched this over the last several weeks. You know, several days that within 48 hours of biting ending his campaign, Kamala Harris has seen a surge of support from Democratic fundraising, enthusiasm on the ground, and, of course, with high level endorsements from essentially every Democratic leader, the last holdout was really the Obamas. And we saw that as Kayla just laid out. I want to read for you some of what Stephen Cheung, one of Donald Trump's top advisors said in this statement. He said, quote, given the continued political chaos surrounding Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat Party, general election debate details cannot be finalized until Democrats formally decide on their nominee. It went on to say it would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds. Now, again, they are saying this despite it being very clear that Harris does seem like the likely person he is going to face off in the fall. Now, Trump himself actually addressed this with reporters earlier this week. He said that he agreed to a debate with Joe Biden, not with Harris, but also argued he still wants to debate. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I haven't agreed to anything. I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden. But I want to debate her and she'll be no different because they have the same policies. I think debating is important for a presidential race. I really do. I think that you have to get -- you sort of have an obligation to debate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But right now, when I talk to him, they're really in a wait and see moment. And, of course, this is a departure from what they had committed to in the past.",

The two were arrested in the U.S. after evading law enforcement for decades. Officials say Ismael Zambada, known as El Mayo, and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the son of El Chapo, were taken into custody after boarding a plane under the pretense of inspecting a property in Mexico when they got a surprise of their lives.Let's get straight to CNN's Polo Sandoval with the details. So, what happened? They got him on this plane and then?",

      "sentences": "So, we can't overstate this enough. This is a massive victory for the U.S. government, Sara. You have one of the most wanted cartel bosses, at least wanted by the federal government, a multimillion dollar price on his head, who, together with Joaquin Guzman, we all know him as El Chapo, helped actually establish the Sinaloa Cartel, was essentially tricked to fly into the waiting arms of U.S. law enforcement. It really reads out of a Narcos episode, but it's reality here.A little bit about Ismael Zambada, who's known by authorities as El Mayo, he oversaw, according to federal prosecutors, the manufacturing and distribution of narcotics going all the way back to 1989 and up until this year, according to federal prosecutors. El Mayo in his mid-70s, this is an old school kind of cartel boss, right? He kept a low profile, unlike his partner, probably one of the reasons why, up until now, he hadn't actually set foot in a cell. In fact, it's very difficult, even finding recent photographs of this individual. But some of those pictures that you saw a short while ago, those were actually taken not far from El Paso, about 20 miles away from El Paso, according to what I've heard, as well as some of my other colleagues heard from some of those investigators, so those sources close to the investigation. He stepped aboard this airplane yesterday under false pretenses that he would be flying to see a property potentially to buy it, and he had no idea that this plane would eventually land near El Paso, where U.S. authorities were waiting. As you can see in that footage, you see some of those federal investigators on the ground. They even actually attach a chain to the propeller of the plane that is believed to have been the one that actually flew El Mayo, as well as Joaquin Guzman Lopez, one of Chapo's sons, who's accused of also running the Sinaloa Crime Syndicate. While his whereabouts, El Mayo's whereabouts are still unclear, I can tell you, Sara, that a U.S. DOJ Aircraft that's frequently used for extraditions of fugitives and of suspects traveled from El Paso to the Chicago area this morning. And that is important because El Mayo actually has an outstanding indictment, one of several there in that district. One of the big questions, will this actually reshaped the cartel landscape? Is the Sinaloa Cartel no more? I can tell you, absolutely not. If anything, what I've seen in the past, this only leads to infighting, friction and a power struggle to fill a void. And what a void this is, especially for this sort of elder cartel boss that is now in U.S. custody And then the final and perhaps the most key question here, who actually betrayed him. There is some reporting out there and several leads that were following that suggested possibly was from within the Sinaloa Cartel Syndicate, but not yet ready to actually go there. Finally, I do want you to hear directly from the U.S. attorney general that was ultimately the one who fired I'm going to finally confirm this hours after we started hearing about this yesterday afternoon about the significance of this arrest.
