The National Association for Gun Rights is one of the groups suing. It's arguing that the order violates the Second Amendment.

These gun groups are saying, you know, you need to have a historical precedent for this type of law, and that's missing. And there's no way -- I mean, they're arguing that it's not constitutional.
