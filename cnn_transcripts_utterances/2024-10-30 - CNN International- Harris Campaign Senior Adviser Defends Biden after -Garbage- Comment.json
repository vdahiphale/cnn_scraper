Six days now until Election Day here in the U.S., both campaigns really in an all-out sprint at this point to win votes in those critical swing states.

The ellipse outside the White House where Donald Trump stood on January 6, 2021. Just before a number of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent insurrection. Harris hoping to capitalize on that contrast in her pitch to voters.

Just imagine the outrage there would be over these comments by Joe Biden, but we've really become numb to it. The problem, though, for Democrats and for Kamala Harris is, to your point, is that these comments were made at a time when her campaign seemed to be moving ahead smoothly. The speech last night went very well. She was able to lay out her vision, and she was to do it in a way that was more encompassing. Let's say, then what we hear, what Donald Trump has to say. But then, you know, it's very hard to make the argument to go out there and say that Donald Trump is vulgar and rude when you have the President of the United States going out and saying something similar. So, I do think it is going to have a little bit of an effect, in the sense that it's going to consume some time, some valuable time, over the next couple days, you know, for the discussion about, you know, who is cruder.

Today, she is really trying to bring that to the ground, to these specific groups of voters, and to try and bring them into her camp. And it was so remarkable last night, just the imagery of that speech. You know, she was standing right in front of the South Portico, exactly where Donald Trump was speaking on January 6, almost four years ago. And I don't think any Americans who are watching that would have necessarily that it would have been lost in them, that that was the message that they were trying to send. Those clips have been so ingrained in people's minds for the last four years, but at the same time, she was really also trying to present this vision of what she would do in office. You know, she ticked out a series of policy items from Medicare, from immigration, from trying to restore the protections in Roe Versus Wade. All with the point of making the contrast with Donald Trump. And that is essentially her closing argument, and it is what we'll see her doing in all three battleground states today, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, is to try and deliver this message specifically to voters. And to try and make this contrast with what she says would be Donald Trump in the Oval Office ticking off his enemies list, compared to what she says she'll do, which is to tick off her to do list. And I think in a lot of ways, this was an introductory speech for the vice president, which is, you know, in and of itself, pretty remarkable in the final week of a campaign. It gives you an idea of just how abbreviated her own 101-day campaign has been up until now. In the eyes of her advisors, there are still a lot of what they call conflicted voters out there who they think that they convince, can convince these are people who might be turned off by what they've been hearing from Donald Trump on the campaign trail, but aren't necessarily sold yet on Kamala Harris. And really what she was trying to do, and what she'll be trying to do over the next week, is to show voters a little bit more of herself, to try and demonstrate not only what she would do in office, but what kind of presidents she would be. So, you heard her last night talking about some of her motivations for leadership, what inspires her as a leader. And I think that in the eyes of the Harris campaign is the message that they need to drive as they work to talk to every single undecided voter in those seven battleground states in the week before Election Day.",

That's why a lot of Democrats breathed a sigh of relief when he stepped out of the races, because they did have to explain away a lot of what he was saying so much of the time. Now we should clarify, President Biden has clarified what he said. He said he wasn't talking about all of Trump's supporters when he referred to them as garbage, he was talking about the specific supporter who spoke at Madison Square Garden. But at the end of the day, President Biden's campaign appearances have been limited. In part, that's political because Harris wants to distance herself from an unpopular incumbent, but it's also because Harris campaign knows that he can be a liability. He's known for these kinds of misspeaks and these kinds of gaffes.

And that was in response to that inarticulate mention about Trump supporters being garbage by the current president. I should point out Trump obviously has been incredibly divisive about Vice President Harris supporters. He has said that her supporters are, quote, the enemy from within. He has said her Jewish supporters should have their head exam, and so just putting -- doing some level setting there. The agenda today, though, in North Carolina and in Wisconsin is really a different approach to both states. In North Carolina, this is a state that Donald Trump narrowly won by in 2020 in a state that he is hoping to fend off a very aggressive push by Democrats to flip this state, this time around. In Wisconsin, he is the person trying to flip the state, and you are seeing him spend aggressively in that state, spend a lot of time there, trying to turn it from a blue state to a red state, and really penetrate that blue wall that the Democrats are relying on. What's interesting though, here is that we are seeing the approach shift from going from trying to attract new voters to really trying to get out his base. And you are seeing them really put an emphasis and focus on trying to convince -- over yet there has been a lot of chatter on social media and from Trump's supporters online, suggesting that he is running away with this thing. And we have seen them push out a lot of suspect polling that he is ahead. And in the last couple of days, we are seeing some of his top surrogates, people like his running mate, J.D. Vance, as well as Charlie Kirk, someone who's been very influential in a circle. They have been telling their people, we need to stop being so cocky. We need to realize this is going to be a very, very closely contested race, and we need to make sure we are we are fighting for every vote all the way through November 5.

And so that's what's causing this particular outrage, and it's put the Israeli authorities, the military, on something of a back foot as well, because they say that they have started an investigation to try and work out what exactly happened. Military officials have said that they didn't intend to demolish the building or to collapse the building that was struck on Tuesday. A source in the Israeli military has told me that what was targeted was an individual, suspected Hamas militant, a spotter who was seen on the top of the roof of the building, he was fired upon, and then the building collapsed. And what there was some surprise about amongst the Israeli military is that so many people were killed inside a building that they did not know was occupied, they say. And which -- in an area which they say had been evacuated, or at least there had been evacuation orders in force in that area of Northern Gaza, Beit Lahia for the past several weeks. And so, the investigation the Israeli military are running right now is to try and get to the bottom of why there were so many people inside that building. And one of the theories being explored by those investigators in the Israeli military right now, according to our sources inside the Israeli military, is that this was a gathering of Hamas members inside the building. That's why so many people were killed, they say the Israeli military. And that's why the Israeli military says that some of the people who have been named as dead by the Palestinian health authorities in this attack have been identified positively by the Israelis as being members of Hamas or other jihadi terrorist groups. That's the words, of course, as the Israeli military. But none of this takes away from the fact that there is immense human suffering unfolding, excuse me, on a daily basis in Northern Gaza, with hundreds of people now being victims of an incessant barrage of Israeli attacks against what they say are resurgent Hamas activities in the area.

We know that the White House Officials, Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk from Washington, will be coming here to Israel on Thursday, they will be talking about Iran and Gaza and the hostage releases. Bill Burns, who is the Head of the CIA, is heading to Egypt where we'll be speaking with his Egyptian counterparts about the possibility, among other things, of a hostage deal there.
