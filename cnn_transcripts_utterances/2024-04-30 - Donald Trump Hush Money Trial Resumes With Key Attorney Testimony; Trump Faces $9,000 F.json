I'm Erin Burnett, outside the courthouse in Manhattan, along with Wolf Blitzer in our nation's capital. In just moments, the former president will be back in the courtroom, and the prosecution will resume questioning a key attorney at the center of this case, Keith Davidson. Keith Davidson began his testimony this morning; he represented both Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels, two women who say they were paid to stay silent about alleged affairs with Donald Trump,, Wolf.",

Erin, before Davidson took the stand this morning, jurors heard from the banker who says he unwittingly structured the Stormy Daniels hush money payment. Also today, as the New York Times reports, Trump is frustrated with his own lead defense attorney. Trump was hit with a $9,000 fine for nine social media posts that violated the judge's gag order. He has just taken down those posts as ordered. Let's start right now with some of the major takeaways from the testimony, very dramatic testimony so far today. Our senior legal analyst, Elie Honig, is over at the magic wall. Elie, walk us through what we learned from the testimony so far today.",

      "sentences": "So, Wolf, busy morning. The prosecution has put on four witnesses already, even before the lunch break. Now the day started out with Gary Farrow on the stand. He's a banker from First Republic Bank and let me show you why his testimony was really important to this case. The way the payoff to Stormy Daniels worked is first, Michael Cohen directly paid Stormy Daniels, through her attorney, $130,000. And then later, Donald Trump, through his businesses, repaid Michael Cohen through a series of checks. And this is the crux of the crime that happened here. The allegation is they structured this to make it look like legal fees rather than a hush money payoff. This witness, Gary Farrow, testified in detail about this money, the way Michael Cohen got that money by taking out -- drawing down on his mortgage, and the way Michael Cohen came to him with a sense of urgency, needed to get this money, and we know the reason why was to make this payoff to Stormy Daniels.Then we heard from two witnesses, one from C-SPAN and one from a court reporting company. The reason prosecutors called these witnesses is simply as vehicles to get videos and depositions in front of the jury. And then they started to show some of those videos to the jury. For example, one clip from October 2016, when Donald Trump on C-SPAN said, quote, I have no idea who these women are. No idea who these women are. We know that ended up being false, and so prosecutors are going to argue, gee, why would he be untruthful about whether he knew who these women are? So those were the second and third witnesses. And finally, we left off at the lunch break with the fourth witness of the day on the stand, and this is Keith Davidson. Now, he's an attorney who represented both Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. And the reason he's really important is here is because in negotiating the deals, the cash money deals with McDougal and Stormy Daniels, Michael Cohen dealt with Keith Davidson. He was not dealing on the mechanics and the logistics of it with McDougal and Stormy Daniels. So right now, we're in the middle of Keith Davidson testifying about the negotiations that were happening between him on behalf of these clients and Donald Trump's camp and with other outlets. Now, who's next? I suspect Keith Davidson is going to take the rest of the day or close to the rest of the day with his testimony and cross-exam. We don't know. Prosecutors have been playing it really close to the vest. It feels like they are setting the stage for Stormy Daniels to take the stand at some point soon. Of course, later in the trial, we're looking for Karen McDougal. Prosecutors may call. Hope Hicks could take the stand. And, of course, the most important witness, Wolf, will be Michael Cohen. Lots to watch this afternoon.",

They're the folks you see in court, but there's a lot of folks behind the scenes who have a say. There's people who are just calling him from random universities, giving him advice. And then the client himself is a very challenging, difficult client. So, there's always tension behind the scenes. It doesn't matter if it's a state-level investigation or Supreme Court cases where the stakes are incredibly high. There's always tension behind the scenes.
