They said that -- the court found, \"Apparently the FBI engaged in a massive effort to suppress disfavored conservative speech and blatantly ignored the First Amendment's right to free speech. The evidence shows the FBI threatened adverse consequences to social media companies that they did not comply with its censorship request.\"The court found that, \"This seemingly unrelenting pressure by the FBI and the other defendants had the intended result of suppressing millions of protected free speech postings by American citizens.\" As a results, the court states, for example, millions of citizens did not hear about the Hunter Biden laptop story prior to the November 3, 2020 election. Page four of the court ruling lists some of the important subjects that the Biden administration and the FBI forced the social media platforms to suppress. The evidence shows you, your agency, the people that directly report to you, suppressed conservatively free speech about topics like laptop, the lab leak theory of COVID-19's origin, the effectiveness of masking, COVID lockdowns and vaccines. Speech about election integrity in the 2020 presidential election. Security of voting by mail, even parody about the president himself, negative post about the economy. The FBI made the social media platforms pull that information off the internet if it came from conservative sources. They did this under the guise that it was disinformation. Can you define what disinformation is?",
