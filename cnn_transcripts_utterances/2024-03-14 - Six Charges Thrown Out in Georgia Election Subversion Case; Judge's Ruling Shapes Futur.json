DAN KILDEE, U.S. HOUSE DEMOCRAT: At the end of the day, for me, it really came down to whether or not we can take some action to try to deter this malign influence of the PRC. FOX (voice-over): But the bill wasn't without its detractors. 65 members voted against it, including 50 Democrats. DAN BISHOP (R- NC): The answer is not to go selectively banning the flow of information from a particular nation. The way we defeat China is being more American, not less. FOX (voice-over): Those backing the bill argue they did so for national security. MADELEINE DEAN (D -PA): I know we're getting plenty of phone calls that young people really love TikTok and I lift that up. I think that's terrific. But I want to protect them from a foreign adversary collecting their data and manipulating it. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): TikTok is owned by ByteDance. ByteDance is in China. In China, any company has to subscribe to the national intelligence law of 2017 which says you have to be our spy if we tell you to. FOX (voice-over): Already, President Joe Biden has said he would sign the bill if it passes, even though Biden's campaign is on TikTok. Opponents argue that could be a political mistake. Do you worry at all about the political implications for Biden for democrats in the election over supporting this legislation? Ro Khanna (D -CA): I don't know why you want to upset young people, 170 million people on a platform when there's a least restrictive ways, less restrictive ways of achieving the goal. FOX (voice-over): Donald trump once called for an outright ban on TikTok.

FOX (voice-over): Senators Marco Rubio and Mark Warner, top members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, committed Wednesday to, quote, working together to get this bill passed through the Senate and signed into law. But Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not committed to putting the bill on the floor. [00:14:59] FOX: And following that House vote, TikTok released a statement saying that they were encouraging senators to consider the facts, listen to their constituents, and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service. There's also no guarantee that the House bill will come to the Senate floor. That's because Maria Cantwell, a leading Democrat on the Commerce Committee, says she is looking at a different approach to try and rein in TikTok. That could take weeks, even months, to put together. And again, Chuck Schumer, the Majority Leader, has not said whether or not he's going to put that House bill on the floor.

Are we safer?Well, John, I think that U.S. lawmakers would say that we will be safer because the concern with TikTok really is its connection to Chinese parents. And that's not just for our current company ByteDance. Lawmakers are worried that the data that U.S. users give to TikTok could potentially, -- the Chinese government could force the company to hand that over things like location data, IP addresses, and that could be used for propaganda, for misinformation, or for intelligence operations. But I think your general question there is a good one. And I think it's one that many TikTok users are asking here, and I think many users realize that they are handing over their data to many different kinds of companies that's getting sold to all kinds of people, and governments have access to that data. And so, I think many of these users are saying, why are we not focused on broader privacy legislation that would impact all of the big tech companies and not just target this one?",

I imagine many of those people you heard on Capitol Hill today are people who are making money from TikTok. And, you know, it's not quite the same opportunity on a platform like X or other social media platforms to really earn a living. TikTok says there are 7 million people who are operating small businesses that run on TikTok.And it's not so easy to just move your loyal audience and the business that you're running on one platform, move that to another platform if TikTok were to get banned. So, I think that's sort of the first issue here. TikTok also really sort of perfected this really alluring sort of addictive almost algorithm, this algorithm that keeps people scrolling and that also puts users' content in front of other users who don't follow them. It becomes very easy to reach all kinds of different people, not necessarily just the folks who decide to follow you.
