Now we're at one of the locations, I'm going to step out of the way, where debris fell from the 16 missiles fired in the direction of Kyiv according to the mayor of Kyiv. All of those missiles were intercepted, but what happened was that debris fell to the ground.At this particular location where you see they're already trying to clear up, a 14-year-old girl was caught stuck under the rubble as a result of the falling debris. We spoke to her grandmother who wasn't on location, but the girl was still in the rubble, called her grandmother on her cellphone hysterical, desperate for help. Nearby inside of the house her mother was also injured, and she is currently in surgery, we understand, in a difficult state. A man nearby was also injured. Also not far from here in another location, another house was hit by falling debris. Inside that house there were two men, an elderly father and his adult son. Miraculously, they escaped just with scratches. But as a result of falling debris, their car exploded, all of the windows in the house in the area were shattered, walls had crumbled to the ground. Now, 40 percent, as you mentioned, the electricity here in Kyiv has been knocked out as a result, and in Lviv in the western part of the country, 90 percent of the electricity is out as a result of the strikes. In Kharkiv in the east, Ukraine's second largest city, four Russian missiles did manage to hit their targets, described as critical energy infrastructure. And this seems to be the pattern of this current wave of Russian attacks that they're focusing yesterday again on the infrastructure. After having failed on the battlefield to defeat the Ukrainian and losing more ground as time goes by, it appears they're shifting this their firepower just to destroy this country's ability to function.

That is less though than what we have seen in terms of crossings. As the city struggles with a huge influx of asylum seekers. The Trump-era Title 42 restriction allowing us to quickly expel migrants. It remains in place for now.Our Rosa Flores joins us live again this morning from El Paso. Good morning, Rosa. You have been witnessing this firsthand speaking to those migrants day and night. As I understand it, that even that number, 1000 migrants a day that it can hold, it's fewer than the influx that El Paso is dealing with. ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): You know, you're absolutely right. And we've seen the federal government do this before during prior surges. For example, in 2014-2019 when there are migrant surge is at that point in time, the epicenter of that surge was in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas. After that, the federal government beefed up the infrastructure there. There's a tent facility very similar to the one that we're seeing here in El Paso built there. Now, we're seeing this again. And during this surge, the entry and the flow of migrants is in essence moved to areas like Del Rio and here like El Paso. And so, this is -- this is what the federal government usually does. They react to where the big flow of migrants are and they build up tech facilities. These are processing facilities that are air-conditioned inside when it's hot, or they have a heating system. But they look like giant tents. And you're absolutely right, Poppy. This one, in particular, have a capacity of about 1000. It's expected to be operational next month. Now will that be enough? We'll see. What the federal government is also doing is what they call decompression flights and buses. And what that means is that whenever there is a large group of migrants that are in one area, for example, here in El Paso, they will fly them or bus them to other areas along the border that have capacity so that they can be processed in those areas.",
