I think the idea that Jim Jordan and others who are ideologically aligned with him did not know how this would pan out defies common sense. And it's not clear to me who the alternative will be. I think Scalise is probably the best bet, because I think so much of this is personal. But the irony is that Kevin McCarthy has done everything that these people have asked of him over the past two years, to the point of really diminishing himself in the eyes of not only his colleagues on both sides of the aisle, especially moderates on the Republican side and Democrats, of course. But also I think, in the eyes of the public, and he's still not going to get the speakership.",

So even though a lot of Republicans were bracing for this to go to multiple ballots, they are still in disbelief and they are just furious that all this drama is overshadowing their new majority.

Right now, Jim Jordan is sitting in that wing. The challenge has always been that those people actually do want to see things happen. They want to bring deliverables home to their district, that's what their voters are demanding. If you're a Republican in a Biden district, that's what they're saying, that's what they need to get reelected.Those people ultimately are going to have more of an incentive to end this. I mean, I almost swore right there - to end this show, you fill in the blank, that's happening right now on the House floor, because they have political incentives that line up with ending it and finding a speaker of the House. These 19 people and this has been the problem with dealing with the Freedom Caucus, from John Boehner to Paul Ryan right on down to where we are today, is that they do not seem to care about that piece of it. They don't care about governing. Their self interest - you've heard the word narcissist being used by many of their opponents in the Republican Party today. They care about, as John has said, appearing on right wing radio, what is their profile, the leverage and the ways that leadership used to have to get control of people like these 19 are basically gone. And that means that for them, sitting here and doing this 50 times, who cares? There's - they don't have any skin in that game, necessarily. Whereas all these people who are sitting with Kevin McCarthy, they actually do and they may get to a point where they have to say, look, we got to make a change here.",

So in this third ballot, when that goes down with the things we are going to be looking for is, A, do any people who - of those 19 who voted against McCarthy, do any of them change their vote, do they start to peel off and start falling in line behind McCarthy or does anyone else vote against McCarthy who previously haven't. So we're looking for those vote tallies. We're also looking to see who those 19 people are going to vote for in the second ballot.
