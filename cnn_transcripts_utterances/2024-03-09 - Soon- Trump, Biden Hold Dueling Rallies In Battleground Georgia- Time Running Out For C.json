And tonight President Joe Biden and Donald Trump are set to hold dueling rallies in the crucial battleground state of Georgia. Any moment now, Trump is expected to take the stage in the city of Rome -- that's in northwest Georgia. That's his first campaign event since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee following the dropping out of Nikki Haley. And soon after, we expect to hear from President Joe Biden. He's in Atlanta picking off a monthlong push to deliver his message to swing state voters. The Biden campaign hoping to capitalize on the momentum after Biden's fiery and political State of the Union address on Thursday night. Now fewer states will be watched more closely than Georgia this coming November, a state that Joe Biden won by fewer than 12,000 votes just four years ago and which helped deliver him to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I want to bring in CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten. Harry, so how did people react to the president's State of the Union address two nights ago. And do you think this is going to be giving the president a boost in the campaign?",

If you're the type of person who's a glass half full type of individual you'll say, look at this question. Biden's policies put us on the right direction. This is among speech-watchers.Pre-speech, it was just 45 percent; post-speech 62 percent. That's a 17-point jump. Hey, that's not too bad, right, Alex? But look through history, look at the last few addresses that Biden has given -- 2023, 2022. What you see is very similar bumps in sort of the way that speech viewers think that Biden's policies will put us in the right direction. A 19-point jump last year, 15-point jump in 2022. So the 17-point jump is pretty much right in line with that. And of course, after those speeches, we didn't really see much of a boost in Biden's approval rating overall, including all Americans, not just those who watched the speech. So yes, there was a boost that is good news. I think that's part of the reason why Biden wants to take this message out on the road. But if you look at it through the lens of the last few years, it's more of a glass half empty type of approach where we've seen those (INAUDIBLE) before and it really didn't result in higher approval ratings for Biden among the wider electorate.",

How close Georgia was last time around. It was decided by 0.2 percentage points. That's a very close win for Joe Biden in 2020. You look at the polling right now and it's a completely different universe. Donald Trump leading by six points. So in a very, very different place where we were. And this sort of mirrors what we see nationally, where Joe Biden's in a considerably worse position than he was back in 2020.

What is going on with black voters right now in Georgia? Look, Joe Biden is still winning with them. He's winning among them by 53 percentage points. But that is a drop of 24 points from where we were in 2020. This type of margin, to be perfectly honest with you Alex, I've looked through polls throughout the years. This is the smallest margin for a Democratic candidate in the state of Georgia that I can frankly find on the presidential level. This is a very worrying sign for Joe Biden heading into the fall.",

Appreciate it. We appreciate it. Let's discuss now with my panel: \"New York Times\" journalist and podcast host Lulu Garcia-Navarro and Tia Mitchell, Washington correspondent for \"The Atlanta Journal Constitution\". Thank you both so much for joining us this evening. Tia, to you as a Georgia expert, is Georgia still a purple state or do you think it has started leaning more towards one party since the last presidential election in 2020? TIA MITCHELL, \"THE ATLANTA JOURNAL CONSTITUTION\": I think Georgia is still a purple state. It's still a battleground state. But Georgia is definitely a mixed bag and I think the successes that Democrats saw in Georgia in 2020 with Biden carrying the state then Ossoff and Warnock winning both the Senate seats, it showed that there it is possible Democrats can win statewide in Georgia. And then we can't forget in 2022 where every, every Republican, except for the Republican running against Warnock won statewide on the ballot so it's still a state where Republicans run the government in the state level. So it's going to be difficult for Democrats to win statewide. But what makes Georgia a battleground state is that it's possible for Democrats to win.",

She's the 22-year-old nursing student who was killed last month and an undocumented migrant has been arrested in that case.What does that tell you about the role that immigration and you know, securing the border are going to play in this campaign over the next eight months. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": It's been really interesting to see what a shift we've seen in the polls in terms of immigration. It's now the number one issue by voters. And it really is because the border is seen as a problem. And it is a problem. I mean, you know, we've seen Republicans talk about this and call over and over again the situation there a crisis. But this time it really is. Under President Biden, it has been exponentially -- we've seen just exponential numbers of increase of migrants coming here. And so there is a sense that there is a problem right now, and that is worrying Democrats, that is worrying Republicans. But the fact of the matter is that what Biden is facing in Georgia isn't really to do with immigration. It's to do with the black vote. It's also to do with the uncommitted vote. I mean, we're about to have the primary in Georgia and we have the same thing that we've seen elsewhere where a coalition of different types of voters, young voters, voters of color, are saying actually we want to vote uncommitted to send a message that we do not like the war in Gaza.

There's not going to be a lot to shift them.But at the end of the day, there are always persuadable voters that's how a state like Georgia becomes a swing state is those voters in the middle who could go either way. And I think what the Democrats are trying to do is blunt a little bit of that message. They know that Republicans right now are going all in on immigration. We've already talked about the Laken Riley killing, which has been a big rallying cry, not just in Georgia, but across the nation. Democrats want to say, look, we care about this issue too, we've actually tried to solve it. It's Trump, and of course, Marjorie Taylor Greene being a very effective boogeymen as well they lumped her in. It's Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who yes, both of them did oppose that bipartisan border legislation -- border security legislation in the Senate. Democrats want to make sure that again persuadable voters know that.

And this comes as American officials had been hoping to broker a ceasefire deal that would include the return of hostages held by Hamas before Ramadan begins on Sunday night. But so far President Joe Biden says that is unlikely.In Gaza, the United Nations is now warning that four out of five households do not have safe drinking water. The White House says the U.S. will join other nations to send humanitarian aid now from Cyprus into Gaza by barge through a maritime corridor. The U.S. is going to be building a floating pier and a causeway along the Mediterranean coast of Gaza. Mark Esper is here with me now. He is the former defense secretary under Donald Trump. So Mark, thanks so much for joining us. The U.S. is now airdropping aid into Gaza. They've announced that they're going to be building this pier. That could take as long as two months and as many as a thousand U.S. troops could be involved in building that. To what extent do you think this reflects that the United States actually doesn't have all that much sway over Israel since Israels essentially ignoring U.S. calls to open more border crossings.",

Doing logistics over the shore which is being proposed by the president's plan to build a causeway up here then offloading shipping is better than airdrops. But nothing beats ground convoys going in to relieve the suffering. And you're talking about on a daily basis, 500 trucks a day are needed if you will.But it's interesting because when you think about how this is going to happen with building the pier and the causeway, which I have known that the U.S. military will do expertly. The issue then becomes well, then how do you move the food and you start talking about moving from a bigger ship to a smaller ship. And then from a smaller ship to the floating pier and then somehow the pier has to get it -- the items onto trucks and it's unclear who's going to drive the trucks. And then the trucks have to get to the shore and then it had to be distributed. It just seems like a lot of steps and complication as compared to just figuring out a way to accelerate the clearance process at the borders and make sure that there is no contraband going into Gaza. And then open more sites and get the aid in expeditiously en masse, which is what you need. You need volume to really address the problems on the ground in Gaza.",

Eventually it has to be anchored to the shore and somebody's going to have to do that anchoring.And of course, assembling the causeway means American soldiers will be working nonstop to assemble piece by piece by piece to make sure you link it all the way up to the pier. So somebody has to anchor it. Somebody's going. soldiers will be working on that pier at all times. They will be exposed to enemy fire, indirect, direct fire, and they have to be secured. And that's unclear as to who will provide that. There has been talk that the IDF will provide some security, but I'm sure were not going allow American service members to go unprotected. So were going to have to provide some type of local security as well. We've got to protect the pier and the causeway, which means well have to have a warship out there doing the same.
