Here's what she is doing that's very good though, in Michigan, she's going after Donald Trump. She is on the front foot. She's going after him for being exhausted, she's going after him for not showing up. She's traveling around the state. You know, when you're a kid in Michigan, you learn geography very easily. She started out over here in Grand Rapids. She went here to Lansing and now she's here in Detroit, right? She's been moving across the state. And that shows a level of activity out of the campaign and some of us were worried about a couple of weeks ago, the campaign, just wasn't doing enough events every day.

If you know anything about the great state of Michigan, you know, union households are so important in that state. And although Kamala Harris is still leading amongst those where in union households, her margin is smaller than it was four years ago at this particular point or small in Joe Biden's was at this point four years ago. So the bottom line is, Harris is doing better among those with the college degree, while Trump is doing better among those in the working class, and it's going to be interesting to see how those two balance themselves out at the very end.
