We're getting new details on the first witness to be called, a man allegedly in the room when a scheme was hatched to bury bad stories about Donald Trump and the 2016 election. Jewish students being urged to return home for their own safety, classes go virtual as protests roil a university. And the Supreme Court braces for arguments that could effectively end the federal election case against Donald Trump. I'm John Berman with Sara Sidner and Kate Bolduan. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. History is unfolding before our eyes today. Right behind me live pictures of a courthouse in lower Manhattan, and then that is Trump Tower here in New York. Bery shortly, Donald Trump will leave his apartment for opening statements in a trial that could ultimately land him behind bars. We're getting new details this morning about the very first witness expected to be called by the prosecution, a man known to be involved in several catch and kill schemes for Donald Trump, including the alleged hush money payment with porn star Stormy Daniels. CNN's Kristen Holmes is live outside court this morning where history really will be made, Kristen.",

      "sentences": "That's right, John. And we do expect Donald Trump to stop by those cameras in the hallway. Remember, this is effectively the only campaign stop he's had in several days. He was supposed to have a rally in North Carolina over the weekend where he could likely air his grievances, as he likes to do. However, it was canceled due to bad weather. And as we know, he is using these various trial appearances as campaign stops because he effectively has to. He is in court four days a week.So what do we know about what we're going to see today? Of course, you're going to have those opening arguments by both sides talking about what the details are of the case, laying out their version of the case. But we also have learned who that first witness is going to be. That is a man by the name of David Pecker. Now, Pecker has been friends with Donald Trump for decades. He ran the company that owned \"The National Enquirer.\" He is known to have bought and buried damaging stories about Donald Trump, meaning that people would come to him. He would buy the rights of the story and then never publish it because it could hurt Trump. He allegedly helped broker the deal with Stormy Daniels and allegedly had multiple conversations with the former president about that. Again, this would have been before he was president. Now he has been granted immunity in exchange for his testimony. The thing to keep an eye on here is how Donald Trump reacts during this testimony. This is likely when we're going to here are some of those salacious details. Remember at the heart of all of this is an alleged affair with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, something that roiled his marriage when he was the White House when these reports first came out and something that has embarrassed the former president. Now he is going to be forced to sit in that courtroom for hours listening to a line of questioning around this, John.",

And what they need to do and what I'm sure they will do is not make this about a salacious, sexy scandal. This is a very straightforward -- it is a very straightforward case involving falsifying business records. And it's a very straightforward case that the jury should be able to follow, that this involves the former president tried to circumvent the law when it came to the election. That's what this case is about.It's not about Stormy Daniels per se, it's not about Michael Cohen per se, although they will take the wind out of those sales of the defense so that this is not just on Michael Cohen's shoulders. In fact, we know that David Pecker is going to start things off, so it's far more than that. But they're going to simplify things, the prosecution.",

He is part of that formula, that plan of what, to kill any bad story, that catch-and-kill which involved Stormy Daniels, which involve McDougal, which involved potentially as well this doorman. So this is -- if you don't start here, you're kind of coming out fragmented, and he's a strong witness who's also not someone who maybe so adversarial, like Michael Cohen or Stormy Daniels, to the former president. So he's a great place to start by laying that foundation and understanding what's next. How did this evolve? Where did this come from? David Pecker.",

Is it a combination of any of those?And again, that all starts with this theme and why we're doing this, because it makes no sense just to kill a story. And this was the reason behind it. That reason is behind it is to protect Donald Trump in the election in some capacity. That is a theory in part of the prosecution.",

The attorneys aren't his friend, but Donald Trump and David Pecker have a longstanding relationship. But listen, there's an advantage to you to do this. Why are you doing this? Because you have a benefit, and you may be able to fudge things a little bit to point things the other way, as opposed to taking blame and responsibility. David Pecker, his company, had 187,000, I think, or so, fines from the Federal Election Commission. His hands aren't clean, so there's going to be attacks certainly on that level as well.",

SALANDreally knew, and that's how they're bringing in David Pecker. That's why they're bringing in Michael Cohen. Thats why they're bringing other folks. But it's that second component which people have a hard time with, which I understand, is falsifying business records is just a misdemeanor, just as a relative term because no one wants to be convicted of a misdemeanor. But it's how do you get to that next stage and this sort of novel theory of it's a federal election crime that was never charged, a state election crime that was never charged, a tax fraud. So it's convincing that jury, again, to follow the law, to follow what I am saying as the prosecutor. Josh Steinglass, Chris Conway, let's not make this about sexy, scandalous behavior involving an affair and a former porn star. This -- take it out. This is just falsifying business records.",

He is one of the main witnesses in this case. Does that work well for the prosecutors, to say, hey, look, he was convicted of this. He went to jail for this.

But if a drug dealer and kingpin, who knows most about that person? Not someone on the outside, but someone who is immersed in that business, someone who is selling the drugs, is buying the drugs, who is involved.That, as ugly as an analogy as it is, is who? It's Michael Cohen. He's immersed, he's hands-on, he's there. So there's a great advantage to have Michael Cohen on your team. You just have the bubble to clean them off and say, I get it. He's not the best guy, but that's not what you'll hear about. You'll hear, if you believe him, and he's immersed in it, there's your answer.",

One of them, on campus, the Gaza Solidarity Encampment that you'd be able to see just beyond that fence line that you see again, the campus is still restricted access right now because of the events of last week.But the other demonstration also taking place on the sidewalk, literally at the gate of Columbia University. What also has intensified over the weekend are these growing fears among some Jewish students who say they fear, they feel not just uncomfortable, but in some cases, even intimidated. And I have been able to speak to some over the weekend saying that they are growing increasingly frustrated saying that Columbia University simply is not doing enough to make sure that some of the Jewish student population feel safe coming to class. So as a result, one of the rabbis that is with ties to the university calling on some Jewish students to simply go home. Now, the Columbia institution itself releasing a statement saying that they hear those concerns. They are acting on them, that they are taking steps to make sure that they feel that these students are supported, especially ahead of Passover. Now, in terms of the organizers of these pro-Palestinian demonstrations, the two groups that organized them, they are out with a statement as well, effectively trying to distance themselves from non-student protesters calling them, and I quote, \"inflammatory individuals --\"",
