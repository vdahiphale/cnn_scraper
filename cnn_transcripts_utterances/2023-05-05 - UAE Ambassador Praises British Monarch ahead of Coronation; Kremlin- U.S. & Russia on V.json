First, your headlines this hour Russia, rhetoric towards the United States over its war in Ukraine continues to escalate. Its Deputy Prime Minister warning that an armed conflict is becoming more of a reality but qualified his statement by adding Moscow is working on making sure that that conflict with Washington doesn't happen. Meanwhile, on the frontlines, the Head of the Mercenary Wagner Group has threatened to pull his men from Bakhmut after releasing a graphic video displaying dead bodies and asking Moscow from your more ammunition. Serbia is really off for a second mass shooting the fresh off the heels of another at a school in Belgrade earlier this week. This time a 21-year-old killed eight after opening fire with an automatic weapon and fleeing the scene. He has since been arrested following a massive overnight manhunt. And later this hour where will Messi go next? I'll be asking the Saudi Tourism Authority's CEO what plans his country might have to bring the footballing superstar there after already tempting his rival Cristiano Ronaldo more on that interview is coming up. All Right, I come not to be served but to serve surrounded by pomp and pageantry, King Charles III will say those words just hours from now as millions of people across Britain and around the world celebrate his coronation. Saturday's service in Westminster Abbey will be deeply religious and behind the sacred music and holy oil you'll find centuries of ancient tradition. Let's kick off this part of the show with CNN's Royal Correspondent Max Foster, who gives us a sense of what we can expect. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  For more than thousand years, the coronation ceremony for English monarchs has remained largely unchanged. King Charles will walk into Westminster Abbey in the footsteps of his ancestors, ancient symbols like the stone of scone. See some Scotland by King Edward in the 13th century, and using coronations ever since brought to London for Saturday's event. The palace says he also wants to reflect modern Britain and look to the future. The challenge will be how to do both during a cost of living crisis. Charles will be crowned with the St. Edward's Crown the very same one placed upon previous monarchs. Crown Jewels will feature including scepters, a golden orb and various sorts each with their own symbolism. He'll wear robes that have been passed down through the generations, the anointing; the most sacred spiritual part of the service will be hidden from view by a special screen. One of the only newly made pieces for the coronation, because Charles who's always been known for his environmental campaigning has been keen to emphasize reuse. He'll be welcomed to the Abbey first by a young chorister, to whom he'll say, I come not to be served, but to serve. Inclusivity is at the top of his agenda. The ceremony will be conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the most senior member of the Church of England after the King.",

And that's something we have seen from King Charles already actually following the death of his mother, you'll remember that he visited people lying -- in the queue for the lying in state ceremony and he was surprising people there and shaking people's hands. So a real personal touch a thing which people appreciate. It's a part of trying to include people we saw the prince and Prince of Wales yesterday at the pub in Soho. They traveled there on the tube, I think including the public as much as possible in this event over this long weekend is important to the Royal Family, not least because the ceremony as you saw there from Max's package is one that is very solemn, and it's quite exclusive. And of course, by its nature, it's elitist. It's the anointing and crowning of a King. So all the bits around it are very focused on making sure the public feel engaged, Becky.",

It's much more than about investment. At the heart of it lies people connectivity, at the heart of it lies the royal connections, you know, and that's what has really fostered this relationship and driven this relationship. But of course, as a representative of the United Arab Emirates federal government, we will stand there to be fostering and deepening our bilateral ties along trade and investment ties, but also in the innovation space, you know, in creativity in space.

And it is just one of a number of wonders in the Arab country, which has in recent years opened its doors to more and more tourists. They are visiting places like Al Ula, an ancient stone city, often compared to Petra in neighboring Jordan. Then there's the Red Sea coastline, the religious sites of Medina and Mecca and the metropolis of Riyadh, all now attracting millions of visitors every year. One of those visitors last weekend was football star Lionel Messi who went to the kingdom with his family. But that trip wasn't without controversy, and it is fueling rumors that he may be looking to play there for a Saudi clobber. Source says Messi didn't have permission to travel from his current team Paris Saint-Germain, and that is why he has been suspended. Reuters cites of source saying Saudi team Al Hilal has already made him an offer. Well, Messi, of course, is a Tourism Ambassador for Saudi Arabia. He's got a commercial deal to promote the country.

They're conscious that every bit of the carbon footprint reduction counts. But also you can have a sustainable energy agenda, and still save money and control your overheads in the future.
