You have a choice between two people. You have somebody like Joe Biden who wakes up every day. He's fighting hard for American citizens. He's working hard to lower prices. He's building 56,000 projects across the country. And in the meantime, you have another stark choice, one of the most dramatic stark choices in the history of our country. Somebody who is in fact a convicted felon of 34 felonies. Also, most of the people around him when he ran for office before have been convicted, are in jail. Seventeen of his cabinet members have now said they won't vote for him, including his vice president. He's been bankrupt six times. He's been determined to have been liable for sexual assault, for defamation, and for business fraud. Now, that just is like the choice. And that's the choice that American voters are going to face in a couple of months, and you're going to see the clear difference between the two in the debate that you guys are going to host in just a couple of weeks.",

We heard from President Biden when he was talking to Erin Burnett that he doesn't really believe the political polls. He was talking specifically about the economy. Let's listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The polling data has been wrong all along. When I started this administration people were saying there's going to be a collapsing economy. We have the strongest economy in the world. Let me say it again -- in the world. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Secondly, there's no universe in which Donald Trump is going to get 21 percent of the black vote. That's never going to happen. And so it's not that were not worried about that, but we're fighting very, very hard for every vote.And the records of each of these men is clear in this regard. Polling is always important, but it is true, and I think you guys have to recognize that it has been vastly wrong for a lot of time, especially in the recent past. So it's not that you don't care about it. The second thing is this -- President Biden has its, in fact, created 15 million jobs since he has been an office. Donald Trump lost 2.5 million jobs, the greatest loss of jobs in the history of the country for any president except Herbert hoover. And so we are going to continue to tell that truth because it is the strongest economy in the world. However, prices are still too high. And that is why the president is really working hard to fight corporations, to really make sure that we bring down costs for prescription drugs, and to do the work that is necessary to give every American a little bit of breathing room. That is a message that we have to take to the American people. And we're not going to stop talking about how well America is doing in this particular time. I don't know why Donald Trump keeps tearing down America. Everything he says about this country would make you believe that we're gone through a hellhole. All you need to do is travel around this country and see the unbelievable things that are going on. That's not to say that we don't have problems and we have challenges. That's why the person who sits in the Oval Office is important. And that's why wisdom, character, and judgment are necessary, because if you're the kind of guy that make decisions in the dark that only help you and hurt everybody else, that's not the kind of guy you want and sitting behind the Resolute Desk.",

They see the incredible work that was done to restore I95 or to clear the channel in Baltimore or to get the highway backup and operating in Pittsburgh and the competence of elected officials as a result of the work the Joe Biden did with governors. They see part of the 56,000 projects that are helping them have clean water, clean air, high-speed Internet, and building all of this infrastructure. And 15.5 million jobs will continue to resonate.But we've been through a very, very tough time. Remember, when Joe Biden took over, the economy was in a freefall. Donald Trump was asking people to drink Clorox. Thousands of people were dying. This president rescued this country and actually started the recovery, and we're well into it right now. But that is no reason to actually hide when you created more jobs than most presidents have done in that term, or not to talk about how strong America is, or how well were doing vis-a-vis all of our international partners. Joe Biden led that effort primarily because he gets up every day thinking about people. Donald Trump, as you know, you know this, I don't have to sell this to you. That guy gets up, he thinks about himself. He looks in the mirror and he decides who he needs to go punch in the face because he's mad at them about something. Somebody resigned every day when he was in his administration. You have 17 cabinet members that left Donald Trump's administration that said please don't vote for him again, including his vice president. That's never happened before. And as we continue to tell that story in America, the American people are really wise. They know that the choice they're about to make is going to have consequences that are going to reach far in to the future. And we haven't yet started talking about the pain that the Supreme Court has put on people and how it's going to get that much worse when Donald Trump gets another choice for that court or maybe even two.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's right, John. Donald Trump will be meeting today with House Speaker Mike Johnson as well as the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, Richard Hudson. And look, I think this meeting is very important for both sides. What the two House leaders want is for Donald Trump to help get their members and their candidates elected as fall. And Donald Trump has some agendas of his own, which I will walk through.But first I just want to talk about the House races. So we know that Donald Trump in the past has been a kingmaker in many of these key battleground races, and for many House members. However, in 2022, many of Donald Trump's candidates, who he endorsed, went on to ultimately lose in the midterm elections. And so this is something that I know has weighed very heavily both on Donald Trump's mind personally, but also that of his team. They have been endorsing far fewer people this cycle. They say publicly it's because Donald Trump is focused on his election, but in my conversations with the Trump campaign, a lot of it comes down to them not wanting to support candidates that could ultimately lose. So that is part of what they will be discussing today. The other part of this is Donald Trump wants to stack the House with people who are going to be very loyal to him and who will help him fight the Democrats. Now, we have some reporting that in the aftermath of his conviction in New York on 34 counts of falsifying business records, Donald Trump called up Mike Johnson to vent to him about this and wanting Republicans to do more on his behalf to fight Democrats against what he thinks is weaponization of the government. And this is going to be a key part of this conversation today, because if Donald Trump can get enough people in office who will help him, if they can secure a large enough majority in the House this fall, and if Donald Trump were to win, they can do two things. One, they can help him with his 2025 agenda. They can also help him wage war on the Democrats, which Donald Trump is very much obsessed with doing at this time. And so a lot of topics I think that will get discussed today at Mar-a-Lago. John?",

There are about 500,000 of them in circulation, but it is indicative of an attitude toward the Second Amendment that seems to be prevailing in the Supreme Court, which is gun rights over public safety and we saw that in 2022 with the Bruen decision where they actually changed the calculus for deciding Second Amendment cases. Even though it didn't apply in the bump-stock case, it was more about federal authority, federal agency's authority, what we see is if it wasn't a gun law, if there wasn't a historical analogue, if it wasn't a gun law 150 years ago, it is not part of our history and tradition of gun regulations, so we have to toss the regulation. We are seeing a lot of regulations and we have a case coming up possibly this week where domestic violence, if you're a domestic offender, if you have a restraining order, the justices are deciding whether you might be able to have a gun and this is how guns get in the wrong hands.",
