You can see the images here of the aftermath. It's a passenger train. It was carrying about 350 people at least. It collided head on with a freight train. Multiple cars derailed and several caught fire just north of Athens where this happened. It left carriages and heaps of debris in its wake. According to state broadcasters there, both trains were traveling on the same track for several miles before the collision actually happened. First responders have been racing to find survivors in the twisted, melted wreckage that you see here.Eleni Giokos is covering this tragedy for us.

Thirty-six people have lost their lives.DNA testing is now required to try and identify the victims. There are people gathered outside the hospital in Larissa waiting for news of their loved ones. We also understand about 200 people were taken to safety, 72 people injured, seven of whom are in critical condition. Now, the question becomes, why would two trains traveling on the same track when there are two tracks available? And that now has become the big issue. How did this happen? Was it human error? Was it a technical fault? The prime minister going on the ground saying that he will spare no effort in figuring out what happened and what went on. But then, importantly, on the flipside of this, many experts are appearing on state TV saying that they are concerned about the overall process, the modernization of the railway systems, 350 people, Kaitlan, were on that passenger train.

She was the first openly gay mayor here in Chicago, and now is set to be the first full-term incumbent mayor in 40 years to lose reelection here in Chicago.This comes on the other side of what she described as a once-in-a- lifetime set of challenges from the peak of the pandemic, spikes in gun violence not just here but in places across the country as well, civil unrest, and more.",

The pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, cutting the price of insulin, so that none of their customers will have to pay more than $35.00 a month for the drug. No more than $35.00 a month for the drug. Let's talk about why this is such a big deal OK. According to the CDC, in the U.S. alone, more than 37 million people now have diabetes, and another 96 million Americans are pre-diabetic, you talk about why that happens. Millions of Americans rely on insulin to survive and that costs money.So, here in the U.S., the average price for a vial of the drug costs about $100. That's magnitudes more expensive than other countries around the world for a drug that does not cost much to make. And that high price tag has forced more than a million Americans to ration the life-saving medication. So, let's discuss this. Now joining me is the CEO and the chair of Eli Lilly and Company Dave Ricks. Thank you so much, I appreciate you joining us this morning. This is really important news. DAVE RICKS, ELI LILLY &amp; COMPANY CEO &amp; CHAIR: It is, and thank you for having me on.
