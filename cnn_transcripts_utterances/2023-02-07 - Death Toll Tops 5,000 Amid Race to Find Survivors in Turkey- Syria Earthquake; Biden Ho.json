You can see on Turkish television right now just rolling coverage, 24-hour images from the scenes of these search and rescue operations. People standing by pointing at buildings, naming relatives, multiple family members buried under there without them knowing their fate. And that is the priority here, is to get answers to these families.This is absolutely the critical window here, right. This 24 to 48 hour period after the earthquake struck when there is still that glimmer of hope that you might find survivors. And overnight these promised expert crews from around the world started to fly into the affected area. They came with specialist equipment, with sniffer dogs, all of this desperately needed by Turkey. Of course, they simply do not have the resources to spread over this very vast area. So you saw overnight hours, particularly outside of the major administrative cities, that people were simply on the streets made homeless and trying to survive in these freezing cold conditions. Already families complaining that they are receiving no help at all, that they have no food, no shelter, no access to any sort of aid. So this is the day when you're going to start to see those recovery operations, those aid supplies begin to disseminate across this very large area. And again, you mentioned that possibility from some groups saying that number of dead could be multiplied by eight-fold. [04:05:00] We already know there are some 3,000 -- over 3,000 people confirmed dead here in Turkey, some 20,000 wounded. But the fear is of course that there are thousands more trapped under the rubble. Just for context, in 1939 an earthquake of the same magnitude it Turkey, that killed 30,000 people. So, this is absolutely a moment of fear. You really feel the country collectively holding its breath, hoping that more people are found alive under the rubble. And then further south it is even more dire. It's really hard to imagine a population more vulnerable than the Syrian people, particularly in that area. I know you mentioned some 4 million displaced people, people who had been forced out of their homes time and time again by conflict who were already fully dependent on humanitarian aid to survive. And now their situation made even more vulnerable. And in the case of Syria, you're watching the civil conflict play out in the search and rescue operations. You have different authorities on the ground, the government doesn't control all the area, the central government is sanctioned.

So, it's pretty close to freezing to slightly above but we are staying below normal and even colder air expected.We are looking at satellite now showing you the water vapor, the moisture in the atmosphere. The darker purples, the oranges you're seeing that's probably snowfall or rain depending on the temperature, but a lot of that is slowly fading away. So as we clear out the skies especially through the overnight, we lose all the heat, it escapes back into the atmosphere and it gets much colder. And that's what we could expect into tomorrow morning. Scattered showers, no showers, rain showers slowly starting to move out over the next 24 hours. You'll notice that clearing Thursday into Friday and that's again when we'll expect some of the colder air. You will see the blue starting to push further south, that cold air just sinking in. It is frigid in some cases stretching across central Turkey where we can expect temperatures to fall below zero. And that is in the morning. For Aleppo, 4 below on Thursday morning. For the afternoon high, while we make it above zero, it's still but still cold. We're still below what we should be this time of year. That magnitude 7.8 that struck February 6 early in the morning, many aftershocks to follow. We've already been experiencing them. The Arabian plate pushing north against the Anatolian plate along that east Anatolian fault, that's where we can expect most of the aftershocks to occur. So again, that colder air really moving in, not a good situation when we get these aftershocks. A lot of the buildings already crumbled to the ground and what's left, people homeless.

And representatives said that it shouldn't have taken a tragedy like this for the world to remember Syria. That the international community had largely forgotten Syria. But it seems that the assistance that is being provided right now is hitting there Damascus into the most catastrophic scenarios that are playing out in Syria right now. But the Syrian representative said that the scale of response is not enough. The W.H.O. also warned that fuel is going to be an enormous problem when it comes to providing assistance to Syria. Overall, Bianca, every second counts, every minute counts. I mean, these are critical moments in search and rescue which remains a priority. We are also hearing and W.H.O. confirmed this, of people sleeping out in the cold in Syria because there are no shelters available. So the response to Syria has been one that perhaps is not matched to what we've seen in Turkey. And I want to talk about what we have seen coming through from Turkey. The Turkish government just said 23,060 personnel from 45 countries have now either been dispatched and are on the ground or making their way there. Turkey says 4,800 buildings from what the initial assessments are telling them is that buildings have collapsed. So we're talking about many more people possibly stuck under the rubble. The big concern here is that the death toll is going to increase. 20,000 people are currently injured in Turkey. So, trauma response is going to be vital. Max just spoke about the U.S. response. 160 personnel heading to Turkey right now. And we've seen an enormous international reaction.

Something that kept the president at Camp David some four or five hours longer than he was supposed to be there on Monday before returning to the White House. But when it comes to what's actually in that speech, advisers arepretty keen to point out, is largely the same from what you've heard from the president over the course of the last several weeks, talking about very clear accomplishments his first two years. Very clear progress in the first two years. But also, clear areas where there is still more work to do, work they hope could be done in a bipartisan basis. And that's critically important because of who will be sitting behind the president on Tuesday night. Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, a Republican for the first time since President Biden has been in office and certainly there have been no shortage of partisan brawls in the early stage of that new House Republican majority.

CNN's Jason Carroll reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JASON CARROLL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the controlled release, as they call it, was something that was incredible and both frightening to witness. We were about a mile and a half from the scene of the explosion. We first heard it at 4:38 p.m. that's when you heard the initial boom. And then shortly thereafter that huge plume of smoke started to grow. We got a statement minutes after the explosion from the train company in charge of all this, Norfolk Southern. They released a statement that said in part the controlled breach was successful and that some material burned off that was consistent with the models that they had put out there. Now earlier in the afternoon, they had given us a basic walk-through of what we were to expect and what was to happen here. They had a team of experts that went out to the site of the derailment, and they planted explosive devices, small explosive devices, on five of the derailed cars. That allowed small holes in the car so some of the toxic material could seep out and then they could light that on fire. Ohio's governor was also here. And he explained just how deadly the plume is. MIKE DEWINE (R) OHIO GOVERNOR: Controlled release of the toxic chemicals also has the potential to be deadly if inhaled. Those in the red area, those in the red area, are facing grave danger of death if they are still in that area.
