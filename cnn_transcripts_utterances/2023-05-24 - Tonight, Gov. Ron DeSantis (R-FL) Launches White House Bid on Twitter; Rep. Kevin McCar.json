And so it's interesting to actually see that starting to happen with this DeSantis announcement.Now, in terms of the former president, his campaign, his allies, there is a coordinated rollout, I am told, by advisers to essentially bracket DeSantis' announcement here and do what Trump seems to do best, which is take all the oxygen out of the room. This includes rolling out videos, including one of Trump directly addressing the DeSantis candidacy. It's also going to include a social media blitz. Now, this is something that Trump's team has spent months trying to achieve. They have been courting these big name conservative commentators with huge followings, trying to get them to get behind the former president. We're going to see them tap into that network today, having those posts out there. The things that we are hearing that surrogates are going to really be hitting DeSantis on are a number of policy issues both from when he was in Congress and since he's been Florida governor, and that includes reforming entitlement programs, a trade policy, China, his COVID-?19 response. And now you say there's more to that, that they've actually have research, opposition research, that will show DeSantis' decision, of course, something that we'll wait to see here. But the one thing to keep in mind is that despite the fact that Trump is surging in the polls, his team knows this isn't over yet.",

We've seen, obviously, a lot of talk about the more candidates who get in, the better it is for Donald Trump and that it's somehow a 2016 redux. And I tell you, Sara, this is nothing like 2016. And it starts because Donald Trump is the absolute frontrunner. No one disputes that. He's leading massively in the polls, which certainly wasn't the case in May of 2015.

And it's still very much in the thick of it.So, let's analyze this because it's a very interesting satellite loop. And here it is. We anticipated a direct landfall with this storm, but the typhoon went through what is called an eye wall replacement. So, it kind of wobbled the system north and circumvented the island. It's actually hugging the western island. And this has implications for who gets the strongest winds and the storm surge and heavy rain. This is what it looked like outside of the National Weather Service just a few hours ago during what was called an extreme wind warning. They reserved those words for very specific moments when winds are very dangerous to life and property. And, of course, they certainly were at that particular moment in time. Here's the storm. Large mass of orange you see here, right? The definitive eye has closed in, but still 140 mile per hour winds around that cone centric eye wall that we can't see on radar at the moment because, well, quite frankly, the radar has been knocked down. We have over 16 inches of rain already recorded in some locations, just incredible. That's why flash flood warnings are in place. More rainfall to come, another five to seven inches. Here's a look at the storm surge potential. Not as high as what we anticipated yesterday, but it's those western coastlines that will feel most vulnerable to this storm. John?",
