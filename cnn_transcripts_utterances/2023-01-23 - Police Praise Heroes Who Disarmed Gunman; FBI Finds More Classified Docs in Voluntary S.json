The sheriff says Tran opened fire at a ballroom dance studio here in Monterey Park, killing 10 people and  wounding 10 others.

Zients led the coronavirus response for the White House until last spring. And he also was recently brought in to try to help identify senior staff to fill -- come into the White House, should there be some turnover. But so far we really have seen very little turnover within this administration. Now, President Biden landed on Zients for this job, in part because it became clear, sources say, that White House chief of staff Ron Klain favored him as his replacement. And also, this comes at a very critical period when it comes to what the president is trying to accomplish in the coming years. One thing that much of the next two years will focus on will be implementing some of the laws that President Biden got passed up on Capitol Hill. And when you talk to people at the White House, talk to sources, Zients is known as a man who can get some things done. If you think of the large vaccination campaign that happened with the coronavirus. Back in 2013, he was brought in to fix the Obamacare.gov launch after some website woes.
