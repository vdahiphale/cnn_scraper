Vice President Harris held two rallies there yesterday, attended by about 25,000 people. Our own Isaac-Dovere reports that this morning, the campaign really feels confident about winning there even more so than Arizona. But Republicans think that they can hold on to the Tar Heel state, which hasn't gone for a Democratic president since 2008.Joining me now is the chair of the North Carolina Republican Party, Jason Simmons. Nice to see you. Thank you so much for being here. Before President Biden dropped out, Democrats, as you well know, essentially gave up on competing in your state. Kamala Harris is showing interest, is showing a slight lead within the margin of error in multiple polls. The Quinnipiac University poll actually has her up three points in their September poll. How worried are you, candidly, about that state for Donald Trump?",
