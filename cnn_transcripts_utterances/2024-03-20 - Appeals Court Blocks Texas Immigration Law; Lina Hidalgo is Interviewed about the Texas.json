The Supreme Court, for a moment yesterday, literally for like a few hours, cleared the way for the law to take effect. But around midnight an appeals court blocked it again.

And it's a confusing reality to make this story even - even more confusing for people. But essentially, just to get people up to speed, what this Texas law does is that it gives local law enforcement agents the ability to arrest people suspected of entering Texas illegally, and it also gives judges the ability to deport migrants to Mexico if they are here illegally. Obviously, critics of this law say that immigration enforcement is the sole responsibility of the federal government. Texas officials were briefing hailing the Supreme Court order that allowed SB-4 to go into effect for several hours yesterday. The attorney general called it a huge victory. The governor of Texas, who signed the law in December, says it was a positive development. But all of this, again, on hold. But, John, in speaking with a number of law enforcement agencies yesterday, you could get the sense that they were all kind of scrambling to figure out exactly how they would carry out this law on a day-to-day basis. And this is where the real difference comes in. It's the - you know, in theory, what this law looks like on paper seemed to be very different from what it would be like on the ground, where law enforcement agents were trying to make sense of it, exactly how it would be implemented day-to-day. Many officers we spoke with yesterday were telling us that these law enforcement agencies either don't have the manpower or the jail space, or there's just a lot of confusion as to exactly how it could be implemented. And some agencies very concerned about a possible liability for racial profiling and that sort of things. So, really just kind of lends to the chaotic nature of what this law has kind of created, at least for the time being, as so many different people across the state of Texas wait and see how this plays out in the courts.

And so what we would be able to do is say, law enforcement will not be implementing this.But I can tell you, for immigrants and just people of Hispanic descent who know that racial profiling is an issue, that is too much of a concern. And the other point is, this is just a terrible precedent. What Texas is doing on immigration would be akin to them declaring their own wars, would create massive confusion across, not just Texas, but other states. Iowa just passed something similar. No reason why Iowa needs to be worried about undocumented migrants crossing their border. But that just tells you this is about politics.

There is a crisis when it comes to immigration policy. And, yes, it is an issue in Texas. And it's an issue in states where migrants have been sent by the governor in order to make a point. And that's why President Biden partnered with Republicans in Congress to try to get a bill passed that was going to make the border safer and provide some sort of pass to immigration that was going to put over 1,000 more officers on the border. So, that's really what we have to work on is, as someone who's been through the immigration system myself, we need a real solution, but this simply is providing an opening for people to discriminate against folks that look Hispanic and it's also creating confusion. It's putting a burden on our law enforcement. It's not keeping people from crossing the border. It is going after the people, like me, who simply are Hispanic.",

But since Hunter decided not to show up, Republicans are now instead turning their focus to a pair of Hunter Biden business associates who have claimed that President Joe Biden was deeply involved in his son's overseas business deals. But those claims have yet to be verified. And, in fact, many of them have been directly undercut by other witnesses.So, Kate, there are signs that this hearing is shaping up to be far more spectacle than substance. For starters, as you mentioned, there is going to be an empty seat with Hunter Biden's name on it. And we should also point out that one of the Republican witnesses is going to be appearing remotely from federal prison. Meanwhile, Democrats have decided to select Lev Parnas as their witness.

In a new filing to the Supreme Court, Trump's legal team claims, quote, \"a denial of criminal immunity would incapacitate every future president with de facto blackmail and extortion while in office, and condemn him to years of post-office trauma at the hands of political opponents.\"With us now, California Congressman Adam Schiff. He is currently a member of the House Judiciary Committee and is running for Senate in California. Congressman, how would the prosecution of Donald Trump incapacitate every future president? REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Well, it wouldn't. In fact, it would reinforce the principle that no one is above the law. It would tell future presidents, if you engage in criminality, let alone try to subvert the peaceful transfer of power, you will be held accountable. And, frankly, if the result were any different, that would be the end of the republic. But I think what Trump is really arguing here is less on the merits because I think the Trump lawyers understand how weak their argument is, and more they're arguing, hey, Supreme Court, nod, nod, wink, wink, what we really want is a delay. Send this back to the lower court, make them go through factual findings. We will appeal whatever their decision is right back to you. Help us push this off after the election. And if we're successful, we'll make the whole thing go away and you won't even take responsibility for it. That's, I think, really what the Trump team is looking for. We saw the Supreme Court act with great speed when it came to dismissing these efforts by states to disqualify Trump. They can move quickly when they want to. They can also delay what they want when they want to. And I think that's what Trump is really after here.",

It would be absurd to say that the only check - the only really meaningful check of presidential power, that is the ability of voters to vote you out, is essentially nullified by this immunity argument. That is, voters can vote you out and a president can ignore it and stay in power and you can't hold them accountable.So, the merits are week, but they've already essentially given Trump some delay by pushing the hearing until April.
