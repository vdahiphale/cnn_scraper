What more can you tell us?FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, they certainly are. And I think one of the key organizations right now is certainly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the really elite part of Iran's military. And in that Revolutionary Guard Corps, the aerospace forces, because the same unit that conducted those missile strikes on Israeli territory, which by the way, the Iranians continue to say they believe were very successful, that is also the unit that is responsible for air defenses in Iran. First and foremost their general, Amir Ali Hajizadeh. And the Iranians really do take pride in their air defenses because a lot of them were made by the Iranians themselves after the sanctions. So they say the fact that they've been able to do that is certainly something that they take great pride in any case. I think there are several incitations that right now the Iranians will be looking at. First and foremost, their nuclear installations, which of course they will have protected by their air defense systems, which of course is something that's very difficult given the fact that the Israelis do have those fifth generation fighter jets that have stealth capabilities making it extremely difficult for surface-to-air missile systems to hold them off. But then also one of the things that we've been hearing about a lot as potential strike targets are, for instance, the oil and gas installations that Iran has, for instance, in the area of the Persian Gulf but also in the border area between Iran and Iraq. So those are certainly things that the Iranians right now will be bracing for. They'll be bracing for other targets as well. But you can bet that Iran's aerospace forces and their surface-to-air missile troops will definitely be on high alert. But I do also want to talk about, Kim, those Friday prayers that are taking place today, because I do think it is highly significant that the Supreme Leader himself, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is leading those Friday prayers. The last time he did that was when Qasem Soleimani, the legendary Iranian general, the director of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was killed by a U.S. missile attack in 2020. We can see there some of the crowds gathering, obviously a massive crowd that is already on hand. I think that it's very difficult to overestimate how important Hassan Nasrallah was for Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. There was a deep bond between Khamenei, Nasrallah, and also Qasem Soleimani. In fact, the three actually wrote a book together a couple of years ago. And in that book, the \"2006 Lebanon War,\" Israel's incursion into Lebanon at that time, played a major role. And the Iranians and Hezbollah certainly believed that Hezbollah held their own in that. And I think that was really a defining moment for Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. And so for him, it certainly was a big blow that Hassan Nasrallah has now been killed. The Iranians, of course, have said that they will continue to support Hezbollah and of course also Hamas as well. And if you look at the crowd, I was looking at some of the feeds that were coming in, there are a lot of Palestinian flags, but also a lot of Hezbollah flags that are being waived by the people who currently are coming to those Friday prayers.

I'm purposely being neutral here and objective because each side seems to believe that he's right and their logic subscribes to the same line of thinking.And look, what's going on with Hezbollah was going to happen anyway. I mean, there was the Hezbollah grossly miscalculated their participation in this war after October 7th 2023, you know when it was a token participation it was sort of tolerable, but they made it intolerable and untenable for Israel and there needed to be a response. And okay, let's assume that that's contained and even the U.S. whose prime interest in the last year was to contain escalation or prevent escalation altogether, the U.S. thought that as long as it's confined to Israel and Hezbollah, we America could live with that. But enter the Iranians into the equation and the Iranian relationship with Hezbollah and the Iranian sense that they need to project power and the sense that if Hezbollah is being damaged earth or degraded significantly, Iran needs for its own geopolitical reasons to respond. So all this put together leads to inevitable escalation. And again, I'm using that. And again, I'm sorry, Kim, I'm using that word.",

KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump was slated to give a speech on the economy and while he did touch on some economic points in Saginaw, Michigan, he talked about some of the policy proposals he has if he is reelected, including no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime. He also veered off topic pretty much half or more of the time talking about everything we have heard from Donald Trump in the past, including re-litigating the ABC debate talking about Kamala Harris' ascension to the top of the ticket. At one point, he called Nancy Pelosi crazy, yet again, having nothing to do with any policy on the economy. But one of the things that he continued to fixate on was the federal response to Hurricane Helene. Now, that's not that surprising given the fact that Donald Trump and his team have been working to tie Kamala Harris to the current administration, which is not that hard to do. She is the vice president, but now he has fixated on this idea of the federal response to Helene. He has been claiming over and over again that it has been disastrous. That is not what we have heard from Republican and Democratic governors on the ground, particularly on a day like today where President Joe Biden was on the ground there, assessing some of the damages, promising some more resources, but he also made this claim.

The two of those things would not be conflated. But obviously, as we know, Donald Trump often tries to take some part of the truth and bolster it out there to try and use incendiary language. It appears that's what he was doing there tonight. Now, one interesting point I want to note, he is going to be in Georgia on Friday, standing next to Governor Brian Kemp, the popular Republican governor, who he has been at odds with for years. This is the first time the two of them will appear side-by-side since before the 2020 election. Of course, as we remember, they had a huge falling out when Kemp decided to certify the election in Georgia going against Trump's wishes.

That brings us up to more than 100 villages in all, to a depth of about 30 kilometers into southern Lebanon that they're saying must be depopulated right now as part of its operations. The Israeli military says it has carried out dozens of bombing runs in Lebanon from the south and the east of the country to the southern suburbs Beirut as well. It says it is targeting Hezbollah militants and infrastructure.

It's now weakened to a tropical depression, but it's still dumping heavy rain on the island. Those caught in the storm were rattled by its force. Damage is widespread. Hundreds of flights have been canceled. Close to 100,000 households lost power. Schools and stock markets were closed. Before hitting Taiwan, Krathon hit the Philippines, where more than 23,000 families are estimated to have been affected. Here in the U.S., the death toll from Hurricane Helene has risen to at least 213 people across six states. More than 200 people in North Carolina are still unaccounted for. In many areas, like Chimney Rock, entire parts of towns, including bridges, roads, and buildings, were wiped away. The area around Asheville was particularly hard hit. It's struggling to meet basic needs for residents as the search goes on for people still missing, and residents continue to cope with the destruction. Here's North Carolina's governor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC): To wake up one morning and everything that you own be gone is a tragic situation. This is an unprecedented situation that is going to require an unprecedented response. We're working to turn on every avenue of resources that we can to help people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Hurricane Helene cut an 800-kilometer path of destruction across the U.S. southeast. The National Weather Service calls it a once rainfall event.And President Joe Biden surveyed devastated areas in the southeast again on Thursday, first in Florida, alongside Republican Senator Rick Scott. And later in Georgia, where he said, it's time to come together and break down the rabid partisanship in U.S. politics. Ryan Young reports from the President's stop in Valdosta, Georgia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RYAN YOUNG, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, all throughout Lowndes County, which is 500 square miles, you see destruction like what's behind me. You see this house right here with a tree across its roof, and the house next door has a tree across its roof. We've seen this repeat itself over and over again. Crews have been working their way to clear streets to make things safe for residents. But that's why the president showed up here. We know that this has been such an impoverished storm that they need federal assistance in this area. The president went through to see the areas that were damaged. We know agriculture has been greatly impacted. Small businesses have been impacted, and they need federal assistance. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: When it was like this, it was trying to put politics aside. Again, it's not one state versus the other. It's the United States. Our job is to help as many people as we can; as many as we can. And also, by the way, when you do that, I hope we begin to break down this rabid partisanship that exists. I mean, it's the ceiling. There's no rationale for it.",

Tarps are being handed out to citizens all throughout this county because they know more rain could be coming. They're trying to protect homes throughout this area. They're also giving out ice and water.But more than 70 percent of this area is without power. There are power crews that are working from all across the United States here. We saw a crew from Mississippi that is trying to get lines back up, get critical power back on. It's still very hot here. The residents here are suffering more than one way because without power, as several small businesses, people aren't getting paid. They're not able to go out and get food. So these are things they want to see restored very quickly. It's something that we'll continue to watch. Ryan Young, CNN, Valdosta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That would quadruple the numbers that Dominican migration authorities have been reporting up until September of this year.These actions have been taken according to Dominican President Luis Abinader because of the inefficiency up until now of the U.N.-backed mission in Haiti fighting the gangs that control up to about 80 percent of the capital city of Port-au-Prince. Let's take a listen to Dominican President Luis Abinader. LUIS ABINADER, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC PRESIDENT (through translator): We could see at the United Nations that the process of support to the Haitian National Police was slow, and that is why we said at the United Nations that if they did not act quickly we were going to take special measures. Today, we are starting to take those special measures.",

He said authorities also agreed to strengthen border surveillance and controls to fight human trafficking.The Haitian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dominique Ayiri expressed via X her concern, saying there are a series of discriminatory measures for the mass deportation of Haitians. Ayiri called for their respect of international treaties and the inalienable rights of every child, woman and man affected by this decision. Haitians consulted by CNN also expressed their concern while hoping Dominican authorities will focus their efforts exclusively on undocumented migrants. They worry that might not be the case on the ground. By September of this year, Dominican authorities have reported the deportation of roughly 172,000 Haitians. That number is expected to rise exponentially. For CNN, Jessica Hasbun, Santo Domingo. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
