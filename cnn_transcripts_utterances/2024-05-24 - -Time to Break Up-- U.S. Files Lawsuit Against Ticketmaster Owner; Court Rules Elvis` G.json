President Biden and the first lady welcoming KenyanPresident William Ruto and his wife to the White House yesterday. The Biden administration is hoping to boost ties with African nations in order to counter China`s influence in the region. China has loaned billions of dollars to Africa, giving it a lot of leverage over the continent. Ten second trivia. In what year was Elvis Presley`s estate Graceland opened to the public? 1966, `77, `82 or `93? If you said 1982, you are correct. Elvis Presley`s ex-wife Priscilla was co-executor and co-trustee of Presley`s estate. She worked to open the Graceland mansion in Memphis to the public in 1982. Thank you. Thank you very much. According to History.com, Graceland is the second most visited residence in the U.S. behind only the White House, did you know? Songs like Blue Suede Shoes, Jailhouse Rock, catapulted Elvis to superstardom in the 1950s. The so-called king was such a cultural phenomenon that his home in Memphis became a museum. But the Presley family almost lost it this week. A lending company planned to auction off Graceland to the highest bidder. It claimed Elvis`s daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, owed them millions of dollars on a loan and the company wanted to seize Graceland to make good on the debt. But Elvis`s granddaughter filed a motion in court to stop the auction. She claims the loan paperwork was fake. A judge agreed with her, halting the auction and accusing the lending company of potential fraud. So for now, Graceland is staying with the Presley family and it stays open to the public. So rock on. Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10. One reminding us that we`re never too young to have some fancy taste. A Florida baby going viral on TikTok for being a big fan of the swanky Four Seasons Hotel in Orlando. Check it out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
