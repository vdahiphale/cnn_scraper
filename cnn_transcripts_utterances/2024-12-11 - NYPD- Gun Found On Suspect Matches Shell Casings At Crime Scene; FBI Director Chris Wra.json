Plus, a truly stunning find in Syria, a padlocked prison cell shot open only to discover an inmate alive inside. CNN cameras were there as it happened, and you will see that moment first here on THE LEAD. And then President Trump hired him in 2017, presumably for a traditional ten-year term. But now, FBI Director Christopher Wray is announcing plans to resign before that term is over, under pressure from Trump, who wants to replace Wray with a new, much more pliant and controversial choice.

I'm Jake Tapper.Lots of fast moving and major developments today in the case against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The latest, the NYPD commissioner says the gun found on Mangione in Pennsylvania on Monday matches the shell casings that were discovered at the crime scene last week. And according to law enforcement, Mangione fingerprints were found on evidence discovered at the scene of the assassination. The first forensic match directly tying the suspect to the scene in Manhattan where Thompson was shot one week ago. The suspect's lawyer, however, is denying his clients involvement, saying that he will plead not guilty. Police right now are looking closely at the suspects writings that they discovered in a spiral notebook. Sources say some of those notes actually reference his plans to kill, while other notes reference his back pain from a 2023 back injury. Police are investigating whether the insurance industry either denied a claim or didn't fully come to his aid. Even though the victim in this case was a husband and father of two, the murder has prompted many Americans to express anger at the health insurance industry, and even in some cases, a nihilistic fandom of the suspected killer himself, a sentiment shaking up corporations across the nation. They are scrambling to protect their senior executives as police warn of an elevated threat against business leaders. CNN's Brynn Gingras takes a look now at where the investigation stands, and how law enforcement is trying to trace the suspect's activity in the months leading up to the murder. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): While Luigi Mangione sits alone in a Pennsylvania jail cell, police say they now have crucial connections between the 26-year-old and the Manhattan crime scene.",

Appreciate it.As investigators pore over the subject's writings and social media posts, we're trying to get a better understanding of what Mangione may have been dealing with in terms of his health. Let's bring in CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. He's a practicing neurosurgeon who operates on the brain and the spine. And, Sanjay, Mangione allegedly claimed in handwritten notes that he was suffering from spondylolisthesis -- well, you can explain it to us, to how you say it. It means a slippage of the vertebrae in the spine. Tell us more about it. How to pronounce it and how it affects people. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Sure. Yeah. So this is what we're gathering from some of these reports. We haven't confirmed this, but spondylolisthesis is the -- is the term. Let me just show you, Jake. I pulled this -- this spine model here so you can take a look at this with me. But so, this is -- this is the spine. We're going all the way up to the neck, down into the thoracic spine. And then the lower back, lower back. And this is your sacrum over here. So with spondylolisthesis, you might have slippage of the bone over here kind of moving forward on -- on another bone. So it's just basically instead of lining up perfectly like you see it in this model, one of the bones sort of slips out a little bit forward. And that can be painful for -- for various reasons. It can be painful in the back because of that movement of the bone. It can also cause leg pain if one of the nerves in that area starts to get encroached or pinched by those bones moving around as well. So it's a -- its a fairly common condition. I mean, just back pain. Overall, 65 million people roughly have that in the United States. And there's a lot of operations performed for this sort of thing. Again, we don't know for sure what exactly was going on with him. How long he had this sort of problem. Sometimes people are born with issues that can lead to this sort of problem later on in life, but it is. It's quite common, actually, Jake.",

Naming a successor to Wray when Wray's job wasn't up for another three years is about as much public pressure as you can put on someone to show them that the decision is either they resign or they're going to be fired.And Donald Trump was asked about that on Sunday during an interview where he essentially said, look, I've put Kash Patel. I've named Kash Patel as the person I want leading the FBI that would go to show you or go to reason that that needs to job needs to be open by the time Kash Patel gets there, meaning Christopher Wray would either have to resign or I would fire him. And Donald Trump has had a real turning with Christopher Wray, the person that he himself appointed to this job, particularly after that 2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago home for classified documents that ultimately led to his indictment in 2023. It was just a matter of time, and Donald Trump's team is celebrating the fact that Christopher Wray decided to go down this path of resignation rather than waiting to be fired by Donald Trump.",

The president has made no secret that he does envision a fundamentally different relationship between the FBI, the nation's chief law enforcement agency, and the White House.In the past, there has been a separation. The FBI director has been viewed as someone outside of partisan politics. That's why Congress made the FBI director almost unique in our federal system that they have a ten-year term. The attorney general doesn't get a ten-year term. But unfortunately, for better or for worse, the FBI director in years past has become embroiled at the epicenter of political controversies, which is why we see what happened today play out. So I think what we're going to see in the next Trump term is one where there is a much closer working political relationship between the White House and law enforcement than there has been in the past.",

What specific information? We heard it in Elizabeth's excellent reporting there. Like for example, it happened in 2006, but you amended it several months later, right? Or a couple of months later wherein you said it was 2007. Was this not a traumatic event? Did you not know the specific date? Did you not know the specific time? Did you not know the specific place? Did you not know so in October that you were not married? Or were you married, as you said now? And in terms of other information that feds are going to vet, they're going to say there was another celebrity present. Who was that celebrity? They will speak to them. They will indicate that, hey, this happened at some point and you then were fired. They will seek to speak, the investigators will, to his supervisors. And so there's a lot of information they will glean before they attempt to insert this in the criminal case. Last point, Jake, and that's this -- even if those answers are answered positively, right, and lets be clear, civil complaint is an allegation. There are allegations that have to be proven in a court of law. It would be up to a judge to make the assessment as to whether or not this would be admissible in that case, meaning, could a jury hear it and how could it be used, whether it would be limited? Will it be excluded? That all will be to the discretion of the judge in the federal case.",
