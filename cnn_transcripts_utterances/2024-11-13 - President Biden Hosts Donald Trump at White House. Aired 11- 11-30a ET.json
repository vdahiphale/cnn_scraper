This is actually Trump's first time here at the White House since he departed four years ago from the South Lawn, when he skipped Joe Biden's inauguration. And I should note, Pam, as I was walking in the White House -- and there you can see Trump's motorcade headed here to the White House. As I was walking in, they're preparing for Trump's inauguration now. They have got the stands built outside the White House, just a sign of how this is about to be a historic change in power shortly.",

He is in such a different position now as he sits down with President Biden.And the two men, they will meet in the Oval Office and likely discuss many topics, including the crises unfolding around the world.

We know what he said. We know what he's pledged to do, ending the war in 24 hours. I mean, obviously, Pam, it's a very difficult crisis that he's about to inherit. The same with the war in Gaza. They have very different views on this. You just saw that with Trump's pick as his U.S. ambassador to Israel. I also have questions. This is what we're told they're going to talk about, foreign policy and views on that, when they're in there.

I mean, that is really what it's all about. We should note, though, that Melania Trump is breaking with tradition, her office confirming she will not attend the customary meeting with the first lady.

They cheered and they clapped as she got out of her motorcade, clearly sort of wanting to send the message, yes, you had a tough week. Yes, this was a tough week for Democrats in the party. But we welcome you back to the White House. We appreciate what you did. There's not been a lot of talk, actually, in all of my conversations I have had with Democrats about what the future of Kamala Harris is. Quite frankly, I think that's not the headspace that a lot of folks are in. I think they are still in the headspace in the place of processing what happened on Election Day. And, as we have reported, the anger that I am hearing from so many Democrats is not being directed at Vice President Harris. It is being directed at President Biden.",

This is a very different Washington, D.C., that he is descending upon. And the other part of this is that, yes, back in 2016-2017, when Donald Trump came to Washington, Republicans did have control of the Senate. They did have control of the House.

And I am told that he's been reveling in it, reveling in the win, reveling in what Washington is going to look like. And he wants to come and show up here. And I think it's interesting that he didn't stop and try to talk when he was at JBA, which he could have. There is the press there. That's the airport, obviously, that he landed at.

I mean, it really is -- this is tradition. We keep talking about that, but it's also extraordinary. There is so much significance with this meeting today between Trump and Biden.

One of the central reasons he came back to run in the first place was to defeat Donald Trump. And that is what is so extraordinary here now, a one-term presidency of Joe Biden. Donald Trump is not just returning. He's returning in a far stronger fashion than he was before. But there's no doubt that President Biden is a traditionalist. He has served in every corner of this capital. And this is something that he believes in his bones, that the Constitution and the office of the presidency is bigger than any one man. So he does want to show that. But in terms of eating glass, yes, I think he would like to think -- but they're also meeting in the private dining room, as we all know, just steps off of the Oval Office.

So this is a thing that it's a living, breathing version of a letter that they leave for one another. That's what's kind of playing out here today. BROWN:  And you can you can look at history, right, when he met with President Obama and how that went. I think it went longer, as I recall, than expected. And from our reporting, President Obama tried to warn Trump of all the national security risks that he was going to be taking on and cautioned him to really pick qualified White House security -- White House personnel. This time around, we are getting a picture of what Trump wants his Cabinet to look like, right, Pete Hegseth as defense secretary. You have to wonder how that's sort of shaping the conversation today, particularly, as our reporting indicates, Biden wants to talk to Trump about issues like the war in Ukraine.",

He also warned about North Korea and was saying you have to pay attention to North Korea, I believe, at the time, that that country is one of the biggest risks to the United States. I don't think that has changed much. But just on the personnel, back then, Donald Trump picked Michael Flynn. This time around -- as national security adviser, who didn't last very long.",

He will be largely surrounded by entirely different people this time around.And I think first and foremost is the person who has the best real estate aside from the Oval Office. That's the chief of staff. And Susie Wiles is someone who knows Washington well. She's not worked in Washington as much as she has in Florida. But that is one of the big differences here. I'm asked all the time, what are the differences between when he first came in? One, he knows the job. And, two, he is surrounding himself, as of now, with different people, the toughest job in the city, if not the country or world, that position of chief of staff. So I'm told she's been talking to previous chiefs of staff, trying to get a sense of the institution and the history.

I just want to also say that, eight years ago, Donald Trump didn't think that Donald Trump was going to win. I mean, he really didn't. I think that it's fair to say, especially now that we have done so much reporting on that time period, I have talked to lots of people in and around him who say that he was a bit shell-shocked that this sort of lark that he went on to get into politics succeeded.

He will take the oath of office on the steps of the Capitol. And then at noon that day is when the power will be turned over and Joe Biden will leave the White House and Donald Trump will enter the White House for his second term. And I think, M.J. and Kristen, looking at this and this moment, the pleasantries are being exchanged there. Certainly, it is a relationship that is broken down between the two of them where Trump obviously has said horrible things about Biden on the campaign trail, calling him diminished and talking about him at length until he was out of the race. He's said much nicer things lately.

We're going to continue to see this rollout of what the staff is going to look like.But this marks the beginning of that peaceful transfer of power and how Donald Trump handles this and how Joe Biden handles it sets the tone for what it's going to look like. And I heard Jeff saying, and I thought it was interesting, the fact that Donald Trump was deferring to President Joe Biden when it came to answering questions, he was looking at him seeing what he was going to do. Clearly, he is trying to set this tone and by saying it's going to be a smooth transition of power, kind of ignoring what happened last time and essentially pretending that they're starting fresh here. But he is trying to set a tone clearly with what he is saying. Obviously, we will see if he ends up contradicting that. We know that that's often something we see with Donald Trump. But right now, it is clear what he's doing.",

The brief pleasantries were pleasant, I guess polite, but I do think it is worth underscoring the reason that this scene and this image is so striking is because these two men have no relationship to speak of.This is not President George W. Bush welcoming the Obamas to the White House. This is not Bill Clinton welcoming w. Bush to the White House. You look back on those images in the footage and there is some real warmth there. There is no actual warmth, despite the fire, between those two men. We have talked about the many ways in which President Trump has talked in denigrating ways about President Biden. Biden, too, throughout the course of this campaign, referring to this person as a fascist, as a total threat to the country, and now on top of that, he is having to say the words \"Welcome back\" to a man who single-handedly actually could completely alter and probably already has altered his political legacy. The fact that he believed that he needed to seek a second term and then was forced out of the race and then the vice president that he endorsed didn't end up winning, I mean, that is going to be sort of the lead sentence, probably, of anything that is ever written about President Biden. And here they are now just sitting a couple of feet away from each other and he is having to say the words \"Welcome back.\"",
