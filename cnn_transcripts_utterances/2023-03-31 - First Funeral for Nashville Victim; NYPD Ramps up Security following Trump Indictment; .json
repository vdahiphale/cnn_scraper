So, what are they looking at? They're looking at social media platforms. They're looking carefully at statements from Donald Trump and supporters about rallying people.But the New York City Police Department is unique in this regard in that you've got 35,000 police officers. It's not like what we saw in Washington, D.C., where there are finite limits to that. I mean, when they thought he was going to be indicted Tuesday the week before last, their first effort at that was 10 mobile field forces on Monday, 14 on Tuesday. That comes out to 752 cops, of mobile field force, one lieutenant, five sergeants, 40 cops. These move as a group. But, you know, you can keep pressing that button and you can order another 1,000 cops or another and another. So, what you're seeing today is a layering, a show of presence, not of force, to say, we're in - we're in place. And they have the entire police department in uniform today. If you're working narcotics, if you're on the terrorism squad, if you're in an administrative job, you were there in full uniform. All officers of all ranks, as of 7:00 a.m. today.

It emerged that he has not accepted guilt for the crime of espionage for which he's been charged, and the court arraigned him in pre-trial detention until May the 29th. So, nearly two months from now when he gets his next day in court. In terms of where he is now, well, that's not being revealed publicly. But I think the expectation is probably he's probably at that Lefortovo prison in that pre-trial detention center. That's where lots of people accused of this serious offense of espionage are held.
