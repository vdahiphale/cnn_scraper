Wolf, we'll get to you in a moment.We have this breaking news right now. We're standing by for the release of a second group of hostages held by Hamas. Sources tell CNN that release is being delayed, in part over a dispute about the number of aid trucks entering Gaza. These are live pictures right now from the Rafah border crossing in Gaza where the hostages could be transported at any moment. We're also told today's group is likely to include 13 Israeli citizens, several of which are expected to be children, adding to the 24 hostages released yesterday. And this exchange comes a full seven weeks after the hostages were abducted from their homes. A U.S. official says American citizens are not expected to be among those released today. 39 Palestinian prisoners are set to be released as well today, following the release of the Israeli hostages from Gaza. These exchanges are part of a four-day truce set to expire on Tuesday. Wolf in Tel Aviv.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, by this time yesterday, those hostages had not only already been handed over to the Red Cross inside Gaza, but they had also gone into Egypt via that Rafah crossing, and they were making their way to the Kerem Shalom crossing, which is right behind me here.The light that you see, in the distance there is the turn or -- the turn where the convoy yesterday of ambulances carrying those hostages, drove down this road, turning at that point, and driving down this road on their way to the Hatzerim Airbase. As of now, though, Wolf, that has not happened. The -- our understanding is that there has been a delay -- a delay, at least of a few hours clearly, of this deal going through, because, in part, of the movement of aid vehicles into Gaza. With Hamas, claiming that Israel has not provided the number of aid vehicles that should be going into Gaza as part of this overall deal, because it's important to remember that beyond the release of civilian hostages, 50 over the next four days, and the Palestinian prisoners, three Palestinian prisoners for every one Israeli civilian hostage, there is also this aid component to the deal. And it appears that there has been a delay in those vehicles getting across into Gaza, and that may be part of the delay of these hostages, finally, being able to -- able to cross back into Israel. That is why Israeli officials have really been taking this process, day by day. They recognize early on that there were going to be speed bumps in this process. That there were going to be potential delays and issues that would arise. Even as late as this morning, our understanding is that there were still discussions mediated by the Qatari government between Israel and Hamas over the exact number, whether it would be 13 or 14 hostages to be handed over today. And so, this is a very delicate situation. And even though yesterday went relatively smoothly, and offers some hope, some opportunity for additional releases of hostages going forward, clearly, this is still a very tenuous situation. But Wolf, clearly the Israeli military has been preparing for these hostages to arrive at this Kerem Shalom crossing. They have closed down this road to regular traffic. We have Israeli military vehicles right next to our position. So, all the preparations are in place to receive these hostages. The question now is when will that happen? Wolf?",

They are very much in tune to what's going on. They have heard there has been a delay, that, of course, has upset many of those here. They want to see this process moving forward. They want to see that second batch coming out, even as they celebrate the release of the first batch.You can see here, this is a major event they have scheduled here, calling it essentially 50 for 50. 50,000 people they're trying to bring back and bring here to mark 50 days in captivity for the hostages. They've had this clock going pretty much since then ticking down the hours, 49 days, 12 hours, 13 minutes, and the seconds ticking down until the 50-day mark. Many of those who have arrived here have held up signs, I think as you just saw in the shot there, and taking pictures of the clock as it goes. There are 1000s here to mark this event. We've had a chance to speak to the families of some of the hostages here, including 10-month-old Kfir Bibas, the youngest hostage in Hamas captivity. He actually turned 10-months-old in captivity. When he went in, he was nine months. And his cousin said, look, it's been incredibly difficult as we wait for any sorts of news. We don't even know the first 50 to come out. Hamas simply releases the names in each batch day by day, and that makes it even more difficult. They had been hopeful that because Kfir Bibas is so young, he would be one of the first to come out. And that simply has not at least as of right now been the case. So, simply becomes a matter of hoping for another day and hoping for another day that the list includes their family members. Still, here in this square, all of the families of the hostages have come together and formed their own family, a new family as they call it. And that's a lot of what this is about. Strengthening those families and making sure the pressure remains on the government to do everything it can to bring everybody home. One of the difficult aspects of this is that so far, it's women and children. So, those who have men who are in captivity, have to keep waiting for some sort of news and hoping that the initial deal for four days is extended, can be expanded to include their loved ones. They demand here that everyone will be brought home without exception. Wolf.",

It's very difficult because we all know there is zero trust between the two parties. There is no direct communication between them.

So, it all has to be done by passing messages to people, can deliver the messages underground to the Hamas command centers, it's a very cumbersome and time -- it takes a lot of time to get done.

Do you think there could be more deals down the road in the near future to help bring those folks back to Israel? BASKIN: Yes, as I understand it from talking to people in Hamas, in -- they are interested in releasing all the civilian hostages. They only want to hold on to the army, the soldiers, the women and men soldiers in order to negotiate them for the release of 7,200 Palestinian prisoners, something which is unimaginable.

And Israel on October 7th failed to do that. And these people were taken from their homes. And Israel has a responsibility to bring them back. And I think that's weighing heavily on the members of the Israeli government. Certainly the new members of the Cabinet from a party, they pushed Netanyahu and other people in the liquid (ph) to agree to this deal. I don't think they had a choice.

He is also the author of the book \"Losing an Enemy \"on U.S.-Iran relations. Trita, good to see you.So as we await for these hostages, thank you so much, to be released. Hamas says there is a delay because Israel is slow on allowing humanitarian aid to enter. So what does this say about which side is wielding power here? TRITA PARSI, AUTHOR, \"LOSING AN ENEMY\": Well, both sides definitely have leverage in this situation without a doubt. And this is one of the concerns that always exists with prisoner exchanges of this kind. It is dragged out over several different days, which means that there's plenty of unfortunate risks that something may potentially go wrong. In this specific case, the number of trucks has been below the 200 that has been part of the agreement whether that is because of the mistake, logistical reasons, et cetera. We do not know. But I think this just makes the ordeal for prisoners and hostages on both sides all the more devastating and excruciating when a delay like this takes place.",

Hopefully, after this prisoner swap, we will not go back to the war as it was before, but rather it will be used to create momentum, or a more enduring ceasefire that puts an end to the killing, and then slowly but surely paves the way for a diplomatic path towards actually resolving this issue.",
