      "sentences": "You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington and we are following two major stories unfolding at this hour. Moments ago in Texas, the state's House of Representatives voted to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton. He is accused of bribery and abuse of public trust.The conservative Republican said the impeachment was illegal and being pushed by what he called corrupt politicians. We'll have more on that in just a moment. But in the meantime in Washington, its deal or no deal. Two sources tell CNN that President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are expected to speak by phone this hour. It comes during a critical moment in the debt ceiling talks and a source says it's now down to one final sticking point, work requirements for social safety net programs. The White House and Republican leaders may have as little as eight days to prevent the US from defaulting on its debts. Many experts predict economic disaster if that happens. Let's begin with the debt talks. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is over at the White House, Manu Raju up on Capitol Hill. Manu, they would not be getting on the phone just to go over what they're going to have at their Memorial Day weekend barbecue. I mean, this this means that maybe we're getting close.",

      "sentences": "Yes, indeed it does. In fact, I just spoke to Patrick McHenry, who is one of the key negotiators who has been in the room all along about this phone call.I asked him what is the purpose of this phone call. He said, it is because of those sticking points. He said that the president and the speaker need to get on the phone and try to hash out the remaining sticking points. And he mentioned the work requirements that we've been reporting that has been a chief sticking point. Work requirements on social safety net programs like food stamps and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program. Republicans believe that certain individuals who benefit from that program should be forced to go back into the workforce. Democrats believe it's an attack on the working poor. They believe it's an attack on families that need these benefits. So how do they reconcile that? That's a big issue. But he also said another issue the president still needs to resolve with the speaker is on spending cuts. We know that has been a part of these negotiations all along. Republicans demanding steeper spending cuts. McCarthy has said his red line is they need to spend less money next year than we're doing this year for the federal government, but it sounded according to Patrick McHenry, that has not been totally resolved yet either. So the point of this phone call that's happening in this hour is can they figure out a way to resolve this impasse that the negotiators themselves have not been able to figure out over the last several days. And as you mentioned, Jim, time is of the essence here. They want to get a deal tonight in order to release the legislative text as soon as tonight and try to get it on the House floor as soon as Tuesday and then try to get it through the Senate as well. That will take several more days before we get into June 5th, and we're not even talking about the complication of counting the votes, getting people on the left and right behind this bill, and we expect a lot of opposition from both sides of the aisle over this deal. So a lot of moving parts, but the moment, the critical phone call, the president and the speaker, can they resolve those final disagreements -- Jim.",

This is the recognition of that by people in his own party.And you're right. In the Texas Senate, it's going to be a higher threshold for sure. It's two-thirds of those who are present. Look, if you think about it the way you think about the indictments and the impeachments of folks, either connected to former President Trump or President Trump himself when he was impeached in Washington, and it works very similar to that here in Texas. The House basically makes an indictment in the form of the impeachment, and then the Senate has the trial. I find it interesting, Rosa mentioned that, basically the presiding officer of the Senate, not necessarily the judge in this case, but the guy who will hold the gavel is Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, and he is the kind of Republican I mean, ideologically and the kind of person who has the support of former President Trump, like Ken Paxton does, but I might have expected Patrick to be sort of dismissive of this, but he hasn't been. In the last few days, you've had Patrick come out and say that the Senate is going to take its duty very seriously when it comes to this, and he would not make any predictions about how it might go.",

So one of the things that's -- one of the aspects of this is not justthe alleged misdeeds of Paxton, but I think that vote also shows you that this really became a question about leadership in the Texas House and whether Democratic and Republican members of the Texas House were going to side with Phelan and not fight against Paxton. And so look, it is Texas politics, it's not for the squeamish. It's full contact and all of that, and we're going to see how this turns out in the Senate.",

That's really not what's going on. It's not like Democrats are getting things in these talks.

The White House said yesterday that they weren't in favor of these work requirements, and that they were discussing. I agree with that. And so I have faith in the president.

I suppose you have to call them out when they happen, though, regardless. HERTLING: Yes, there's no way any of the condemnation is going to attack the - stop the attacks, Jim, because this is the Russian way of war. We've been talking about this for 16 months now. The use of illegal weapons like cluster munitions, the fact that they are targeting specifically civilian infrastructure to include hospitals and schools and medical facilities. So all of those things just add to the list of Geneva Convention and law of land warfare crimes that the Russians have been committed.

Sometimes you do see the video posted by other users on these websites, and so that - it just continues on for other people as well.But I understand that you have been working up on Capitol Hill to try to get some momentum moving forward on this issue, to try to do it legislatively, what's the latest on that?",

Look, I think that both sides of the aisle see that it's time to repeal Section 230 protection for these tech companies since they've shown over and over again that they just can't be trusted to do the right thing.So I think that I saw that Nikki Haley came out who - she's obviously Republican presidential candidate, she came out in favor of repealing these sanctions or the repealing of Section 230 immunity for these companies. So I think slowly but surely now that Congress realizes the balls in their court, I think that they're - from what I can gather, there's movement to create some bipartisan legislation, and I'm going to be there doing everything I can to push for this legislation and advocate. And I think it's actually going to probably be easier to get something like this done to - then, it will be to pass new gun legislation. So I'm hopeful --",

It's not about free speech. So I think we pull Section 230 back. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They have the technology to flag and that's actually part of AI. The good part of AI is that they can make this - they can flag this content and get rid of it. But they don't want to do it as - and again, I go back to Francis Hogan (ph), because they make money from it. They make money from it. And that's got to stop and I think that, again, per Nikki Haley's comment and what I'm seeing or hearing on the Hill is that I think enough is enough.

There's also this fake video that appears to show Hillary Clinton endorsing DeSantis on MSNBC. This was also circulating online as well. Again, we want to stress to our viewers, this never happened. This is another one of those AI deepfakes. And CNN's Jon Sarlin joins us now. Jon, I mean, this stuff is getting - and I don't want to give it credit, because it's so twisted, but it's getting better and better. These memes and these deepfakes and so on.

It's why Washington, D.C. is looking to regulate it, but in the medical community, they're incredibly bullish about what AI can mean for drug discovery.In this case, scientists tackled a superbug that's becoming increasingly common in hospitals. It clings to doorknobs and can be deadly. In 2019, the CDC said that it was urgent that researchers find a new way to combat it. Well, researchers at McMaster University, Harvard and MIT used AI to do just that. And so basically, there are two ways that AI - scientists are excited about AI when it comes to medicine. One is to take AI to create completely new drugs, to develop completely new drugs and those drugs right now are being tested. In this case, scientists used it to speed up the traditional research process. In this case, they took the kind of middle process of seeing how the disease reacts to certain chemicals. It fed it into an AI. They told CNN, they went out to lunch. By the time they got back, they had a list of possible drugs.",
