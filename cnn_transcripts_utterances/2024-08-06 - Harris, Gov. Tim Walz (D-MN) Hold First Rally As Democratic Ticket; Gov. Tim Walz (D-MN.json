He's a good campaigner. You know, they hope he can culturally relate to voters and states they have to win. But if they get to the finish line and they fall short in Pennsylvania, and thus fall short in the Electoral College, there's going to be a lot of second guessing this moment. FMR. REP. LEE ZELDIN (R-NY): I mean, I think this is a race that should be decided on issues at the end of the day. And, you know, right now, initially you make an announcement, people get introduced to a V.P. You go through the initial few media cycles. Ultimately, when we get into time for voting in September and October, you ask people, what do they care about? And they're talking about the border, for example. That word wasn't mentioned at all at any point tonight in any of their speeches, Shapiro, Harris, Walz. They didn't mention foreign policy. They didn't mention energy policy. I'll tell you one other name was a lot about Trump and there was a lot about Vance. We didn't hear the name Biden once. So, when you're out there saying that you just won the nomination and you get a big round of applause for winning the nomination, well, how did that nomination get won? It was actually the sitting president of the United States. It's the leader of your party who went out and got 14 million votes. And at the end of it, that person ended up getting replaced over the course of the last couple of weeks. And now Kamala Harris becomes the nominee.

But we're going to start-- the blue wall originally was the 18 states, the phrase that I coined in 2009 for the 18 states that have voted Democratic, ultimately in all six consecutive elections from 1992 to 2012, the most states they'd won that often in the party's history. In 2016, Donald Trump dislodged three states from the blue wall --Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by a combined margin of about 80,000 votes. And that's really become the focus. Trump won them in part because he held Hillary Clinton to utterly miserable numbers among working class white voters in those states. These are states, Abby, that are preponderantly white. Eighty percent of the voters in Michigan, roughly 80 percent in Pennsylvania, ninety percent in Wisconsin. And of those white voters, half or more in each of those states are whites without a college degree. Trump dominated among them, that's why he won those states. Four years later, Joe Biden improved. These numbers aren't great, but if you notice, they are all significantly better, except for Pennsylvania -- six, seven points better. That allowed him to win these three states by 250,000 votes. It's going to be hard for Harris to match Biden's numbers, but she probably doesn't have to. The states are continuing to evolve. Like other states, the non- college white share of the electorate is going down. The Democratic vote in the suburbs is going up, but she does need Tim Walz and his kind of cultural affinity to help her stay reasonably close to these numbers. She can't afford some erosion, but if she goes back to the kind of level that Hillary Clinton was at in 2020, it's very hard for her to get there. And once again, it's worth noting that if she wins those three states and all the other states that Democrats won by three points or more, plus that one C.D. in Omaha, she gets to exactly 270 electoral college votes, that's where they're hoping that Tim Walz will help the most.",
