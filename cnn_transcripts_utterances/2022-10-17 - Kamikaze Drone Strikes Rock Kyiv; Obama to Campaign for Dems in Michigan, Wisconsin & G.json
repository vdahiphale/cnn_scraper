      "sentences": "Good morning, Brianna.Well, we're standing right near the site of one of those blasts that woke up Kyiv residents at about 6:45 this morning. They've actually now pushed us back from the site, because this is an ongoing rescue operation. Ukrainian authorities now saying they've rescued 19 people. At least three people have been killed. And they believe there may be more people in the rubble back there. And I want to stress, this is a residential building that was hit this morning by these Iranian drones. Ukrainian authorities saying that one of the drones had written on it, on the debris that they discovered in Russian, \"(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE),\" \"for Belgorod,\" basically. Essentially saying that it was in revenge for attacks on the Russian side of the border that Ukrainians have not officially claimed responsibility for. Now, there had been a huge amount of activity here up until just a few minutes ago. Then we heard the air-raid sirens again. Understandably, a lot of people have moved away from the area. Because this is a place right in the center of the capital. It's also a place with a lot of critical infrastructure. And it is been hit many times last -- in the last week. Last Monday, I just want to show you over there. Scotty McWhinnie can pan up to that building, which again, you can see windows blown out. The facade seriously damaged after a barrage of missiles hit the capital last week. And so the fear here now, really, for people living in Kyiv is not only about these new kamikaze drones and the threat that they bring with them, but also that the targeting now really seems to be specifically geared towards civilian infrastructure. We spoke briefly to the mayor back at the site there, Vitaly Klitschko. He said, Listen, they want to try to get us before the winter, to freeze people, to hit power, to hit heat, to hit energy plants and things of this nature. So definitely, a grim new chapter in this war, Brianna and Alex, with Kyiv, the capital, very much once again at the center of it.",

We were both here at the beginning of the war, when central Kyiv was regularly coming under attack and, certainly, the suburbs of Kyiv were very much the focus of Russian attacks.But in the past few months, it has been relatively quiet. Life has gone back to normal. So this is a significant development. What's interesting in terms of the psyche of the people of Kyiv, this is something I also asked the Mayor Klitschko about. And he said, you know, they do it to try to intimidate you, the Russians that is, but actually, the effect is to make people angry, to make people want to fight harder. And so it remains to be seen whether this is a tactic that is going to continuously be implemented. We've heard already from Ukrainian authorities saying, Listen, this is why we need those air defenses to help bolster our existing infrastructure and air-defense systems. Because at the moment, they say they intercepted in the last couple of days, 37 of these kamikaze drones; 15 intercepted this morning that were headed for Kyiv. Obviously, four managed to hit and detonate. And they want to do whatever they can to try to mitigate the threat of this new weapon.",

This is a nonprofit, John. AVLON: It is. And that's the key here. There are certain basic constraints on nonprofits, which are tax-exempt, right? They can't be self-dealing, and they need to stay out of partisan political campaigns. But the fact that the -- an investigator in the attorney general's office is flagging this for the IRS means this is not the last we've heard of it. We have seen a pattern where conspiracy entrepreneurs keep spreading election lies, that really metastasize in our politics. But they are constrained primarily by legal action. And that could -- this could be the first step towards that. Because this group, as you see from the complaint, has promised massive amounts of information, failed to produce anything, but has dramatically influenced the national conversation around false claims of mass voter fraud, but especially in Arizona, where all four of the state-wide Republicans right now back those election lies.
