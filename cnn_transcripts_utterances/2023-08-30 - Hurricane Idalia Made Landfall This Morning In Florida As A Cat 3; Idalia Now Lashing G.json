I'm waiting on an official assessment from down there, just to see what happened. So I really don't know what kind of surge we had. I have heard through the grapevine that one house was destroyed for sure. Other than that, I'm not sure until we get official word. We just have so many trees down. Our sheriff has just asked everyone to stay put, stay off of the roads, and until they can clear some of these big trees.

But you know, oddly enough, we're known as the tree capital of the south. As I'm hearing all of these reports, we have so many trees down across all the roads. And I've had so many people calling me, can you give me help so I can get out. We have our work crews out and we're doing the best we can, but it's going to take a while to clear this mess up.

And what's concerning is, we have that high tide still right around late afternoon, 4:00 p.m. The water here has gotten so deep that we've seen two boats now from Citrus County Rescue hit the water. We've also seen two groups of different people be rescued, pulled out of neighborhoods in here, pulled out with their belongings. We've seen a dog be rescued alongside this group as well. They're then pulled out to U.S. Highway 19, which is behind me. A lot shallower on that side. Then they can get to emergency vehicles, get any other assistance that they need. [13:45:08] But these rescues have been ongoing now for more than an hour. We expect that to continue since we can still hear in the distance these boats going up and down the street. Now I am told that, if water levels rise on this side of the street, where I'm standing, six more feet and cross over Highway 19, homes on that side would be flooded. Really a great concern here. So much worry from residents, even before landfall, as to the damage that could have been sustained all because of this surge flow. We've seen businesses have been boarded up. A lot of people evacuating and leaving their homes. But still some that decided to hunker down and see out the storm, now needing to be rescued alongside their belongings.

We know you have a lot to handle, a lot of people to take care of there. What is your biggest challenge right now? MAYOR JOE MEEK, CRYSTAL RIVER, FLORIDA (via telephone): Thank you so much. We appreciate you being here in the community and highlighting the situation that we have going on. As we were concerned about, the biggest issue now obviously is dealing with the storm surge. And we're right in the middle of it as we speak. Some of the indicators that we're seeing right now is the water starting to recede slightly. However, high tide is not until around 4:00 p.m. But with that being said, that doesn't necessarily mean the water will continue to rise until then. What we're seeing now is somewhat of a -- the water receding slightly. So that is good news. The bad news is most of the city right now is under water. We're a low-lying area. Our base elevation throughout our city is anywhere from three to five feet above sea level. And so we're experiencing a significant surge right now anywhere from seven to nine feet. And so most of our roadways are under water. As the gentleman was just saying, there's individuals that are being rescued. We have Citrus County and Crystal River Fire and Rescue that are out. I just stepped off of an airboat a few minutes ago, went through the city. I will tell you that, for the most part, it doesn't appear that there are folks that are -- a lot of folks that are needing assistance right now. I think a lot of folks heeded the issue. We've been talking about it over the last few days, had a mandatory evacuation throughout the city now for two and a half days. I think people were mostly prepared. But our biggest issue right now is dealing with the surge. Hoping that it starts to go down relatively soon. Obviously, once the water goes down and recedes, it's dealing with all the issues that's brought about.",

And then as soon as that is safe, of course, open it back up to residents to come in. We're very obviously susceptible to tidal issues. It's not rain/water- type flooding. It's tidal. Once this surge recedes, we should be able to get in there very fast. To your point, we are very fortunate. I think we're used to dealing with these types of things with storms and floods. But folks this time saw I think the severity of the storm and the track that it was taking and took it serious. I know a lot of folks throughout the city in the past may not have taken it as serious. But they did this time, which was very fortunate. We got a lot of folks that got their belongings up to higher ground and that did evacuate. Some, of course, did not.
