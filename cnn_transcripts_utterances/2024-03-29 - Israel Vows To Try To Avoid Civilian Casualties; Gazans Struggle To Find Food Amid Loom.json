Israel says it has eliminated about 200 of what it calls terrorists since the siege began. Israeli forces are also conducting military operations in and around Al-Amal Hospital in southern Gaza. They say they've discovered hundreds of weapons and apprehended dozens of terrorists. I spoke earlier with CNN military analyst Lieutenant General Mark Hertling and asked him what a military occupation of Rafah would look like and how risky it would be for civilians. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, from the standpoint, the first thing you got to consider, Michael, is what's the enemy doing there. And Israel is claiming that there are four battalions or more of Hamas operating from inside or underground Hamas, and especially that there are many senior leader, Hamas leaders there, including Sinwar. And as well as the potential for the 130 plus remaining hostages. Now, Israel believes these are the last remaining Hamas strong points within Gaza, even though they'd still been fighting in Khan Yunis. So, what you're talking about is the potential for a massive operation. The Israel started an air campaign in that relatively minor air campaign on Monday, but you're going to see them looking to destroy complete the destruction of Hamas in this area. And it's going to be very tough because as you said, there's a hundred -- 1.2 million people living above those subterranean tunnels and shafts that are in this area.",

The International Court of Justice says the catastrophic conditions in Gaza continue to deteriorate with famine setting in.It's demanding Israel do more to get humanitarian aid into the territory, that includes access to food, water, shelter and medical supplies. Israel is criticizing the decision as, \"cynical\" and blames Hamas us for the situation in Gaza, accusing the group of commandeering, hoarding and stealing aid. Meanwhile, the U.N. humanitarian group is appealing for large scale aid deliveries into Gaza by land. The group says Israel must open more access points and supply routes. The U.N. reports more than 1.1 million people are struggling with food insecurity. Now, after hearing about famine in Gaza, you might find this next story infuriating, it is about an absurd amount of food waste. More than one billion meals are wasted every day. At the same time, nearly 800 million people go hungry around the world. The startling statistics coming from a new United Nations report. It says households, restaurants and other services throw out about a fifth of their available food, with 13 percent of the world's food lost between the farm and the dinner table as well. Most wasted food ends up in landfills and breaks down into methane, a greenhouse gas that fuels climate change. All right, let's talk more about this with Dana Gunders, the executive director at ReFED, a nonprofit dedicated to ending food loss. She joins me from Truckee, California. Good to see you.

For an adolescent girl, it's three-and-a-half thousand people to a shower so that the conditions, the dignity being denied these young women is kind of like we haven't really seen before.

I've seen cities now that are unrecognizable. I go with colleagues who are drivers who've lived here their whole life, who cannot work their way around their city because the landmarks which they would have used are simply gone. So everything continues to get worse. Two days ago, I was in the north and I was looking back at footage realizing that there is some footage I can't share now because a child in that footage has now died of malnutrition and dehydration. So unfortunately, Michael, everything (INAUDIBLE) we warn when you have these sustained attacks, a lack of aid, a lack of a ceasefire, remembering a lack of a ceasefire also means the hostages aren't going home.

He said I made a series of bad and bad decisions, the judge said, he has never expressed remorse for what the harm he has caused these victims.Some victims have said their entire life savings were wiped out. Others said that they needed the money at the time for medical reasons. They couldn't use it because it was it was gone. So the judge focused on that and also Bankman-Fried's own testimony during the trial and that of his co-defendants in the case who had pleaded guilty, saying that Bankman-Fried viewed everything as the proposition of taking risk. And the judge said he was playing the game here, that the risk of him getting caught was less than the risk of him getting away with it. And that is why the judge said he needed to make -- to take him out of the game by that sentence. And that quote you read is so spot on because the judge was saying he needed to make sure that Bankman-Fried couldn't do this again because he even noted that once FTX filed for bankruptcy Bankman-Fried was already starting to spin a new narrative, and the judge said that Bankman-Fried needed to be he sent to prison and get this message. So when Bankman-Fried's prison term is up, he will be 57 years old. He's 32 years old today. And you know, his parents were there in court as they have been throughout so much of this case.
