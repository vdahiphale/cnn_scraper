CNN reporters and correspondents are following the sprint to the finish line right now covering the key races in all the major battleground states across the United States. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's begin our coverage this hour in Pittsburgh with CNN's Jessica Dean. Jessica, control of the Senate could come down to Pennsylvania. Both Mehmet Oz and John Fetterman are out on the campaign trail tonight. What do we expect to hear from them?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, we're hearing their closing arguments to voters here in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania as Election Day is now upon us. We have Mehmet Oz, who is trying to cast himself as an independent voice, as a moderate. He has been enforce bid former President Donald Trump. He appeared with him at a rally over the weekend, but didn't say his name, didn't say the name of the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Doug Mastriano, either. He really stuck to his script that we have heard from him, really pitching independent and conservative Democrats as well.In the meantime, John Fetterman really trying to cast Oz as a phony, saying that he is not who he says he is. Fetterman saying instead to voters that he is the person that has been in Pennsylvania, that while he had his stroke back in May, it knocked him down but he got back up, and that's what he'll continue to do. That is the message that we have heard again and again from both of these candidates as they try to make it to the finish line in this race. It is a super tight race. As you mentioned, Wolf, it could very well determine the balance of power in the U.S. Senate. And that's why so many people are focused on it, to the extent that it is the most expensive Senate race in the country, some $146 million in television ads between Labor Day and tomorrow. And that just gives you a sense of the flooded airwaves here as everyone really looks to Pennsylvania to see what the voters -- and it will be the voters -- decide. Wolf?",

And Republican Challenger Herschel Walker will be here right outside Atlanta, in Kennesaw, the critical piece of Cobb County, to rally Republicans tonight.But, Wolf, it is clear, as Jessica was saying, Pennsylvania is the most expensive race, this is the second-most expensive. And Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock is one of those Democratic incumbents who is very worried about the economic headwinds, the inflation concerns that have really complicated his path to re-election. But they are feeling confident on the eve of election here, largely because of the early vote. 2.5 million Georgians have already cast their ballots. But that means there are a few million more to do so tomorrow when the polls open at 7:00 A.M. But, Wolf, Republicans are trying to nationalize this race. They're trying to tie Senator Warnock directly to the policies of the Biden administration and President Biden himself. That's what Herschel Walker has been repeating over and over, really connecting him to the president. For Senator Warnock, he's trying to disqualify Herschel Walker in the eyes of voters. But so far, that's been not as successful as they had hoped. Wolf, this race on the eve of the election is as tight as any in the country. But one difference here, this could still go into overtime. If neither man gets over 50 percent, a runoff is on December 6th. Wolf?",

      "sentences": "Wolf, that question gets at the challenge for Democrats, 435 House elections all on a new map because of redistricting. But let's look at the current state of play, which gets to your point. Right now, this is the balance of power on the old House map. The map stands, though. Republicans need a net gain of only five seats, a net gain of only five seats to take the majority. The average in a first presidential midterm election, if you go back to President Reagan, the average since then is 30, so, Joe Biden trying to defy history to keep the House. How do we look at this? Let's look at it this way. Let's look at the seats we have identified through our partners at inside elections as the competitive seats. We have 82 of them across the country. And, Wolf, it's hard to see while on T.V., but 57 of them, almost three times as many Democrats defending in these competitive districts as there are Republicans.That tells you everything about the map. They go coast to coast. They go from Maine to Southern California. There's a Democrat in Alaska. So, the Democrats have to prevent a net gain for Republicans when the historical average is 30. That's upending history. And, again, these races, a lot of them in the suburbs with Democrats of all stripes from East Coast to West Coast, so the House challenge is enormous, the president asking to defy history. Let's just switch over quickly and look at the Senate as well. If you pull up the battle for control of the Senate, again, the Democrats cannot afford to lose anything. Right now, it's 50/50. The vice president of the United States breaks the tie. The Democrats have to hold all of their races. Actually, let me look at this way. It's more interesting when you come this way. This is how you ranked them, right? And so you have a tossup race where Jeff Zeleny just was. Perhaps the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent is out in Nevada. This is a Republican-held seat at the moment. The incumbent is not running. The Democrats can't afford to lose anything right now, Wolf. If they picked up Pennsylvania, they could afford to lose one. Republicans think they can get more than one. The Republicans think they can get Nevada, they think they can get Georgia and they actually think they can hold Pennsylvania. And they say, watch New Hampshire, watch Colorado, watch Arizona. So, the Republicans certainly have more options on the table, if you will, when it comes to the Senate. If you come back to the original map, the Democrats simply can't afford to lose anything. If they get Pennsylvania, they can afford to lose one. That's a very narrow margin you have to live in.",

I believe it took into a second or third week even. So, we may not know the final margins. In the House, Jeff Zeleny just mentioned, we could have a runoff for the Georgia Senate seat. We may not know the final numbers for sometime but there will be early clues.Number one, there are two competitive House districts in New Hampshire. There's also a very competitive Senate race, the Democratic incumbent, Maggie Hassan. If Maggie Hassan is in trouble early on election night, if Democrats are losing those House races, that will give you the net first clues, if you will. Then you come down, four competitive House races in Pennsylvania, where you also have that key Senate race. If the Democrats are falling in those House districts, that likely spills over into the Senate race. So, we may not have a final number for some time, Wolf, but as we get through the 8:00, 9:00, close to the 10:00 hour tomorrow, we're going to have a lot of clues from these competitive House districts right here. And, again, a number of those competitive House districts overlap the Senate races. It might take a while to get a final number. We'll have clues very early.",

But if you look at all the data in the last ten days, two weeks, even a little bit longer than that, it has trended back to Republicans nationally.Then, though, you have to ask the question, and the dynamic, every one race of these can be hand-to-hand combat. Dana and I were just talking before we came on. In a very tough tea party environment a few years back, Jeanne Shaheen kept her Senate seat in New Hampshire. Why? Because she had a personal brand. I have been in Pennsylvania in a couple of the key battleground House races.

What do Democrats need to do? Get out their voters and get out complacent voters. Get out voters how might have gone for Joe Biden in 2020 and now they say, I don't have to go vote right now or I just don't like anybody.

He's also projecting confidence that he'll be able to get the votes to become speaker and that he's also going to have the support of both the MAGA wing and former President Donald Trump. Wolf?",

These are very tricky things to do inside a caucus that's going to be that divided. I'm going to keep an eye on that.But I'm also going to keep an eye on what Joe Biden is likely to do. If the House goes Republican, which it is, I think the Republicans will probably win the Senate as well. Will Joe Biden come out with an agenda and challenge the Republicans to do something comprehensively on immigration? Is he going to challenge them to do something comprehensively when it comes to whether they raised the debt limit and what could the reforms be? These are the things that I'm interested in seeing, whether Biden wants to get back to the way Biden was when he ran and whether he tries to label the Republicans obstructionists if they don't cooperate.

And so he just can't stand it, in which case he might want to jump in there and just belly flop and just mess up the party for everybody else.I do think if he does that, it will send a shockwave through the Democratic Party and say, listen, we're about to be back in the same mess we were just in two years ago. But, listen, who knows? I mean, he's winning just right now, the fact that we're talking about him. This is what he wants.

That video got millions of views on social media, it was even shared by one of the then- president's son but it turned out to be totally bogus, totally false, but a lot of people use that as the idea that there was something wrong with the last election.
