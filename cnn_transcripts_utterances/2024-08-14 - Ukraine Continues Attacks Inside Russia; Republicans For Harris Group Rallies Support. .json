Thousands of lifelong Republicans and former lawmakers shared their stories and made their case for putting country ahead of party. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLIVIA TROYE, FORMER U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICIAL:  As a firsthand witness to the chaos of the Trump presidency behind closed doors, I can say this. We cannot go back. AUSTIN WEATHERFORD, NATIONAL REPUBLICAN ENGAGEMENT DIRECTOR, HARRIS/WALZ CAMPAIGN:  This is no longer the party of principles, and it shows. REP. ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL):  If we can defeat Donald Trump, then we can go back to the luxury of arguing about policy. FMR. REP. JOE WALSH (R-IL):  So if your neighbor, a Republican, doesn't want it to beat Trump's party, Trump's got to lose, and he's got to lose by a lot, and that means we Republicans have to vote for the only person who can beat him.

And he thinks that he can win them over by insulting the rights that they fight for every single day.This is not uncommon. The fact of the matter is that he has always sort of pretended to be about the working class, but then given big tax cuts to the wealthy and really given big corporations the upper hand when it came to those very fights that are happening at the bargaining table and on the shop floor. So I just think it's going to fall largely on deaf ears and this is more of a media conversation than something that's happening. And, sure, there are conservative union members that will vote for Trump, but the question is, is he reaching the undecideds? And that's the type of thing that tells me absolutely not.",

And it's a state that's been a perennial battleground now since 2008, when the Obama campaign did an amazing job of not just organizing, but really catching a North Carolina Republican state party asleep.It's been close ever since. And what we have seen is, time has been invested by Donald Trump and certainly by Joe Biden as president, Kamala Harris as vice president, spending a lot of time in the state. And I know Harris is going to go back as well. It's a critical battleground. I'd say two segments of voters are really important here, one, Hispanic voters. It's a very big, growing part of the state. Republicans and Democrats, for that matter, would be very smart in investing more resources in Hispanic media. Two, African-American voters. That makes a lot of sense. It's a high population of the state, but specifically young African-American voters. What Barack Obama was able to do in 2008 was, he was able to turn the 11 HBCUs in North Carolina into absolute turnout machines. And that's something that is hard to replicate. But if Harris has this real enthusiasm and can match it with the organization, that can make a difference in the state that was the closest one that Joe Biden lost just four years ago.",

Russia's Belgorod region on the border became the latest to declare a state of emergency, as fighting has forced thousands and thousands of Russians to evacuate. A warning:  What you're about to see may be disturbing. CNN senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  A Russian attack gunship firing at Ukrainian forces from the air in the Kursk region inside Russia, while, on the ground, a Russian soldier's bodycam records what appear to be several killed Ukrainians near their destroyed armored vehicle, the Kremlin trying to show its forces are halting Ukraine's advances. But the reality is this, more Russian civilians having to evacuate their towns and villages as Kyiv's troops press ahead. \"We left the chickens at home,\" this woman says. \"We gave them two bags of grain, some water and left. Maybe there will be nothing to return to.\" What seemed to be Russian prisoners of war transported in a Ukrainian pickup as a Ukrainian soldier spray paints the Ukrainian spelling of a town's name inside Russia. Kyiv's lightning offensive caught not just its allies off guard, but Moscow as well. Russian President Vladimir Putin trying to publicly brush off Ukraine's incursion, meeting with the head of the Palestinian Authority in Moscow after earlier berating his generals to oust Kyiv's troops from Russian soil.

And I think that could be part of it, changing the narrative with this really outrageous military step by Ukraine. There's no question that this is a real dilemma for Putin. People who are being moved out of those areas, the Russians who are being moved out of those areas, on social media, you can see they're saying they feel abandoned by the government. They're not quite sure where they're going to go. This is a real problem for Putin. And the people who are being brought in, the forces that we understand, a lot of this is unclear, are being brought in to fight against the Ukrainians are conscripts. And conscripts are young guys who are just brought into the military, not very well-trained. Their parents are worried about that. So I think, on a social level, this is a real problem for Putin.",

His response is a counterterrorism operation. That too is kind of softening it, trying to make it seem as not as big a deal as it actually is, very similar -- remember, at the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, he said, it's not a war. This is a special military operation.

There's still a lot of lack of clarity about what the Ukrainians are up to, and that is probably part of what they're trying to do, keep it as opaque as possible. Keep the Russians trying to figure out, how do we respond? Where are those Ukrainian troops? It's a very, very important, I think, step in this war. And, Wolf, we can't lose sight of the fact that Vladimir Putin right now is the first Russian leader since World War II to have foreign troops fighting on his soil.
