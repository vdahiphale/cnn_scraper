Donald Trump is not in Washington even though he says he wants to be. He's in New York because he is forced to be today. His historic trial picks back up soon with testimony from the man who bought and buried unflattering stories about him before the 2016 election, David Pecker, we've been talking about. He has not testified yet about the deal specifically with Stormy Daniels, and that likely changes today. We're learning that before the day is out, Stormy Daniels herself could take the stand.Any minute, we're expecting to see Trump leave Trump Tower for a second time already this morning. You're on probably cup of coffee number one, and Donald Trump has been out and back to his apartment like several times. CNN's Alayna Treene and Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic are standing by with much more at all this for us. Joan, let's start with you. This is the Supreme Court matter, of course, at hand.

      "sentences": "Sure. Good morning, Kate and John. It's really a historic day with an untested question -- can a former president be completely shielded from criminal prosecution for actions he took while in office? Now, this does come from the Jack Smith charges brought on behalf of the Department of Justice. The United States here alleging fraud, obstruction, denial of the right to vote, things culminating with the January 6th, 2021, attack on the Capitol.Lower federal court judges rejected Donald Trump's claim of immunity here, saying whatever protection he had from criminal prosecution while in office dissolved once he was out of office. But this is an untested question. The Supreme Court has in the past ruled that a former president can be immune from a civil proceeding, civil damages, but never addressed the weightier situation of a criminal context. Both Donald Trump and Jack Smith, their lawyers point to history, the Constitution, both saying that it works in their favor. For Donald Trump's side, he says separation of powers. The idea that the three branches are independent of each other means that judges cannot sit in judgment of the former president, whereas Jack Smith argues that there was never any kind of criminal immunity foreseen by the framers of the Constitution. And he points to a more modern day precedent, and that involves former President Richard Nixon who was forced out of office in 1974 because of his actions during the Watergate scandal and his own effort to try to ensure his reelection back in 1972. But in 1974, after he was forced out, then President Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon. And that pardon, Jack Smith argues, was a recognition that Nixon could have been subject to criminal prosecution if he had not been pardoned. So those are the dueling arguments the justices will hear. But bottom line, this trial of Donald Trump in this particular case has already been postponed since its original March start date because of this detour to the Supreme Court. And we'll probably see a ruling by late June. Kate, John?",

Donald Trump admitted that today he went and visited the building site for JP Morgan where they're going to be building a new headquarters in New York. He met with some working class voters, construction workers, as well as teamster union members.And this is really him, despite New York being overwhelmingly having voted for Joe Biden in 2020, this is him trying to salvage some of his campaigning and looking ahead to November, despite all of the legal battles that he is facing. Now, one really interesting thing just to touch off what Joan was speaking about is that even though Donald Trump is in New York for his criminal hush money case, he's very focused as well on what's going to be happening at the Supreme Court today in Washington. And at one point, while speaking with reporters, he even said he wished he could have been in Washington, D.C., instead, and that the judge was keeping him in New York. Take a listen to how he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  We have a big case today. The judges are allowing me to go. We have a big case today, the Supreme Court or presidential immunity. A president has to have immunity. If you don't have, you just have a ceremonial president. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The argument that his attorneys have consistently made and something that I know that Donald Trump has repeatedly complained about in private is that he really does believe that he had immunity because he was president at the time. And this is something that he really is hoping he can continue to drill into voters' minds, that he essentially did nothing wrong because he was immune. Of course, we're going to hear how that plays out today. And obviously there's a lot of people who argue that a president doesn't have total immunity. He can't just do anything just because he is present. But this is something that Donald Trump is really hoping is successful for him today in Washington.",

Donald Trump expected to leave there shortly. Testimony resumes there shortly from David Pecker, the man who ran \"The National Enquirer.\" When we last heard from him, it was really a cliff hanger. He had just begun talking about Karen McDougal, the former Playboy playmate, and his efforts to bury stories about her. This gets into a very important subject areas about what Donald Trump did and how he did it to keep stories from going public, and he could testify about Stormy Daniels later as well. There is more news, though. Breaking overnight, new charges in Arizona against several of Donald Trump's closest associates who were trying to overthrow the election results there. Former chief of staff Mark Meadows is among those charged. Now remember, Cassidy Hutchinson worked for Mark Meadows, and she spoke to CNN overnight.

That's what he -- his action show those is he is not for the American people, he is for himself. He is willing to go to whatever ends necessary to make sure that he is not put in prison like he is currently facing and that the American people don't know the truth about him.

They don't apply and you go and you take what you want and he has lived his life that way and he has gone very, very far with that. Now, he sits in a courtroom in the criminal court building in New York, and he is subject to the control all of the court, he has to sit silently. A man who offers himself as peerless is forced to sit there and wait for a jury of his peers to render a judgment about him and listen to really, really difficult  testimony and I think that you can see that it is wearing on him, that he doesn't like to be confined in that way. He doesn't like someone else to have control, but at the end of the day, what matters most is what happens and there is some mystery as to what happens at the end of this process. If he is a convicted felon, that's going to have material impact on him moving forward. If he should have a hung jury, which could happen, it could have the reverse effect and it could be the beginning of his way out of this legal morass that he is in because he will use it to taint all of the other cases.

Now, he is trying to pre-spin this trial and this judge is trying to contain him in that and with this gag order. Now, good luck with that, because he knows they are not going to put him in jail. The fines are sort of de minimis and he doesn't seem to worry much about that. What he is really interested in doing is telling his counter story about the judge, about the jury, the New York Democratic jury, about the prosecutor. So that if this thing goes bad, that he has pre -- he has prepared the public for his interpretation of events. So you know, this is -- I mean, I don't think anybody would say, hey when we make ourselves a defendant in a criminal trial leading up to the Republican convention, that would be a great run-up, we will get a lot of attention. But I think, he is trying to make the best of what is a terrible situation here by setting up the kind of thing that we saw before the 2020 election and his supporters will buy it. The question is, are the people who are on the bubble, those folks who voted for Nikki Haley in Pennsylvania the other day, for example will they buy it?
