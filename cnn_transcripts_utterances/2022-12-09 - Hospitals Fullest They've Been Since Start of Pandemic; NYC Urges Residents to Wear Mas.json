And for the last two years, the capacity was around 70 percent.This week, it jumped up to 80 percent. And that jump really happened a lot in the last two weeks. We saw about an 8 percent increase in the past two weeks. The only other time where beds were 80 percent full was last January with the height of Omicron. And at that point, we saw this 80 percent number. In fact, in some states, it's even worse. Rhode Island, we're talking above 90 percent beds are full. In eight other states above 85 percent.

We have seen higher hospitalization rates now, according to the director of the CDC, than at any point in the past decade for this time. You just reported on those recent numbers, 120,000 hospitalizations,overall, over 7,000 deaths. But add to that RSV, which we reported on a lot, particularly in the pediatric population. And then there are other factors. So there are workforce staffing shortages affecting hospitals. And they affect the places where we send patients. So we send patients to nursing facilities and rehabs. If they don't have the staff, we can't discharge patients from the hospital and you get a backlog. In addition, there's also a delay in people who didn't get care during the pandemic, who are now seeking care for their procedures or other illnesses. And so all of this together has created this situation where we're just seeing elevated high levels of hospital capacity.",

Here's the picture, year to year, some improvement, but wholesale prices still rose more than expected last month.And that is tamping down hopes that Americans will soon get some relief from the highest inflation in decades. The pessimism also reflected in this new CNN poll that shows more than half of Americans believe the economy is still in a downturn, only 17 percent believe it's starting to recover. CNN's Harry Enten is here to break down the polling. But first, Matt Egan is joining us to walk through the new numbers. It's not all doom and gloom, right?",

That was crushing consumers and freaking out economists and investors. That is really not the case anymore. It is cooling off. Now, today's report focuses on whole wholesale inflation. This is inflation before it gets to consumers. And it showed that wholesale prices jumped 7.4 percent year over year in November. The good news is this is the fifth straight month of cooling inflation by this measure. Also, this is the lowest annual rate of inflation for this metric in a year and a half. I think the problem is the pace of improvement has been disappointing. This was hotter than expected. People are still feeling this high cost of living. Maybe not as much at the gas station because they've come down but they're feeling it at the supermarket. And there's nothing about today's report that will dissuade the Federal Reserve from continuing to bump up the cost of borrowing.",

And 49 percent of Americans say they are worse off than they were a year ago. Compare that to when we asked this question last year, only 33 percent of Americans said they were worse off. But also keep in mind that the worse off number, 49 percent, is about equal to about the same, 34 percent better off, 16 percent, which adds up to 50 percent. So kind of a mixed picture, right? But why are Americans concerned about the economy at this point? It all comes back to the cost of living. So very concerned about cost of living. And 63 percent of Americans say they're very concerned. The other thing I'll note here is the 42 percent who say rising interest rates. So it's cost of living and as well the rising interest rates, which is why Americans feel not so fond about the economy at this point.",

This is a sign that people need cash. They're having some trouble making ends meet. Also we're seeing another reflection of the spike in interest rates which, of course, has driven up the cost to get a mortgage. It's impacted home values. And so a recent report from research firm, Black Knight, finds that over 250,000 people who bought homes this year alone, they already owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth.",
