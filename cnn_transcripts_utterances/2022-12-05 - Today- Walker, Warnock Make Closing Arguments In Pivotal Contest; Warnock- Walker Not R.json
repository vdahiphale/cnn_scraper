Tomorrow, voters settle the Senate runoff that will complete the new balance of power here in Washington. Today, Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker get one last chance to make closing arguments.Plus, throw out the constitution. Donald Trump says, he should still be president and it's worth ripping up the country's founding document to make it so. Top Republican sadly, are again mostly silent. And a remarkable reemergence, Paul Pelosi attends the Kennedy Center Honors, his first public appearance since an attacker brutalized him inside his San Francisco home. Up first for us, one final day of campaigning in Georgia. Today, closing arguments take center stage. Tuesday tomorrow, voters settle the Senate runoff, pitting the Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock against Republican Herschel Walker. A democratic Lynwood deliver President Biden a 51-49 Senate and some critical breathing room in a divided Washington, with an $80 million spent on TV ads in just a month. And today, a pair of new ads. It meant to leave one last impression. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): I don't work for the big oil and gas corporations. I work for you. I don't work for the big pharmaceutical companies. I work for you. I keep fighting until every child has a chance, until every veteran has the benefits that they deserve, until women know that they're in the control of their own body. GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA): This is going to be a turnout elect. Who's more motivated? Is it them or us? That's right. And that's why it's time to retire Raphael Warnock instead Herschel Walker to the United States Senate. (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: CNN is live on the ground tracking both campaigns. Jeff Zeleny is with the Walker campaign today. Let's begin though with CNN's Dianne Gallagher, live in Atlanta following the Warnock campaign, Dianne?",

He's going to have his fellow Georgia Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff also newly elected member of Congress from Florida, Maxwell Frost, the first member of Gen Z to be elected to Congress.Now, the Warnock campaign going into Tuesday feels good, although the candidate himself has been warning his supporters not to celebrate before they reached the end zone. Looking at some of those more than 1.85 million early votes that have already been cast, breaking them down, look roughly 30 - roughly, I'm sorry, a third of them come from black voters. It's actually a larger percentage by just a few points than was back two years ago. In that runoff election when Warnock won his first bid to the Senate. We're looking at some of that, especially in terms of the seat latest CNN poll that you referenced there. When black voters in Georgia, likely black voters were asked who they preferred, they said Warnock 96 to 3 percent for Herschel Walker. And so, look, this is something that the campaign has paid close attention to. But again, we're also here on a college campus. You can see the students starting to come in here. Older voters have had a much greater turnout here. But during a gaggle with my colleague, Eva McKend yesterday, we're not told her, look, I'm not giving up on college students. I'm not giving up on the youth vote. It is important to him. I've attended several events for the senator at college campuses.

This is Senator Warnock on the campaign trail yesterday saying look, people of Georgia whatever you think, whether you're Democrat or Republican, he says Herschel Walker simply not up to the job. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. WARNOCK: Now, I'm not mad that he doesn't know what he's talking about. I'm mad that he doesn't know what he's talking about.

I mean, that's those are the sort of the two-bound argument, character and incompetent. And listen, in so many ways, Herschel Walker has himself made this argument, very easy for the Senator Warnock campaign because of his own utterances on the campaign trail. And you can tell that they feel like sort of the best messenger for Herschel Walker. Isn't necessarily Herschel Walker, it's Lindsey Graham, who seems to appear next to him on many of the ads, you know, many of the commercials he does, or appearances he does on Fox TV. And then even in this closing argument, it's not Walker who's making the argument, it's Kemp who's out there speaking for them. And you know, listen, partisans will show up and vote down the line, most likely, but I think his main problem. If you're Herschel Walker, you have to look at independents. In our last poll, independents are backing Warnock, 61 percent to 36 percent and that's what they're hammered. And I think if you're - the Warnock campaign really trying to reach out to voters.",
