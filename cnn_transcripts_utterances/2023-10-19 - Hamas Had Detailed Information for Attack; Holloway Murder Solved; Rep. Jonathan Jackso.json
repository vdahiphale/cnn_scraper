He is now getting ready to give a prime-time speech to the nation tonight. Biden expected to push for wartime aid to both Israel and Ukraine. It is a big, encompassing speech. It is going to be about American values and what these wars stand for. The president hoping to deter wider escalation. Right now, the Israeli military says there has been a, quote, significant escalation, not in Gaza, but by Hezbollah in the north, coming from Lebanon, in a growing battle there. The IDF says Hezbollah has fired numerous anti-tank missiles from Lebanon into Israel, where there has been a massive buildup of Israeli forces along that northern border. They also say that Hezbollah forces have attempted infiltrations actually physically into Israel with forces. Meanwhile, pro-Palestinian protests continue across the Middle East and, frankly, around the world, in the U.S. and Europe. The demonstrations ramping up since the hospital explosion in Gaza, even though Israel has denied responsibility for the blast and provided evidence to make that clear. We are learning that the precision of Hamas' assault on Israel, though, was no accident. In fact, we've got video and documents obtained by CNN that show that the militant group had a shocking amount of detailed information about the Israeli communities where they slaughtered more than 1,400 people. In fact, you just heard the IDF moments ago telling us they found two people last night in an attic in Be'eri. A mother and child huddled together burnt to a crisp. And the material, we understand, includes detailed attack plans, specific information about security and homes and even the best places to hold hostages. Now, we do caution you that some of the images here that we've obtained are graphic. CNN's Matthew Chance is live in northern Israel with more this morning. So, Matthew, I guess let's just start with how Hamas got all this information and, obviously, you know, what it is. And, clearly, it took a long - a long time to put all this together.",

After the attack, Israeli first responders saw bullet holes and bloodstains in room after room in what looks like a coldly, methodical killing spree. CHANCE (on camera): But while hundreds of Israelis were killed, some Israeli communities managed to repel the Hamas gunman and save lives. At kibbutz Mefalsim, also near Gaza, residents pushed back at Hamas attack and found documents on the bodies of the militants they killed with disturbing, highly accurate intelligence on their homes (ph).

Even with detailed intelligence on their targets, not every Hamas objective was achieved. Nearby kibbutz Sa'ad wasn't even attacked, although we now have documentary evidence that Hamas intended to inflict the maximum possible human casualties there, and to hold hostages. A highly detailed street map found on another Hamas gunman, and obtained by CNN, shows individual buildings inside identified and accessed for their military value. The communal kitchen, for example, is described as the main place suitable for holding hostages. Inside the guard room, the soldiers must be neutralized, the Hamas instructions say. While the kibbutz dental clinic is designated a place for first aid for both enemies and friends. Israeli residents of Sa'ad say they also found that level of detail astounding. SARAH POLLACK, KIBBUTZ SA'AD RESIDENT: Shockingly, the details are very accurate. The map is a map of our kibbutz. It's very accurate. It's horribly accurate.

It is a dark turn. Even for a group seen here parading before the attacks that's come to symbolize the uncompromising face of Palestinian resistance and violence against Israel. Israeli officials say a document referencing ISIS and al Qaeda, which CNN has not been able to authenticate, was found on one Hamas gunman killed during this attack on kibbutz Be'eri. The document, given to CNN by a senior Israeli government official, praises jihad against Jews and crusaders. Israeli officials say that's evidence Hamas is in increasingly influenced by global jihad ideology, an assessment many experts have dismissed. But in the wake of the unprecedented brutality of these attacks, U.S. officials tell CNN the Hamas threat may now be reassessed. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

JONATHAN JACKSON (D-IL): What I'm focused on is the fact that there should be an immediate cease-fire. I agree with the United Nations secretary general and a growing body of people that want to see hostages released, want to see humanitarian aid sent into the Gaza Strip. That's our focus right now. We want to have a de-escalation of the violence. And so what we're seeing is mounting death tolls, maybe 1,400 Israelis that have been killed, over 3,000 Palestinians. And as the Israeli government gets ready for a ground offensive, we're very much concerned about, how do we protect the life of innocent civilians. Hamas is not the Palestinians. The two need to be separated. This was an intelligence failure that we first have to address. Currently, I'd like to see stronger defense provided for Israel. I'd like to see justice, if you will, for the humanitarian efforts, for the - those in Palestine. A million people have been dislocated in the last week, in the last 11 days. They have to get aid. Water is running short. Food is running short. And there is medical equipment, there is medical supplies at the border that cannot get into the Gaza area. The people are really caged in now.
