The southern border is wide open. We are seeing as many as 2,500 individuals a day coming into our country illegally. We've seen about two million come into our country as got-aways. So we don't even know who they are or what their intentions are to cause harm in our country. And the speaker himself took a delegation of 50 members to the southern border, Eagle Pass, Texas, ground zero, just last week. Everyone returned home and had these discussions about how horrible the conditions are, how terrible it is. We've spoken to law enforcement. We've spoken to CBP. My question continues to be, is that -- it is an imminent national security threat. So what are we willing to do about it? Right now, because of the spending issues coming forward again -- because they've been mishandled, quite frankly, for the last several years. This is our opportunity to serve our country in the way we all promised to. And that is to secure it first. And we must tie security to our southern border, to any type of funding.",
