The move coming as Trump ally Steve Bannon is sentenced today to four months in prison for defying his subpoena.Also, today, President Biden makes a new pitch to voters and a new prediction as well. He claims the momentum Republicans are seeing right now will tilt back to the Democrats in the final days before the midterm elections. And Ukrainians removed the last bodies from the largest mass graves found in a key eastern city. This as Ukraine is accusing Russia of planning to attack a critical dam to create a large-scale catastrophe. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get right to our top story tonight the January 6 Select Committee's truly historic subpoena of former President Donald Trump. CNN Senior justice correspondent Evan Perez is digging into details for us right now. Evan, so what is the committee specifically ordering Trump to do?",

The January 6 committee is asking for the former president to turn in -- turnover that -- turnover a broad range of documents by November 4, and to come in and sit for a deposition with committee staff and some members of the committee on November 14. And they say that the former president, of course, was at the center of a historic effort to overturn the 2020 election.In justifying this subpoena, they point out, and I'll read you just a part of the letter that was sent by the chairman and the two chairs of the committee. They say in part, you are at the center of the first and only effort by any U.S. president to overturn an election and obstruct the peaceful transition of power, ultimately culminating in a bloody attack on or on Capitol and the Congress itself. Wolf, they're asking for a broad range of documents, I'll read you just a part of the list here. They say they want any calls and any calls that were made by or directed by him on January 6. They're asking for records of calls to members of Congress. Records related to the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, communications that were looking to block certification of the January -- of the 2020, election, communications about Mike Pence, and of course, anything related to the destruction of materials. And as part of these communications, one of the things that really stood out is the list of people that they're asking about. People like Mike Flynn, who was of course, the former national security adviser of the former president remained a strong ally of the former president was a key part of the effort to try to get the overturn of the election. And to push these fraud claims. People like Roger Stone, Steven Bannon, of course, Rudy Giuliani and Jeffrey Clark and John Eastman. These are two key architects and allies of the former President, as he was trying to find desperate ways to remain in power in those days after the election. Wolf.",

He has said, at least on his social media platform that he is prepared to come in and do a live interview with the committee, of course, the committee is not prepared to do it that way. The other option for him, of course, Wolf, is to do what he has done before, which is to say that the committee is legitimate, and to try to fight this out in court and run out the clock because he knows that this committee is facing of course, the end of the term here coming up at the end of -- following the midterm elections and come January, it is very likely that they will not be around",

That is for national security purposes, that communication by the President to anyone is secured and encrypted at all times. Here, we're seeing in the subpoena, that there's a deviation. They're asking for information from platforms such as Signal, which is an encrypted platform, but it's open to the public, it's private, non- government use. So to me, that's really telling you that there's something of evidentiary value that the committee may have that indicates that the former president was communicating outside of, you know, typical norms for a sitting president.",

He got a subpoena from the House. He didn't show up. He didn't have the protections around him, that people who were serving in the administration might have more broadly. And so he was convicted. Today, he got his sentence, but he's going to appeal his team is promising this. There's lots of legal arguments that can arise and there's lots of things the courts can do.

I want to bring CNN Medical Correspondent, Dr. Tara Narula. Thanks so much for joining us, Dr. Narula. Why are we seeing the significant surge in these RSV cases right now? And do you think this is the peak right now? Or will things get worse over the coming weeks? DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, I want to take a step back to pre-COVID and exactly what Brynn said. I mean, pre- COVID, this is a virus that most Americans were infected with before the age of two. And while it doesn't confer lifelong immunity, it gives you some immunity. And that helps you so that the next time you see the virus, you're less likely to get sick. Now, what's happened for the past two years is all of our mitigation strategies have essentially created a new ecosystem for these circulating viruses, a situation where we're seeing a change in the seasonal occurrence. So we're seeing the onset potentially much earlier. And we're also seeing what we call an immunity gap. We have a whole cohort of children who never got exposed to the virus, and now they're seeing it and they're potentially seeing it at older ages, when their reactions may be different than how they got exposed at a younger age. We also know that moms may have been less exposed because of the mitigation strategies, and therefore, it did not pass across the placenta antibodies that may have protected infants. So for all of these reasons, we potentially think we're seeing some of the search. Now as far as what might happen in the coming weeks, I think nobody can really predict. We certainly hope that we will be seeing the peak soon. And it'll come down before winter, but even more reason to emphasize the importance of getting the flu vaccine for children and the COVID vaccine so that we take off some of the pressure on the hospital systems that we're seeing, and we decrease the potential severity of those illnesses, should children get infected with the flu or COVID.",

Certainly, if you have a young infant, they may present with irritability, decreased feeding, decreased activity, or even breathing problems.Absolutely, if you see your child struggling to breathe, their nostrils are flaring, they're breathing from their belly, you can see their ribs or their neck muscles straining, or they're not staying hydrated, you can't keep liquids down or food down, that's a sign that it's time to take them to the emergency room.
