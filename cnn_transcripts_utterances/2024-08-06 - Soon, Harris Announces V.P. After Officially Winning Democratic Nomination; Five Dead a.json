One thing I will say, well-manicured lawns, very bucolic, but no signs as so far as we can tell of any movement inside.Let's get right to see it in Chief National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny. Jeff, I saw you looking at your phone right before coming to air. It got me excited. Any new information this morning? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  John, always checking for new information, but as of yet, there is not. And this is by design. As M.J. was just saying there, the campaign is intentionally doing a bit of a slow roll out this morning. I am told that this decision is likely to be in a matter of a few hours, more than a few minutes. We will see if that holds. But this is why they're trying to build anticipation and they're trying to allow supporters to get the news first through their list, through their emails and through that video phone call. We're all thinking back to four years ago when the video was released of Joe Biden then calling Senator Kamala Harris, it's actually four years ago this week, to make that offer through a Zoom phone call. I'm told to expect a similar type of arrangement. But, look, all eyes are on Minnesota Governor Tim Walz this morning, as well as Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, talking to a variety of Democratic strategists, advisers, campaign officials overnight. And this morning there is a split among who would be the better choice. So, this is Vice President Harris' choice and hers alone. There is no doubt that here in Pennsylvania, these 19 electoral votes are central to winning the White House. So, that is why Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is seen as a leading contender. However, I'm told that he will be at this campaign rally tonight here in Philadelphia either way. And he is likely to campaign for this Democratic ticket either way. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz really was a late bloomer in this accelerated search for a running mate, coming on very strong with support from progressive groups and moderate groups as well. He was at a campaign fundraiser last night in Minneapolis. You know, showing that he too can help raise money for the campaign and be helpful. So, John, at this hour, this is the vice president's choice to make. I am led to believe she has already made her choice. She has just not told many people about it. You need some time to set this into motion, of course. But it's the biggest decision she will make as a candidate, and we'll see what she does, I'm told, in likely a couple hours.",

Jeff, very quickly, in about 30 seconds or less, she really didn't deal with a Democratic primary. In a way, the whole V.P. selection is something of a primary.",

We've really seen divisions in the left as well as across the spectrum of the Democratic Party coming out in favor of one of the candidates or actually against some of the others. In Pennsylvania, Governor Josh Shapiro has been at the center of a campaign, where progressive Democrats have been urging her to pick someone else. What we do not know is if that sort of encourages her to follow their lead or perhaps to show an independent streak and choose Governor Shapiro.Again, thinking back to when in the summer of 2008, when Barack Obama made his choice of Joe Biden, he said it was a coin toss. There were a lot of good options. So, Vice President Harris, who's been talking with former President Obama, we know, in the last few weeks, seeking guidance on this, this could be a coin toss for her as well. John, it will, though, say something about what she believes the future of the Democratic Party is and her electoral chances are, whichever governor she decides.",

So, people here are used to flooding. But when you think about the preparation for amounts of rain they're talking about, you can see the sandbags on the outside of someone's home right here. More than 50,000 sandbags were passed out just as an area that when you think about the tornado that hit Edisto Beach and Seabrook Isle, that's about 50 miles away from here, you know that people are taking precautions when it comes to this, because they obviously are worried about all the excess rain that will be coming this way. If you look this direction here, you can see that waterway out there. That is not too bad in terms of where you can see the rain has not been falling in the last few hours or so. And on top of all this, what we've been told by emergency management, they want to make sure people don't try to drive through areas like this because we've seen people get stuck in the past. That's not happening right now. Take a look at this video from overnight. You can see some of those tornado hit zones. People were talking about just how it sounded. That train sound coming through the area with that heavy rain, this unrelenting rain that could be hitting over the next few hours and something people are worried about. Sara?",

But experts are warning that we could see a lot more volatility in the next couple of months until really September, when the U.S. Federal Reserve could cut rates.Now, the reasons why the Japanese stock market in particular, which was the hardest hit, and the Asia stock markets have recovered so quickly are really twofold. The first reason is we received a better than expected service sector data for the month of July from the United States. That's alleviated some concerns about there being a possible recession in the world's largest economy. Now, the second reason is because the value of the yen depreciated just a bit, and the yen looks as though it's beginning to stabilize. On Monday, we saw the yen surge against the greenback, in large part because the Bank of Japan just last week raised interest rates for the second time in 14 years. Interest rates are now at 0. 25 percent, which doesn't sound very high, but the reason why Japan is raising rates and not cutting them, like many other countries are around the world, is because it looks to prop up its currency. As you know, John, the yen has been depreciating significantly this past year, and that's been very costly for the country. So, again, the Bank of Japan looked to raise rates and therefore prop up the currency. And it's done exactly that. But the sudden surge on Monday really spooked investors and hedge funds, which is why we saw some of that panic selling spree. But, again, as the yen looks like it's beginning to stabilize, and now it's trading a bit lower at around 145 to 146 to the dollar, that has alleviated some of those concerns. Now, we can expect the U.S. stock markets to open slightly higher. There is cautious optimism there, but we can expect to follow trends in Europe and in Asia. But, again, there is cautious optimism and all eyes are on the Federal Reserve come September to see if they will really cut rates. John?",
