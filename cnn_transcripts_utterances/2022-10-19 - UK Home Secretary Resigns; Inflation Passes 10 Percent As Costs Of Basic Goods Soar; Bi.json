The Home Secretary resigns, thrusting the British government into further chaos. And President Biden announced his plans to release another 15 million barrels of oil from US government reserves. And Netflix shares spike after the company adds more than two million more subscribers. Coming to you live from New York. It is Wednesday, October 19th. I'm Zain Asher, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Tonight, the British Prime Minister's Cabinet is in turmoil as her Home Secretary resigned. Suella Braverman said that she is stepping down for sending an official document from her personal e-mail. In her resignation letter, she took responsibility for the mistakes. She also wrote that pretending we haven't made mistakes is not serious politics. Clearly, a jab at Prime Minister Liz Truss who had just appeared in the House of Commons where she was defending her record. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Prices are rising sharply amid all of the political uncertainty. Increasing costs for basic goods drove inflation over 10 percent in the UK in September. Food prices rose almost 15 percent in the past 12 months. Housing costs were up nine percent and transport prices rose almost 11 percent.

The economic instability from the mini budget was bad enough, when we don't know who's going to be the Prime Minister in a few weeks' time, when we see the governing party divided in several ways, that political instability results in bad government and poor economic policy.

It's not just goods, it is services. It is things like transport and rent that you are talking about. And so they are more like the US than the Euro area. You can't just say it is food and energy. So, the Bank of England was arguably already behind the curve on raising rates before the Truss-Kwarteng mini budget blew a further hole in policy. So, I think the Bank of England has a long way to go, the market seems to be pricing in what they call a terminal rate, meaning a peak rate around four percent. I think they're going to have to get closer to five percent, meaning continuing to raise rates well into mid-2023.",

It is possible, we may end up with a program that is much more contractionary than the one the bank looked at to set policy in late August, early September before the political mess. So, you're looking at a much higher chance of recession and a near certainty in my view of recession in the UK in the next year.

They basically recovered all those losses, so we're back to where we were. You know, this is not entirely new. The President said back in late March that that he would release 180 million barrels of oil from the reserve. They were about 15 million barrels shy and now, they're going to go and do what they said they were going to do. I don't think that we shouldn't expect a dramatic impact here for consumers, but I think this does speak to just how laser focused the administration is on this issue. I mean, if gas prices go up, that makes inflation worse, it lowers consumer confidence, it upsets voters, of course. So, they don't want to see that. They want to do everything they can to try to keep a lid on prices. And you know, they've been using the emergency reserve more aggressively really than any of their predecessors. I mean, this reserve is down by about 34 percent since President Biden took office in January of 2021. It is actually at the lowest levels since 1984. A time when, of course, the US economy was much smaller, and demand for energy was smaller as well. But that also speaks to the fact that we are in this unusual circumstance where one of the world's largest producers of energy, Russia is involved in a war in Europe, and the United States, and the EU, and a lot of other countries are punishing Russia. And so, there is a lot of uncertainty about what happens to Russia's energy flows, and I think that is another reason why the President came out and made this big show of finishing this 180 million barrel release from the emergency reserve.",

But I think, you know, of more significance rather than the Martial Law inside Ukraine that Russia has imposed, it is the security measures that have come alongside that inside Russia proper, along the border, the provinces there, border with Ukraine, they've really tightened up security, basically, something very close to Martial Law there as well with travel restrictions in place, vehicle checks, a lot more presence of the military. There have been a lot of attacks from inside Ukraine into those border areas, and so I expect this reaction to that. But also elsewhere across the country as well, deeper to the east towards Moscow, elsewhere, provincial leaders have been given the authority to impose restrictions of that kind whenever they see fit, and it is not been exactly made clear what restrictions will be put in force in places like Moscow. Though the Mayor of Moscow says that he doesn't expect that the tempo of everyday life for Muscovites will be affected. But nevertheless, this is clearly a demonstration by the Kremlin. They're not prepared to back down, they're going to double down, which is what they're doing and if anything, tighten their grip on the country, particularly in the aftermath of the upsurge in criticism that has been experienced here because of the succession of military defeats of the Russian Armed Forces on the battlefield.",
