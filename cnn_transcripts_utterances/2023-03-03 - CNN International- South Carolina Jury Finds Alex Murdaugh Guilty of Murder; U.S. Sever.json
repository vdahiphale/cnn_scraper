So much testimony, but certainly a couple things stood out, both coming from Paul Murdaugh's cellphone. One was the kennel video which put his father, Alex Murdaugh at the time of the murders at those dog kennels on the property known as Moselle.For many, many months Alex Murdaugh said that he was not there earlier in the night with his family and only found them there dead at the kennels and that's when he called 911. But at least 10 witnesses say they heard his voice on the video and finally he took the stand and admitted being there. There was also the video -- the Snapchat video that Paul Murdaugh sent to friends on Snapchat at 7:56 p.m. and that showed him wearing -- showed Alex Murdaugh wearing long pants and a blue shirt. Later when he saw investigators, he was wearing shorts and a white t-shirt. So of course, the state said that he had washed up and changed clothes after allegedly killing his family at the time. Now we know that the jury has found him guilty of both of those murders. Randi Kaye, CNN Walterboro, South Carolina. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

More than 180 flights departing Texas were canceled. The storm sent parts of buildings flying and knocked out power lines -- or power to more than 260,000 homes and businesses across Texas. That number is now down to 140,000. A tornado also tore through Alabama. The National Weather Service in Huntsville said peak winds reached about 110 miles per hour.

And that includes tornadoes, damaging winds and the potential for large hail. And that threat is going to continue as we push through the remainderof the day Friday. But we just notice the threat area begins to shift farther to the east. Now you are talking focal points like Cincinnati, Nashville, even down toward Atlanta, Georgia and Mobile, Alabama. But the threats remain the same. So here is a look at the focus for the storm in the early portion of the day Friday. This system will gradually make its way off to the northeast. As it pushes into the Great Lakes and northeastern portion of the country, you've got a lot of colder air in place. So, a lot of that rain is going to transition back over into a rain/snow mix and in some cases even some ice and snow filtering back in. Overall, the heaviest rain is going to be along the Mississippi River Valley, not out of the question to have two, three, even four inches total. And heaviest snow is really going to be across portions of New England where even in excess of a foot is likely across some of those areas. Widespread flash flooding however is still possible. States like Arkansas, areas of southeast Missouri, and along the Ohio River Valley as well. You're talking a very tremendous amount of rain in a short period of time. Another very widespread concern is actually going to be the wind. And the key thing here, is that it's not just while the storms are occurring. Even after that line of storms moves through, a lot of these states are going to continue with some pretty significant wind gusts up around 50, maybe even as high as 60 miles per hour. Yes, even after the storms exit the region. For estate like Georgia for example, the wind advisories will linger all the way until 7:00 p.m. in the evening on Friday. But the main focus again for Friday is still going to be that lingering low pressure system.",

So, that's what Blinken had to say.But Moscow's version is a bit different. Lavrov pointed out they said that it's a total lie that there was a discussion on the sidelines on Paul Whelan, there was no talk of it. They did admit to a discussion between the two. According to the U.S. it lasted about ten minutes. But according to Moscow, there were no negotiations. Now unfortunately for India that sees itself as leader of the global south of developing and emerging countries, they were hoping for consensus on a lot of issues. There's been an impact of this war of course, which we all know of. The, you know, price rise in terms of energy and food, and that's something they wanted to focus on. But unfortunately, this entire G-20 talk of these ministers -- foreign ministers -- was hijacked by the war of words between the U.S. and Russia. And it did continue even Friday morning.

Unquote. The diplomatic rift continues to deepen between China and the U.S. with the U.S. saying again and again China is considering sending lethal aid to Russia. Beijing continues to deny those claims and then accuses the U.S. of pouring lethal weapons into Ukraine. China also continues to claim it is neutral despite that no limits alliance with Russia. On Friday of course there was the peace planned position paper with 12 points that was released which had no mention of the fate of occupied Ukrainian territory. And that plan was endorsed by a key Putin ally Lukashenko who visited Beijing this week. But that plan was also widely criticized by Western leaders who accuse China of already siding with Russia. So, Max, very little wonder that at the end of this G-20 meeting in New Delhi, there was no consensus statement. China and Russia they refuse to condemn Russia's invasion. Back to you.",
