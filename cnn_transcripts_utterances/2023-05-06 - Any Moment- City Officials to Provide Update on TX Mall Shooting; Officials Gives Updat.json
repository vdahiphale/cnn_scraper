And many, many people in that mall were able to see this to witness not just the shooter, but also the victims. That's what we've heard from a lot of the victims that were the witnesses that were at the mall. Now we also have Dash-cam video of the moment that the shooter gets out of the car at the parking lot in the mall, and then opens fire I do want to warn you this video is graphic. But here is the moment when he gets to the mall. He's in the car you see him then getting out of the car now this video does not have sound, but he does begin to shoot towards the mall. There are witnesses who say they've heard and saw exactly what happened in those moments. Of course it was extremely traumatic for the many people that were in that parking lot that were in the area and that also were at the mall and had to experience the before and the after. We have another video of someone who was also in the parking lot and heard those gunshots. In this video you can actually hear the first five gunshots or it's unclear exactly when they happen but in the video, those are first five gunshots and then you hear a lot more gunfire after. This is again another disturbing video but I want you to watch and listen to all of this and the commotion that happened after.",

So of course we started calling local hospitals and there is one hospital group that said they were treating 8 of the victims, those victims ranging in ages 5 to 61. They said all of these victims were being treated at Trauma facilities. Again, we're waiting to see if those are all of the injured or there are more and that's what we're likely going to hear from police are hoping to hear from police in the next few minutes or so. But again, a lot of witnesses who say they were traumatized and who big picture here also say that they're terrified of going to a mall because of what they went through. Many who said they had to go to back rooms and hide who had to get help from people. And again, unfortunately many who also saw the shooter and the victims Paula.",

So we will continue talking until that happens and let you hear from that briefing once it starts here in Allen, Texas. But we have learned from a law enforcement source here tonight, that of the 9 people that were transported to hospital for treatment for their wounds.Two of those patients arrived had passed away when they arrived at the hospital. So that, at least 2 confirm dead, that is going to be in addition to the number of people who lost their lives here at the outlet mall, in Allen, Texas. So we'll continue to sift through the details of these numbers. And obviously, all of these numbers pertain to family members who are hearing just awful news here tonight, from law enforcement officials as they continue to sift through the crime scene to kind of give you a sense of where we are. The shooting scene in that H&amp;M store that you've heard so many people talking about is just beyond these law enforcement vehicle lights that you see there. And this is an area that is still cordoned off, as law enforcement investigators continue to comb through the scene, and they have secured the entire situation here. But as we mentioned off the top there, Paula, of the 9 people that were treated at local hospital for their wounds 2 of those people died, were already dead when they arrived there at the hospital. So we're waiting to learn more about just what is the number of victims that were here at the scene. And what is interesting in speaking with witnesses over the last few hours, you know, some of those initial shots where we're told we're fired around that H&amp;M store. And the place where we believe the victim of the gunman was taken out by the Allen police officer was basically around the corner some distance away from where that initial shooting erupted. So the question kind of becomes, you know, was there some sort of chase was this a situation where the law enforcement officer was chasing the suspect? Or was this person already on the move to another location to carry out more shooting, you know, all of this very difficult to kind of sift through and these details very difficult to sift through as we've talked to people who were in this vicinity, when the shooting happened just before 4 o'clock central time, this afternoon. So Paula, we continue to wait here we were told that city officials will be holding the briefing at city hall with the police Chief and other city officials.

Some people say the shooting lasted for what felt like them 20 minutes or so other people have told us that the shooting lasted one to three minutes. So that kind of discrepancy is rather striking and I think really speaks to the trauma. The intensity of trying to process something so horrific watching, literally people lose their lives in front of you while you're doing something as simple as going to an outlet mall for shopping with your family. The other thing that has been really striking is the number of people who are just running for cover ducking into whatever area they could.

We'll be holding a vigil at Cottonwood Creek Baptist Church here in Allen. Just got a phone with Pastor John Mark Caton and this church which does such a wonderful job with so many others in the faith community and wrapping their arms around this community and loving on and supporting people in their time of need. Tomorrow will be a great night of healing a much needed night of healing and hope. I was on scene today was in constant communication with Governor Abbott and our Speaker Dade Phelan who have offered their full support of state government. They have been on the phone with Steve McCraw, Executive Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety. The state government stands ready to assist our wonderful Police Chief Brian Harvey and all of our local officials really law enforcement agencies at all levels in responding to this tragedy. They are true heroes and I saw that firsthand today and so we remain committed to praying for.

Allen is a proud and safe city which makes today's senseless act of violence even more shocking. However, I want to commend our police and fire departments for their quick response. Their thorough training not to hesitate to move toward the threat likely saved more lives today than what we could imagine. We also want to thank all of our surrounding municipalities and law enforcement agencies for offering their assistance at the scene. This collective effort is what makes our North Texas communities united. We know the days ahead will be difficult in somber. While remember the victims of today's shooting, we want to convey our appreciation for the condolences and notes we are receiving from all over the world. I have received calls from the White House, Governor Abbott, and many other national, state and county officials who have reached out to the City of Allen to express their support in desire to help the Allen community in any way possible. On behalf of our city council, our law enforcement personnel, our first responders and all of our city employees, we will remain strong and stand united.

I think there were a lot of people here in this community who were desperately anxious to hear or at least to see the opportunity to ask questions as to how much we know about to this current situation and how all of this is unfolding?So it's a little stunning to be honest, there weren't any kind of moments for questions in the situation. But we will have to take and continue to work on getting everyone as much information as we possibly can. But, you know, significant news and clearly devastating news 8 victims killed. 6 of those died here at the outlet mall scene, 2 of them died when they were taken to the hospital when they arrived, they were already dead when they had arrived at that hospital. There are 3 patients in critical condition, 4 others that are in stable condition. So it really gives you a sense of just how much pain and damage was inflicted. We don't know exactly the amount of time that all of this lasted. But in piecing together some of the clues from what we've heard from witnesses, the many of the victims were initially shot by an H&amp;M store, which is just beyond these lights that you see behind me and from what I've been able to gather, but the gunman was shot and killed around the corner in front of a place called Fatburger. And that is where we believe that the Allen police officer took out the gunman is neutralized as city officials here have been saying. We don't know exactly what transpired between the moment the gunmen attack the people they're coming out or in that H&amp;M store vicinity area. And then getting to that other location within the small but you can imagine how chaotic and how confusing that must have been. Especially considering that, you know, early on and all of this, there were several victims who were saying that they thought that there were 2 shooters. And that really kind of speaks to the confusion in the in the chaotic moments of what we've heard. But you know, at least the situation here under control. The investigators say they do not believe there is anyone else or any other gunman involved in all of this and that the gunman who was responsible for this attack has been shot and killed here at the scene. But beyond that, officials here tonight not were offering much more information or much more clarity as to what they've been able to gather in the hours since the shooting happened, Paula.",

It doesn't take very long before you have multiple fatalities in a situation like that.They didn't mention the type of weapon that was used. We heard it was an assault weapon would have been nice if he had verified that. But apparently, you know that officer was there on another job. And, you know, the timeline wasn't really concrete. But it definitely was not a long period of time, like we had heard from some witnesses in the chaos and a trauma, you know, time gets distorted tremendously. I'd also like say that you know, an officer, and you're running towards the sound of gunshots in a situation like that you've got a stream of people coming out. It's like swimming upstream, because they're trying to get out you're trying to force your way in. And so that officer just displayed a tremendous amount of courage to go in there alone. Continue to move towards the sound of gunshots and actually kill the individual responsible. So that was good job on his part. REID: And Steve Moore, I want to bring you in.

So I want to treat this though, as someone who is still looking for information that will be relevant to this. Nothing was mentioned about the type of gun as Chief Ramsey said.The name of the gunman was not mentioned, it would be by now in most normal circumstances, he's dead. And he has no privacy right at this stage. And if we don't know who he is, we can't learn more about him and what he's doing? The exact timeframe between when he entered, and when he was shot is still not totally clear. I mean, it's shorter than an hour we had heard at one stage hour, that timeframe is irrelevant, because it goes to the lessons learned about the capacity of a certain type of gun, but also what we will tell people to do, if they are in an active shooter case like this, if someone's able to bring down a 6 or 7 people in just a few moments, you know, I'm not sure running is going to be the best if they even have that choice, it seems futile. And fourth, the ages of the dead, at least some range should have been given by now. I'm not sitting here second guessing the response. I'm saying the six hours later. This is the basic information that the community and the nation would want to know at this stage. We don't you know, lots of nervousness about talking about guns this soon after, but I think the gun will be relevant if only to begin to talk about a culture that someone glorifies a certain kind of gun, and we don't have to change any laws, if everyone could just agree like, this thing isn't, there's no joking around about it. No pictures, no culture wars, nothing. This is a serious weapon that kills that is just devastated. Dozens and dozens of people today, it's not just the dead, I mean, just think of the concentric circles of children and partners and parents and everyone who is impacted by each of these individuals dead.

I just think that at this point in time, a little more information could have been given out, but then I don't have access to all that.

So again, we do not know if that say 5 year old is still alive. So we are hoping to get that kind of information from authorities. I do want to point out, I've been speaking to our colleague, Josh Campbell, who's a Former FBI Agent, and one of the things that he was telling me is that the shooter is dead. So it is going to be a lot more complicated to find a motive here, because he says, yes, you're going to have search warrants of his house of where he lived. And you're going to have to comb through a lot of the social media, but he is dead. So it is going to be a lot more difficult to find that motive. And something Josh pointed out was that maybe we'll never have that motive. But I will echo that frustration from our colleague, Ed Lavandera, who's there in Allen, Texas, the fact that they're not taking questions from reporters. I do think that's a critical part in a situation like this, you need to allow reporters to ask those questions, because now we're left watching these videos, listening to the witnesses and trying to piece together all this information as we talked to sources and make calls.

This is the weird thing about this press conference. It's having, you know, sort of Uvalde vibes, I mean, that in terms of you just there's no reason I should be suspicious. And I just think, just say what the gun is, we're going to find out what it is? And whatever the politics of the gentleman who were at the state at the --, it doesn't matter what in the sense that this is just facts that we just need to know what the gun was, because it will tell us something about access, it will tell us something about maybe we can reform laws if the Texas legislature is in session right now. But I think as importantly, and you know, if we can't solve laws, we can solve culture. And I think that's important for people to hear. And we know what the polling looks like on guns, we know that the American public is pretty unified on basic gun safety gun measures. I have no qualms talking about it today, because I probably won't get a chance to talk about it tomorrow because there'll be another mass shooting. And so the issue that we should talk about is just the performative culture wars that are around guns. Now, if we could tone if that could be toned down by gun advocates, then a lot of this then there'll be a unified mission to say these are really serious weapons that are killing 7,8 people in just a matter of moments and the impact that will have on so many around them. I think that if we can begin that that's clear and by hiding the name of the gun, they are being political, not us. They are being political.

So all it means that an incident command will be set up, you may, you're searching lots and lots of resources, the locality and then surrounding areas, the state, and then federal government, as we see in terms of the FBI presence, to stop the event care for those who need care.And then, of course, investigate this case, this isn't over, obviously, for the community, I mean, in terms of its impact across the board. And it's not just physical impact, mental impact, the economic impact as well, for these communities, for the shutting down for some period of time, have a major area of commerce that also impacts communities, people's jobs. These are all the consequences of guns in our society right now. And each of them needs to be discussed. It's not just a number count. It's all of it.",

So there are people all over the country who he might have communicated with. And the FBI will be sending out leads to find these people and door knock them at 2, 3, 4 in the morning, because there is no spare time on this case. And so nationwide, there's going to be a large law enforcement activity, trying to fully understand who this guy was? How he got his weapons and whether he tipped his hand at any point? And did anybody know about this? And do nothing about it? There's so many things that we need to know and we need to know in a hurry.",

And he's like, no, it's probably just construction or something. And then like heard 10 to 15 more shots go off.And so I ran to the front of the store. And we're like, no, that's shooting and we see the guy. There's this guy dressed in all black, wearing a vest has an assault rifle. And he's just shooting at people. Right across, he was at like Francesca's area, shooting at people. So we got everyone in the store at the back of the store and just camped out there.

You know, if it's an outdoor scene, if there is bad weather coming in, they've got to figure out how they can, you know, do something to kind of protect the scene? So they'll go through that pretty carefully. So they don't have to run the risk of having evidence wash away or anything like that.But there'll be at it all night, however long it takes. I mean, you got 8 victims here you got, you know, 6 of them there at the scene. You've got the shooter there at the scene. So yes, they've got a lot of work to do. So they'll be going at it all night long. And as Juliette mentioned earlier too I mean, like with the weapons by now, they've already traced it. They know it may, where was it purchased originally? Was this a private sale? I mean, how this guy got his hands on the gun? I mean, they're going to trace the history of it. And they're going to talk to every individual along the way, if he's not the original purchaser of the firearm. So there's a lot of information they could have provided. I mean, the first press conference, I could understand that it was very much information at all at that time that they could verify. But at this point in time, they know it could be a little more detailed, unless they haven't really gotten their hands on, you know, certain critical individuals that might have some valuable information, friends, relatives, things like that they still want to be able to interview that I can understand that giving the name of the shooter up.

And the weapon unless you've had some kind of serial number removed, something like that, that's not going to be very hard either. What's going to be time consuming is mirroring the computers that he had getting warrants, getting access to all his social media?And you know, sometimes you have to send agents out in San Francisco out to Silicon Valley to serve warrants for that kind of stuff. So this can all be very complicated. I don't see why the weapon, the type of weapon has not been released. But it's, you know, it is a time consuming investigation.

So fortunately, you do have a joint response to this type of situation.So a department like, Allen, that's probably limited in terms of the number of personnel, I don't know how many people have, but it can't be that large of an agency. They'll have a lot of help from federal, state, local departments that will take some of the load off them because you know, we're looking at the mall right now, 911 calls are still coming in for other issues in that particular city. So you can't strip your entire department on one case. And that's why it's so important that you have mutual aid agreements.

But what has been found in safety and security, that sense of helplessness, that many people probably find themselves in situations like this or just gun violence. Generally, the counter to that is action is to actually commit not it doesn't even have to be political, but helping in ways whether it's volunteer or assisting victims and ways in which you can actually empower yourself. That's what the data shows us that engagement is actually good. We've talked a lot about mental health issues and crime on air, and these kinds of guns violence and engagement whether rather than withdrawal is absolutely necessary. But again, the numbers are most important, obviously, in terms of those dead, and those injured. But the circles of harm, that one incident on one night and on a Saturday in Texas is going to have for years and years to come and those are immeasurable.",

We have to as a culture, we have to start having reasoned, respectful conversations on both sides of the issue, and finding points of agreement. So that we can not only deal with mental health issues, not only deal with hardening these targets, because there will always be some kind of weapon.
