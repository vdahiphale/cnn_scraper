      "sentences": "And there's the scene in Gaza at 10 o'clock in the evening. You can see the red of the fires burning as theyhave for several hours. We will get into many details as to what caused it, how many explosions and the current situation. It is day three of the crisis that was sparked by the deadly attack on Israel by Hamas. The fires light up the night sky and will continue to do so for many hours. It's only 10 o'clock. So one assumes there is much more military activity from the Israelis still to come. Good evening to you. I'm Richard Quest in New York. We will have all the coverage of the events of the day. A few moments ago, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu said near constant airstrikes on Gaza, the sort of thing you're witnessing just now are only the beginning of Israelis response. If you want to see what it's like, this is what it was like earlier in the day, the sheer number of strikes, and the explosions taking place in Gaza. They have been raining down, you can see the explosions individually there, and then other one, over the course of the day and across into the border. CNN teams have been watching Israeli military equipment move into the area all day ad that raises the specter -- a real specter of a ground invasion, which would appear to be preparing for, although of course, that's by no means certain. Israel's Defense minister has ordered a complete siege of the Gaza Strip, depriving it of electricity, fuel, and food but it is believed water is still being allowed. And the number of people who have died on both sides in this war is rising sharply with every update. Israeli officials say the attack by Hamas killed at least 900 people and Palestinian officials say nearly 700 have subsequently died from the strikes on Gaza. Hadas Gold is in Jerusalem. You listened and your simultaneous translation of the Israeli prime minister gave us a good understanding. What was the important bit of what he said?",

He called for opposition leaders to immediately sit in an emergency unity government, the likes of which was seen on the Six-Day War saying they should do so without any preconditions because we do know that at least one of the opposition leaders, Yair Lapid, had called as one of his conditions that they lose the extremist elements of this government like Itamar Ben- Gvir, like Bezalel Smotrich. But Benjamin Netanyahu calling on them to sit with him without any preconditions. He also said right off the outset, he said that the rest of the world is seeing what Israel knew Hamas to be like. He said Hamas is like ISIS, saying that they have committed atrocities against civilians, against children, against the elderly, against the disabled. But then he did say that while their response in Gaza will continue, he said that Israel will only win if its people are all united altogether.",

There are a lot of families who are angry, who feel as though they haven't been -- the families of the missing who feel as though they haven't been contacted or have been -- that have had enough support from the government. People questioning, you know, why did a massive military response to the border region takes so long in their eyes? And so I think he's trying to shore up support for the Israeli government, rally people around the Israeli military, because that is something they're going to definitely need in the days ahead. Three hundred thousand reservists have been called up, a lot of families in Israel, not only directly affected by either knowing somebody directly who was killed because in a country of nine million, having 900,000 people killed means most people know somebody who was affected by this.

When the Israeli Defense Forces have targeted and they've targeted -- and I think it's -- I think it's important to state this point, precision weapons in the past. They have literally banged knocked on the door. They call it knocking on the door. They use a small charge on the roof of the building to make sure until the residence basically has got two minutes or whatever the time is to get out of the building before we hit that building. And we've seen some of the targeting here over the past few days. This is not mitigating against civilian casualties that are civilian casualties. The numbers are in the hundreds. These are big numbers. They're not insignificant. They're civilians. They're not Hamas. Hamas hides amongst the civilians. But what the Israelis typically have done here is collapse infrastructure with precision targeting. It's that knocking on the door, that small charge on the roof of the building telling people they need to get out. If that is not being used, this is what Hamas is telling us about. And one takeaway I've got from this, Richard. Since we were first became aware of this threat by the Qassam Brigades by military wing of Hamas and Islamic Jihad have said a similar thing. Since they said that a couple of hours ago, I think we haven't heard as many airstrikes. I think the airstrikes have gone down. I think we're in one spot. I can't tell you what's happening across the whole of Gaza. I've heard artillery rounds going in. Smaller and perhaps that is beneath the bar of the warning and threat that Hamas is giving. We don't know this is terribly tense, terribly tense. The threats are real, the stakes are real. But are we in a moment where there's some -- there's some talking going on behind the scenes? Again, and what's the nature of that talking? Let's not get carried away. But I don't think anyone is willingly going to throw away the lives of hostages.

I want you to watch the pictures. You may not be able to see it in too much detail, but the pictures of the military hardware. I don't know whether you can see these pictures, Cedric. But we have seen a lot of armored carriers and not tanks, as Nic put me right. Certainly, armored troop carriers all moving closer to the border but not in numbers that would suggest this is actually an invading force.",

But normally, at least in myexperience, what you've done -- what we do is we take a look at and go through a series of areas that we believe it should be targeted. And then we evaluate whether or not those are legitimate targets. In the case of Gaza, they've got a fairly limited area to work in. But one of the things that you see is that they are going after certain junctions in roads, they're going after certain buildings. And in that shot, which you write is very reminiscent of some of the shots that you had during World War II. They're going after a lot of different concentrations. So, it appears as if they're going after certain set targets from a predetermined list. And that is what, you know, what would result in something like we saw there.",

Steps will also be taken to bolster fighter squadrons. But any further immediate U.S. help remains in question. Washington is currently at a standstill.

That's not DoD his role. In fact, quite the opposite. A functioning Congress is supposed to tell DoD what to do. Richard, I'll point out one other way in which congressional dysfunction affects the military. And that is the hold on military nominations coming from Republican senator Tommy Tuberville. That very much to is affecting not this specific case but the wider region. For example, those holds include the commander of Fifth Fleet which is U.S. naval forces in the Middle East. He's supposed to become the deputy commander of central command. That position to is also on hold. Important policy positions in the Middle East for the U.S. Defense Department are on hold.
