There were some early folks saying that you know Minnesota is not a swing state so was this really the correct decision for Vice President Harris to make? Was she already leaning on a constituency she had?But what the folks here are telling me is that they see him really as a representative of the Midwest at large. And so, so many college students for instance going to school here, voting here, more importantly here in Wisconsin, some of them are from Minnesota. I don't want to speak when the Vice President or her running mate gets on stage so I'm going to wrap this up quickly. But I will tell you that they are - their core argument will be focused on protecting fundamental freedoms, reproductive rights. They will make a case against former President Donald Trump arguing that they are not like us. The Governor will be able to make that argument that he is like these folks in the crowd and that in Minnesota he worked hard to pass progressive policies, and that that can be replicated on a national level. That it's not so much the policies, it's the messenger. So Omar, just lots and lots of energy and enthusiasm in this crowd. Unbelievable, given this brand new ticket. Back to you.",

We've also been following Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance on the trail. So I guess the question is right now where is former President Trump? CNN's Kristen Holmes is live for us in West Palm Beach, Florida. So Kristen, I guess the choices or the split screen that we're looking at is we're looking at a vice presidential candidate in a swing state against a presidential candidate with her vice president on the other side. Where is the former president? What is he choosing to do instead?",

      "sentences": "Okay. So a couple things just to break down here, we obviously are in a different point of the campaign because the Harris campaign was so rushed. The fact that you're seeing this unveiling now with Harris and Walz isn't that surprising. It's also not surprising you wouldn't see Donald Trump and JD Vance out there.JD Vance might be on his own because they've already had their rollout. That was weeks ago. But that doesn't change the fact that we're not seeing Donald Trump at all. I mean, one of the things that I've talked to the campaign about is why is he not out there on the campaign trail, whether it's with JD Vance or not, why is he not hitting these various battleground states. And they point to a number of things. One, they say that he has done a ton of interviews. They point to the fact that he sat down with Adin Ross, which - who is an influencer, a streaming influencer. The fact that he did Fox News today. He has an Elon Musk interview on Monday. They also say that his travel schedule is going to ramp up. So we are keeping an eye on that, asking every day when the next kind of events that we see are. But there is no mistaking the fact that the last time we saw Donald Trump was Saturday in Georgia. It is a critical battleground state. And the next time we're going to see him is this Friday. It's almost a full week in Montana, which is arguably not at all a battleground state. He's having a rally at 10 PM Eastern Time on Friday. So the big question is why is he not also out there hitting those battleground states. The other thing I've heard from some advisors is, well, he's been doing that now for two years. He has been running for president for two years. But we are in a critical stretch and we are also in a very different race now. He is no longer running against President Joe Biden. [15:05:01] I've talked to people outside of the campaign. These are allies who are watching and who want Donald Trump to win. And they have the questions as to what is happening next: Is he going to be on the campaign trail? When are they going to see them again? Is he doing enough to engage with voters? And right now, we just don't know the answers to that. Of course, the campaign, again, we are reaching out to them every day to see if there is a strategy behind this, what they are doing in these critical states. JD Vance is on the campaign trail. But this is in comparison to Harris and Walz, who are hitting every battleground state right now. So this is quite, as you said, Omar, the split screen.",

Frank, the latest CNN poll of polls is showing a close general election, no clear leader between Harris and Trump. Do you think that this newly complete Democratic ticket is going to reveal something new here? FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER &amp; COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGIST: Yes, it does, because the momentum is clearly behind the - Vice President Harris. You see it in the crowd. You see it in the commentary. You get a feel for it across the country. I'm doing focus groups every - I don't know, four or five days, and I see it in the sessions that we've been doing, that it's remarkable that in two weeks time, the entire race has shifted. And I'll remind viewers that it's not the national numbers that really matter. It's only those seven key swing states in the West, Nevada and Arizona; in the South, North Carolina and Georgia; and in the industrial Midwest, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. Those are the only states that matter. And in every one of those states, Harris has either closed the gap, ended the gap or in some of those states, the Midwestern states, Harris even has a 1- or 2 percent lead. You can see it. You can feel it. It doesn't mean that this election is over. There's still more than 90 days to go. And most importantly, Donald Trump still has a lead over Biden and Harris in terms of his performance in his administration versus their performance. Trump needs to come out, talk about issues, clearly, most importantly, inflation, immigration. But the more that he stays back, the more that he's not part of the message, part of the daily discussions, and the more that Harris takes the limelight, such as the town hall that you're about to show, the rally you're about to show, the stronger she's going to continue to get.",

And maybe you can also speak to how much you think he's just going to matter in general.

Only 1 percent of Americans prioritize transgender issues, 30 percent prioritize inflation, 28 percent prioritize immigration.So if her campaign gets off the rails, focusing on issues that most Americans simply don't care about, that would be a mistake on their part. And it's funny you raise this, because it's exactly precisely what this election will be about. If Trump focuses on those issues and stops getting drawn into the negativity that he seems so easily aligned with, then it's his election to lose. In Harris' case, she wants to draw a clear and precise contrast, her attributes versus Trump's attributes. In that situation, she's the stronger candidate.",

If it's described as pro-family, helping families make ends meet, we have 24 percent of Americans who are paycheck-to-paycheck voters where their families struggle at the end of a week or end of a month to pay their bills. If this is about making their day-to-day lives easier, that's a policy that will be endorsed by everyone.If it becomes policies that are only focused on certain families in certain communities, and if it's spoken out of anger or resentment, that policy will fail. The issue with Vance is that they're dredging up something he said that he probably should not have said in 2021 about women who don't have children. Don't be insulting. Don't be mean. And in fact, if I only had three words to the Trump-Vance campaign, don't be mean. And if I had three words to the Harris-Walz campaign, I would say talk about issues.",

      "sentences": "So let's start with the beginning. So Austria has a terrorism ISIS threat. We - there was a major attack in 2020, sort of the most recent. So it's not like this is unique to Austria. They've had radicalization issues.What we do know now is there's, at least, the main suspect is a 19- year-old Austrian citizen. He was stopped south of the capitol where the - from where the concert is going to be. He was apparently in what we call preparatory - sorry, preparatory mode which is essentially he was putting things together to try to do an attack. Now, we don't know the nature of whether the chemicals or explosives would have worked. We don't know how sophisticated he was. But it was enough to cause this arrest and to have this alert. He apparently has an accomplice and was radicalized relatively recently online. So we are likely to find in the days ahead he is someone who was online, decides that this is a high-profile event - they don't get higher profile than Taylor Swift - and tried to get in, but that his access, his capabilities and the explosives that he had are still unknown. I don't need to tell anyone about these concerts. We certainly know with Ariana Grande in the London attack in Manchester, they are events that are appealing to terrorists because it's youthful, it's fun, it's the very opposite of what a terror attack should be and it's high profile. And - but the - we are told that the stadium is secure. Obviously, Taylor Swift has plenty of security. And if I were there and lucky enough to have tickets, I would go at this stage.

So any high-profile event is going to add more attention. As ISIS depleted in terms of its geographic capabilities and ownership, we saw a move to online and less about recruitment, because there's really nowhere for people to go, right?Remember, years ago, people are traveling to Syria, but more do something in your - where you reside. And the quick radicalization is very common. Mostly, you know, he - that he's 19 years old is not surprising to me. Young men, we'll get a sense of what his background is, his isolation, what his affiliated groups were, go online, get radicalized relatively quickly, and think that they can perform or act out a terrorist attack like this without getting caught. The truth is, is that, you know, these groups are being watched. The websites are being watched. Austria has a sophisticated law enforcement capacity, is nervous about radicalization on its own. But this idea of a - of someone, you know, younger than 30, a male, getting online and getting radicalized, we know that story. This is one of the big challenges of social media right now, is the ability to radicalize people who are looking for an identity. And again, what we don't know is what his true capabilities were.
