I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin the hour with President Biden defending his decision to include cluster bombs in the administration's latest military aid package to Ukraine. Human rights groups oppose cluster bombs which can carry dozens or even hundreds of smaller explosives known as bomblets. Sometimes the bomblets don't explode on impact, as you'll see in this video of a Russian cluster bomb dropped on Ukraine last year. The unexploded bomblets can kill and maim civilians. More than 100 countries have outlawed the use of cluster bombs but that group does not include the United States or Russia. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where the president is spending the weekend. She joins us now. Priscilla, the president is facing some pushback from even some fellow Democrats on the inclusion of cluster bombs in this military aid package. Tell us more.",

Now Ukrainian officials have given the U.S. assurance that they would not use these in urban areas, but the concern is clearly still there among Democrats. Now of course, this is a decision that the administration did not take lightly. National Security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said that they came to a unanimous decision within the National Security team that it was time to provide these munitions, that President Biden himself grappled with it.

The ammunition that they've been calling 155-millimeter weapons. This is a war relating to munitions, and they are running out of that ammunition and we're low on it. And so what I finally did, I took the recognition of the Defense Department to, not permanently, but to allow for this transition period where we have more 155 weapons, these shells for the Ukrainians, to provide them with something that has a very low dud rate. It's about -- I think it's 1.50, which is the least likely to be blown. And it's not used in civilian areas. They're trying to get through those trenches and stop those tanks from rolling. And so it was not an easy decision, and we're not signatories to that agreement, but I -- it took me a while to be convinced to do it. But the main thing is, they either have the weapons to stop the Russians now -- keep them from stopping the Ukrainian offensive through these areas or they don't. And I think they needed them.

The Trump administration lest me forget was an administration that had no problems separating families and engaging in other, very cruel anti- humanitarian tactics.And so it was a policy decision that the Trump administration walked away from is one being used and embraced by Governor Greg Abbott. It is shameful. We are going to see more drownings. We know that deterrence and tactics like this don't stop desperate people who are running for their safety. It only causes more death. And in fact, not just the death of migrants, but I am very concerned also about the impact it will have on Border Patrol agents and other Department of Homeland Security personnel whose job it is to help provide rescue operations for migrants, and what this will do to their ability to do their job.

But from a practical standpoint, the president did the right thing and I support his decision.It was the righteous thing to do. The fact that these systems are essential to Ukraine in these battles for liberating territory and helping win the war quickly. I met with probably almost a dozen Ukrainian ministers on our trip there. I just got back yesterday. And de-mining these kinds of munitions are at the forefront of their minds. Russia has been using these weapons systems with impunity, with a huge amount of duds, meaning unexploded ordinands. Ukraine is going to be very mindful. They're going to take responsibility for their territory. It's being employed on their territory. They are going to be careful with them, but they see it as essential to being able to liberate territory and destroy the Russian army. This is all about being able to attack the Russian army at its heart, break its ability to continue to wage war in Ukraine, and with that helped usher in the conclusion of the war. In a lot of ways, it seems counterintuitive, but it's frankly one of the most humane things that they could do in order -- instead of having this war run indefinitely, have a sharp punctuated conclusion to this war. It's a pretty humane approach both for the population that's living under occupation, for the soldiers that are sacrificing their lives to liberate their country, and for all of us that are, you know, assuming enormous amounts of risk with Russia in engaging in a perpetual war in Ukraine.",

So anything that they have in their arsenal that they think they can get away with, they'll employ. There's not going to be any change. What it will do is it will actually provide the Ukrainians with some critical weapons systems. These are going to be fired from a cannon, a 155-millimeter cannon, to relatively precise targets even though they could spread over a large area. The Ukrainians could identify the areas that they're going to employed, the dud rates for U.S. munitions, the I for DPICMs stand for improved. The dud rates are somewhere around 2 percent or lower. That's a pretty reasonable number when you think about the Russians being able to use their cluster munitions with dud rates of 40 percent.

So, things are coming to reality. But climate change is real. Just in Houston alone, for example, since I have been mayor, and I've been there going on eight years now, we have faced seven federally declared disasters in those eight years. And now we are experiencing extreme heat conditions. In fact, the U.S. Conference of Mayors is asking FEMA to designate heat, extreme heat as an element for FEMA to consider. I am hopeful that they will because the heat is serious. And we are identifying various heat islands within the city. We are planting trees to go over the city of Houston, for example.

Can you keep up if it keeps getting -- if the weather just keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter? TURNER: Well, what it means is that cities like the city of Houston and others, we have to build in resilience. We have to take into account the impact on vulnerable, marginal communities. We have to really be very data-driven and evidence-based, and that is why we are doing a lot of heat mapping in the city to determine and designate where those heat islands are. We are certainly partnering with -- in our case, we have this Beat the Heat every June where we are partnering with, for example, reliant utilities and others, providing air conditioners especially to seniors that do not have them. We opened up, for example, well over 20 cooling centers all throughout the city of Houston, and trying to create these lily pads throughout the city.

Now an estimated one million patients suffering from early forms of the disease have access to the drug.And Dr. Joanne Pike, president and CEO of the Alzheimer's Association, joins me now. Dr. Pike, thanks so much for joining us on such an important topic. How significant is this for patients? There are so many families who have been waiting for this news for years. DR. JOANNE PIKE, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION: Yes. First off, thank you for having me to talk about this pivotal moment in the history of progress against Alzheimer's disease. This is truly a moment that we should all be celebrating. It has taken us decades to get to a point where we have a traditional approval from the FDA for a drug that treats the underlying biology of the disease. This means for those in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's or those with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, they have a treatment option available to them that they can discuss with their physicians and certainly make informed choices with their family and their doctor.",
