But I want to give you a sense of the scale of the destruction.I am standing right now in what used to be, what still is, the garage of this residential home. Most of the homes in the subdivision were built around 2022. It's a rather new subdivision. Some of the residents in nearby area -- you know, nearby streets that we spoke to yesterday, moved in only a few months ago. So, a lot of lives were just suddenly interrupted when this tornado swept through. You can see here, most of the items that were left and there weren't that many were cleared out. The twister just completely destroying the roof, shredding the roof there. There's a part of the house in the back that's destroyed. If we pan over a little bit, the aftermath of a car that's no longer usable, that is still here. We saw the owners of this house clearing out whatever possessions they had, trying to load them into trucks and vans to take them to a safer place because they're certainly not going to be able to be living here for quite a while longer. Down the street, I know it's a bit dark, but the destruction continues. Some homes completely flattened, others half standing. The way that most of the families in this area survived was by hiding in the basements. That was a big lifesaver. And in fact, Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen says that it is a miracle. He said that yesterday that there was no casualty from this tornado. What we saw throughout the day yesterday, once the sun comes up, the families returned, volunteers from local churches and religious communities. There's a strong Indian -- American-Indian population here. And the Hindu temple as well as the Nebraska India Association were out here trying to help members of their flock, you know, salvage what they can, trying to place them into homes. And it was a really beautiful thing to see how much the community stepped up because we didn't see power crews here. [06:05:02] We didn't see officials from the state or this county necessarily doing work, but we did see a lot of neighbors from nearby divisions or even neighbors from here whose homes were still standing, pitching in and helping. There's -- dumpster trucks full of debris that was being cleared out because folks are really just trying to salvage what they can from their memories before moving on to a different location and waiting for the rebuild to happen, which of course with destruction at this scale is going to take so long. Another big concern that some folks expressed to us, documents. You know, a twister like this comes there's not a lot of personal possessions that remain standing. It's the memories that are gone, but it's also important paperwork, IDs, passports. We ran into one young teenage girl looking for her wallet desperately yesterday. And so, it's the sort of the struggle in the immediate aftermath. A lot of people though, of course, grateful to be walking away with their lives, guys.",

You know, the hope is that today won't be nearly as bad as the last few days but the potential is still there for those strong to severe thunderstorms. But just to kind of recap, take a look at some of these storms that we had. These are the total numbers for the last 48 hours. This includes both Friday and Saturday, 118 total tornado reports. That's all these red dots that you can see here.So, you're talking a pretty wide swath that's been impacted. Eighty damaging wind reports and almost 150 hail reports. Some of those as large as baseball size. Again, impacting a pretty wide area, but you'll notice some of these same areas where you see dots have the potential to see more of those storms today. This is where the line is right now. You can see essentially from Chicago all the way back down, well south of Dallas. This also means if you have some travel plans this morning, maybe in and out of Chicago or Dallas or some of the other is surrounding cities you may want to check for some delays because a lot of these very strong storms have a ton of lightning. There's also torrential rainfall with some of these and flooding has also been an issue. This red box here you can see that's still a tornado watch. Most of this is in effect for at least another hour or so, but we're likely going to see additional tornado watches pop up as we go through the day today. Especially once the sun comes out, you get heating of the day, it's going to fire up a lot more of these showers and thunderstorms to develop especially this afternoon and the evening hours. This is going to be the main target zone for today. Again, some of these same areas were areas that were hit yesterday. It's essentially from Wisconsin all the way down to the Gulf Coast. So, Houston, Dallas, Shreveport, Little Rock stretching up to St. Louis, Kansas City. All of those places have the potential for some strong tornadoes, damaging wind, and yes, again, some very large hail, golf ball size or even larger. The big concern, again, is going to be tornadoes. The main threat is all of these areas, but right here in this orange hatched area, this is where we have that potential for those EF-2 tornadoes or larger. By this afternoon, again, you can see a lot more of that developing, especially 4:00 or 5:00, and that will continue unfortunately into the evening hours again.",
