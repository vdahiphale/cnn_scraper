He wants to remind the voters of what he's done, but also lay out what he wants to do if he gets reelected into office.And one of the things that we saw last night in his speech in Philadelphia, is he's going to talk about what's at stake in this election cycle and talk about his former predecessor, Donald Trump. He mentioned him by name, and about him about eight times yesterday. And a lot of that is that he really wanted to stress that he believes that Donald Trump poses a threat to democracy.

But naming Trump when he's out explicitly on the campaign trail is a little bit of a shift to make it more of a direct contrast.But that speech on Thursday was still very fiery. And I think we can expect Joe Biden to continue that, you see that that's something that some of the folks in Trump world were kind of taken aback by. They've been kind of casting Joe Biden as kind of sleepy and not fully on top of his faculties. And the way he came off in that speech is something that kind of shuts some of that down, to think we're going to expect him to continue to do that. But this -- the way he's been taking on Trump directly shows this is the matchup he's ready for. He wants to draw those contrasts. He wants to draw contrast on democracy on tone. You know, you mentioned the little child who was holding up a middle finger. That's a coarsening of society. That's all something that Joe Biden is expected to probably talk about today.",

You're going to see Joe Biden tried to reach some of those folks, and he already has started trying to reach out to some of those folks.You know, Donald Trump -- the thing that Donald Trump struggles with is when he gets before a rally crowd like he will today, he tends to speak to his base. So what we're going to try to see today is whether he continues that and he will be in a very heavily Republican part of the state. He's in Georgia, where, you know, there's still fresh memory of what happened at the University of Georgia student Laken Riley, something he has been speaking about a lot. Immigration has been central to him. So whether he can leans into his hard immigration policies or whether he kind of cast a wider message that brings people into something to see, but we're going to see a stark contrast between these two laying out what is going to feel like a very long general election stretching out before us.",

So whatever the Republican Party is active in elections this year with guys, they're campaigning for not only Donald Trump, but for down ticket races. That is all going to be coming and filtered through the Trump campaign. So you're going to see him fully commanding that political apparatus now. You know what is interesting is some of the things that they're talking about this new leadership. They want to focus on fundraising, which was struggling with the RNC. But one of the biggest things that they talked about as a new priority, one of the reasons that Michael Whatley was chosen this chair is because of the emphasis he keeps putting on election integrity measures. This is something that stems from Donald Trump's false claims in 2020, that he lost the election because of fraud. He's still bringing that up pretty much every time he speaks. And what he has kind of charged these folks with as they take over the RNC is to have a much more robust program in place to monitor the vote to file legal challenges to just be much more aggressive this time around than they were in 2020.",

But you got to remember in 2020, when Joe Biden and Donald Trump debated, the first one was almost unwatchable, because Donald Trump was interrupting so much that the next time they got together, the Debate Commission actually kind of invented this mute button to cut off his microphone because they just couldn't hear anything when he was interrupting all the time.

It flooded this entire walkway here we're on a part of the Beltline here in Atlanta.And you can see the creek is still rushing fast and it's rising this morning after we got to get another inch and a half of rain overnight. There's some debris down here too. When you get that heavy rain, it picks up all of our plastic pollution and sends it right into the waters. And we've been watching it kind of roll down the creek this morning. Once the sun comes up, we'll be able to see it a little bit better. But yes, rising here with another inch and a half of rain overnight. And we've got even more significant flooding just to the south of us in southern Georgia. I want to show you the radar because we've got this storm that's pretty expansive. We've got some showers stretching from upstate New York all the way down the east coast and that heaviest rain is in southern Georgia, where we've got all of the lightning strikes there. Now we do also have a tornado watch that's in effect until 11 o'clock this morning along southern Georgia, the Florida Panhandle where we could have some spin up tornadoes as we go through the morning as well. Flash flooding has continued to be a risk. We've got flash flood warnings that continue through the morning here. Because we've got heavy rain. We've gotten two and a half inches of rain in spots. And we're piling on that some of these rainfall totals have been in excess of five to six inches over the last couple of days and the Southeast has been pretty saturated and inundated all of winter. We've had some rainfall totals that have been well above average so far this year. So far this winter, it's just been well above average. And so that has led these ground conditions be pretty saturated and keeping the flooding risk there, right. When the ground is saturated, and you get more heavy rain on top, the ground really can't take that much more. Now we do know that we find that these two-inch heavy rainfall days are increasing as our atmosphere becomes warmer, it can hold more moisture and we squeeze out more of these heavy rainfall days. We do have the rain that's wrapping up here in Atlanta, but all of that moisture heads up the east coast.

Well, first, in terms of foreseeability. In the event that you purchase your child a weapon, first of all, which was four days prior to this, and you have knowledge as to his mental health maladies, right?That's problematic. And so, to what extent now were you negligent? Furthermore, you saw the clip there with respect to the defense asking about the hiding of the gun, did you hide it enough? Where was it in connection with, you know, where he would, that is Ethan Crumbley, the shooter himself convicted as we know, pled guilty, spending the rest of his life in jail such that he could have access to it. So, all that's important. You're the father, you shot with him. This was your hobby. You have a responsibility will be the argument to make sure he doesn't get a hold of that gun. Next issue, what extent, if any, are you aware as to what your child is going through, and should you have been aware of that? And so, when you saw the clip of the defense focusing on the issue of knowledge, it's important because the jury is going to say, what did you know about the son, and why would you got him -- why would you have gotten him a gun if you knew that? And that's why you saw the defense focusing in on that. They have to separate that issue. Father had no knowledge, father secured the gun, and if they had any hopes of exonerating him in this case, Isabel.",

Human nature is human nature. And as a result of that, it's hard not really to make a connection with the fact that there are four kids dead. Why? Who is accountable for that? Could it have been prevented? And so, when you hear this emotional testimony, when you hear the impact that it had on the school, the impact that it had on the community, the impact that it had on the families, you're looking to see why and who is responsible. Why are we even here? Who could have done something better? And father, if it was you because of your lack of hiding, concealing the gun or knowing how to treat your son when he needed help? Then, you know what? We may be more likely, the jury, to assess guilt in the event, right? That, that's not the case, then perhaps not.
