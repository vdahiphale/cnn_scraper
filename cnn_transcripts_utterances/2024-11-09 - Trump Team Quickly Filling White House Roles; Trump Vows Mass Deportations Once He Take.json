For more on how the Trump White House is taking shape, CNN's Alayna Treene is joining us now from West Palm Beach near Mar-a-Lago. Alayna, tell us more about the president-elect's search to quickly fill key roles. It seems like they are moving more quickly than they did in 2016.",

We hear this talk about building mass detention camps, and certainly that will be essential to the president's plan, but the bottom line is, he is going to need a couple of things. One is a real surge in ICE agents, a surge in repatriation flights.The number of deportations is really a resource game. The more resources you put into it, the more deportations you get. But you are talking a cost that's really excessive, billions and billions of dollars. And to put that in perspective, in about 2019, the last, but one of the largest years of Trump's deportation numbers, ICE deported about 267,000 undocumented immigrants. The cost there was about $6 billion, so you can see that tens of billions it would take to do a million people in a year. DEAN: Yes, and I am curious what the resources -- I know you just outlined some numbers, but what the current detention space looks like, what the current ICE workforce looks like, and would there need to be, it would seem, a dramatic increase in those areas.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so ICE currently has about 41,000 detention heads. The secret though is not a secret, but the reality is that the majority of those are not actually federal facilities. ICE relies heavily on contractors and also on state and local jails, so sheriff's offices. They pay for bed space.So if you want to ramp up to be part of this mass deportation plan, even finding the places where you can house the migrants is going to be a challenge and that is why you are hearing about these private detention contractors starting to scout out locations and start the plans for constructing these massive facilities. But look, all of this raises another issue, which is that even if the president was to get the money tomorrow to implement this mass deportation effort, it is still going to be an incredible challenge to just deploy the resources. So, you need to hire the agents, train the agents. You need to find places and buy the real estate for the detention centers, construct the facilities. All of that takes a tremendous amount of time and the president only has a four-year window in which he has promised 11 million deportations.",

      "sentences": "Yes. The primary issue there is going to be in the state and local jails. Now, one thing again, and one of the things that is a little bit frustrating to me when we hear this talk about we are going to focus on criminals is that ICE is already excruciatingly focused on criminals. They have a heightened focus on that population.So there is not a person in this country who is booked into a state or local or federal jail or prison that ICE is not aware of and if they are removable, so if they are either someone who is on a visa and committed a crime that allows them to be deported or someone who is just undocumented, ICE is going take action against those individuals. They're very, very good at it. So there is not like this sizable population when Senator Rubio says, well, we are going to focus on criminals first. They already are focused on criminals, but that is the one area where state and locals can frustrate ICE's efforts because they can block access to their jails. But despite the fact that there is going to be a lot of concerns about how ICE or how this immigration system is going to operate, big cities like Los Angeles and Chicago and New York let's say who might try to implement barriers to ICE taking action in their communities really are powerless to do so. They cannot stop ICE from operating in their streets or in their cities, but they can restrict access to places like their jails, which ICE does rely on for their enforcement efforts.",

How many would you say, or is it possible to know, criminals that are undocumented that are not in a jail? I guess, I am just asking because they make it sound like there are a lot of them out there and I wonder what you know about those numbers.",

      "sentences": "Look, all data shows that, you know, crime rates in undocumented communities are lower than the general population. So migrants tend to commit crimes at a lower frequency than does the regular population.That said, and don't get me wrong, there are some bad actors out there in our communities, right, there are transnational gang members, there are individuals who committed violent crimes who we deported who snuck back in the country unlawfully. I would love to see ICE shift its focus to go after that population and take a surgical approach to finding them, the individuals who are at large wreaking havoc in the communities, apprehending them and getting them out of the country. The problem though is this, when you talk about mass deportation and you start putting out these big numbers, you cannot accomplish that with a surgical approach to the criminal population. It takes a lot more time to arrest these at-large criminals. These transnational gang members know how to hide. They are hiding and masking their identity. They are not sitting on public registrars or getting drivers' licenses or ways in which it is easy for us to find them. So, what I mean is, it takes a lot more time for ICE agents to find them, and when they do find them, it takes a lot more resources to make one arrest. Very quickly though, you might get one arrest, but it is a very high quality. You might get a very bad guy off the street, but you spend a lot of ICE's resources to get him. Unfortunately though, when you set these quotas and big goals of mass deportation, it is just a lot easier to get the low-hanging fruit of the system, which is those mixed status families or people maybe who are ordered deported 10 years ago, but ICE gave a stay for humanitarian reasons.",

Surely he would get fired. Donald Trump has said he would. But the bigger issue here for Jack Smith is DOJ has a policy that's been on the books since 1973 for over 50 years that says we cannot and will not prosecute, try or imprison this sitting president. If it sounds familiar, it's the same policy that sort of stifled Robert Mueller and kept Robert Mueller from saying whether he believed Donald Trump should be charged during his first term in office. So that has been the policy of DOJ for over 50 years. Jack Smith understands he's bound by it. And so what he's trying to do now is wind out in an orderly fashion. The only thing really left for Jack Smith to do is issue a final special counsel report. Again, like we saw Robert Mueller do, I think Jack Smith will try to do that between now and January 20th.",

And it comes after Biden had extended this invitation to Trump in a phone call they had this past week.One thing that Biden said he stressed in that call when he congratulated Trump for his victory, he said that he's committed to an orderly and peaceful transfer of power. And that's what makes these meetings that are happening this week so interesting, because that is something that former president or then-president Trump, did not afford to Biden back in 2020 when he had won the race. Trump really put up a lot of roadblocks in the transition process and also never conceded this race to Biden, never hosted him at the White House. So Biden is essentially trying to go back to a sense of normalcy and tradition as he's trying to show that he's committed to this transition process. Now, back in 2016, then-President Barack Obama had welcomed Trump to the Oval Office as well. We also know that the White House had extended an invitation to Melania Trump to come visit as well. It's unclear if and when a meeting between First Lady Jill Biden and Melania Trump could happen. But this is all part of the Biden team's efforts to try to show that they are committed to the transition. That is what a lot of the focus will be in the months to come for the president. I'll also note a little bit later this week, the day after Biden meets with Trump, Biden will actually be departing for a pair of summits in South America. First, he will be stopping at the APEC summit in Peru, followed by the G20 summit in Brazil. And what's interesting about this is that he'll be meeting face-to-face with many of the world leaders who are grappling with the looming Trump presidency as they're trying to figure out how they will be working with Trump. So it'll be interesting to see how President Biden's conversations, perhaps, with Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday might inform any of those upcoming meetings with the world leaders as well.",

They've been meeting in Budapest to try and figure out how best to respond.Many of the questions and the conversations are about whether Europe can be galvanized by a future Trump presidency or whether, indeed, it will continue to be further splintered on things like the economy, whether Trump tariffs will lead to European greater integration, better protection for itself, as it tries to weather the likely trade wars that could fall out or, on the contrary, whether the continent will be further split by individual trade deals that might be struck by individual countries. On security, the question of whether or not Europe will be able to come together to achieve more strategic independence from the United States or, indeed, whether the next Trump presidency could encourage far-right parties here in Europe to sow more division than there was even before, Jessica.",

Far-right leaders such as El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, and Argentina's president, Javier Milei, were among the very first ones to congratulate him. And now CNN has learned that Milei intends to travel to Mar-a-Lago as early as next week for an investors' conference, but really hoping to meet personally with Trump, who has so far spoken on the phone with Bukele and with the Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum.Countries where the left is in power, such as Colombia and Mexico, are preparing for a more delicate relationship with the White House, particularly concerning migration. Trump's pledge to deport millions of undocumented migrants could wreak havoc for many countries in this region who rely on remittances from the United States to boost up their economies. And surprisingly, one person who extended an olive branch to Donald Trump is Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro, who has said he wants to open a new relationship with Washington. Trump was the president when the U.S. Department of Justice charged Maduro with drug trafficking, but at least from Caracas, there is the declared desire to turn the page. Jessica?",

Trump's return to the presidency could really shift U.S. defense policy on Taiwan, and the former president's past remarks suggest that Taiwan may need to pay for U.S. protection. Now, as he's about to become president again, they're very keenly aware here in the Taiwanese capital that Trump's transactional approach does raise doubt about U.S. support in a crisis, so they're trying to get in his good graces.
