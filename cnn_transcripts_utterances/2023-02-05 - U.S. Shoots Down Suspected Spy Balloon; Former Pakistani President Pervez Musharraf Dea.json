A foreign ministry statement accused Washington of overreacting to a civilian unmanned airship and the Chinese defense ministry warned it reserved the right to use, quote, \"necessary means\" to deal with similar situations. But Washington has been skeptical and wary of China's claims from the start. U.S. President Joe Biden said he gave the go-ahead last Wednesday to shoot down the balloon as soon as possible. The Pentagon waited until it was out over the ocean to finally bring it down. A Senior White House official is pushing back on China's claim the balloon was for civilian use, that official insisting it was seeking to monitor sensitive military sites and adding a second balloon spotted over Central and South America is also another Chinese surveillance balloon. They said, quote, \"Both balloons also carry surveillance equipment not usually associated with standard meteorological activities or civilian research --- collection pod equipment and solar panels located on the metal truss suspended below the balloon are a prominent feature of both balloons.\" The White House affirmed that the president made the right call. President Biden says he issued the order last Wednesday to shoot down the balloon as soon as possible. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  On Wednesday, when I was briefed on the balloon, I ordered the Pentagon to shoot it down on Wednesday as soon as possible. They decided -- without doing damage to anyone on the ground. They decided that the best time to do that was, as it got over water, outside -- within our -- within the 12-mile limit.

The diplomatic side as well, the U.S. making it very clear they found this unacceptable and considered a violation of U.S. airspace and now we have seen the military's response -- Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon.

Beijing is saying that if the U.S., essentially, if the U.S. flies balloon over China, it will probably shoot it down.Look at the statement coming from the Chinese defense ministry, quote, \"The U.S. used force to attack our civilian unmanned airship, which is an obvious overreaction. We express solemn protest against this move by the U.S. side and reserve the right to use necessary means to deal with similar situations.\" There has been a shift in the tone from Beijing; on Friday evening, the Chinese foreign ministry expressed regret, saying that its airship, as it described it, used primarily for research purposes, had blown off course, over the U.S. And now, the Chinese government, different ministries are protesting the fact that this U.S. fighter jet shot the balloon down. The damage on the diplomatic front has already been visible, with the U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken postponing a trip he was supposed to make this weekend to Beijing over this balloon scandal and calling the existence of this balloon over U.S. airspace a violation of U.S. sovereignty and international law. The Chinese response has been, hey, this is due to weather, it's out of our control, they have been communicating with their U.S. counterparts. But clearly done some damage to what was an effort that began in November between President Biden and the Chinese leader Xi Jinping when they met face-to-face at the G20 summit in Bali to try to put a stop to the downward spiraling relations between the world's two largest economies. We'll have to see whether there can be efforts to revive diplomacy in the wake of this, I would argue, a growing crisis.",

It summoned China's ambassador to Ottawa then.And now we're getting reports of a second object flying over Central and Latin America that looks remarkably similar to the balloon that was just shot down over the U.S. It was seen over Costa Rica, according to officials, on Thursday. And on Friday the Colombian air force put out a statement, saying this object was seen at an altitude of above 55,000 feet, roughly the same altitude as the balloon seen over the U.S., that it was monitored and it was moving at a speed of 25 knots. And then the Colombians followed it until it left Colombian airspace. A U.S. official telling CNN they believe this also is, as they put it, a Chinese surveillance balloon. We have put a question in to the Chinese government, asking whether or not this is, in fact, a Chinese airship, as they put it, about the previous balloon seen over U.S. airspace. And also, U.S. officials have said that they have also seen similar Chinese, as they put it, surveillance balloons three times over U.S. airspace, during the Trump administration and at least once over the U.S. earlier during the Biden administration. Why has this -- sorry to do this -- why has this blown up this time? Well, U.S. officials say they haven't seen it loitering over U.S. airspace for such a duration of time in the past. And we don't know that ordinary citizens have been able to see this kind of balloon with their own eyes, with the naked eye, and take pictures of it before.

It would hit it with tremendous force and be absolutely misshapen, torn apart and broken up by this impact. What does that mean to recovery? What it means is the first thing they have to do when they get settled out there, to get divers down, 47 feet down, that's good. That's a good, workable depth. There they have to look at this, figure out how many pieces it's in, where they are, assess it, figure out if some of it is buried down in the muck below. And then come up with a list of priorities.

Officials say though some of it was released in the environment but they have not detected any harmful levels in the air. The cause of the derailment is still not clear.

He said the balloon incident is a stark reminder of China's growing determination to challenge the U.S. on the global stage. Here he is on CNN earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL), OVERSIGHT AND INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES:  I think that it just reminds us of the threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party. Basically we know that their military technological national security threats and, of course, this particular balloon, the balloon reminded us that these threats exist, that the Chinese Communist Party is aggressive. And unfortunately, they're committing surveillance in violations of our own national sovereignty, not to mention violations of the national sovereignty of so many of their neighbors, including Taiwan and others. We're going to find out very soon the nature of this spy balloon. We'll know the who, what, when, where and how, hopefully, related to that balloon, once we salvage the technology. But at the end of the day I think that probably there were actors within the Chinese Communist Party who continued with their aggressive surveillance. And it's not even clear whether the left and the right hands knew what they were doing in terms of the Chinese foreign ministry and others knowing about this. Of course, if they did, it would really question the sincerity of their diplomatic overtures. I think that chairman Xi would -- we would just have to really question, you know, how eager he is to solve our diplomatic issues and to do so in a responsible way. I particularly think that the Chinese will have some explaining to do. And they will have to own up to it. But regardless, it doesn't decrease tensions; if anything, it just keeps them at the state they are at and maybe worsens them. But for the sake of all of us, we're going to continue to undercover the facts behind the CCP's threats to us on the committee, counter them and then, hopefully, come back another day to diplomatically resolve our disputes with the CCP, even as we work with our friends and allies and partners in the region on our collective mutual defense.

During the independence movement, which led to independence in 2011, Catholic radio was basically the communications network of the independence movement.Of course, civil war erupted two years later in 2013. The road map for a peace deal that was signed in 2018 was signed in Rome under the aegis of a Catholic organization close to the Vatican. Some two-thirds of the population in South Sudan is Catholic. So the pope almost uniquely in South Sudan can mobilize great deal of social and political capital. And that is why there is such a hopeful atmosphere that maybe this visit will mark a turning of the page.",
