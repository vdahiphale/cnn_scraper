      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\", this hour, as we follow the fast moving developments in the stunningdownfall of one-time crypto King Sam Bankman-Fried call it dramas in the Bahamas in the coming hours. The former FTX CEO is expected to be charged on various U.S. criminal counts, including wire fraud and money laundering. There are reports the U.S. Department of Justice or the DOJ is expected to unseal that indictment very soon. And in what appears to be coordinated action the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission so the SEC, announcing just hours ago, too, that it has filed separate civil charges against Bankman-Fried accusing him of defrauding investors in what it calls a \"House of Cards scheme\". SBF, as he's better known, was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday night and now is awaiting extradition to the United States. That's according to the attorneys General's office there and that's not all. The U.S. Congress begins hearings this Tuesday into the bankruptcy and collapse of FTX. Hearings, where of course SBF was expected to testify. However, the panel will still hear from the failed firm's current CEO that's John Ray, who was likened FTX to the massive accounting scandal at Enron. Those hearings expected to begin just one hour from now. Still so many questions surrounding the story, including where the hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of customer cash go can they even get their money back and can SPF continue to use some form of ignorance as his defense? Also, will there be more crypto market contingent giant crypto exchange Binance, now warning of further customer redemptions. We are going to discuss that throughout the show today. For now, though also on to another huge market story just released economic data showing a further easing of U.S. consumer prices last month. The so-called CPI rising at a less than expected annual rate of 7.1 percent and month over month inflation of a mere 1/10 of a percent higher. The market reaction as you might imagine, is positive. U.S. futures are significantly higher this morning, with all the major averages set to rise at least 2 percent. You can see them as though they're leaping some 3.8 percent pre market, Europe on the bottom line. They're also hired too after a relatively mixed handover from the Asia session. Hong Kong however, rising after city officials there scrapped more key COVID health restrictions. Wow, there's a lot to get through today, but first to our top story and the arrest of disgraced FTX Head Sam Bankman- Fried. And Anna Stewart joins us now. Former Head of course, no longer the CEO Anna I think for most of our audience this morning, their head's about to explode, quite frankly, with what's coming up just in the coming hours. Yes. Can you just recount what we're looking for in the coming hours and how we even got here?",

We've got to watch the CFTC now to see what they come up with as well and just a day before he was expected to speak in Congress. One wonders why they didn't just let him continue to talk and perhaps incriminate himself further. We can discuss that, but Anna, I think this comes to something that you've mentioned frequently in the past, and that is the sheer speed upon which these charges now are appearing compared to sort of other criminal cases or at least alleged criminal cases in the past. Perhaps he sort of incriminated himself with talking on Twitter, doing interviews in the last month since the bankruptcy was announced.",

Now that we don't know yet specifically what these charges are but if we look at the civil charges that were announced by the SEC this morning. We get a sense of what authorities believe had happened here and what they say is from the inception of FTX, that Bankman-Fried was using customer funds, and not for the ways that he told them he would use them. They say that he was defrauding customers in both, are excuse me, investors in both FTX the company as well as customers who use the trading platform. So according to the SEC complaint, he didn't tell investors that he was going to take money that were customer assets and use them for his hedge fund Alameda and what authority safe they're from what happened. It is that the money that was used for Alameda was diverted there it was helped to cover some of their loans in their exposure, but it was also used by Bankman-Fried and other executives as a personal piggy bank. According to the SEC complaint Bankman-Fried had used some of this money to buy luxury real estate in the Bahamas for himself, his family. And also for other FTX executives he also used some of this money to make big political donations. Of course, you know, the big debate here about whether crypto should be regulated and if so, how, and that he also was using some of this money for his own personal loans. According to the SEC, he had taken out $1.3 billion in loans from this company. So we're still waiting to see what these federal criminal charges are going to be, but as you have played, you know, Bankman-Fried has said that he never intended to defraud anyone. We're going to see, in short order, what the specific details are.",

Those statutory maximums of 20 plus years so that's a long time and in the U.S., the amount of money that you're accused of stealing can really ramp up your sentence. And if we're talking billions of dollars here, that is very serious, that is very significant for him. Most people don't get the statutory maximum, but it really remains to be seen what facts will come out? What evidence will come out? And ultimately, that will all inform a judge down the road if he is convicted or pleads guilty to what he could face? But we're talking potentially some serious prison time, Julia.",

Then that justifies this less hawkish stance by the Federal Reserve and other central bankers, that they can raise rates less aggressively, which decreases hopefully the chances or a recession. Or if there is going to be one, maybe it's just a mild one. And obviously, consumers can be totally understandable that they're not necessarily celebrating these numbers because 7.1 percent year over year, price creases are still painfully high and higher than what wages are going up at.

You know, stepping back, Julia, you and I have talked about this for more than a year, these inflation numbers. And imagine this 7.1 percent consumer inflation is a relief. That's the world we live in. I mean, so a lot of people out there are still saying, yes, it still feels like there's inflation in the economy. There is no question. But you're absolutely right, down five months in a row and the smallest inflation gain since the end of since December last year. So it's the trend here, that's really important. The direction as you were pointing out earlier with Paula Monica and the direction is, the peak seems to be behind us. And the worst might be behind us. I'm always too nervous to declare, you know, inflation is dead, because it's not it is still in this economy, but it is cooling and that is the really fair.",

The thing that concerns me in this Christine and you can educate me better is the shelter because it's such a huge component of both the core and the headline inflation. And when I'm saying shelter, I mean rent. And that's sticky. So as much as this is starting to come down, I worry about that, because that was actually still going in the wrong direction.",

But shelter at 7.1 percent and shelter is you know, overrode a month-over- month decline in gasoline here for this number. I also saw in here, airline fares up 36 percent year-over-year. And I wanted to mention that to you because I know you and I both like to take the occasional trip. And it's interesting how consumer behavior is changing. We're not buying couches; we're buying trips and experiences again. So I think you'll start to see that reflected in some of these inflation numbers as well.",

Separately a few hours ago, the Securities andExchange Commission charged him with defrauding FTX investors and customers. He was of course arrested on Monday, just a day before he was due to testify in a congressional hearing. Joining us now Defense Attorney Renato Mariotti, who is a former federal prosecutor, Renato, fantastic to have you on the show. I think, for most people looking at this for me, certainly the speed at how these charges are appearing is pretty mind blowing. To what extent do you think the Department of Justice here in particular was helped simply by the fact that he didn't shut up and kept giving interviews and tweeting? RENATO MARIOTTI, FORMER U.S. FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: You read my mind, in fact, one of the --I had the exact same reaction. I mean this sort of case that's been put together and what a little over a month, usually would take years to put together and I think they were helped by two things. One was the brazenness of this fraud. I mean, if you read the SEC's filing today, they just describe the entire FTX business empire as one massive fraud of both investors and customers. But the other piece as you point out, most people when they're caught and when they're under criminal investigation, keep their mouths shut. They hire somebody like me, who is carefully going to issue carefully crafted statements and await for the evidence and said Mr. Bankman-Fried literally talk to everyone. Every day, when I logged into Twitter, he had a different Twitter space where he was on for hours answering difficult questions, really, not only incriminated himself, but provided a record that the government can use at trial against him, so very problematic.",

But just tobe clear, because we're now in many ways, overwhelmed with the number of prospective charges and what's set to come in the coming hours. From a criminal perspective, my understanding is what we need to know is whether he knew that client money was being transferred, and that there was intent to defraud because while I was scanning what we heard from the Securities and Exchange Commission, they're effectively saying that. They said that look, he'd already used client money and he was still raising money from investors. Is that what we need to see criminal charges precede of him to be found guilty?",

So the fault line is going to be on did Mr. Bankman-Fried know that he was making false statements to customers, you know, fraud is where you lie to people to get their money. Did he know the statements were false, for example, when FTX was telling his customers that their funds were going to remain at FTX? And the way he would know that, of course, is if he knew about the funds being transferred to Alameda to himself and others and so forth. And then separately, did he have the intent to defraud. And of course, you know, the SBF Talk parade, where he was going to talk to everybody, I think was meant, in part, I think he understood that. And he was trying to portray himself as somebody who was inattentive or not, not focused on the details, as opposed to somebody who was trying to trick his customers.",

I just wonder, in your experience, again, and it ties to the speed and the fact that he was talking perhaps, too. Do you think someone's talking? Do you think someone's giving evidence against him, which has also helped speed this up? Perhaps even those that he was using.",

And that really tells me that the SEC, I assume the DOJ, once we see that indictment, we're looking at all of those people that were involved in Alameda, for example, if I was representing any of those people, I would tell them, they're in very serious trouble. And we need to be looking for a potential deal with the government. So I would not be surprised if there's co-operators. And don't forget, you know, this was also a massive operation in which SBF was not only had a various employees and associates, but he was talking to all sorts of people around the globe as this was occurring. So I'm sure a lot of people have come forward in what appears to be a massive investigation, a massive effort by the U.S. government.",

They mere what you just mentioned a moment ago regarding the SEC's charges that he defrauded his customers and investors. Conspiracy could potentially help the government bring in certain evidence. I mean, I think it could bolster the government's claim, for example, if they're going to charge others conspiracy requires more than one person. So it'll be interesting to see who else is in that conspiracy charge, for example, is Former Paramore, who's the Head of Alameda, Co-Head of Alameda Trading that would be one potential co-conspirator for example. So I think that's interesting. I think it'd be interesting to see whether there's any money laundering charges as well. But you know very serious crimes. And as a practical matter, you know, a sentence here will be driven by what we call a criminal law, the loss amount, in other words, the total amount of money involved, which looks to be absolutely massive, you're potentially the biggest fraud case since the party made off.",

But essentially, the majority of the team are a new generation, except the mid-field the likes of Luka Modric who we were talking about, of course.
