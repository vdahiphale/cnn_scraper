And he lost his legislative majority in the Lower House, which is making it of course very difficult for him to enact this particular agenda. For Emmanuel Macron, he is absolutely committed to reforming the economy, and to sort of injecting the French business sector with new funding and support. And these measures have been challenged by economists, by demographers, and also by pointing the fact that he has been unwilling to increase taxes on the wealthiest sections of society and on corporations and businesses.

The Yellow Ribbon sprayed on walls tied to railings has spread with the movement throughout the areas under Russian control with a particularly large and growing number of activists in Crimea.

These acts are small and symbolic but under occupation any act of defiance comes with a huge risk. Says Taras (ph), all this resistance is very difficult because the price of putting up one poster could be the loss of your freedom or your life. Katia (ph) not her real name knows those risks. Twice Russian police searched her home in the Kherson region. The invaders she says expected to be met with flowers. Last November Russian forces retreated from much of the Kherson region.

This was his wish list if you like back in January, 2021 when he said these are the military and arms improvements and developments that I want to achieve in the next five years.This was a key part of that plan, and we're almost halfway through that five year plan at this point, so he said he did want the capability of a solid fueled ICBM. Now the key for the solid fuel rather than liquid fuel is, as you mentioned, it is easier to handle. It's quicker to be able to launch one of these ICBMs. And of course, that makes it far more difficult to detect and if necessary, intercept. So it certainly does give North Korea a benefit.

(END VIDEO CLIP) HANCOCKs: So what the South Korean military has said at this point is, although they do believe it could well be a solid fueled missile, they do believe that North Korea needs more time and effort to be able to perfect this kind of technology and capability. Now, of course, time and effort is something that we know full well Kim Jong-un has plenty of. Now it's also coming at a time just a couple of weeks before the South Korean president heads to Washington to meet with the U.S. President Joe Biden, but also at a time where there is no communication whatsoever between North and South Korea. Now they're not talking any kind of dialogue at the moment. But there's usually a hotline twice a day, which is answered but has not been answered by North Korea for about a week, Michael.",

Thanks so much.Now much to the ire of China, the Philippines and the United States are to enter several days of their largest ever joint military exercises. Troops from both countries held anti tank missile exercises on Thursday at the military base in the northern Philippines. The joint exercises aimed to boost Manila's military capability while showing U.S. support for the Philippines as China's assertiveness grows. The two allies plan to hold more exercises in the South China Sea later this year, which will include other countries. The Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva is in Beijing right now. He's expected to meet in the coming hours with trade union leaders and later with Chinese President Xi Jinping. But despite previously vowing to discuss peace making strategies with Russia's ally, there is no mention of the war in Ukraine on Mr. Lula's official schedule. Instead the two are expected to focus heavily on issues of trade and investment. Stephano Pozzebon with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

China is Brazil's main economic partner by a considerable margin, and even though bolstering the commerce between the two countries is the stated goal of these visits, a high profile trip holds a considerable political significance. IGOR PATRICK, RESEARCH SCHOLAR, KISSINGER INSTITUTE ON CHINA AND THE U.S.: I see this trip also has a message to the U.S. because when Lula visited Biden at the beginning of 2023, the Brazilian side had like high hopes for like signing deals, especially when it comes to climate change and protecting the Amazon. And what the U.S. side offered wasn't too much.

Now more than 20 business deals, Michael are expected to be signed on this trip. But the issue of Ukraine may be raised. It's not on the official agenda. But it is something that could be discussed.
