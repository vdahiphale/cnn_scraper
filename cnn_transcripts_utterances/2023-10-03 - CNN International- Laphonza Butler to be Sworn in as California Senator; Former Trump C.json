Since Kamala Harris left in 2021 to serve as vice president, there have been no Black women serving in the chamber. Newsom also avoids a political pickle with three congressional Democrats already running for the Senate seat, Adam Schiff, Katie Porter, and Barbara Lee, who had lobbied publicly to be Newsom's choice. REP. BARBARA LEE (D-CA): Of course, it would have been great if I -- because I did want to fill the vacancy, if in fact that occurred. But listen, we all have to just focus on what we're doing and I'm running very seriously. LAH (voice-over): Newsom's office said Butler's appointment comes without any strings attached, so she could run or not run for the Senate seat in 2024. Before she's even been sworn in, some Democrats say she should not. REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA): I just think it's terribly unfair that she would do so. And the word around here is that whoever he appointed would not run and be air dropped into this is simply not fair and by the way, I don't think many people know her. LAH (voice-over): Butler has four months before California's primary to change that as the sitting senator.

A lot of people for them to actually talk to. They went to Stepanakert, the now former, I suppose, capital of this separatist region. This majority ethnic Armenian region that has been essentially vacated. It is a ghost town. They -- the estimates that they got were that between 50 and 1,000 people only remain in the entire territory, 55 zero. These numbers are incredibly low.They also saw -- I suppose this is good news. Most buildings, civilian buildings, hospitals, schools, houses, things like that intact for the most part. They said that the Azerbaijanis are beginning to restart healthcare services, try to get utilities back online. But there were no stores open and you can understand why, because there is absolutely nobody there. And nobody to buy from them anyways. They did manage to speak to obviously the few number of locals that are still there, who said that, you know, there were no reports that this UN mission got of any violence after the ceasefire had ended. But of course, where we are starting to see violence is along the border regions of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Yesterday, as you mentioned. One soldier killed, 2 injured, according to the Armenians along that border. It comes after the Russian -- a Russian peacekeeping mission who is doing patrols, joint patrols with the Azerbaijanis also reported taking sniper fire. No one killed there, but they don't know where it was coming from precisely. Both sides are denying that they had anything to do with it. On Saturday, you also had a similar incident where an Azerbaijani soldier was killed -- again, blaming Armenia. They deny it. There have been precious few people, at least reports of arrests amongst the civilian populations, but obviously there are some high- profile exceptions, some former military commanders and also the former state minister, all of them arrested as they were trying to flee toward Armenia. The children of the former state minister, Ruben Vardanyan, they appealed yesterday publicly for the international community to step up to try to do something to actually help their Father Get out. Because they say that, look, he's in Azerbaijani custody right now. We have not heard from him since he was arrested Wednesday last week.",
