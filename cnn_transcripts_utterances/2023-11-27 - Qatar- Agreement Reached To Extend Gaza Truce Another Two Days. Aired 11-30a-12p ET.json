      "sentences": "There had always been this hope, Kaitlan, and now, it's official. The reason that it wasn't certain was because everything was so fluid. Things could have really blown up at any moment.There was a moment on day two when it looked like that might happen. Earlier today, it -- things look very uncertain. So, I think in the course of this morning here in the States, and in the day your time, we've had now two back-to-back pieces of very significant news. It does look like this fourth day of exchanges of hostage releases is going to go into effect in the coming hours. And then we now have this announcement by Qatar, that the four-day pause has now been extended for two more days. Meaning that this temporary truce, this pause in the fighting between Hamas and Israel will extend for six days -- I'm sorry, extend into six days and be six days at a minimum. And there could be a hope that it will go beyond that as well. Now, Qatar has been the leading mediator between the different sides. They are the ones who speak directly with Hamas. They obviously have a relationship with Israel and the United States as well. I want to read you the tweet from the foreign ministry spokesman for Qatar. Dr. Majed Al -- Dr. Majed Al Ansari says the State of Qatar announces as part of the ongoing mediation, an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian truce for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip. So, what does that mean? By the end of today, Kaitlan, there is an expectation that 50 Israeli women and children will have been released. Now, a number of those are dual nationals. There was a hope that three Americans would be among that 50. So far, just one American, Abigail Edan, has been released. She is 4 years old. She was released yesterday. There was a hope that two more Americans would get released today. That is uncertain. A spokesman for the White House, the National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby said earlier today that he does not know whether that is going to happen. So, during this two-day extension, there is certainly hope and really an expectation from the American side that those two women will be released. Now, I'm told this news of the two-day extension came after President Biden had spoken with the Qatari Prime Minister. And so certainly there is going to be pressure from the United States on Hamas via Qatar that during these two days that more Americans get released, Kaitlan.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, for 20 more families, this is about as welcome news as it gets because there was an open question of whether or not they could even agree to this extension because they're having difficulties just agreeing on the fourth list of hostages. I think the big question you hear, Alex, and I'm not even sure if we have an answer to this because Israel has so little insight into what's going on with these hostages, is if Hamas has 20 more hostages that are together at this point, or do they have to get them and bring them together given we know they've been quite spread out all over Gaza. I mean, what's the sense of what -- of what this could look like if who is left to choose from if we do still understand this next group of potentially 20 more hostages would also still be in that category of women and children?",

      "sentences": "Yes. We still haven't seen the Red Cross go in and check on the other hostages like the Israeli prime minister said was supposed to be a part of this deal. But, Alex, now that they've agreed to 48 more hours, that means, you know, after 7It means 20 more families here are going to be able to welcome home their loved ones at least. What is Hamas get out of agreeing to two more days of an extension? Is it because it's helping them given there's not constant bombardment happening in Gaza?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it really is -- it really is three things. It is a pause in the fighting, which is probably what Israel has feared the most or been most concerned about. Because it gives Hamas a moment to breathe, to reset, to move around the Gaza Strip, to rearm, and to reposition their fighters to gather intelligence about where Israeli forces are.I mean, this really gives those militants who have had -- who've been pummeled for the past seven weeks. I mean, just Israel has been pounding the Gaza Strip. It really does give Hamas a moment to reset. And then it also allows more of this aid to get into Gaza. We understand that this deal says that regardless of when this pause ends, that at least 200 trucks a day of aid are supposed to be going into Gaza. This allows the aid to not only get in but to be spread around and distributed around Gaza more easily. There are so many hundreds of thousands of desperate people, 1.7 million displaced Gazans who desperately need aid. We're so happy to see this pause in the fighting. And so, that is -- that is really the second major part. And the third, Kaitlan, is this question of Palestinian prisoners. You have this three-for-one ratio, three Palestinians released from Israeli jails for every one hostage. That's just for the women and children, Kaitlan. I think that the very interesting moment is who is going to come after these six days. Well, Hamas said they have more women and children to release. Will they start negotiating for some of the men and then that ratio may change? Certainly, when it comes to the IDF soldiers that are holding, you can certainly expect that Hamas is going to be asking for a lot more than three Palestinian prisoners for every soldier that they're holding, Kaitlan.",

      "sentences": "All right, we do have breaking news this hour as we have now learned that Israel and Hamas have now agreed to extend that temporary truce that has been in place for four days, we are on day four right now, for two more days. That could mean more hostages coming home to their families. That would obviously be welcome news to them. It could also mean more Palestinian prisoners being released from Israel going back home to the West Bank. And also, more aid going into Gaza where we know it is so desperately needed by the millions of people who are there.CNN's Oren Liebermann is here tracking this with me. Oren, I should note, it is nearly 7:00 here on the ground local in Israel. We have not actually seen the facilitation of the release of this fourth group of hostages. But this is big news that both sides have agreed to a two-day extension here.",

There was a new list put out. And then we got word of this agreement. Oren Liebermann, thank you.I want to go to CNN's Alex Marquardt. We are breaking this news that a two-day extension has been reached between Israel and Hamas.

      "sentences": "Well, this has been such a high priority for the United States, Kaitlan, that President Biden has really been very intricately involved. He's had numerous conversations with all of his counterparts involved, the Egyptians, the Israelis, the Qataris, over the past few weeks. In just the past three days, he's spoken twice to the Qataris. And that just really speaks to how central that Qataris are to all this.But I understand that President Biden did speak with the Prime Minister of Qatar earlier today. We don't really have a sense yet -- we haven't gotten a readout from the White House, for example of what exactly was said. But certainly, it would have been about the ongoing hostage negotiations, the concern by the United States over the Americans who have not yet been released. There are two women, seven men, there is great concern over their condition. But I just want to pick up also on what Oren was just saying. We've just heard from the Israelis that they believe there are 198 hostages who remain in custody. Again, it's not just Hamas. It's other factions. It's gangs. They're spread out across the Gaza Strip. So, let's just assume that in the next two days that 20 more hostages are released. You're still going to have around 180 who are -- who are inside with, you know, maybe dozens of them are foreign nationals. But a huge number of them are Israelis and Israeli men. And so, it's very feasible that this pause ends soon with the release of a large number of women and children but leaving inside a large number of Israeli men and female soldiers as well. And so, these negotiations are going to drag out for a long time, and they're likely going to drag out as the fighting starts back up again. Israel has indicated that they very much plan to essentially pick up where they left off. And I think a big question for the Biden administration now is, what do they want Israel to do? They've expressed some discomfort with the way that Israel has been prosecuting this war. And I think there's an expectation or hope among many U.S. officials that Israel will not go back at it as forcefully as they were before, Kaitlan.",

We'll see how that factors into those future talks. Alex Marquardt, thank you for that.CNN's Ben Wedeman is also following these developments from Jerusalem for us. Ben, we've heard from what I've seen any statements from Hamas, what are you hearing from official -- from officials there? How are they viewing this two-day extension that they clearly you know, yesterday for the first time had said that they were on board with potentially doing this?",
