Also tonight, Ron DeSantis defends his state's new curriculum on slavery, and filmmaker Spike Lee joins me with his take. Good evening. Hunter Biden went to court today with a plea deal already agreed upon between his attorneys and prosecutors. If all went according to the agreement, he would be the first son of a sitting US president to walk into a federal courthouse and plead guilty to a crime. He would admit to two misdemeanors for not paying federal taxes on time in two calendar years and he would enter into a deal that would resolve a felony gun charge if he abided by the deal's conditions. Now Republicans have characterize his plea as a sweetheart deal and even tried to block it, once again, trying to tie Hunter Biden's dealings to his father. Today, however, in court, all that was needed was the approval of the judge for the deal, and that is where everything began to unravel. Once the federal judge began to question the deal's provisions, including one about immunity from future prosecutions. Kara Scannell joins us now outside the courthouse with more about what happened. So explain why the judge rejected the deal.",

What kind of immunity would Hunter Biden get? And she kept peppering the prosecutors saying, you know, would this exclude him from being prosecuted for maybe not registering as a foreign agent because of his business deals overseas, and the prosecutor said, no, that would not cover that. Now that had Hunter Biden's team kind of caught off guard. They said they thought that that would be the deal. So then initially, both sides, the prosecution, and Biden's team called it off. But then Biden's lawyers asked for more time to try to work something out. They both came back and Biden's lawyers said they would agree to the terms the prosecution laid out. It looked like things were back on track, but then they got to this gun diversion charge and the judge raised questions about the constitutionality of that charge, saying she wasn't prepared at the time to sign off on that and she wanted to hear more from both sides in terms of legal arguments, both on the tax misdemeanor charge, one of them to firm that up, as well as this question of a gun diversion charge -- Anderson.",

At the end of the day, this is the president's son, this is not an elected or appointed official and I think in the eyes of the voter, it would be a strategic miscalculation to try to put this on par with, of course, who will likely be the Republican frontrunner assumed to be thrice indicted former president. So I think you're going to hear a lot of scuttlebutt on the House side of Capitol Hill suggesting this may, you know, lead to impeachment inquiries into Joe Biden.

Those that did believe that in fact, it was connected to Biden were overwhelmingly Republican. And more than that, as we look forward to 2024, what we see is that most Americans say that this will have no impact on their vote at all, and the Americans who do say that are again, Republicans, less likely, they said that they would vote for Joe Biden, but the truth is, they weren't voting for Joe Biden anyway.

I think that there are certainly credible allegations of trading off of his name, influence peddling, but he right now is the first son of a president to be indicted on federal charges.

So, you know, the judicial process, the way civil litigation works is plaintiffs file a complaint, which includes several allegations.In our complaint, we alleged that Mr. Giuliani made false and defamatory statements about our clients, including that they, you know, hid illegal ballots and suitcases under the table to count fraudulent ballots, that they excluded election observers under false pretenses, that they passed USB drives -- all of these statements were false -- and those are the factual allegations of our complaint. Meanwhile, Mr. Giuliani in the motion that he filed last night, or the filing that he filed last night, said: \"Giuliani stipulates to all pertinent facts plaintiffs would need from him to establish liability.\" So to us, that is pretty cut and dry that he has stipulated to all of the factual allegations in the complaint, while potentially reserving some right to make certain legal arguments. But no, the facts are what they are, and we view this as a concession, which is what Mr. Giuliani stated in his filing with the court.",
