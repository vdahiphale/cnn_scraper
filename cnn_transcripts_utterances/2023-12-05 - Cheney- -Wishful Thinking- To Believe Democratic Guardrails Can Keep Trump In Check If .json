Jack Smith, we are learning plans to go back, way back, to tell the jury, at that trial, about Trump's history, of encouraging violence, also his longtime refusal to commit to the peaceful transition of power. The court documents that were just unveiled are striking. We're going to dig into them, with a team of attorneys, in a moment.

I think Trump's election to a second term would mean constitutional crisis, on a daily basis. But I have faith in our constitutional structures. They're strong. And Trump tried to steal the election, as President, in 2020, and failed. So, it will be a tremendous battle, and not one that anybody should look forward to.

And Trump's efforts to steal the election were defeated.I'm always happy to be called naive. It brings back memories of days going by. I'm not naive about this at all. But I'm also not alarmist. Bob Kagan, whom I have a great deal of respect for, an old friend, wrote a lengthy piece, a couple of days ago, comparing Trump to Julius Caesar, and the threat to the Roman Republic. Now, I have to say Caesar must be turning in his grave, to be compared to Donald Trump. But Donald Trump is not Caesar. And the Roman Republic fell not because of Caesar alone, but because of repeated body blows, from the likes of Sulla, Catiline, Pompey, and its own structures were not even comparable to ours. So, I just think you've got to get a grip on this, historically. Be ready for the fight, if Trump's elected. But not put it in terms that confuse people, or actually make it harder to mobilize opposition to Trump, when the need arises. COLLINS: Well, so what are the guardrails that you think would be there, if Trump did try to repeat his actions? Is it the Supreme Court? Is it Congress? Because I mean, the Supreme Court, he picked most -- several -- three of the justices that are on that court. They now lean in a strongly conservative favor. We've seen Republican lawmakers. I mean, Liz Cheney got booted from her position, as a Republican leader, on Capitol Hill, basically, because of the same comments that she's making, tonight.",

I think too many Republicans, in the House, in particular, have been supine, in facing Trump. I hope that changes. But even within the Executive branch, people have to understand, Trump can't just snap his fingers, and expect things to happen. And I think one of the constitutional crises we're going to see is when he tells appointees, even his own appointees, to do things that are illegal, unconstitutional, how many of them resign? And then how many of the career people, in the Justice Department, in the military, start resigning below him? This is the kind of thing that I think will cause enormous turmoil, in the country.

Look, I'm perfectly well-aware of what Trump can try and do, with the Justice Department. He tried to do it to me, with respect to my book, in 2020. And his political appointees, at the top of the Justice Department, did the bidding of the White House, in trying to suppress publication of the book. The real question is because of -- because others have learned as well, certainly Trump has learned from his experience, but others have learned as well, how he will try to manipulate the Justice Department. And we'll see how it goes. We'll see how many of his nominees get confirmed. We'll see how he deals, not just with a few people, being in acting positions, in a place like Justice or the Defense Department, but with everybody being in active positions.

He says that he wants to weaponize the DOJ, to enact revenge, on his political enemies. And so, I would encourage people, who think that we sound like alarmists, when we're saying that, democracy is at stake, if Trump were to be elected, again, for a second term, that you have to pay attention to his own words, because he is saying these things. And unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be penetrating through to the public. And I think it's in large part, because his campaign has actually kind of adopted a basement campaign strategy, circa, Joe Biden's 2020 campaign. And they actually kind of have shielded him, from public view, and have been a little bit more strategic, with his appearances. And so, I think that as we get closer and more, into the 2024 race, it looks obviously inevitable that Trump will be the Republican nominee.

On the other hand, you can't let in evidence that's overly inflammatory. And judges do, from time to time, get reversed, for letting in too much evidence.

And we need to take them at their word. This is not a thought experiment between political scientists as to what might happen if Donald Trump is reelected. This is a very real prospect of completely restructuring and undermining our government, our democracy, in the way that we know, and expect it to function. And that's based simply on what they are actually saying, they're going to do.
