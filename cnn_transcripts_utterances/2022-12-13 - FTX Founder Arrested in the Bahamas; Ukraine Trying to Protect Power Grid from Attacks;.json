That's after U.S. inflation cooled considerably in November. U.S. consumer price growth slowed to 7.1 percent last month. You can see how the markets are reacting. It is green across the board. The Dow, reentering boom market territory in early trading. It's up almost 2 percent. Now the latest numbers show that inflation is easing in the world's biggest economy. The hope is that cooling inflation pressures will lead to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates less aggressively on Wednesday and beyond. All right, so, from crypto celebrity to pariah, a stunning fall from grace for Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the bankrupt crypto currency exchange FTX. He has been indicted on eight criminal charges. That is including wire fraud as well as conspiracy. Authorities say Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday after U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against him. The Securities and Exchange Commission is charging the former CEO, alleging he, quote, \"orchestrated a years-long fraud against FTX investors.\" And there is a question looming over this, where is the money? Where are investors' deposits? At least 1 million FTX depositors who cannot access their funds also want to know. I want to bring in CNN's Anna Stewart. Anna, I think when this happened, when FTX imploded, the big question was, how quickly will the SEC act? When will he get arrested? He was himself, SBF, as he is known, vocal on Twitter. He's been on other platforms, talking about his involvement and how he just didn't know what was going on. Tell me about the timeline leading up to this arrest. The crypto industry and so many others, they've been asking why it's been taking so long.",

Ever since then we saw Binance putting out, trying to sell all its FTT token. And it was a run on FTX. It was rapid, it had to do within about a week, declare bankruptcy and then we started hearing from SBF. As more information came out and more and more SBF was willing to talk, whether that was in the media outlets, on Twitter, in DMs, at a stage that he attended virtually, it became abundantly clear that everything he was saying was likely to end up being used in court. And he hasn't really helped his case here. It has been interesting though, that throughout this, he has said that he didn't wittingly commit fraud. He has made some mistakes, he certainly said that. But he said a lot, take a listen to the some of the things he said in the last few days. We don't seem to have that. Apologies. Essentially he says that he wasn't as competent as he thought he was. He will be working overtime to try and prove that point in the various investigations from criminal CFTC, that's the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and, of course, SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, three investigations working in parallel.",

All right, let's move on now to the effort to help get the Ukrainians through a cold, dark winter of war. The French prime minister says more than $1 billion  has been pledged at a conference in Paris. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy had called for nearly $850 million in aid as he addressed the conference virtually. The money will go to help rebuild and restore Ukraine's badly damaged energy network, as well as for food, water, as well as health care. Covering this story from France, as well as Ukraine, we have CNN's Jim Bittermann in Paris for us and Will Ripley in Kyiv. Jim, I want to start with you, the big question is, the aid package, what is that going to look like? And importantly, is there alignment in terms of what President Zelenskyy is asking for and what donors are putting on the table? JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTL. CORRESPONDENT:  I think it's pretty much absolute alignment. In fact, President Zelenskyy is getting more than what he came in here asking for. He has got more than $1 billion on the table in pledges so far. Just to make the point, this is civilian aid we're talking about. This is not military aid. There has already been billions promised for that. In fact, this is just to help Ukraine get through this winter up until mid March, is the way president Macron suggested it should be when he called the donors to this conference. There are 46 donors here, donor nations, as well as some NGOs. And there is also 700 French companies represented here, which are going to be showing what they can do to help out. Already, France, for example, has pledged over $70 million to help Ukraine through the winter. That includes a number of high power generators, 63 generators. All of the aid that's coming in, it's being focused into different baskets. But the main categories of aid are basically electricity, heat, health, food and transport. Those are the things that the French believe are needed to get Ukraine through the winter. That's the kind of thing that is being pledged today, Eleni.",

Reaching ignition in a controlled fusion experiment is an achievement that has come after more than 60 years of global research, development, engineering and experimentation. The people at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories' national ignition facility reached this, a mission milestone because of the work others did before them. Their analysis of data and models, their continued pursuit to have the best possible facility and their sheer excellence and grit. I would like to thank the members of Congress, thank you so much for being here today, that supported the national ignition facility because your belief in the promise of visionary science has been critical for our mission. I would also like to thank the international partners that worked with us on this, because their collaboration demonstrates the power and possibility of advancing scientific pursuits. Finally, a giant thank you to those talented federal defense programs and national security enterprise teams that supported this work at Lawrence Livermore.

In achieving ignition, the researchers at Lawrence Livermore have opened a new chapter and NSA science-based stockpile stewardship program enabling us to study new regimes. Along with this, we have taken the first tentative steps toward a clean energy source that could revolutionize the world. Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to remember the 30th anniversary of Divider, the last explosives nuclear weapons tests, conducted by the United States. And reflecting on Divider, I spoke of how far our stockpile stewardship program has come and in how many ways we now understand our nuclear weapons better than we did when we were testing. Unlocking ignition at NIF will allow us to probe the extreme conditions found at the center of nuclear explosions and address significant, long- standing stewardship questions. The unprecedented nature of reaching ignition confirms what I and previous administrators at the NSA have been saying for decades:  there is no more dedicated or more talented group of scientists in the world, as it should be. The tireless efforts of thousands of people from around the national security -- nuclear security enterprise and their predecessors are responsible for this breakthrough. We honor their intelligence, their commitment and their determination. Going forward, we know we will make further breakthroughs, we will have further setbacks.

But it's a really important milestone, because, of course, who is going to fund a prototype power plant unless you can demonstrate you can actually produce energy? Really important point on the route. In terms of telling us, look, this is a completely carbon free power source, like nuclear fission, but some of the advantages over fission, which is what's in today's nuclear power stations, is there is no chance of meltdown. And although fusion does produce some radioactive waste, it is only from the chamber itself. It is not waste products, it's not spent fuel. And we think it will probably last maybe 100 years, rather than the long time scale, thousands of years, that some really dangerous fission radioactive waste will last. So for all of those reasons, people think it's a really great power source. And there is enough fuel for potentially millions of years of energy.",

OK, so, what do we need to do to actually turn this into a power source? There's quite a lot, to be honest. This was one shot of a single experiment. If you wanted the same process that we're seeing here for power, you'd have to do that 10 times a second, which is a big difference. And you'd have to get the cost right down as well. Now the important thing to take away here is that the current setup was never built (INAUDIBLE). And this shows us not just that laser fusion can work but it gives us a really good idea that actually other approaches to fusion, that might eventually be more economical to work as well. So I think the biggest effect this is going to have is crowd and investment, innovation, ideas and, frankly, excitement in trying to think about how we take fusion from a scientific experiment to something that might actually be suitable for a power plant and economical in the future.",

Restoring of certain private keys to access hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto assets, without effective security controls for encryption. The ability of Alameda to borrow funds held at ftx.com, to utilize for its own trading or investments without any effective limits whatsoever. The commingling of assets, the lack of complete documentation of transactions involving nearly 500 separate investments, made with FTX group funds and assets. And the absence of audited or reliable financial statements, a lack of personnel in the financial and risk management functions and the absence of independent governance throughout the FTX group. The fundamental challenge we face is there were in many respects starting from near zero in terms of corporate infrastructure and record keeping that one would expect in a multibillion dollar corporation. Still, in just over four weeks, we've instituted meaningful steps to gain command ad control. And every week we get a better understanding of what occurred and the path forward, all with which will be shared with interested parties and affected parties throughout the chapter 11 processes. The scope of our investigation is truly enormous. It involves detailed tracing of money flows and asset transfers, from the time of FTX's founding, and complex technological efforts to identify and trace crypto assets. We're in the process of collecting and reviewing dozens of terabytes of documents and data, including billions of individual transactions that were leveraging sophisticated technology and expertise to identify and trace additional transactions and assets. While many things are unknown at this stage, we're at a very preliminary stage, many questions remain. We know the following. First, customer assets at ftx.com were commingled with assets from the Alameda trading platform, that much is clear. Second, Alameda used client funds to engage in margin training which exposed customer funds to massive losses. Third, the FTX group went on a spending binge in 2021-2022, during which $5 billion  was spent on a myriad of businesses and investments, many of which may only be worth a fraction of what was paid for them. Fourth, loans and other payments were made to insiders in excess of $1.5 billion. Fifth, Alameda's business model as a market maker required funds to be deployed to various third-party exchanges, which were inherently unsafe and further exacerbated by the limited protections offered in certain of those foreign jurisdictions. I know that the resolution of the chapter 11 process, as well as the investigation and the cause of the FTX group's collapse are of keen interest to this committee and to your constituents. Although, you know, there are many who need and deserve answers, there's customers, creditors, investors, counterparties, employees and regulators. We're positioning ourselves to provide each of these constituents with the answers that they deserve. Although a bankruptcy proceeding of this unprecedented nature will take some time to run its course, I've committed to working as quickly as possible to investigate what happened, formulate conclusions and hopefully inform the committee's work here. I should note that my ability to account on certain matters today will be inherently limited by the state of FTX's records, ongoing bankruptcy proceedings and, of course, the numerous ongoing investigations by the U.S. law enforcement regulators.

Because of my plan, we're taking powerful interests to lower -- powerful actions to lower prescription drug costs and health insurance premiums and energy bills. In just a few weeks, starting in January, families will get a little more breathing room. They've been told for some time since we passed the legislation that we're going to be able to lower the price of drugs. Let me give you just one example. Coming January 1, seniors with diabetes on Medicare are going to pay no more than $35 a month for a prescription of insulin. They, up to now, they've been paying as much as $400 a month. That's a genuine savings for seniors. This matters to so many families with loved ones who have diabetes and rely on insulin to survive, going from an average of $400 down to 15 -- or $35 a month. In January, they won't have to choose between paying their insulin -- paying for their insulin and, in many cases, putting food on the table. It matters. It's real savings to people and it's just about to kick in. The same is true from healthcare to clean energy. By taking action, we're making real progress in strengthening and stabilizing our economy, giving Americans across the country some breathing room in the process. Look, I know it's been a rough few years for hardworking Americans and for small businesses as well. And for a lot of folks, things are still pretty rough. But there are bright spots all across America where we're beginning to see the impact of our economic strategy and we're just getting started. I say it again:  I've never been more optimistic about America's future. And today's news gives me another reason to be optimistic about that future. We're building a better America, an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down. When the -- when the poor have a shot and the middle class do well, the wealthy always do very well. We just have to keep going. I know we can get this done. And God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. And I'll take questions -- I'm going to be seeing y'all a little later this afternoon. I'm not taking any questions right now. Thank you very much.",

Jin, this Tuesday afternoon, became officially the first member of the pop sensation BTS to start his military service. At about quarter to 2:00 this Tuesday afternoon, we did see six black vehicles heading into the military barracks. And there was significant security. It is believed that Jin was part of the convoy. Now they had asked -- the management company and BTS -- that fans known as the Army don't come to see him off. There were a few that turned up, though. One in particular, Mandy Lee from Hong Kong, had flown in especially to say goodbye. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There was a law passed a couple of years ago, saying that anybody who excelled at popular culture or art could defer it. And BTS certainly ticks that particular box. There are some professional athletes who have won a medal at the Olympics, for example, or the gold at the Asian games, also some classical artists who have been exempted. But there was tremendous debate as to whether BTS should be exempted as well. But it's not the case and there will be seven of them in all that will be starting their military training. We saw families saying goodbye to young men here. There was one 20-year- old, also called Jin, who said he was nervous but also excited to be starting at the same time as Jin.
