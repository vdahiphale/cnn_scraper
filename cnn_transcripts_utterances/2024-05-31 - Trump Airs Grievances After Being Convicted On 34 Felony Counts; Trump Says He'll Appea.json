He also is saying that the judge just led an unfair trial, saying that he looks like an angel, but he is the devil.And he also made some statements against the prosecution's key witness, Michael Cohen.

And so I think you will probably see challenges that draw the most attention around the due process claims and those deal specifically with whether or not he was adequately placed on notice of the specific allegations of the specific crimes that he was alleged to have committed in the charging document. And I'm talking specifically about when they bumped this up from a misdemeanor to a felony and they tried to say, well, he did all this with the intention to commit another crime.Well, whether or not that other crime was fully explained - whether or not that was fully explained to the jury, this whole question of did they have to find something unanimous or they didn't have to be unanimous on which of the other crimes were involved and how that intent would be formed in those other crimes. These are things that I think you will see great interest in, in the Court of Appeals and ultimately could ultimately be of interest in a federal court of whether or not there's been some deprivation of rights and due process rights there. I don't think you're going to see much in the way of a venue change. That's just - that's kind of just talk right now. We're beyond that. And you may see some good arguments made around whether or not his expert witness was improperly excluded. That may be something that you say.

I think that Justice Merchan showed admirable restraint and even handedness throughout the case. You know, it is true that whenever a party loses, they feel disaffected and upset with the presiding judge. That's the nature of the business of judging. But I can't see that that there was anything unfair. He has appellate grounds, of course, as Michael just said, with respect to some of the charges and he'll exercise those rights.

And even though they admonished him, they felt that he was fine to sit.And I and I think his conduct demonstrated that he didn't have a bias and didn't have a lean.

Typically, a change of venue, Boris, is when there's pretrial publicity, you know, that so affects the jury pool that you can't find a fair jury.Look, everybody in the country knew something about this case. So that wasn't going to be the basis for any change in venue. He just wanted to get it out into, you know, presumptively favorable territory. He's a New Yorker.

You know, he's at a point now, you know, where he's trying to test the parameters of the gag order.And by the way, you know, the gag order is still in effect. And it's going to be in effect until Judge Merchan lifts the gag order. So this is a guy who's not like any other defendant, frankly, that I've ever seen. He keeps running his mouth. You know, he keeps threatening people. He's saying things that are really beyond the pale. This is not the sort of prototypical defendant, you know, who leads up to a sentencing by minding his business and doing the right things. And by the way, you know, as far as his record is concerned, you know, that he's not going to recidivate, which Michael sort of implied. We have to remember that since the factual array that formed the basis of the case in which he was convicted on 34 counts yesterday, he was indicted in two federal jurisdictions and one state jurisdiction, you know, for violating the law. So, you know, if you evaluate whether or not he's going to reoffend, you know, you have to look at what has happened in the last couple of years, plus the way he conducted himself at the trial with all of the contempt citations.

Now, if you can't feel sorry for that guy (INAUDIBLE) want to make my president. The problem is he is exclusively focused on himself. And this is where I think the Biden campaign needs to take it. He's - Mr. Trump's in it for himself. I'm in it for you, right? Mr. Trump cares desperately about staying out of prison. That's his most important job right now is keep himself out of prison. But he seems to be fixated only on his own grievances, and grudges, and vengeance, and his business deals, and he's complaining about the last election and the last jury trial. Biden has an opportunity here not to push on the criminality, but to push on what voters care about, right?

That's a 14 point swing in a one point race. Now, I don't think they'll do it. I think people overstate that when they're polled. Trump also has done remarkably well, much better than he has in the past with younger voters. Same poll. Good poll for Trump. Twenty-one percent of those younger voters said if he's convicted, 21, they'll switch from Trump to Joe. Now, Biden has an obligation here, though, to build a bridge for them, to give them a permission structure. And it doesn't come by talking about Trump's criminality.
