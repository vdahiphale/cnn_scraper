It has been quite a day and quite a night!First, Kevin McCarthy lost his sixth vote, to become House Speaker. The House then adjourned. A round of intense attempt to deal-making ensued. Members then reconvened, briefly, only to adjourn again, until noon tomorrow, with would-be Speaker, now seemingly more upbeat, about his chances. CNN's Manu Raju first broke that news for us. He joins us again, tonight, from the Capitol. So, why are things looking more upbeat, for McCarthy?",

      "sentences": "He is hearing some more positive responses, from those opponents, people that have essentially seemed immovable, for the past two days.But after a meeting, in which McCarthy has made a number of concessions, ranging on political issues, how this outside group engages on some key issues, as well as giving them more power, and more sway, over themselves, the rank-and-file, at the expense of the leadership? Some of these members sound like they're moving in his direction. Congressman Mike Cloud, for one, sounds like he's moving. He says these talks are moving, in a positive light, in his view, as well as Scott Perry, another opponent, of his. Chip Roy, another one as well, though Chip Roy just mentioned to me, earlier that he is still -- that he still want to see everything they have talked to, in writing. So, there is significant amount work to go. Now, there is also a lot of tension within the ranks. I just talked to Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus. But she's one, who has been an outspoken supporter, of Kevin McCarthy. She told me that \"Republican Party looks like an embarrassment, right now.\" And she -- also, those are her words. And she also went and said that she spoke to Congressman Byron Donalds, who was nominated today, to challenge Kevin McCarthy, who received 20 votes, enough to deny, McCarthy, the Speakership. She said she told Donalds that essentially that he needs to figure out a way, for this to end. She said that -- I asked, \"Well, how did he respond?\" And she said, he sort of acknowledged that her response, and she says that she's getting attacked by Conservatives. And even though a lot of members of the House Freedom Caucus are supporting Kevin McCarthy, they need to figure out a way to end this. So, the pressure is really growing, from all sides here. But, real indications that, potentially Kevin McCarthy could get there, but he's just not there, yet, Anderson, because of the narrowness, of the House Republican majority. 222 seats, meaning he can't lose more than four Republican votes. Already, there are four very, very hard-no votes. Others, like Ralph Norman, who is not considering as part of those four very, very hard- no votes, just told reporters, moments ago that his position has not changed. Others are signaling that they're still not there yet. So, there will be more negotiations to be had. But nevertheless, McCarthy, as he left the chamber, sounded very upbeat. He has been sounding upbeat, as he's lost these six ballot votes, but still believes he can eventually get there. Can he get there by noon tomorrow, Anderson? Still a question. I asked him that question directly. He said he does not want to put a timeframe on it. But he says he believes progress is being made, talks will continue, and that he'll eventually get there, Anderson.",

      "sentences": "Well, there's been a flurry of meetings, tonight.So, I'm told that Kevin McCarthy met with a group of freshman members, who voted against him. This was really an opportunity to get some face-time, with these members, who have not had that opportunity, because they are new to Congress. And basically, he just walked through some of the concessions that he already made, and some of these promises, in greater detail. But the bigger negotiations going on, tonight, are involving Chip Roy, and some of McCarthy's allies. And I am told that these are some of the most serious and productive negotiations, they've seen, thus far, throughout this entire saga. And Chip Roy told GOP leadership that he believes, based on how these negotiations are going, and if they pan out, that he can bring 10 members along, with him, and that additional members might be willing to vote, \"Present.\" Now, obviously, that's a big if, that being negotiations going the right way, and all 10 members actually flipping, to vote for McCarthy. But that doesn't bring him to 218. He still has a long way to go. And I think it's an important distinction, to separate some of these opposition, some of these opponents. You have people like Chip Roy, who seem to be trying to get something in earnest. He says he's still pushing for a number of procedural and policy issues. He said he is still pushing to make it, so that a single lawmaker can call for a vote, to depose the sitting Speaker. He's also pushing for more representation, on the House Rules Committee, which is important, because that has sway, over what bills come to the floor, how they come to the floor, that sort of thing. It's very inside baseball, but it matters a lot, up here. But he made a distinction, when he was talking to us earlier, he made a distinction, between himself, and some of these other opponents, who've been trying to make more personal asks. I reported earlier today that Matt Gaetz, for example, went to McCarthy's office, on Monday evening, and made a list of demands, including wanting a Subcommittee gavel, on the House Armed Services Committee. But Chip Roy is seeming to try to put some distance between himself, and some of those asks. But really, it's going to come down to the math, of course, and how many members are in the never-Kevin camp. As of right now, we know of five Republicans, who say they are firm-Nos. As of right now, that includes Ralph Norman, as Manu mentioned. He came out, just moments ago, and said he is still going to vote for Byron Donalds, on that first ballot. And so, McCarthy is trying to wear down his opponents, one by one. It's starting with this group that's being led by Chip Roy. But that will only be the beginning of his path, to 218.",

Obviously, that would take 218 votes. So, they would need agreement to do that. But they feel like they're moving in the right direction. They want to be able to show that the opposition is shrinking. Even if he doesn't get 218, on the next ballot, they want to show that they're moving in the right direction, not the wrong direction.",

If that comes down to five or one, again, that's self-destructive, for whoever the Republican Speaker is, again, just handing rope, to your opponents, to hang you with. There's that.

I mean, to the extent that they will end up nominating, Republicans, who are on the far-right fringe, who will not be part of the governing majority, they will not vote for the things that need to get done? Those people will get elected. And, in some cases, they'll elect Democrats, because some of those folks will be too far to the right. Again, I just think it's very self-destructive. Somebody should talk to the more moderate pragmatic members, of the House Republican Conference, about that deal. I can't imagine any of them are happy about it. I would think they would be livid over it that that Super PAC will not play in primaries. Of course, they should. And everybody knows it. So, that one just slows you (ph).

Is it clear how much power, to you, he would actually have?NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I agree with Jonah, here. He wouldn't have much power, if he actually makes it, and neither would Steve Scalise, or Byron Donalds, or any of these other folks they are putting forward. It's the nature of the giveaways that he or whoever would have to make, to give this Caucus. And it's the nature of that motion to vacate, which is now five, could go down to one. So, whoever is in that seat is going to have to constantly think about the fact that they have to please these five people, or else those five people, can sort of band together, and raise the motion, to pull the Speakership. We've seen this time and time again, right? This is could be history repeating itself, because we saw this happen with Boehner. That's why he left town, because of the threat of the motion to vacate. And same, with Paul Ryan. So, this is a very organized band of people. They're not necessarily committed to any sort of ideology, other than sticking it to who they view as the Establishment. And they certainly view Kevin McCarthy that way. And, in some ways, whoever would be in that position, as the Speaker of the House, I think would draw their ire. So, I think we are seeing this transformation, of Kevin McCarthy, from somebody, who had been with the young guns, right, with Paul Ryan and Eric Cantor? They were policy wonks. He never really was. But he wanted to hang out with them. And now, he's hanging out with Marjorie Taylor Greene. So, this is a full-on transformation. It's in some ways why those five people, and a few more, actually don't believe he is a true believer, in any real cause that his real cause is Kevin McCarthy.",

It's called the 60-minute meeting, happening 60 minutes before the game starts, where the medical teams, from both sides, both teams, get together. And they really go over everything. They do drills, on what could possibly happen. They have a person, who's clearly in charge of running a resuscitation, should one be necessary, someone, who's in charge of carrying the defibrillator. I actually didn't know a lot of the details, of these types of protocols that take place, at all football games. They have a Level One Trauma Center, standing by, obviously, an ambulance, there, at the field. And they gave us some sense of how those things sort of played out, with regard to Mr. Hamlin. Team doctors go out first. As soon as they sort of determine that more is necessary, there is hand signals, and radio. They do both, because it can get very loud in the stadium. They bring in the paramedics. And we saw some of that unfold. But it was hard to get a sense of it, as if you were just witnessing it. But all those things are sort of taking place. And there's going to be lessons learned here. They think it went really well, in terms of the resuscitation. That's how they described it. But there's always some more lessons to be learned.

Typically, when someone says there are signs of improvement, given the nature of what we know, his cardiac arrest, and the impact on his lungs as well, it would probably revolve around that. Is his heart starting to take over more and more activity, requiring fewer medications? Is it becoming easier, to actually ventilate, use the breathing machine, without having to use higher settings, to have him prone? Those are the sorts of things you're sort of looking for.

And the sedation then would require someone be on a breathing machine. They may use something known as hypothermia, something you and I've talked about. But when you actually cool the body, you're lowering the metabolic demands that the body has on the heart. So, you're trying to give the heart and lungs a little bit of a break here.
