A van then driving the suspect to the courthouse with a large motorcade.CNN Shimon Prokupecz is now outside the courthouse for us in Manhattan.

And it'll be his initial appearance on the federal charges, those four charges, the two charges for stalking and murdering allegedly Brian Thompson, a firearms charge.And so that is what we expect to happen. It'll be his first time here in a New York court. Coming back to New York in quite a different way. Really, just a sort of believable to see the way in which he was transported here to New York City. An NYPD plane picking him up in Pennsylvania, meeting him at an airport was an NYPD helicopter in Long Island. They then flew him to the Wall Street heliport where he was met by dozens of law enforcement officials, the mayor of this city, the highest ranking officials of the NYPD, all there waiting for him. And it was quite a spectacle and really just remarkable to see the way in which they presented him, the way in which they accepted him, the way in which they walked him through that heliport into a waiting van where then FBI agents with the NYPD brought him here to the courthouse, took him into custody here, the FBI did. And now he's facing these very significant federal charges that make him eligible for the death penalty. Now, he wasn't on the state case, but it's quite different now. And so we wait for this hearing to get underway here shortly.",

We have CNN Legal Analyst, Joey Jackson, a Criminal Defense Attorney, retired New York Police Detective, Michael Alcazar, now an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal justice, and CNN Senior Legal Analyst, Elie Honig, a former State and Federal Prosecutor. Thank you all for being with us. Elie, first, I want to go to you because you know this courthouse extremely well. Give us an idea of what it actually looks like since cameras aren't allowed inside. ELIE HONIG, CNN Senior Legal Analyst: Yeah, Boris. I spent many, many hours and days inside this courthouse. So what's happening today? What will happen shortly is an arraignment. So before that, Luigi Mangione is going through some basic processing through the court officers, through the marshals. They'll take his prints. They'll ask him some basic questions. When the court proceedings ready, he'll be walked into what we call magistrates court. Now, if you're trying to envision this, it's not these sort of soaring ornate federal courtroom where most trials happen. This is sort of an unglamorous dingier courtroom. The ceiling's lower, it's darker, it's smaller, and usually it's just used as a place for sort of initial processing. So Mangione will sit at his table with his lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo by his side. The prosecutors for the SDNY will be at the other table. The judge will essentially say, Mr. Mangione, you've been -- you've been not indicted. Excuse me. You've been charged by complaint. Have you seen the complaint? Have you gone through it with your lawyer? He'll say, yes. The judge may ask, how do you plead? If that question gets asked, he will say, I plead not guilty. Do you have a lawyer? Mangione will say, yes, I do. This is the person sitting right next to me. And then the judge will say to the lawyer, do you want to make a motion on bail here? Meaning do you want to ask for bail? He might ask for bail. Karen Friedman Agnifilo might ask for bail for him. But that's just to put on a show. There's zero chance that he gets bail. And then from that point, the prosecutors, the federal prosecutors will have 30 days under the rule, and under some readings, 20, it sort of depends on the nuances here, but 20 to 30 days to go to a grand jury and get an indictment. At that point, the case will be assigned to a district judge and will be underway in the familiar, normal criminal process.",

That's in large part because of the amount of evidence that investigators have gathered here, what they found on Mangione when he was apprehended in Altoona.I do wonder how you see federal investigators working with the NYPD and what New York detectives have gathered. Do they basically just pick up from what they have, or do they then these federal investigators have to start their own investigation?",

Of course they're going to look at the information that's being shared with them by the NYPD, but they're going to do their due diligence, do their own investigation. Look at all the evidence.I mean, there's a wealth of evidence here what the NYPD recovered at the crime scene, the gun on Mangione, the bullets at the crime scene that now match the DNA evidence on the bottle, the water bottle, and on the phone, his manifesto, his fingerprints on the manifesto on the scene. So it's going to be a joint effort, but I believe the Feds will do their own -- conduct their own investigation and then compare what they have with the NYPD.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So big issue to watch here in the coming weeks and months. Just to be clear, New York State law does not have a death penalty. So in the state case, the most that Luigi Mangione could be sentenced to is life in prison. But here in the federal court, which we're looking at here on the screen, this one of the charges against Luigi Mangione can potentially be punished by the death penalty.Now, there's a process here. DOJ first has to go through its internal process. If you're the prosecutor on this case, you have to write a memo that goes down to the Attorney General's office in D.C. where you recommend we should or should not seek the death penalty, then the AG and his people in D.C. will review that, and if the decision comes back, yes, we are going to seek the death penalty, then that's the case. But DOJ does not always seek the death penalty in all death eligible cases, the kind of things you look at are just how heinous was the crime, what's the nature of the crime, how premeditated was it, how many victims were there? Are there larger societal needs here, deterrence rehabilitation? That kind of thing that would weigh for or against the death penalty. So that process usually takes weeks or months to play out. But important to notice, there's going to be a big difference when the Trump administration takes over DOJ in three weeks. I mean, Donald Trump's DOJ was way more aggressive during his first term in imposing the death penalty, certainly than recent Democratic administrations have been. [14:15:06] Biden administration has sought death penalty in two cases, two mass shootings. But I think the chances of a death penalty being sought here are going to go up when Donald Trump's sworn in, when his DOJ takes over in January.",

That is the jury essentially deciding that this person may have committed the act that they're accused of, but that on the greater whole, it would be unjust for them to face a sentence effectively. And you can correct me if I'm misrepresenting jury nullification, but I wonder how that now potentially applies to federal charges.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Boris, indeed. I mean, I think most people would be screaming at the screen and probably are right? Saying, jury nullification? What are talking about? He's guilty. Look at this evidence. Have you not seen the criminal complaint here in federal court where it lays out chapter and verse? He's on his bicycle, it talks about the manifesto, it talks about to the Feds. He's guilty, even looking at this.Not so fast. Obviously, you have the presumption of innocence. However, from all public indications, the evidence is really strong. The reason we're here talking about, at least, you know, you raised the issue of jury nullification is. We've seen social media. I have never, right? And I'd be curious to know if Elie has ever seen a case like this where social media really is calling him a hero. He's being called St. Luigi. They're selling T-shirts with angels on them. They're selling trinkets for Christmas. People on social media are saying, hey, it should have been me to do this. It should have happened before, you know, it should happen again. It's insane. And so why is that relevant? Why is public perception relevant? Why am I talking about social media? Because we're talking about a jury pool now, of course, the Southern District's jury pool. Lot different from a Manhattan jury poll to the extent that it's more, right? It's a broader area that you have to cover. And I don't know whether that's better or worse with respect to the number of people who are going to be there, the number of people evaluating. Now, I should also say very briefly that you select a jury, and if there's jurors who say, I hate the health care system, I hate government, I don't like anybody. Most of all, you defense attorney and you prosecutor, whatever, you excuse them. They're called challenges for cause. But you have a limited number of people who are ultimately, right? Going to be on that jury. And those are the people you agree to. But people are people. They have visions, they have emotions, they have perspectives. Will they say, you know what? Wow, this is long overdue. That's something to look for with regard to a hung jury, with regard to a jury that nullifies. You know, I don't know that they will. But if ever there was a case, right? Where it would be a jury that would nullify. And last, last point, look at the last election. The public has spoken with regard to what they feel about the government, with regard to what they feel about the country and the direction it's heading, the distrust of government, just the feelings overall about politics. They wanted someone in the office who could just be, you know, just a norm breaker. I'm looking for that as it relates to this case. To be sure.",

It was highly unusual for a prosecutor to that.",
