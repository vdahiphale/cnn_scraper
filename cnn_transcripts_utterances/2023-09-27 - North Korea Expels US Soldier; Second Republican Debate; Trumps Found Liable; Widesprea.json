As for Donald Trump, he will not be there.

And really capitalize on DeSantis' downward slide and trajectory in the poll. So, what you are expecting to see tonight as these campaigns are projecting in their comments are saying, look, they are going to be more aggressive. They are going to take it to Trump. We've certainly heard them testing out some of these anti-Trump lines from the Haley camp. We've heard from Tim Scott's campaign that he is going to push a more aggressive tone, and Vivek Ramaswamy's campaign has told CNN that what he is going to do is to lay out those policy and personality disagreements he has with Donald Trump on the debate stage tonight. And I want to point you to this comment that Ron DeSantis made just hours before showing up here in Simi Valley.

Trump's team is not expecting him to get a warm welcome from union leaders like we saw for President Biden yesterday. Those union leaders have largely criticized Trump and his administration saying his policies were pro-business, anti-union and anti-worker. But what they do think is that they can get people here in Macomb County to receive Trump and receive him well.Now, Macomb County is a county in Michigan that Trump won, both in 2016 and in 2020. And I'm told by Trump officials, they believe that there is a wedge between union leadership and the rank and file. And that's what we're expecting to see here tonight. These previous former and current union members, including from the United Auto Workers and their families, and the question is whether or not Trump can be well received by these rank and file. Now this location that we're at, it's called Drake Enterprises. It is a non-union shop. But one of the arguments that we are told Trump is going to make, it's all about electric vehicles, essentially slamming Biden's electric vehicle policy saying that's going to cost auto worker jobs. Well, we heard from the President of this location, of Drake Enterprises, yesterday in an interview, where he said that if electric cars were to become prevalent, that he would be out of business. So giving you a little bit of an idea there of why they chose this specific location. But again, these working class voters, Michigan itself, that propelled Trump to the White House in 2016. It's also the same group that propelled Biden to the White House in 2020. Whether or not Trump can actually get these voters this time around, it's going to be a very different landscape than it was in 2016 when he didn't have a record to run on. And again, those union leaders, they're hitting back on Trump's record,. They're saying he is not pro-labor. So it'll be interesting to see how exactly that plays out in the state.",

And, you know, Nikki Haley, why did she gain so much in the last debate, and she did gain from the last debate. Partly, it was because she energetically rebutted Ramaswamy.
