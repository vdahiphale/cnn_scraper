      "sentences": "It was an ugly day. Just to give you some context here, this is the worst trading day for stock markets in nearly two years. In the early minutes of the session today, we saw around a trillion worth of wealth wiped off just a handful of the biggest tech stocks. So ugly is the way to describe it.I won't use the word panic. This is not panic. Let's be clear. But there is a palpable concern out there that the U.S. economy is slowing far quicker than we thought. And that was fueled by, as you said, the jobs number that we got on Friday, weaker manufacturing data last week as well. It's raised questions about why on Earth the Fed didn't cut rates last week, if it knew this data was coming. And I think there's justifiable concern there. I also think we have to take a step back briefly and just say, look, we're still overall adding jobs to the U.S. economy. No ones talking about imminent recession, but they are talking about rising risks and that the Fed should act on that. And I think they will. Now, if it would just that, I'd be tempted to suggest that there's an overreaction going on in stock markets. But the problem is it's not just that. One of the strongest pillars of the markets so far this year has been the tech stocks. And we've now for a number of days seen a lot of people taking money off the table. They're still in profit, but they're just taking money off the table and that's had an impact. Fast forward to what we saw last night, the Japanese stock market, that fell 12 percent. Now that is panic and you don't see something like that without seeing pressure on U.S. markets. Plus, it's summer time. There's simply less investors out there. Jake, I will say the silver linings, the conversation has changed now over the Fed. It's not about if they cut rates in September, it's about how much they do. And I think that's the right conversation to be having.",

And we need to lower them again. Well, you know, let's -- let's take it one step at a time. This Fed has been very focused on main mainstream, very focused on making sure that inflation doesn't hit working people in their pocketbooks. And I think that that is where the emphasis should be. Investors have made a lot of money in recent years. You know, we're talking not about losses right now. We're talking about gains being given back. And I would note that aside from tech stocks and some of the other sectors, there were even at the end of this trading day, some gains in areas like industrials, real estate.

We're not -- I don't think were going to see any kind of emergency meeting.

Quote, Fetterman's advisers suggested to Harris his team that the senator believes that Shapiro is excessively focused on his own personal ambitions. I can't believe an ambitious politician, shocking, shocking thing.But I mean, it doesn't help to have you know, a senator from your own party in your own commonwealth, bad mouthing you as a potential pick. MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS &amp; PUBLIC SERVICE: I -- look, I don't know anything about this process, but I would be shocked if that pushes Kamala Harris away from Josh Shapiro. I don't know that she's going to pick him. But here's what I do believe that Democrats are hungry to beat Donald Trump. That is first and foremost on their minds. She's got three candidates here in front of her that you can make a compelling argument, can help with that. And that's the number one rule, job of a running mate in the campaign, at least phase of this whole process is to help you win. If Shapiro can help her win a point or two in Pennsylvania, that could be enough. If Walz can help her win a point or two in Minnesota or Kelly in Arizona that could be enough. And so, I'm fairly confident that, yeah, you're going to have people taking pot shots at some of the candidates, right now in favor of their favorite candidate.
