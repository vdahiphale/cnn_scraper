Since October 7th, we've been documenting unprecedented wave of settler violence. Which is backed by the Israeli military and police.And it's all part of an effort that has two aims. The more immediate and specific one is to forcibly displace the people -- these communities from their land and handing it over to Israeli Jewish settlers. And the other one is that some groups also within represented in the government, the Israeli Government, but definitely a lot of settlers on the ground want to exacerbate the situation and open a new front in the West Bank in addition to what goes on in Gaza and the perimeter of Gaza.",

Understandably, after the atrocities that Hamas committed on October 7th. But I don't think that this wave of violence against innocent farmers receives any type of widespread support among the Israeli public.I think the opposite. I think many are very much afraid that the West Bank is going to go up in flames and that this is a nightmare for most Israelis. We don't need more violence in this region. So I don't think it receives any sort of popular support. But settlers and their political groups are overrepresented in the Israeli government, which is the most far-right government Israel ever had. And unfortunately, the silent majority is silent and also focused on really the horrible things that happened in Gaza, and also happens in the in the rest of Israel with Hamas launching rockets, Hezbollah launching rockets from the North. People have their mindset on other things, on immediate issues, on their children, staying home, not able to go to school. So, understandably, they're less focused on what happens to -- in the West Bank. And settlers are using that in order to gain more land and to induce more fire.",

I can't find words to express how -- how horrified I am that Jewish people can even fathom conducting such horrible things. That said, it's the onus of the Israeli Government to disprove this.There are elements in this government that has called for similar things that are supporting similar things. And you know, it's by their own words. We know that the Israeli Finance Minister said wipe out Hawara just a few months ago. It's up to them to say -- to downplay it. It's not up to me. I'm worried that people that are supportive of the such ideas are part of the Israeli Government.

Qatar has negotiated a deal between Israel, Hamas and Egypt in coordinated -- coordination with the United States to get all foreign nationals and critically injured civilians released from Gaza. And that is according to a source familiar with those talks. It's important to note that this agreement is separate from any hostage negotiations, and there are no details yet on exactly how many people could be released or when that might happen. We have Scott McLean here with us who's tracking these fast-moving developments. Scott, are you learning anything else at this state?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so the details that we have so far are from Becky Anderson's sources -- a source familiar with the talks that have been ongoing. Obviously, you have to have a lot of parties on the same page in order to make anything happen at the Rafah border crossing. You need the Israelis, you need Hamas, then you need the Egyptians to all agree for anything to happen at all.So this source has told our Becky Anderson that there will be 500 foreigners allowed to cross. There are some four or five, maybe 600 Americans there alone. Obviously, there will be many other people holding various other foreign passports. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but we could be talking about thousands of potentially foreigners who've been trapped inside Gaza. So 500 is very likely not all of the foreigners. I think the open question at this stage is, is this a sign of things to come? Is this a sign that foreigners are finally going to be let -- be let out? Because it's been pretty bewildering to see people holding foreign passports saying I want out of this war zone and essentially the gates being shut. It's been pretty remarkable to see. You know, I'm struggling to find a comparison in another conflict where foreigners have been sort of trapped inside. Even on the Israeli side, foreigners were, you know, on some of the first flights out and were allowed to leave. But in Gaza, they have been stuck there. And now, at least some of them might be leaving. I understand we have a live shot of the Rafah border crossing. It's not clear whether some or any of these foreigners have actually been able to cross yet. But that is the expectation at this point. Obviously, there are ambulances on the Egyptian side waiting to take some 80 or so -- 80 or 81 wounded -- critically injured Palestinians to a field hospital that's been set up very close to the Rafah border crossing. Sheikh Zuweid City is where it's located. And again, 81 is surely a drop in the bucket when we talk about some of the strikes that we have been seeing. Thing like in the refugee camp, the Jabalya refugee camp where, you know, the number of wounded and killed -- we don't have final numbers, but it may well turn out to be a very high number. And that's just one day. We're seeing these kind of strikes all the time. The IDF says that there were 11,000 targets that have been hit since the outset of the war in the 3 1/2 weeks or so since the outset of the war. And so, given that hospitals are filling up fast, given that they obviously don't have the resources that they need and that we're seeing people being treated on the floor effectively, it would be undoubtedly a positive sign if this were the beginning of a new trend. To allow injured Palestinians out and obviously foreigners out as well.",

What is the purpose of the visit? What is King Charles hoping to get out of it?FOSTER (on camera): So it's really, you know, he's here on government advice. So they're trying to establish a firm relationship between Kenya and the UK, forge a new relationship going forward. Of course, getting those economic ties really firmed up as well post Brexit. So it's about forward-looking. But they -- being forward-looking. We're going to see a bit more about that later on in the tour. But this first part was really dealing with the big sort of elephant in the room. Which is the rebellion and that horrendous suppression that the Brits put upon the people of Kenya. And we've actually just had King Charles at this cemetery, this war cemetery. He met World War II veterans, one of which was 117 years old. Samuel he was called. They actually had to throw their medals away during the uprising in the 1950s because they didn't want to be associated with the UK. Today, Charles came here and presented them with new medals.
