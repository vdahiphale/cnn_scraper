The way that Ukraine has used longer range weapons to hit Russian targets in Crimea, it's fair to say they pushed a lot of Russia's fleets there, strategically important towards the Black Sea Russian coast, so far away from NATO territory, strategic victory there, but also too we talked to Speaker Johnson about reform in Ukraine, touching on the sensitive issue here with those in Congress about corruption in Ukraine. Most, Boris, see some form of corruption, because of the intensive expenditure.But this theme continues, it seems, to dog Ukraine in trying to get the billions it's become used to, almost weekly in announcements from the Pentagon and White House to keep this war afloat. But Zelenskyy is facing a complex time here. His defense minister, frankly, joking that the chief of the army, the chief of staff of the armed forces, Zaluzhnyi here, hadn't in fact been fired. There's a clearly a public dispute between the Ukrainian president and his commander in chief that's been talked about in Ukrainian society a lot over the past months because essentially how the counter-offensive over the summer didn't really work. Combined with that, the crisis in funding they're now seeing, the fact that Russia has clearly been waiting, eager for this moment of Western unity and support to begin to crumble. Well, we're looking for a very bleak winter ahead here. There are some suggestions that if Congress doesn't put something on the table that Ukraine can start to increase its funding with before the end of the week when they potentially go away for the holidays, they could, according to one lawmaker here, begin to have trouble paying salaries to doctors, first responders in January. Today, we got a taste of exactly what it would look like if Russia gets more in its front foot, loses reporters in Avdiivka, a town in the east. Now, a U.S. intelligence report has suggested that maybe 13,000 Russians have become casualties as Russia tries to push for that eastern town, one of the number they maybe be able to take by just slowly grinding their way through, but a large cyber attack across Ukraine has damaged access to cell phones, impeded, in fact, the work of air raid sirens, air raid alerts on people's phones. Civilians here are worried they're going to see a bleak winter as civilians and potentially front lines starve with the cash that have kept Ukraine's defense alive. Back to you.",

He could get the border through. That's looking like a worse and worse bet as time goes on.Then there are the Ukraine specific issues that you've brought up. As you say, we haven't heard a huge amount. I'm sure there's some corruption going on. But let's face it. We've been sending them mostly arms made in the United States or brought out from the allies. There's not a whole lot to steal that would be in the way of actual cash, except for the support for the Ukrainian government. Not a lot of evidence there. The biggest problem they're facing is the war is beginning to turn on them. The Russians, as we have all discussed, screwed up a lot of things in the first 18 months. But they have now got more manpower coming in. They've got more artillery coming in. They're using their electronic warfare better. And it's coming at the very moment that Putin may believe that we're beginning to crack in our own support, our own willingness to go do this. And if the U.S. cracks, Europe will be next.",

Because at that point, former president, Trump, has said he will solve this war in 24 hours.

It's a good thing that the election is going to be a little bit less than a year from now. There is time.The Democratic coalition will come home. That is what we have seen in presidential election after presidential election. There also doesn't seem to be a focus on the Joe Biden-Donald Trump contrast yet, why? Because Donald Trump still isn't the official nominee of the Republican Party. Once that happens, and I believe it will happen, then that contrast between Joe Biden, the massive accomplishments that he has done in the years that he has been in the last three years, versus Donald Trump, who by his own words will be a dictator on day one and the incredible threat that he is to our democracy, plus everything else in terms of the things that he will take away that the American people now enjoy, I think will be a contrast that Joe Biden will win on election day.",
