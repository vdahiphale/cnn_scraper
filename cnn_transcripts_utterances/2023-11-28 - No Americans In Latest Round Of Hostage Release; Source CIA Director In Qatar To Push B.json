This is moments ago at Sheba hospitals, one of the largest hospitals in the country, not that far from where we're standing right now. This is shortly after a helicopter landed, bringing the hostages from Kerem Shalom from the crossing where they had entered Israel and taking them to Sheba Medical Center. Eight of the hostages taken there. We have not yet gotten an update on their condition.We expect that sometime later on tonight, perhaps very early tomorrow morning. Two other Israeli hostages were taken to Ichilov Medical Center, also in Tel Aviv. And then two foreign nationals were taken to Shamir Assaf Harofeh Medical Center. That's where all of the foreign nationals has gone -- have gone. You can see those hostages -- I'm sorry, those -- yes, those freed hostages being loaded onto buses there after coming off the helicopters. As you point out, those are elderly women. In fact, of the 10 hostages released, only one was a minor. One was a 17 year old Israeli woman. Those are now being treated. And they'll begin the process of the medical evaluations and of course, the mental health checks that are the far more complicated, far more difficult part of the entire process. Crucially, the process worked today and the truce held. And that was a major question. It played out a little later than we thought it would, but as you can see from these images, it did in fact play out and that bodes well for tomorrow where we expect the release of another 10 Israeli women and children in exchange for another 30 Palestinian prisoners, women and children released from Israeli jails. We of course, saw that happen tonight, as well. The question what happens beyond that, CIA Director Bill Burns in Qatar, where the majority of these negotiations have taken place, the U.S. trying to extend this beyond that to include not only women and children, but also elderly men and IDF soldiers, men and women, that however, Jake, remains a very challenging question at this time.",

We have seen it on fragile thin ice before. But the terms of the truce held together, hade continued to go in, the hostages continued to come out.

And they want the civilian casualties to lessen, at the very least. Do -- or is Israel going to start listening? Do the administration think? LEEI think, Jake, we're seeing this sort of interesting rhetorical shift coming from the White House. You know, in the early days, we were hearing a lot of emphasis on. The U.S. can't tell the Israelis what to do. We are not involved in making their military decisions. And now we're getting a lot of, we are advising them, they are taking our advice, they seem to be sort of helping to shape the tactical decisions, this is according to U.S. officials.

If there was some magical solution where we could tweeze our people out and just hit the rocket launcher that's shooting rockets at Israelis, we would do it. We do try to reduce unnecessary civilian casualties, but the reality is that there's no magic, the current ratio, the current ratio, is lower than what it was at the beginning and low and international standards from World War II through Iraq and Afghanistan, you'll see that Israel has one of the lowest ratios.",

The first thing is to fully disarm Gaza and ensure that it's -- there's no more arms, no more explosives there after we dismantle and eliminate Hamas. I mean, the first thing is to kill the Hamas leadership and the terrorists then clean up the Gaza from weapons and explosive so something like this could never happen again. The third thing I would do is create a buffer zone into Gaza of about one and a half kilometers deep, which would become a no man's land between Gaza and Israel again so this sort of thing could not happen. And that Israel would retain overall security and defense responsibility, but we don't want to govern the Gazans.So what I think we would do is create an interim technical product self-government that would, say, for about five years govern Gaza, de- Nazify Gaza, which means clean out all the incitement, all the education that all Jews are pigs and devils.
