We'll bring you those details as soon as it's released.First, though, let's begin in East Palestine, Ohio. EPA Administrator Michael Regan set to visit the area today. Frightened, furious residents, understandably, demanding answers in the wake of that toxic train wreck. They packed a town hall meeting last night. Railroad officials, though, didn't show. As Jim mentioned, they backed out at the last minute citing employee safety concerns. But, still, they promised to somehow address residents. Well, that move, understandably, gave little reassurance to folks who feel unsafe right now in their own homes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What is the tone that we're seeing in this grand jury report? I think we will be able to tell from the introduction and the conclusion. At a minimum, does this grand jury recommend that there is a crime here? Because we could see an introduction that say, we believe there was a criminal scheme to interfere with the election in Georgia. We could see an introduction and conclusion saying, we believe there was no crime committed here. I think it will be the former. It sounds like the grand jury has found that there was at least some crimes. It's also really important to note what we will not see today, but we know is in that report, which is a specific list of individuals and recommendations as to whether they should or should not be indicted. This other thing that's really important to keep in mind, Erica, this is all just a recommendation from the special grand jury.

Now, these searches were conducted with the consent and the cooperation of Biden's legal team.
