But as the war rages in Ukraine, several regions in Russia have scaled back events amid security concerns and a lack of military equipment to display. We are expecting remarks from President Vladimir Putin and a parade in Moscow where the Kremlin will show off its military might. And CNN's Clare Sebastian is following developments for us live from London. She joins us now. So, Claire, talk to us about what's expected at this year's scaled-down Victory Day celebrations in Russia, particularly in Moscow, where tensions are very high right now, aren't they?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Rosemary, you can see the live pictures now, the parade just getting underway, 10 a.m. Moscow time. On the surface it looks pretty similar to normal, to what we've seen in past years and decades. Clearly, Russia is trying to make things appear normal despite a rising sense of insecurity and anxiety in the capital. Don't forget, this is Red Square, just a few meters, practically, fromwhere we saw a couple of drones hit the Kremlin less than a week ago. That was just one of several incidents. We've seen fuel depots on fire, we've seen trains derail in Western Russia. There's a sense of anxiety in the country. And that is why I think, despite the fact that we're seeing some scaling back of the commemorations today, particularly in regions closer to Ukraine, but also in Moscow, they've canceled the immortal regiment march, which is a traditional event where Russians carry placards of their relatives who died in World War II. That has been cancelled. It's now going to have a virtual format. But that is because, the Kremlin says of security concerns, although some are speculating that it is because they don't want to draw attention to losses in the war in Ukraine. So, this is the context of this Victory Day. It is the second Victory Day, Rosemary, since Russia launched its full-scale, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. I think we can expect to hear President Putin to speak relatively soon. I think close to the start of the commemorations, I think we can expect to hear him while he'll offer the traditional commemorations of those who died in World War II. Russia lost, don't forget, some 27 million of its citizens, both soldiers and civilians. I think we can expect to hear some re- justification of his invasion of Ukraine.",

The package is geared toward the country's medium to long- term security needs.

And CNN's International Diplomatic Editor Nick Robertson joins us live now from Eastern Ukraine.

      "sentences": "Yeah, today is being called Europe Day to put Ukraine in lockstep with the European Union and other European countries, that they're celebrating this rather than what Ukraine used to celebrate. And going back to its history as part of the Soviet Union, Victory Day, they are now calling this Europe Day and perhaps no coincidence that Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commissioner is in -- European Commission President, is in Kyiv today.So, from the Ukrainian perspective, they'll be able to say, look, we're celebrating the Europe Day, we're in lockstep with the European Union, so undoubtedly discussions there about Ukraine's ambition to join the European Union as soon as possible. They submitted the paperwork last year. They've been moving quickly to try to do the things that the European Union wants them to do, to achieve that. But this is all sort of the diplomatic side and the hard part of what goes on, as you say, is at the front line here, not far away in Bakhmut, this, of course, with the Victory Day Parade in Moscow, both sides here watching each other so closely because the Russians know that there is that the Russians -- the Russians know that the Ukrainians are about to launch a counter-offensive. They don't know when they don't know where. And from the Ukrainian perspective, they know that that this day is so important to Russia that Russia potentially trying to make some last minute gains back. Look, would have been one of those places where they wanted to do it. So, a lot was at stake going into this day, which perhaps explains all those strikes on Keith that you were talking about. Cruise missiles, eight fired from the Black Sea late Monday night, 17 fired, promote the Caspian Sea to the east of Ukraine in the early hours of this morning. Most of them intercepted, and this of course coming after a barrage of drones that were all shot down the day before. So, it is perhaps, we can look at this after today as an inflection point in the war because now, both sides will have read each other through this moment. And of course for Ukraine, it is all about how, where, when to move this forward to a counteroffensive.",

It was along the lines of his sort of stump speech that we continue to hear, his justifications for the war in Ukraine. Among them that Russia is somehow under siege, under attack. Now, this, of course, rings particularly true in recent days. It's less than a week since several drones hit the Kremlin very close to where he was standing while making that speech.Of course, we've also seen attacks near Russia's border with Ukraine, fuel depots, train derailments, like that. The Russian people as they mark this Victory Day which is really the most important day in their calendar are feeling particularly insecure. There's a heightened sense of anxiety. So, perhaps he was referring to that in his initial comments. I thought it was interesting that he mentioned terrorism. This is something that we've seen President Putin and Russian officials increasingly mention in regard to those sort of attacks across the border into Russia that we've seen in other sort of parts of the speech that were interesting but also not new. He talked about how Ukraine is a pawn in Western efforts to dominate. He talked about how Western global elites still talk about exclusivity. He went on to talk about the sort of multi-polar world that Russia is striving for. And there was, of course, the traditional sort of commemorations of those who were lost in World War II. But as in many recent years, this was not just about World War II. This was about Putin talking about his goals, his aims. He said he was proud of the success of the special military operation, as Russia continues to call it in Ukraine, despite the fact that, as we know, Russia has not only not made a lot of meaningful progress but is, as we speak, preparing to defend its gains against an expected Ukrainian counter-offensive.

That was part of their effort to control public opinion around this war. So, the Russian people are not fed a diet of balanced information about this war. And they are culturally very, the whole sort of sense of Victory Day is a huge part of their cultural identity. So, I think many of them will sort of buy that line, others are perhaps sort of apathetic, not wanting to engage too much with the topic of the war in Ukraine.But the interesting thing is that the more he presents this sense, traditionally this is what we've seen, the more he presents this sense of a common enemy, of Russia against the West. And it's interesting, by the way, that the only leaders who are visiting during this Victory Day, which traditionally was attended by the way by U.S., European leaders that was mostly before the annexation of Crimea. But this year, it's just countries of the former Soviet Union, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, countries like that. They have not got a lot of allies left in the world but as I said he is presenting the sense of Russia against the world, a common enemy, and that does tend to rally popular support. Rosemary.",

You know, I think that -- that would be a tough pill for this administration to swallow.
