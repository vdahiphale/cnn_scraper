But it has been a massive shot in the arm in terms of morale for troops on the ground, for Ukrainians who've avoided or tried to avoid getting drafted with new draft orders being issued by the government. They actually look like they're winning somewhere and psychologically that's really important. Then you look at Western support for this conflict. And Lindsey Graham's words are music to President Zelenskyy's ears because they've been waning support, especially in the Republican side for continuing to support a war that looks like throwing good money after bad.

Otherwise, if they stay in this sort of late armor formation deep inside Kursk, the Russians can do their sort of traditional tactic, which is to encircle those inside their country, surround them and kill them all. That would look terrible. So, are the Ukrainian troops on the ground telling reporters they intend to stay as a massive psychological exercise?

It's unclear exactly how active.I think if you look at his posts from yesterday on X, compared to what he posts traditionally on Truth Social, it was way online with the campaign's messaging. I mean, it didn't really sound like Donald Trump. Trump likes to use social media. And the way he used formally Twitter now, X, when he was president, was kind of a stream of consciousness to sharing what he felt reacting to news, you know, often sharing conspiracy theories, using it to criticize people. And I know from my conversations with Trump's team, both then, but now as well, that he really does feel like these platforms are his way of communicating directly with his base and with his viewers. And there's been some hesitancy on the part of the Trump campaign for putting him back on X because what he's sharing on Truth Social, normally, doesn't get as much attention because there are far fewer people on Truth Social as well. Truth Social is really his base. It's the most conservative parts of the country and people who are using Truth Social in a regular manner. Twitter is a far more diverse type of platform with people of all different kinds of views on it. And that's part of why I think that he is back on it now. They recognize that he needs to amplify his messaging as much as possible before November. I know that many of Donald Trump's allies on the outside who are not on the campaign have been pushing him to rejoin X for some time now, especially since he was, you know, Musk had lifted the ban on him months ago. You know, he just chose to come back yesterday and ahead of this interview, but also because it's so close to the election. But I'll just say to answer your question more succinctly, I do think he will keep posting. I just -- I'm not entirely sure yet in which manner. If he'll be the unscripted Donald Trump that we all know or if it'll be more of his way of trying to really stay on message when it comes to that platform versus his own on Truth Social.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On his emerald green bulletproof train, loaded with supplies from the capital Pyongyang, North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, is portrayed as a hero on state TV, traveling to areas devastated by flooding. Record rains left entire towns and villages underwater, just miles from the Chinese border in the northwest of the country. State media reports thousands of evacuations but no deaths, a claim impossible to verify with no foreign aid organizations allowed in. Kim delivering a defiant speech from the rail car carrying his armored limousine declaring with confidence North Korea is fully self-reliant, rejecting all offers of international aid even from allies, China and Russia, at least for now. Some fear Kim's deepening military partnership with fellow strong man, Vladimir Putin, could be giving his economy and confidence a boost. Russia effectively vetoed United Nations sanctions monitoring earlier this year, opening the door for illicit trade, the U.S. says, perhaps emboldening Kim to shut the door on international aid and diplomacy.

But of all people, let's leave it to Harry Enten, to sort of bring things down to reality and remind us of what Donald Trump has accomplished in the past. And here's what he noted today. He said, given -- despite the fact that we've seen some polling, both national and within those crucial battleground states, showing Kamala Harris even ahead at this point. He said that Trump will win if the difference between the polls at this point and the results match what we saw either in 2016 or 2020. He also notes that Trump is actually more popular now than he was in 2016 or 2020. And despite the voter enthusiasm that we now see, particularly among the democratic base, surrounding Kamala Harris, that that doesn't necessarily result into more voter turnout or voters saying that they will actually come out to vote in November.

So what they say and what they are, how they convince voters as to like what their vision is for the country is really going to matter. And we're all going to be listening so closely because there are so many unanswered questions and nothing is -- nothing's firm in the polls right now. I mean, we saw them swing wildly after Biden exited the race and that is in part due to democratic enthusiasm, of which there wasn't a lot when Biden was at the top of the ticket. And so, you know, whether even that can hold is still an open question and we've got the convention coming up just next week. I'm sure there will be, you know, a push coming out of that. But, you know, that -- then comes the hard part, then comes those debates, then comes those potential interviews that Harris might have with reporters. Those have been complicated, I will say, for her in the past and have led to some missteps. So while it's short, we do have. There's a lot of campaign left and a lot of minds.

If that happens, they could return to Earth within a matter of weeks, if not sooner. That's the preference for NASA and Boeing, for sure. If that does not happen, option number two, and this is the contingency plan that's been floating around in the background for some time, but really coming into focus over the last few days and weeks, is that these two astronauts have to go back on a different spacecraft, on SpaceX's Crew Dragon. And if that is the case, that is when Butch and Suni would have to wait on board the International Space Station until February 2025, at the earliest, to return to Earth on a different spacecraft. So those are the two options. Right now, NASA and Boeing are weighing what they're going to do. Last week, NASA said they were going to have a big meeting this week to try to make a decision. That has now been delayed until next week at the earliest. And NASA just announced yesterday that they're going to update the media and kind of give us another update as to where we're at tomorrow. So, hopefully, we'll get some more information then. But as of now, there is widespread dissent within NASA about whether or not this spacecraft, Starliner, is safe to fly these two NASA astronauts home. So, you know, they're weighing their options and trying to see what is going to be the best vehicle to get them back. So, very unclear what's going to happen.",
