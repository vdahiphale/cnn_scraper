It is 4:00 a.m. there where, more importantly, the first primary contest, the caucuses of the 2024 race, will take place less than six weeks from now. What we saw last night was Chris Christie, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy fighting to become the GOP's top alternative, the number two, to the far and away frontrunner Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I have delivered results. And that's what we need for this country. NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We passed pro-life bills. We moved unemployment from 11 percent to 3 percent.

I thought Ron DeSantis actually got better as the debate went on. He landed some points on the exchange with her whether China or transgenderism. He is somebody who actually has gotten better in a relative sense over these last four debates. He stood out for me over the course of the night as someone who actually over-performed.",

And I do think that maybe if I'm reading the tea leaves here, if Chris Christie does end up dropping out, I know he said time and time again that he won't drop out before New Hampshire, but if he does, or even if he drops out sometime after that, then I think that we could see potentially a Nikki Haley endorsement coming from him because he definitely had high praise for her.And, look, she was definitely taking all the arrows last night and I thought that she performed well amongst all that pressure. And I do agree with Matt though, it did seem like there was a change in strategy and I wonder if that was a decision by her team to just not punch down, because she obviously has the momentum on her side and has had the rise in the polls.

So, look, I don't think that he has a conclusion yet on whether things are different now in the south. Certainly that is what we heard from the state department spokesperson on Wednesday saying that it is still early days. They wouldn't say whether or not things are actually different in how Israel is conducting this war at the moment. And, of course, the thing to bear in mind is that in terms of protecting civilians, it just got harder now that they have moved to the south because this is where so many of the civilians from the north have already evacuated to, Kasie.",

But no one across the Deep South wants to have the sloppy seconds, right, because this storm is going to bring that energy to the Gulf Coast states and produce the severe weather threat that you mentioned, Kasie. First on Friday, this is more of a hail threat across Arkansas, northeast Texas, southwestern portions of Oklahoma.And check this out -- I want you to see how the threat increases for the day on Saturday. So we're trying to give you a head's up because we are looking for the potential at least for some severe thunderstorms that could become a bit cyclonic, meaning that they could have some twists in the atmosphere, maybe a tornado or two popping up, but that's for the day Saturday. Again, the hail threat on Friday. This is the storm system that has brought havoc across the northwest, it is coming to an end, winding down, but cooler weather behind it is allowing for the changeover from rain to snow. So a few inches of snow across the spine of the Rockies. But notice how that transfer of energy moves across the eastern half of the country, picks up a bit of gulf moisture and then we start to see the thunderstorms fire up because we get the collision of air masses. And then along the East Coast, this weekend, Saturday into Sunday, this will be a major rainmaker and potential windmaker for many of the East Coast cities. So if you are traveling out of D.C., New York or Boston, heads up, could have some travel plans interrupted this weekend. The snow will stay north of I-95, but look at this, overall, a wet weekend. I do believe Thursday and Friday, so today and tomorrow will be dry, but Saturday and Sunday. That's a different story for the East Coast. You can see the high parked across the Southeast, that's bringing the pleasant conditions to Atlanta and Charlotte, but it is that storm system across the northwest that will change the southwest forecast going forward.
