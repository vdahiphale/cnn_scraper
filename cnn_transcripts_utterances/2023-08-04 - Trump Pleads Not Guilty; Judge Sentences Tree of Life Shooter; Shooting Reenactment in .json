(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Catharsis in the courtroom this week as one by one family members and loved ones of victims and survivors of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting finally got the chance to freely address the shooter in open court. \"Your sick, vile, despicable actions have totally erased you from humanity and society forever,\" said Mark Simon, son of Bernice and Sylvan Simon, who were killed in the attack. \"I am, in principle, opposed to the death penalty,\" said Rabbi Dorris Dyen, who survived the attack as well, \"but this shooter has challenged my ability to maintain that view. In my opinion, he has forfeited the privilege of living.\" With witness after witness, defendant Robert Bowers sat emotionless, taking notes, no longer in his trial sweater and collared shirt, now in a red inmate jump suit. \"I can only wish Mr. Bowers would look at me while I'm talking instead of scribbling on his page,\" said Dan Leger, who survived after being shot in the abdomen by Bowers. \"Look at me, the Jew he tried to kill.\" Throughout the pain of the week, defiance and hope, though, did emerge.

Back in June, a jury found Peterson not guilty for his inaction the day of the shooting after his attorneys successfully argued that Peterson took cover outside of the 1200 building for, as you said, more than 40 minutes. He never went inside of the building because he thought that there was more than one gunman and because he couldn't tell exactly where the shooting was taking place. Now before this reenactment takes place, nine members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, they are going to get a tour of the 1200 building. They're going to get a look at the three floors where this shooting took place, the classroom, the hallways, where these 17 students and staff members were killed back in 2018, and 17 others were wounded. Now, just last week, some of the Parkland families, they were up in Washington, D.C., and they were lobbying some of these very same lawmakers for a school safety legislation, as well as more funding for mental health services, as well as school resource officers. Here now is Max Schachter. His son, Alex, was one of the victims that was killed. And he talked to us yesterday about the importance of today's congressional visit, as well as the reenactment.

It's sleep, which was a big one, using it for sleep. And mood. Things that tend to, you know, be more problematic as you age.

There's been concerns about cannabis use disorder, not calling it addictions per say, but people who've - who have a hard time stopping.I think one of the biggest concerns with seniors, Phil, though, is falls. That was one thing that kept coming up over and over again. People who -- falls are a big concern already. You have 3 million people who are hospitalized with falls in that age group every year. This could worsen that. So, how do you put safeguards in place, again, just like you would with any other medication.
