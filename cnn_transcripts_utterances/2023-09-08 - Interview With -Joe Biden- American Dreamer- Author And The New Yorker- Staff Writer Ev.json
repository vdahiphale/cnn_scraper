I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour.It's a high-stakes weekend ahead for world leaders arriving in India for the G20 summit. They appear divided over issues like Russia's war in Ukraine with no joint statement agreed upon at any of the group's key meetings this year so far. For President Joe Biden, it's an opportunity to showcase the United States take on the global world order. In the absence of Russian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. It's a pitch that not only matters for America's standing abroad but also for Biden's own ratings at home, which new CNN polling shows are struggling, even within his own camp. 67 percent of Democratic voters say that the party should nominate a different candidate from next year's election. Joining me to discuss all this is author Evan Osnos in Maryland who profiled President Biden in his book, \"Joe Biden, American Dreamer,\" and Monda Charen, policy editor for \"The Bulwark\" and host of the \"Beg to Differ\" podcast who joins the show from Arlington, Virginia. Welcome both of you. Evan, let's start with you. So, as we have the president touching down in India, what does he have to accomplish going into this G20 summit? What would he like to accomplish? EVAN OSNOS, AUTHOR, \"JOE BIDEN: AMERICAN DREAMER\" AND STAFF WRITER, THE NEW YORKER\":  You know, in some ways, this trip is about putting his money where his mouth is. You know, he has been talking about the importance of global cooperation, really from the beginning. It was part of his pitch against -- when he ran against Donald Trump in 2020, saying, you know, the United States needs to be a big player in the world. It needs to fortify its relationships with other with other key partners and the allies. So, you are likely to see him, number one, giving a big embrace to some degree of India, which, after all, is the world's largest democracy. And it's -- on some level, look, this is a reminder that countries can have differences and still have key relationships. India is a big customer for Russian energy and weapons. There are things that the U.S. and India don't agree on, but fundamentally, Biden is saying, we are here and we want you to be a part of these big international institutions, things like the World Bank, the IMF and the unsubtle object of some of these comments, it's China of course.",

And this leads us to ournext question, Evan, about this idea of what decoupling may or may not look like between the United States and China. The president continues -- President Biden continues to say that he would like to navigate a competition and not anything further than that, and he does not want to have conflict with the country. It's a fine balance for the country and for this administration in a fine line for it to walk. This administration is continuing Trump era tariffs, it's imposed new export controls and restrictions. And just, for example, this week, Republicans are calling for further restrictions after it became known that some chips inside of Huawei's phones may have broken current trade restrictions with the country. How is this administration, President Biden, handling this relationship? Because it's the one issue where you're seeing agreement among Republicans and Democrats vis-a-vis with China.",

It's mentally interesting and complex, honestly, Bianna, because I was in Beijing just a couple weeks ago and I can tell youthat in China they are trying very hard to figure out how far does this unraveling go, ultimately. And what I've concluded based on my contacts on this side and in talking to people in Beijing, is what we are seeing right now is essentially a political and psychological decoupling, but it is ultimately not an economic decoupling. You see within these specific sectors and technology is at the center of it, areas in which the United States is erecting barriers around what it will and will not sell and what it will invest in. And frankly, China has been doing that for years in the name of national security. But the bigger change is this idea of the parting of the paths between these two giant countries. And what you're sitting at the G20 is a pretty vivid demonstration of that. China is essentially staying home partly because they have a very full domestic play, as I saw and I'll be describing it as a piece in \"The New Yorker\" in a couple weeks. But, you know, that is a major preoccupying fact for Xi Jinping. But the larger fact is, he's looking at the G20 and he says, this looks like a year in which this is actually more of an American show than the Chinese show, and I think I'm going to go elsewhere.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, the fact is the president has a lot to boast about on foreign policy. He has done a credible job, although I would argue that hecould have been quicker about delivering arms to Ukraine and still can. But that much having been said, you know, voters are notoriously unwilling to give presidents credit for foreign policy successes. You know, we had George H.W. Bush preside over a winning war in the Gulf and then enjoy something like 93 percent support right after the successful conclusion of that war and going oin to be defeated two years later. So, foreign policy only gets you so far with the electorate. And one of the things that is dogging President Biden is that inflation has been, you know, persistently high. It is -- the rate is trending down, but that has not yet caught up with what people are paying for groceries at the supermarket. So, the prices are still way up compared to 2020 or certainly 2019. And inflation is very punishing for presidents. The voters are never happy about it. And then, of course, there is concern about his age. So, what can he do about it? Well, he can try to be a little bit more present. A lot of voters feel that he is not really inhabiting the office, that he, you know, does not communicate with people enough. They're -- you know, it's inarguable that the previous occupant of the Oval Office was way too much in our feeds and in our brains. But arguably, this president has been too little and he needs to reassure people that he is in charge, that he is not senile and that he's not too feeble to serve another term.",

I mean, as a politician, as a member of the -- as the occupant of the White House you don't want to see polls like this. And I think there's frustration on his part that he says, look at what we've done on domestic legislation, whether it's climate, infrastructure, domestic manufacturing, all these things that he thinks will ultimately pay dividends to this country. Americans don't feel it for the precise the reasons that we've just been talking about. You know, inflation has a sort of hangover effect. And even though the numbers are going down, they're still elevated from where they were a few years ago and it scorches voters. But there's another element, which is that he knows fundamentally his entire life has been about these moments when people say, this guy is finished, he can't do it, and then somehow, he manages to come back. When I was writing about him in 2020, remember, you know, he was really dead in the water before that South Carolina primary. I mean, it was just a campaign that was not going anywhere. And in the end, what happened is the party essentially coalesced around somebody who has a track record, who may not be the kind of shimmering new object, but is somebody who, in this case, has the key attribute of having beaten Donald J. Trump for the presidency. And that ultimately is what Democrats are banking that voters will coalesce around that fact.",
