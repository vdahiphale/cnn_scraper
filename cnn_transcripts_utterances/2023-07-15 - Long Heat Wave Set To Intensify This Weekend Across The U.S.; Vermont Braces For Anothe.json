Cities like Phoenix are roasting in the intense heat. High temperatures there have hit at least 110 degrees some 16 days in a row now and are expected to continue that streak until at least Wednesday. In Death Valley, California, living up to its name, it could top 130 degrees tomorrow. On its Web site the National Park Service warns Death Valley visitors to carry plenty of water and not to hike after 10:00 a.m. We have team coverage covering all of this right now. CNN's Rafael Romo is in Las Vegas. CNN's Mike Valerio is in Valencia, California, north of Los Angeles. Mike, let's start with you. It's still just in the double digits from what I can understand where you are right now, but temperatures in Southern California are actually expected to get much worse in the next couple of days.

Last night when some parts of the state were sunny and looked calm, onthe Eastern Seaboard in the middle very area around the Otter Creek, as you mentioned. We had landslides, we had swift water rescues, rescuing people out of cars that had washed off the roadway. We had a major water main issue disruption in the city of Rutland that caused approximately 75 people to have to be evacuated. So these little cells have continued to hammer us even as the major flooding event of Monday and Tuesday is a little bit fading into the background. That being said, we've already started our recovery efforts. There's a lot of activity on the ground today. But we're very aware that between 6:00 a.m. tomorrow and 6:00 a.m. Monday, that there are some very alarming weather predictions that could see another one to two inches in all areas. Of course, we have no capacity. Everything is fully saturated. And in localized areas inside storm cells we could see up to three to four inches of rain.

He is a prime suspect and a fourth. The Gilgo Beach murder cases date back to 2010 when authorities discovered at least 10 sets of human remains along the Long Island shorelines.CNN's Polo Sandoval joins me now from New York.

As the surveillance team was following their suspect here, noticed that he had discarded a pizza crust in the garbage. They moved in. And that's what provided investigators with some key DNA that they were able to compare with some DNA that was taken at the scene of one of the bodies that was located between 2007 and 2010.So this is a case that goes back way beyond this year. But investigators are saying that even though there wasn't sort of any public updates that that was on purpose. This investigation was pressing forward according to the Suffolk County Police Department, deputy commissioner, Anthony Carter who I had an opportunity to speak to earlier this afternoon told me that they never slowed down. In fact they kept information from the public on purpose. They knew that Heuermann was, at least according to them, was monitoring for headlines and they feared that at any hint of a development, that they could potentially lose him. So that's why, not only because of that, but because of public safety that's when investigators moved in. But early today I also had the opportunity to speak to Suffolk County district attorney Ray Tierney. And I asked him exactly what they believe their suspect may have been doing over the last decade or so. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So it depends. Gays in the military? Did that break our military?

Women in combat on the ground, in the air, flying high-performance aircraft. Was that Wokeness to say they should be able to fly these aircraft?

I think it is a very anti-military position taken by a very pro- military state. The new Senator represents a very strong, pro-military state. This is not pro-military. This is undermining our military. So I think the Senate has an obligation to call out on this something that is a courtesy to put a hold on a single individual. But here we have a hold on at least 200, 300 nominations coming up. We don't have a Marine commandant. We don't have commanders for our Fifth Fleet, Seventh Fleet, and so forth.

When you have a trial, there's a whole boat load of evidence that gets admitted into the trial.But that's not always all of what is discoverable. So you've got, like, one through 100 documents. Here, there's a heck of a lot more. But for example, one through 100 documents. You may only get, like, 17 or 20 of them that are admissible in court and used in the trial. It's all of the rest of that other stuff, all of the other interviews, all of the other depositions and all of the parts of the depositions, all the documents, the correspondence that might be pertinent to some other piece of the puzzle. You know, just think about -- when I was a prosecutor, we did a lot of white-collar stuff. You would have to connect A and B over here and to C and D over there. And sometimes you needed the entire scope of information to be able to tie things together. It sounds to me like the Department of Justice is being very, very thorough and they are looking at all possible angles in whatever investigation these subpoenas were pertinent to. Whatever part of perhaps some much greater conspiracy, some of the other individual cases, perhaps. We don't know for sure and they don't have any reason to tell us. But there is a whole host of information they have now. And it could very easily tie in with what is happening in some of the other states. If they, for example -- if folks were asking consistently for the same thing from state to state to state, that might help prove a point in an investigation or a prosecution. So we can only really speculate as to the why. I'm not big on speculation. And I want to be as circumspect as I want, as I can be.

When we started talking, we said, well, we should start a club. Minorities in Shark Sciences' mission is to change the culture so that people from historically excluded groups participate in marine science. We have programs like our Gill Guardians, which is curriculum that lives online to help educate people about sharks and move them from fear to fascination. We have camps for our kids, Science at the Sea, where we bring kids out to the ocean. And then we have Science on the Move for those kids that can't get to the ocean and we can bring the ocean to them. We also have professional development so people can get very specific skills that they need to be successful in this field and help connect people with other people that are doing research.",
