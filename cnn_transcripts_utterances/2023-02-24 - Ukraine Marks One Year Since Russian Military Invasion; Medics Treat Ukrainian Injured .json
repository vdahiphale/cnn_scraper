Now both of those events happening one year after Russian tanks rolled into and missiles rained down on Ukraine at the start of Russian President Vladimir Putin's, quote, \"special military operation.\" In an instant, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, comedian turned head of state, became a wartime president. Today, he's been part of the day visiting wounded soldiers in Kyiv, rewind a year, and in those frantic, terrifying hours after the invasion started, he appeared on the streets of the capital reassuring his country that he was still alive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We are all here. Our military are here. Citizens and society are here. We are all here defending our independence. Our state. And it will remain so. Glory to our defenders. Glory to our women defenders. Glory to Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This map from two weeks into the war shows Russian forces in red occupying a vast area north of Kyiv and across the northern and eastern and southeastern borders of Ukraine including the previously Russian controlled areas of Donbas and Crimea, indicated on the black lines. Just a month later, Ukrainian forces have driven Russian troops out of the north, all the way to where you are in Kharkiv, Sam. Then after months of stalemate, Ukraine made another rapid advance in early September, this time driving the Russians out of the area from Kharkiv to the borders of the Luhansk region. Early November, Ukraine launched an offensive in the south, forcing a Russian retreat from Kherson and out of the villages north of the Dnipro River. And that, Sam, as I understand it, is largely the position today, with the caveat that we are told Russia is building up its forces in the east for an expected new offensive.

The U.N. Security Council has just started a special session on Ukraine. And we will be monitoring that for you for news. Big power politics are on full display as this war enters its second year and observers are wondering just how much they could change the dynamics of the conflict, especially now that China has unveiled a 12-point plan calling for a political settlement. The U.S. secretary of State says the Biden administration is, quote, \"taking a look at the proposal.\" But Antony Blinken, who was at this Security Council meeting that we are looking at now also says Beijing, in his words, is trying to have it both ways. China under pressure over its growing partnership with Moscow. A little, earlier U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin talked to CNN about his warning to Beijing. Have a listen to this. Have we got that sound? All right. Well, let's bring in Nic Robertson who is in London. Nic, you're the international diplomatic editor for CNN. It is your job to keep across everything that is going on when it comes to sort of this, you know, the diplomacy and at the heart of most of what you are doing and have been doing for the past year is trying to unpiece where we go next with this war in Ukraine.

They have signed a wide- ranging agreement to support Russia. That agreement is nonlethal aid at the moment. But potentially it could become lethal aid. And there are concerns about that. So they don't see China as an independent actor but they would like to see China flush more what it's saying and they both recognize that China is not saying that Russia is the aggressor here, which is the position of all the allies behind Ukraine. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as you are mentioning, before has said that, you know, in this situation, China was trying to show one face to the world that it is a neutral party. But it isn't because it doesn't recognize that Ukraine has been invaded by Russia. It speaks about the importance of territorial integrity and sovereignty but it's not saying anything about it. That it is providing nonlethal support and it might provide lethal support. So China's proposal don't seem to have a lot of mileage in them at the moment. There may be something else. They could be hugely influential with Russia. But they could also tip the battlefield balance to allow Russia, at least, to keep what it's got.

But ultimately, those top five permanent members have really been unable to push the needle at all on what is going on with this war from the perspective of the United Nations because with Russia on board they are ineffective.

That isn't a small number, so while Russia is effectively able because it sits on the U.N. Security Council to prevent that body from doing much, in terms of the whole, there is still a strong message coming out of the United Nations in opposition. Now what that turns to in terms of actual actions at the United Nations takes altogether is another question. But what we have seen the United States do is turn to allies who are reliable. So the sanctions today that were rolled out with G7 allies to make those sanctions have more of an effect not just cutting out those entities from the U.S. financial system, but also from the German financial system, from the French financial system, from the Brits.

Here in Dnipro a number of air raid sirens. So people are not just on edge and nervous about what may lie ahead, but certainly reflecting about the past year. It is really extraordinary to think, Becky, that at this time last year we were talking about the Russians taking Kyiv. What would happen with President Zelenskyy, would he stay, would he flee? Would the Russians even try to kill him? And Kyiv of course is now standing strong. It is even thriving. It still does come under attack. But people in the capital have been able to go back to work and go back to school. That of course is not the case all across the country. Cities and towns in the east have been absolutely decimated. Becky, I was in the city of Mariupol a year ago when the fighting started. Of course Russia has destroyed that city and taken it over. So we are now looking at a fight that is still grinding on the eastern and southern fronts of the country but to the frontlines have been relatively stagnant. Russia has been trying to push forward, of course, in the city of Bakhmut where they have made some incremental gains. They are trying to push forward in the town of Vuhledar where I was yesterday, where they have not have much success. It's believed that we're seeing the early stages of a Russian offensive that has not been going well. So as we enter this second year of the war Russia is expected to try to take more of the territory in Donbas that it controls and Ukraine is also expected to mount its own counteroffensive -- Becky.",
