Mayor de Blasio, I want to start with you, just on what we just saw play out, tonight, with RFK Jr. being that special guest that Donald Trump was teasing on stage with him in Arizona. Do you think this endorsement makes any substantial change in this race? BILL DE BLASIO, (D) FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Kaitlan, if you had asked me a month or two ago, I would have said yes. But I don't feel that now, for a couple reasons. One, I think the race for Joe Biden and Donald Trump, we all knew there were a lot of people looking for another political home. Now this is a very, very different election now. I think Kamala Harris has brought Democrats home, and actually is reaching over to a lot of independents and moderates, particularly, I should mean independents and Republicans, including a lot of moderate women in particular. And so now you have a particularly stark choice in this election that I think makes third-party candidates a lot less relevant, in general. I think it could have been a big factor, when there were many more dissatisfied people. I think the other factor is obvious that RFK Jr., I mean, he has been strange throughout, in my opinion. But he got a lot stranger in the last few weeks. And you saw his support plummeting. So, I'm a little worried about maybe some folks that would have voted for him, now go over to Trump. But in general, I think his campaign kind of collapsed. So, I don't think it's going to be a huge factor.",

And to the extent that might help him with some voters, it may also turn off other voters, who might not appreciate Trump appeal, you know, trying to play to an anti-vaccine crowd, for example.

And I certainly get it, when considering a lot of Democrats thought that they were going to lose this thing, two months ago, when President Biden was at the top of the ticket. However, I think Republicans still have the opportunity, to remind voters, about that fundamental thing that they're worried about, the economy and cost. There is a reason that this race continues to be so close, despite over 30 days of incredible news coverage, for Vice President Harris. I suspect, maybe she'll get a bump or two after a successful convention week, from Democrats writ large. Yet the numbers still haven't moved. Because I think a lot of voters, while excited about her candidacy, excited about the monumental occasion that we just saw, right, nominating the first woman of color, that is a big deal. Yet those kitchen table issues, when people wake up in the morning, Kaitlan, it's not going away. When people sit in their cars, and they're trying to go to work, and they realize that the car's on E, do I have enough money to put gas in the tank? When people are wondering if they can pay their mortgage, or pay their rent, without being evicted or being foreclosed on? Those things are very real and tangible, for a whole lot of voters, in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin.

I don't think it's overconfidence to say that we need to close the gap on those numbers. And we need to highlight issues like abortion.I would say this. The Kamala Harris campaign is doing everything right now. So, they should continue to keep doing what they're doing. And from a high-level perspective, from a message perspective, and that means continuing to instill the belief that she's able and capable of making change. And we saw the speech do that expertly, as well as the four days of the convention. When you instill that belief, you're able to keep the energy going on the movement politics that has moms collecting 200 yard signs to distribute, to their mom groups and their neighbors, and has students signing up inside the halls of their universities. This is the type of thing that creates momentum and expands the campaign that we hear others talking about. If she's able to capitalize on that, as well as to use Donald Trump's own weight against him, which she's been very effective at doing. The Republicans came out of their convention overconfident, and they haven't managed to shake off that overconfidence. They almost seem stunned that she's doing as well as she is because they wildly underestimate her.

He seemed agitated, really upset. And we've seen that over and over again, from Trump, as he describes Kamala Harris' California, in dark, dire terms, not realistic terms, but in a way that connects with some of his fans. When you were in Chicago, I was in Philly, watching swing state television. I want to watch the local TV ads, and see what Americans are watching, between the speeches. And the ads against Harris, they're terrifying, right? They're about the border. They're about immigration. That's why Harris needs to go out, and do interviews, and talk to people and answer questions now. Because those ads, she has to rebut those ads. She has to respond to the pro-Trump ads that are out there. She needs to be out there, in challenging environments, to prep for the debate, next month. And I think she will start to do interviews.

But at this point, he is really not taking from anyone. He's just taking from people who otherwise probably won't vote. But I think it is important in Arizona, and in so many other places, across our country, when you think about what the current administration, with the Biden-Harris administration has accomplished. Wages are up. Inflation is down. Small businesses are booming. Manufacturing jobs are coming back. They've caught -- capped the cost of insulin to $35 a month, for those on Medicare, lowering prescription drug costs. Student loan relief to nearly 4 million Americans. And the first bipartisan gun safety legislation in 30 years. So, I think that this election matters. It matters for our economy. It matters for the heart of what it means to be an American. And it matters for basic bread-and-butter issues. What are your taxes? Do you have a job that you can go to, whereas -- or can you pay for your health care? And on all of those issues, Biden-Harris -- I mean, sorry. Harris-Walz are in much, much, much better than Donald Trump.",

He said he was an average governor. Was talking about how he doesn't work hard enough for his constituents. I think the Republicans, who overwhelmingly put him back in office and, in the last election, not that long ago, would disagree with that. But why do you think Donald Trump is doing that now?

We haven't heard anything, from Trump, on this, other than he's going to continue to cut taxes for the wealthiest among us. And on immigration. I also thought she did a great job, Kaitlan, pointing out what really went down. And as a governor, I know what happened.

The money coming from two -- one of two places, fellow Republicans or Donald Trump himself. Take, for example, the Ohio Senate candidate, Bernie Moreno. Trump endorsed him, on December 19th, 2023. Two days after that, Moreno spent $17,000 at Mar-a-Lago, before dropping another $80,000 on a fundraiser there, the next month. Moreno went on to win his primary. He is now the Republican nominee, in one of the closest Senate races, in the nation, against Sherrod Brown. Joining me, tonight, is a journalist, with years of reporting, on Trump's finances. Senior Forbes Editor, Dan Alexander. And Dan, it's great to have you. Because when you look at these numbers. Bernie Moreno is the one we cited. But it is far from just him. We also saw this with Herschel Walker, who ran for Senate, in the State of Georgia. We've seen, he's spent $215,000 at Trump properties. We've seen it with Arizona Senate candidate, Kari Lake, a $100,000 just this year alone. What do you make of what we are seeing, in such an unusual circumstance, of where this candidate is benefiting off of other Republicans, when they're obviously trying to have proximity to him. DAN ALEXANDER, SENIOR EDITOR, FORBES, AUTHOR, \"WHITE HOUSE, INC.\": It's pretty obvious that people are trying to gain Trump's favor. And one way to do that, these days, is to pay him through his businesses. And it's not just candidates, who want an endorsement. It could also be foreign ambassadors, or leaders, who want to stay at his hotels. There are all sorts of ways, to show Donald Trump that you're in his camp, by actually paying him, because he hung on all of his businesses.",
