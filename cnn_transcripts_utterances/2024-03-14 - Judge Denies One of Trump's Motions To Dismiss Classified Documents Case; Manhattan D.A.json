We're standing by for a ruling on the former president's remaining effort to toss the charges.Also breaking, Trump appears to be on track to score another delay in court, this time in New York. Manhattan prosecutors announcing they're not opposed to pushing back his Hush Money trial potentially until late April. And there's news out there on the campaign trail tonight. President Biden making another stop on his tour of battleground states as Vice President Harris pays a historic visit to an abortion provider, becoming the highest ranking U.S. official to do so. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer and you're in The Situation Room. Let's get to the breaking news. A federal court slaps down one of Donald Trump's attempts to dismiss this classified documents case, Judge Aileen Cannon rejecting Trump's argument that the charges were unconstitutionally vague. Let's get straight to our Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, what is the judge saying about what she heard today?",

And Judge Aileen Cannon spent most of today hearing some of those arguments, but shortly after that hearing wrapped, she dismissed one of them outright, and that was this argument that the espionage charges, that the espionage act is so vague, that Trump wouldn't have known that he was doing anything wrong. In fact, during the hearing, she signaled that she wasn't buying that argument when she said it would be, quote, extraordinary to throw out this entire case based on that argument.But, Wolf, we're still waiting for her to weigh in on some of these other challenges that they've posed. They've also argued that Trump had a right to keep these documents, that he believed that they were his personal records. But the special counsel pointed out that Trump is on tape. There is a recording into this case where he acknowledges he knows these are secrets and that he couldn't declassify them once he left the White House. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This totally wins my case, you know. Except it is like highly controversial secret. This is secret information. See, as president, I could have declassified it. Now I can't, you know? But this is classified. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's currently penciled in for May. But two weeks ago, she held a hearing about pushing it back. It's unclear how far back and that, as you can see, increasingly complicated and convoluted calendar, she will push it back. Though I was down there in Florida two weeks ago, and it sounded like August would be the earliest.

But this delay is based on the fact that both sides now need to go through tens of thousands of pages of discovery. So, this is evidence. It was just turned over by federal prosecutors. So, the Trump team was asking for a 90-day delay. Prosecutors have said they won't object to a 30-day delay. But now, all eyes on the judge to see how far back he'll push this.",

It is not for Donald Trump to decide individually on his own what fits under that.And so now, if there are individual documents with which he might take issue, with how they're characterized, there's a process for going through that. And he can raise that with the National Records Administration or even in court if he so wishes. But no president in American history has simply been able to wave a magic wand and say, all of these things are mine. These are exempt from the Presidential Records Act.

And I think it's hoping that it could prejudice the outcome.Listen, we don't know much about -- this is not a highly experienced judge, especially in cases related to national security matters. But what I can tell you is, when this case was brought, it was the one Trump world was most afraid of. Now, they've known it wasn't going to go before the election. But if he were to not win the presidency, this is something where there's actually quite a bit of case law of classified documents being mishandled. The facts of the case are incredibly damning.

He loves these delays, because in the short term, it riles up his base and lets them believe that there's an inside job against Donald Trump. But the closer that we get to Election Day and the closer that we have these trials to Election Day, whether or not there's a conviction, I think voters will go into the ballot box with that at top of mind. We also have polling that shows in any of the cases, if he's convicted, that will shift some Republican voters from him. So, Trump is trying to delay because he knows those things are not in his favor politically. However, in the short-term, I do think it helps him just a little bit.

It could go away, it could be reduced, defendants could be dismissed or otherwise. So, look forward to that and look ahead to that. But also the main issue this judge is going to be grappling with is whether it is required to have an actual conflict of interest that rises to the level that it makes it impossible for the defendant to get a fair case in this action, or is it the appearance of a conflict. You know, the judge is using the appearance of impropriety or the hint of impropriety, will that be enough here?

That's where I think you could see some movement with even moderate Republicans and independents and women that are going to be core to them getting ahead.

Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  Israel cannot survive if it becomes a pariah. Nobody expects Prime Minister Netanyahu to do the things that must be done to break the cycle of violence. I believe a new election is the only way to allow for a healthy and open decision-making process about the future of Israel, at a time when so many Israelis have lost their confidence in the vision and direction of their government.

Schumer was one of the few prominent Democrats to speak out against it.But this time much different. There is angst in the Democratic caucus in particular about the way that this war has been waged and calls for greater action by the United States to try to rein in Israel's action or provide more relief, humanitarian relief, to Palestinians impacted along the Gaza Strip. Now, in talking to Democrats today, they are making clear, even the ones who are aligned with Chuck Schumer on the issue of Israel, that they are supportive of what he is doing as Republicans accuse him of interfering in another country's elections. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT):  Israelis need to decide whether it's a time for new leadership and I think that Senator Schumer's speech indicates that there's an urgency about that decision by the Israelis SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI):  What is Leader Schumer doing, injecting himself into Israel's politics? Again, I think it's just beyond the pale. SEN. JONI ERNST (R-IA):  I'm very upset.

In the House, they have not acted on a broader aid package because it's tied to aid to Ukraine. Republicans are divided on that. The speaker of the House has indicated that he wants to move forward with a standalone Israel aid package, but that does not have enough support from Democrats, particularly many who are aligned with either Schumer or even go further than Schumer and want conditions on aid or want no aid at all, which raises a lot of questions about whether that billions of dollars will actually make it to the Israeli government, especially if Netanyahu is still prime minister.",
