It's 6 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson and you are watching \"Connect the World\" here on CNN. Also happening this hour, the U.S. is pushing for Haiti's Prime Minister to speed up a political transition after a powerful gang member threatens Civil War. Millions of travelers in Germany are stranded as strikes bring that country to a standstill. And to the ninth month in a row, the world shatters its heat record. Well, the stock markets in New York open in about 30 minutes from now. The futures are looking pretty positive today they are edging higher. After a Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he expects the Fed to cut interest rates at some point this year. More on that bottom of the hour for you, while hope is fading fast for a Gaza ceasefire agreement by Ramadan, which begins just a few days from now. A Hamas delegation left Cairo earlier without a deal on a ceasefire in Gaza or the release of hostages. Sources familiar with the negotiations tells CNN a deal is now unlikely before Ramadan and it is raising fears for what can happen next in Gaza. Will CNN's Paula Hancocks joins me now. Paula, how are these talks broken down to it? What do we understand at this point?",

They have said that they had given something back to the delegations, but the fact that Israel didn't have a delegation there, they say was the reason for the breakdown. And then from the Israeli side, we have heard them say that until Hamas gives them this list of the hostages, which ones are alive and which ones are not, then they can't move forward. Now, Hamas has said that they can't give that list until there is a ceasefire, which an Israeli official told CNN today, they simply don't believe. They believe that this is just a game now, if you want to try and find a positive of this, and it is quite difficult at this point. We do believe according to one diplomat familiar with the negotiations that Hamas has changed its mind about demanding that all the Israeli military is out of the Enclave as soon as the ceasefire starts. They have said they want them away from the cities in the first phase, and then in the second phase, they would like them out of Gaza. But again, the Israeli military is not going to agree to that.",

So we've heard from the State Department that they said it was, \"sadly inevitable\". It has been wrongly condemned. But this is the first fatality that we have seen from the Houthi rebels.

You know, however, the U.S. wants to qualify, you know, certainly, they are urging him to begin to transition that would at least call for elections. But it's unimaginable that elections could be held at this point, where you have so much violence, so much chaos. Certainly it's not safe, which is the point that Ariel Henry is made for quite some time that the situation doesn't allow for elections, which has allowed him to stay past his mandate. And we are, of course, talking about a Prime Minister was never elected, he became essentially a Head of State after the Haitian President was assassinated nearly three years ago. So you know, the U.S.'s plan, other Caribbean nations plan is to urge on -- to leave to set this Transitional Council. You know, is that enough to placate some of these gang members? You know, probably not. These are people that are fighting to hold on to very valuable turf. They bring drugs through Haiti, to other places, including the U.S. that is what they're fighting to keep a hold of this force from Kenya 1000 troops that is scheduled to come to Haiti that the U.S. and Prime Minister Henry hoping to bring to Haiti soon, you know, that threatens their businesses and that is what they are fighting to protect.",

IVF treatments in Alabama may be starting back up today after thegovernment in that state signed a new bill into law overnight. Now the legislation aims to protect IVF providers and patients from civil and criminal liability. Lawmakers scrambled to get it passed after last month's controversial ruling by the state Supreme Court that through, the future of fertility care into turmoil. The Court declared that frozen embryos are children and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death. Our CNN's Correspondent Isabel Rosales is joins us now live from Montgomery in Alabama. Just reminders, what exactly does this law protect? And how significant is it that a Republican Governor signed this into law?",

      "sentences": "Becky, good morning to you. Speed was certainly the priority for lawmakers. This ruling by the Alabama SupremeCourt sparked national outrage. And what we saw here was a Republican led legislature that got this bill to the Governor's desk. And then we saw a Republican Governor signing this into law. And this is significant. We saw Republicans scrambling not only here in Alabama, but in Washington to announce their support for IVF. Because they know that this is a significant issue that sparks a lot of emotion, a lot of outrage and puts them in political jeopardy. This is the sort of issue that can run voters to the ballot box. So let me go into this law and what exactly it protects. It is designed to protect those who provide or receive IVF by offering them criminal and civil immunity. That is the word. This is crucial, because in the process of IVF oftentimes clinics and patients they make the decision to dispose of embryos, embryos that are non-viable or embryos that are not wanted. So they needed they say this sort of immunity in light of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling. Now what it doesn't do where it falls short is it doesn't address the issue of personhood when life begins, which is at the crux of that state Supreme Court ruling. This is a problem to a lot of experts and advocates of IVF including the American Society for Reproductive Medicine that warns without addressing if an embryo is legally considered a person while it leaves clinics vulnerable. This is what they had to say, \"We believe these bills will not provide the assurances Alabama's fertility physicians need to be confident that they can continue to provide the best standard of care to their patients without putting themselves their colleagues and their patients at legal risk.\" Now already since the signing of this law, we're seeing impacts, two out of the three clinics that pause IVF in light of that ruling, are set to restart IVF treatments, including Alabama fertility that this afternoon, they have embryo transfers scheduled. So they will be seen patients today, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the first facility to announce it was pausing IVF treatments also saying that it is moving properly to restart that treatment. But then the third clinic this is the Center for Reproductive Medicine in mobile health. The very clinic that's at the center of the suit that led to that classification of embryos as people says it will not resume services. The CEO Mark Nix of Infirmary Health saying that they need legal clarification as to the extent of immunity that they're getting saying at this time, we believe that this law falls short of addressing that fertilized eggs currently stored across the state. It leaves challenges for physicians and fertility clinics trying to help deserving families have children of their own. But Becky, I'll leave you with this. I spoke to three patients, the moment that was signed into law and they feel cautious relief. They said that even if this is a band aid they needed this to continue with their treatments are on such a tight schedule so many of them making so many bodily and emotional and financial sacrifices to be able to undergo IVF. But they say that a deeper conversation certainly needs to happen, Becky.",

And really to no surprise, it was 1.77 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. And in fact, there were some days at the beginning of February that were more than two degrees C above normal globally. Again, we're talking land and sea and all that and look at this. This is the warmest sea surface temperatures we have ever experienced here. But -- think big of a gap that is to 2.2 degrees higher than any time we've ever seen that we've been measuring ocean surface temperatures. Something that's disturbing for the Atlantic hurricane season is this big red area here. The warmest on record for this time of year for that eastern part of the Atlantic, it is so warm that there was a very rare tropical system that moved into Brazil over there summertime of course, but still very rare for that to happen. Moving farther on down to the South because we know we lose the southern hemisphere summer. We did have a near record for Antarctic sea ice a near record low but not quite still about the third lowest. But look how close that was to the bottom of this scale, so not much ice down there either. And now with sunshine, the northern hemisphere is starting to heat up as well.",

But the prosecutor just began by showing pictures of the four victims the four students so young, so vibrant that were murdered that day by Ethan Crumbley his son and now in this precedent setting case in the United States. The father is being charged with homicide. And the prosecution is saying you James Crumbley you cause the death of those four students because you exhibited gross negligence. And the prosecutor just said this was a nightmare come to life and it could have been preventable. What he's focusing in on right there is number one, the gun because there was a nine millimeter gun that shot and killed those four students. And Ethan Crumbley got it on Black Friday, four days before the shooting because his father bought it for him. Now in and of itself, that is not a crime parents buy guns. The family uses them as a hobby together. But the focus would be how was the gun cared for and controlled and stored. And they're saying that it was grossly negligent that it was not in a lock safe, there was not a lock on it that Ethan was able to find it. He was able to find the bullets and he also then pulled the trigger. And something else is the mental issues. They believe that James Crumbley should have seen that his son had some mental health issues going on. And he did nothing about it. What he did was buying that gun.",

And of course, when that hockey stick recovery took effect, there was a sudden rush to get me on a plane; I'm not really sure where I want to go, just get me on a plane. And there's nothing better to reinforce demand than actually creating a massive shortage. And we were all in some sort of lockdown for two years. So airlines are really struggling now with a shortage of aircraft to get back into the air. And of course, that's put a lot of pressure on the supply chains. And Boeing and Airbus, I think are struggling to keep up with the order books of airlines that are desperate for more capacity and more lift. So that I think has created this sort of short term gap between supply and demand that we're seeing, but I do think growth is incredibly strong. We've had the strongest January we've ever seen. And it looks as though we're going to crash through our forecasts. We've just revised it from 88.8 to 90.3 for the end of this year.
