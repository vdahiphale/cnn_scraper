Republicans seeking full control as Governor Glenn Youngkin pushes to restrict abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. We heard from him moments ago at a polling site. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GLENN YOUNGKIN (R-VA):  We're delivering, and I think results matter.

A lot has happened since then, no question about it. But this is a good home base as we look towards what is going to happen today.And we're going to start right here, with the state of Virginia. Joe Biden back in 2020 winning this race by more than ten points. It's the largest margin of victory for a Democrat since 1944. And yet when you move to 2021 in the governor's race, Glenn Youngkin ending up upsetting Terry McAuliffe. This is why this day is so important, whether or not Republicans are actually able to secure not just the governor's mansion but also the state Senate and the state House. That is up for grabs. What else is a big issue here? Abortion. Youngkin has tried to flip the script a little bit after a number of Democratic wins of abortion rights advocates wins throughout the country. He has tried to embrace the issue of a 15-week abortion ban, trying to thread the needle a little bit and go on offense on the issue. This will certainly be a test of that. Obviously, what happens in the suburbs here, which has been a strong point for Democrats year after year after year in the state of Virginia will be something that everybody is watching. Now, you want to switch over to the governor's races right now. You have two, and they're both in red states, two states that Joe Biden lost and lost handily in Kentucky and Mississippi. Why are we watching these deep red states? Well, right now, when you look at the state of Kentucky, it has a Democratic governor. You see there are no results in here. This will start to fill in. Andy Beshear actually has a pretty high favorability rating for a Democrat in the state, despite where Joe Biden's approval sits, which is very, very low. Daniel Cameron, considered a rising star in the Republican Party. Whether Beshear is able to hang on, he's right now favored a little bit, that will be an open question. Mississippi, as Poppy noted, it is still considered a lean Republican race. Elvis' second cousin is involved in the race. But Democrats right now saying if turnout goes their way, particularly in the African-American community, perhaps there's a chance of an upset. The last thing we are looking at, if you go back to 2020 in the presidential race, is the state of Ohio. It is a red state. There is no question about that. But this could be yet another example of red state after red state after red state in the wake of the Dobbs decision and the Supreme Court voting with abortion rights advocates. That will be on the ballot. It will be another opportunity, another key issue we'll be watching throughout the course of the day. Poppy?",

It's one of the issues in which Andy Beshear has repeatedly talked about Cameron as extreme. Whether that is going to be enough for Biden to reassemble his coalition next year I think is an open question. We are a year out. If you talk to everybody either around Biden or in the Democratic Party, they will all privately tell you that all of the polls that they are all dismissing is not real, actually are directionally accurate. But that does not mean they are going to be accurate in 12 months.A lot can happen. Abortion is going to be a big issue for Democrats heading into next year.

We'll see if on the defense case, they bring in people to say, we prepared these and it was valid. That's going to be important.And that leads to the sort of third big point. This was a really important moment. I think a concession by Donald Trump. He was pressed, he tried to dodge, but eventually he said, I would look at them, meaning the financial statements. I would look at them, I would see them, and I would maybe, on occasion, have some suggestions. If I'm the A.G.'s office, I am seizing on this quote.

And then the defense, Donald Trump and Trump Organization, they get a chance to put on their case. Their lawyers have said that's going to take into December, maybe a month or more. I think we're going to hear from accountants. I think we're going to hear from experts who will try to validate the numbers that Donald Trump offered up, but that's going to be a substantial defense case. And then finally at the end of it all, we will have a verdict. Now, the judge has already ruled for the A.G. and against Donald Trump on one claim. There are six other claims.

He died of some sort of encounter at a rally where you had both pro- Israel and pro-Palestine demonstrators really at the same intersection there in Ventura County.Now, overnight, folks from various Jewish groups, as you pointed out in that video, they were gathering actually at the same spot. They had a candlelight vigil. They were singing in Hebrew, and they were holding Israeli flags. Now, the medical examiner labeling this cause of death a blunt force head trauma. We're not getting a lot of details beyond that. The Ventura County Sheriff's Office investigating this, as you point out, a homicide. But here's the thing, there's no details this morning on any arrests or any suspects at this hour. And as you can imagine, that's getting a lot of attention on social media. And so you have folks, including a local rabbi here, who's warning, look, there's a lot of conflicting information at this hour, given how sensitive this climate is right now. He's asking for folks just let authorities investigate, not to inflame the situation, Phil.",
