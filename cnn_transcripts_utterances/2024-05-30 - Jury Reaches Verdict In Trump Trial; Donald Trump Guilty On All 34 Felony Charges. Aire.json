But truly, this moment involving a former US president and the legal system, the criminal justice system in this country may have an intense consequence. Judge Merchan is on the bench, we do expect the jury to come forward with their verdict in 10 minutes or so, so we are really in the in the closing minutes.And, again, we don't know what the verdict is going to be. We know it can't be a hung jury, because they've only been doing it for less than 12 hours and so that's not enough time to say, hey, we can't come to a conclusion. It could be 12 -- it could be 34 counts of acquittal, it could be 34 counts of guilt and conviction. It could be, and one of our experts at least has gone out on a limb and said that she thinks that it's possible that it's a mixed verdict, because otherwise, why would you need 30 minutes to go over and check boxes. Merchan is reading the note into the record one more time. The judge has called for the jury. We are just minutes away from finding out. For those wondering what differences there are in the case, Elie and then Tim, of the different checks and ledgers, two of them or one-two counts, 1 to 4, and counts 5 to 7 were not signed by Donald Trump himself. Those are in February and March 2017. All the others counts, 8 through 34 have to do with invoices vouchers, checks and stubs and where Donald Trump was the one who signed the check in question. Elie Honig, Cnn Senior Legal Analyst: Crucial point here, we are about to receive not a verdict or the verdict but 34 verdicts. And we need to take them one at a time because I have seen it happen plenty of times where count one is guilty, and then later on there's a bunch of not guilty. I've seen it where count 1, 2, 3, 4 are all not guilty, and then the rest of them are guilty. And if there's a split verdict here, which is a possibility, one way the jury might decide to split this verdict is to convict on the checks that Donald Trump signed but not the other documents. And if that's the case, I believe the first check that Donald Trump actually signed is count 10.",

And for those wondering about the political consequences of these 34 guilty verdicts, the short answer is nobody has any idea, period. Nobody has any idea what the effect will be. We do know that there has been polling information about how a guilty verdict might affect individuals, but theoretical is obviously different from actual. There was a new NPR-PBS NewsHour Marist Poll released recently that suggested that any verdict in the hush money trial would be unlikely to have a major effect on most voters choice. It wouldn't impact for most people. Overall, 67 percent of registered voters had a guilty verdict and trial would not make a difference, 76 percent said the same thing about a not guilty verdict. Where there is significance is in the margins because this is, as far as we can tell right now going to be a very close election in a handful of battleground states. And a few people defecting from Biden or Trump could make the difference between winning the White House and losing the White House. And in the polls, a small share of people who support Trump say that a guilty verdict would dissuade them from supporting Trump and the Marist Poll, 7 percent of those who say they would vote for Trump in the presidential race, say a guilty verdict would make them less likely to back them in a Quinnipiac poll, 6 percent. Not a lot and again, theoretical this took place before the verdicts 34 of them. But it is suggestive, Danna Bash, that this could have an impact on some Trump voters.",

Donald Trump has always mistakenly believed he would never face consequences for breaking the law on his own personal gain. But today's verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality, there is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office, at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president.The statement goes on to allude to the chaos that the campaign believes would ensue if Trump were reelected, saying the American people will reject it this November. Of course, we just heard the former president say that the people will be the final deciders here and that November 5th, will be when this case ends, and it is in his words long from over. Now, it's unclear exactly when or even whether we would hear from President Biden responding directly to the fact that his predecessor is found guilty on 34 felony counts. Throughout the week, aides were non-committal about whether the President would weigh in personally, alluding to a very complicated schedule that he has, as well as the fact that today in particular, is a somber day for the Biden family. They are in Delaware, where they're remembering Beau Biden, the President's son who died nine years ago today at age 46. It's a day that the family usually spends out of the public eye. And to that end, the White House called a lid at 9:53 a.m. earlier today, that means that we were not expecting to see the President in public again. Of course, history could change things. Jake?",

And Trump's defense attorneys, they did their best to try to just destroy any credibility that Michael Cohen had. That really was the defense, the cross examination of Michael Cohen, undercutting his credibility, highlighting his criminal record or highlighting his disdain for the defendant, the fact that he's profiting off of this.
