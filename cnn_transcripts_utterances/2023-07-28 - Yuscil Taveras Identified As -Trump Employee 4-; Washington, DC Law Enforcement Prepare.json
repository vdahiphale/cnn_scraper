There are a lot of angles to cover. We learned a lot yesterday afternoon.Joining us here, CNN's Evan Perez and Zach Cohen. Jessica Dean is in Iowa on the campaign trail and former federal prosecutor Kristy Greenberg also with us. Evan, two categories of new charges in this indictment yesterday, one relating to destruction or alleged destruction of evidence. The other that seems to corroborate this idea that Trump, when he was speaking to folks, by the way without a security clearance, that he was actually waiving a classified document in front of folks that wouldn't have had clearances to see that document. On that particular new charge, what do we know?",

And we know that that document is, obviously, one of the ones that was being discussed in that recording that prosecutors have.Of course, that's one of the biggest pieces of evidence, one of the most interesting pieces of evidence that the prosecution has in this case. And now the fact is that they have brought it into the indictment. It tells us that either they have evidence from other witnesses that gives them the confidence to be able to show this to a jury. And, of course, the rest of this indictment is pretty damning for the former president. It really describes a scheme by him, orchestrated by him, with his two employees to try to destroy, at least according to the prosecutors, to try to destroy surveillance video after they received a subpoena to produce that. And that example there - that is listed in their chapter and verse from prosecutors with De Oliveira talking to Taveras saying, \"'The boss' wants the server deleted and what are we going to do about it\" really is going to be something that is going to be a very important part of this case, right, especially if they can get other witnesses to corroborate what is being said there.",

And that's because for the first time ever, the U.S. is providing weapons and equipment to Taiwan under presidential drawdown authority, which means it's pulled directly from Department of Defense stocks so it can be sent in within days or weeks. This is the exact same authority that the U.S. uses to quickly ship weapons to Ukraine. Now it will be shipping to Taiwan. Taiwan having complained in the past of delays in shipments, at least partially because some of that was diverted to Ukraine, so this will at least go in quickly, as you point out, Jim, with increasing concern over China's intent for Taiwan.
