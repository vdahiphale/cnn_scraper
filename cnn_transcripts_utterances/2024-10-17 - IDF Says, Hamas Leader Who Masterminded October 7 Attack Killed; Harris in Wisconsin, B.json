Officials scrambling to ensure all residents are able to cast their ballots in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar launched the deadliest terrorist attack in Israel's history, triggering a devastating war in Gaza. Now, just over a year later, Israel says he is dead, killed by its soldiers in Gaza.",

He was released in a prisoner swap deal in 2011, alongside more than a thousand other Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit. But his enduring legacy came last year, when thousands of Palestinian militants stormed into Israel killing more than 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages at a music festival, in people's homes, and as they fled into bomb shelters. Now, with Sinwar dead, questions about the fate of the remaining hostages and whether the war in Gaza will finally end. (END VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (on camera):  And, Wolf, the Israeli prime minister tonight making clear that Sinwar's death does not mark the end of the war in Gaza, but he did say that he believes it spells the beginning of the end of Hamas' rule in Gaza. As for the hostages, the Israeli prime minister saying that he urging the captors of those hostages to lay down their weapons and release those hostages, warning that if they are harmed, that Israel will avenge them. There's also a question about whether or not this presents an opportunity now to end the war, to reach some kind of a ceasefire deal. Certainly some U.S. and Israeli officials believe that is the case, but it will also depend on who succeeds Sinwar. Wolf?",

It allows Israel to begin the process of ending the war, claiming victory. Obviously, the most important, unfinished business is the hostages. But it then allows Israel to start moving toward a post-war settlement. And that is what the Biden administration has been arguing.And the Biden administration has lined up serious conversations with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia about Israel normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia, but it would be part of a package where there would be some post-war authority in Gaza that would be maybe the Saudis, maybe the Palestinian Authority would have to be involved, and there would have to be some movement by Israel toward a Palestinian state. So, the Biden administration, even in its last days, is trying very hard to see if they can take this and turn it into something that could use as a more lasting political settlement. The question is, does Bibi Netanyahu want to take this enormous victory and turn it into that settlement?",

One woman told CNN he committed crimes that we have paid the price for. Another Palestinian woman saying to me, after the killing of Haniyeh, Hamas' first wife, former political leader who was assassinated of Nasrallah, the former leader of Hezbollah, who was assassinated. We saw people crying in the streets. We haven't yet seen any tears for Sinwar. Now, it's entirely possible that we will see sort of elaborate displays of mourning in the coming days, but it appears to be that the more fundamental question for the vast majority of Gazans is really about survival. I mean, we are talking about 42,000 people dead. We are talking about famine or the brink of famine throughout large parts of the enclave, almost everybody displaced, disease, the reemergence of polio. And so for all the talk in the international community and from the Biden administration, that this could be a pivotal moment, that this could presage somehow, you know, at least the reemergence of those ceasefire talks that had essentially completely broken down for two months for people on the ground in Gaza. They are not optimistic. They are understandably fairly despondent. And as one man said to us, we need food and water. That right now is more important than anything.",

Sinwar particularly, remember, a very brutal man, launched the October 7th attack, but also routinely killed Palestinians. He was called the butcher of Khan Younis because he was butchering Palestinians who were against Hamas, who were looking for perhaps a peaceful path to a Palestinian state. So, this is a bad guy.But does Prime Minister Netanyahu have a plan? No. Because his problem is this, any plan that involves Palestinian political rights will fracture his coalition, which includes some very hard right elements that believe there should never be a Palestinian state.",

And so then you have Donald Trump essentially say this was a day of love. You see the person's reaction, right, that he's like, this isn't really the reaction I want. One of the things you see is the Trump to Biden voters. January 6 is a real issue for them. Character is a real issue for them. She is trying to get some of those Nikki Haley voters, independent voters, centrist voters. So, that's why she's amplifying these messages from Donald Trump that those particular voters will find particularly problematic.

He told the rioters, come to Washington, D.C., will be wild. He told them to go down to the Capitol and fight like hell, and they actually did that. It was a deadly insurrection. And that's what makes him so dangerous is because not only did he incite a deadly insurrection, the most egregious action against our democracy, but then he goes on to lie about it. And it gets back to this issue of character. The last CNN -- most recent CNN poll found that the majority, almost by double digits of voters there, likely voters, find that she actually has the qualities of a leader that they want, that she's got the right temperament to be the president.

As you know, despite Biden's push for a ceasefire, Prime Minister Netanyahu says the war will continue. Considering that Netanyahu has repeatedly defied U.S. policy, has the U.S. lost its ability to persuade him to change course? SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO):  I think it's very important for the United States to continue to push for a mutual ceasefire and to push for a release of the hostages. Sinwar has been an incredible, as you know, Wolf, obstacle to peace for decades and decades and decades. He was the mastermind behind the October 7th attack on Israel that resulted in the killing of 1,200 Israelis and the kidnapping of hundreds of hostages, including Americans. And I think this is a very good day for Israel, for the United States of America. But I think it's very important for the U.S. to stand for the principle that once this war is finished, we need a two-state objective in this region.
