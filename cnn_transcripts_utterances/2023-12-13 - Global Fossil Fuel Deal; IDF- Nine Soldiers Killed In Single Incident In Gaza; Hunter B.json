A few hoursago, nearly 200 countries signed on to a historic climate deal to move away from fossil fuels. The Israeli military suffered one of its biggest losses yet in the ground assault in Gaza. We have a live report from Tel Aviv. And diplomatic success. Vietnam's leader is calling a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, a new historic milestone. Welcome to the show, and we begin with historic climate deal in Dubai. Nearly 200 countries around the world have forged an agreement that includes an unprecedented cold transition away from fossil fuels, but several loose ends remain. The deal reached earlier today at the COP28 summit falls short of requiring the world to phase out coal, oil and gas, a measure many nations and climate advocates have backed. Instead, it presents a series of eight options, options to reduce carbon pollution asking countries to \"contribute to the goal of achieving net zero by the year 2050.\" Well, we have a team of coverage, we're standing by with David McKenzie in Johannesburg for us. We've also got CNN's Chief Climate Correspondent, Bill Weir in New York. Great to see you both. David, we know these negotiations were really tough. And it went in over time. What was really interesting is that it was actually very quick to pass through after the plenary session. The wording here matters, fossil fuels finally in this agreement, but yes, there are loopholes.",

And many are saying it's worth a pause here just to say that this is an achievement. But there are significant loopholes. This is not binding. This doesn't call for a specific phase out of fossil fuels. And that was something I was hearing a lot about when we were at COP some days ago, hearing from delegates and activists, but the head of the COP meetings, Sultan Al-Jaber had this to say.

We're talking about finding ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere, the question has always been, is it enough? And we know it is never enough?

It's these practical matters in individual countries, where they of course will make decisions about their individual citizens. The problem is, is the climate crisis is already a crisis. And unless that financing comes from wealthy nations and is executed properly in poorer nations, it doesn't really matter.

Well, the Israeli military now says nine soldiers were killed in a singleincident in northern Gaza as the ongoing battle against Hamas expands. It is among the biggest losses of life in a single incident for Israeli forces since the ground defensive began in October. But as the war enters its third month Israel and the U.S. stand increasingly isolated on the world stage. On Tuesday, the United Nations General Assembly voted to demand immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Israel and the U.S. were to have only 10 votes against the resolution. 153 nations voted for the non-binding ceasefire resolution. Despite Israel's staunch U.S. backing, thus far a rift appears to be growing. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said he and U.S. President Biden disagree on what the future of Gaza looks like. The same day Mr. Biden said that international support for Israel's military campaign is beginning to wane. And Mr. Netanyahu needs to change his conservative hardline government. Well, following all of this from Tel Aviv is our Chief National Security Correspondent, Alex Marquardt. And we've also got Arlette Saenz at the White House for us. Alex, I'd like to start off with you. Seeing those soldiers dying in Gaza one of the biggest losses in a single day for Israel thus far, but we're - it gives us a sense of just how tough it is right now on the ground.",

One of the things that we have seen, perhaps one of the most pointed criticisms right now in terms of Israel's campaign in Gaza, from President Joe Biden.

The president in a closed door fundraiser where the cameras are off, a venue that he often tends to speak a bit more freely said that he believes that Israel is starting to lose international support due to its indiscriminate bombing. He also said that Netanyahu needs to change his approach, but that he is severely limited by the government he currently has in place, calling it one of the most conservative governments in Israeli history. And Biden also noting that Netanyahu does not support a two-state solution. There are very real differences between the U.S. and Israel, when it comes to talking about the post-conflict status. Netanyahu yesterday very publicly said that he disagrees with what the U.S. has put forward for - to happen in the region after the war. But it really speaks to a remarkable moment when you've seen President Biden really standing shoulder to shoulder with Netanyahu, throughout this conflict. There have been warnings from Biden, that Israel needs to take more care to protect civilian life as they are waging this war in Gaza. But even as we've seen this international pressure for a ceasefire, the U.S. so far has not gone that far. But these remarks from the President and from Netanyahu have - have very clearly shown that that united front is starting to be chipped away at a bit, especially when it comes to the campaign specifically that is occurring in Gaza.",

As you noted, hewas scheduled for a deposition today but the committee chairman on Judiciary and Oversight do not know if Hunter Biden is going to appear. His lawyers had argued that they wanted a public hearing, not a closed door deposition. Their argument that they did not want selective pieces of Hunter Biden's testimony to be leaked in pieces. Instead, they said it would be better to do it publicly. So we are waiting to see whether or not Hunter Biden appears today. The chairman of those respective committees on Oversight and Judiciary have argued that if he does not appear that it is possible they could hold him in contempt of Congress. We also expect to later today that the House Republicans are going to vote to formalize their impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. Specifically, their argument is that they need to get more information and that this is going to bolster their case in court. That is what you heard yesterday from Speaker Mike Johnson. He is saying that this does not necessarily mean that House Republicans would move forward with an impeachment against Biden. Instead, he says that this is just an initial step. But as you might expect, it may be hard once this process gets started next year in an election cycle for Johnson to hold back some of his conservative members or who might be clamoring for a vote despite the fact that there has yet to be any concrete evidence connecting Biden to his President's foreign - his son's foreign business dealings abroad.",

Also, a hotline will be set up to handle incidents from fishing. Other agreements were signed and there was further discussion of economic cooperation between the two nations.
