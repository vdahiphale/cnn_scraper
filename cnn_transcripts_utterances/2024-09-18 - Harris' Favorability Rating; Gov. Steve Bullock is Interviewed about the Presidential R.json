Just by getting into the race, look where she jumped to a month later, at minus three. And this week, for the first time, she popped a positive net favorability rating. That is more people viewed her favorably than unfavorably.If you had asked me two months ago whether I thought Kamala Harris, in the aggregate, would ever, during this campaign, pop a positive net favorability rating, I would have said you were crazy.

This is actually higher than he was in the last two campaigns at this point, but still underwater at minus nine points.Joe Biden at minus 14 points here. And this, I think, Harris' initial net favorability rating was kind of tracking that Biden's, right, because she was the vice president.

And we see that the Democrats lead on that generic ballot by a point.Right now, in the national popular vote polls, we see Kamala Harris up by three points. So, she is actually outperforming, slightly but still is, outperforming the generic House Democrat. So, this, to me, is an idea that as she has gotten on the campaign trail, she's not just met sort of the generic benchmark, she's actually doing slightly better than the generic benchmark, which kind of goes into this whole thing that maybe Kamala Harris and her campaign know what they're doing, despite the fact that folks don't like the economy, and I think that's part of what's keeping this campaign close. Folks remember what they believe was a good economy under Donald Trump. That's keeping things close.

But what we haven't seen is whether people who haven't had a heart event would also be helped by these medications. Now this new study uses AI and real-world data to estimate that people who haven't yet had heart event would also have a 15 to 20 percent lower risk of having a heart attack or stroke with a GLP-1 versus not using one. And they did this in a super interesting way, Kate. They used artificial intelligence and applied it to real-world health records, specifically looking at ECGs, or electrocardiograms. They used this AI algorithm to essentially predict the risk somebody might have a heart attack or stroke, and then they used that algorithm to compare people on these medicines versus off these medicines. And then they saw that risk reduction. This translates, they say, into potential reduction of 34,000 heart attacks and strokes in the U.S. per year if these folks were able to take these medicines.",

But they're still quite expensive out-of-pocket.For the Medicare population, there was one estimate in the journal \"Health Affairs\" that even if five percent of eligible patients got these weight loss drugs, it would add an additional $3 billion per year in spending. And so, you can imagine that's just 5 percent. If you really ramp that up to a lot more, that's a lot of spending.
