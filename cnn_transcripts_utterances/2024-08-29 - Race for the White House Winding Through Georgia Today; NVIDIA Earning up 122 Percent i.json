The reason she was doing better in these Sunbelt states, as the Fox News poll shows, is that she's doing better with younger voters. She has consolidated Black voters. She's done better with Latino voters, homes of the Democratic Party that frankly, Joe Biden was just leaving on the floor. Because, you know, folks have problems with his candidacy. Now that she has brought those back into the fold, there is a much wider map for her when we look at the Electoral College.

It's also forecasting third quarter revenue of $32.5 billion, which is only slightly better than estimates. And that is why the markets are not impressed. Now, after the report, NVIDIA shares traded lower, with shares dipping down some 6.9 percent after hours. Look, NVIDIA is huge. It is the benchmark for chips and for AI as a whole. And you have all the tech giants from Microsoft and Meta to Google, as all of them are building up their AI infrastructure. They have been spending big on NVIDIA's unparalleled processors that power AI, and that includes generative AI, which is the tech behind ChatGPT. Now, NVIDIA is making a mint here, but it's also facing a number of challenges. Let's just run through a couple of them. There have been concerns over production delays for its next generation chips. Also some talk about the potential for rising production costs, antitrust concerns, as well as rising competition, including from the Chinese tech giant Huawei. But analysts point out, look, it's still early days yet. We're still at the very beginnings of the AI revolution, and there's more upside to come. And so when NVIDIA reports earnings, it's a big deal. It's been called like the Super Bowl for the financial markets. And it's because investors, they've grown so accustomed to NVIDIA smashing forecasts that when NVIDIA only beats them, they shrug, they're not impressed. That's what's happening here.

Hundreds of elephants have already been killed in Namibia and across southern Africa by the drought.And so they're saying they will be culling the animals that come from national parks and communal areas with sustainable game numbers and in areas where their population exceeds the available grazing and water resources. So this has already led to some deadly human wildlife conflict. A lot of elephants have killed people there. So the earmarked 723 wild animals, let me just run you through the list of these species that they will be killing to feed the people. 83 elephants, that's a big headline there, but that also includes 60 buffaloes, 30 hippos, 300 zebras, 100 blue wildebeest, 50 impalas and 100 elands. Namibia being forced to do this because it's been suffering from the El Nino weather phenomenon, which has spread all across southern Africa. And this has been exacerbated by the climate crisis. And this is one of the ways they see to put people first over the animals to protect them, because as this drought bites in this country, the worst in 100 years, they have to keep the people safe and they see no other way.

But also, this is a part of the world where game meat has been eaten for hundreds of years. Obviously, conservation efforts have put a stop to most of that. But there's still some activity around that. And the government says that these animals will be killed by professional hunters and distributed to people across the country.
