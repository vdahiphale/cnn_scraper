In Colorado, the Supreme Court there, the highest court, they took Trump off the ballot, or said that he should be off the ballot pending review by the Supreme Court.In Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, she says it's her decision she decided to remove him from the ballot. He is ineligible. And there are going to be appeals there in the state court system. If that just continues on as it's continuing on. If the Supreme Court doesn't get involved, then we may have a primary cycle where each state is deciding on their own what to do. Several states of course, have decided Trump is eligible for their primary ballots and is putting him on those ballots, places like Michigan, places like California we just heard about this week where Trump will be on the ballot despite some challenges at various levels. But this is still a big question before the Supreme Court because the Colorado Republican Party is saying once Colorado moved this way to take Trump off the ballot then other states will follow. We did just see Maine. And so there is this question of can the Supreme Court bring clarity across the land? Will they make a decision? Do these sorts of entities at the state level even have the power to take someone off the ballot because of the insurrection clause of the Constitution?",

This comes from Ukraine, which is just suffered the largest Russian aerosol since the Russian invasion began nearly two years ago. You can see an individual there being cold from the rubble. Again, this is Kharkiv. We are told at least 26 people have been killed across Ukraine with well over 100 injured. Those numbers will almost certainly increase. We're getting new reports of deaths from different parts of the country. Again, that video coming from Kharkiv here in the east. You can see the scope of this Russian attack because Kharkiv was in Sumy, Dnipro, Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Lviv, other locations as well, but it spans this attack did the entire country. I want to bring in CNN military analyst retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Cedric, what are we seeing here from the Russians and why?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, good morning, John. What we're seeing is really a Russian offensive via air. So this Russian air offensive is designed to go after the critical infrastructure of Ukraine. There was some military targets radar installations in particular, that the Russians didn't target. But for the most part, they went after civilian infrastructure targets. This is a replay of what we saw last year where what the desire was by the Russians to, in essence, take out the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine take out all the medical facilities, all the power stations, things of that nature, and make life a living hell for people in Ukraine during this winter. That is exactly what we're seeing here. In some ways this is revenge probably for the attack on the Russian ship in Crimea that just happened a few days ago. It's also a statement by Putin that he wants to bring Ukraine to basically to its knees, and force it to negotiate at this point in time.",

They know that Ukrainian supplies in terms of munitions or defense munitions, in particular, are dwindling. And as a result, they're trying to overwhelm the defenses right now, so that they gain the upper hand militarily. When they do that, they are going to, in essence, go after areas that have weakened defenses from like the Patriot missile system, ATACMS similar systems. And that is the basic idea behind. They're trying to, in essence, take out all of these critical areas so that they can have an easier time of it militarily.And perhaps a side bonus for them would be to move the front lines a little bit in Russia's favor. I don't think that happened as a result of this, because the Ukrainians have withstood similar attacks before but that is basically the Russian goal at this point.",

The kinds of spectacular successes that we've seen with the Ukrainian air defenses have been really, really incredible. And we saw it today or overnight, it was a real concerted effort by the Ukrainian air defenses to protect the country. And in spite of that, you know, you still had about 20 or so percent of the missiles come through and hit their intended targets.But a few months from now or a month from now, it's going to be much worse for the Ukrainians because there's a finite supply of Patriot missiles that could be part of this.
