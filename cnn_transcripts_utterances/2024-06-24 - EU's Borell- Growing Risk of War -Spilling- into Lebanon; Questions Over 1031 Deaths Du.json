Now, it's a crucial issue in the presidential election. You're watching live pictures from Washington where it's 9 am. It's 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi, I'm Eleni Giokos. And this is \"Connect the World\". People in Southern Russia are in mourning after deadly attacks on police, synagogues and churches. And Benjamin Netanyahu says the intense phase of Israel's war with Hamas is nearly over but the focus is shifting to the Lebanon border. Well, the stock market in New York opens in about 30 minutes from now and it's a mixed picture ahead of the opening bell. Will bring you those numbers on how the DOW futures are faring right now. As you can see, DOW is up around two tenths of a percent, NASDAQ sitting down three tenths of a percent, the S&amp;P is flat investors are still pondering whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. And there's been no move so far with U.S. inflation remaining stubbornly above the 2 percent target range. We'll bring you an update on the opening bell, and about half an hour from now. Well, the intense phase of the war with Hamas is about to end. Those are the words of Israel's Prime Minister, and his first one on one interview with Israeli media since October 7th attacks. Now Benjamin Netanyahu also said that Israel's military could shift its focus to the northern border with Lebanon. His comments coming as Israel's Defense Minister is in Washington to meet with top U.S. officials. I want to bring in our Paula Hancocks live from Jerusalem, Paula, great to see you. The prime minister also making comments about a partial deal with Hamas, tell us about how Hamas is responding to that and very crucial messaging, frankly, from Benjamin Netanyahu at this point?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, so this is Eleni, one of the first real moments of clarity publicly and on the record that we've had from theIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in some time when it comes to the future of what is happening in Gaza. Now, as you say, he has said the intense part of the war is over, the military's focus can shift to the northern border, shift to the increasing cross border attacks between Hezbollah and the Israeli military. But when it comes to the actual war itself, he has said that that is not over. He has said that the current stage that we are seeing in Rafah could be phased out that could be over but not the overall war. And this feeds into what he's saying when it comes to the hostage ceasefire deal that's on the table at this point. So he said that he is ready to accept a partial deal with Hamas for some hostages. Now, he has also said that once that ceasefire is over, then he will go back to the war. And he will go back to trying to eliminate the group and he is not willing to give up on the idea of destroying Hamas. And what this really means is it appears to be at odds with this U.S. lead hostage deal which U.S. President Joe Biden has very publicly put his support behind. The Biden Administration even suggesting it was an Israeli proposal that Israel had signed on to, but what we're hearing from Netanyahu is that he's only partially invested in this. Now there has been criticism from the hostage families themselves saying it cannot be just some hostages which come home that did have to be all of them. And we've also had a statement from Hamas saying that this shows that Netanyahu is rejecting a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a complete ceasefire and also rejecting the plan that has been pushed by President Biden. Hamas has been clear that it wants a more specific timeline for a permanent ceasefire. And that is not what we're hearing from Benjamin Netanyahu at this point, Eleni.",

Well, now to Dagestan, Russian region in mourning today after a stringof deadly and apparently coordinated attacks. Authorities say at least 19 people were killed when gunman opened fire on multiple places of worship and a police traffic stop on Sunday. Four civilians are among the dead including a priest. The other victims were all police officers, some praise for the attack has emerged on a telegram channel used by ISIS-K but there's been no claim of responsibility. We've got CNN's Clare Sebastian, who's reported extensively from Russia for us, joining us now from London. Clare, a tragic story here!

So those numbers are slowly creeping up as the scale of this attack unfolds. As you say they are confident this was coordinated. We saw these attacks happening starting in the sort of early evening of Sunday in two cities more than 100 kilometers apart Makhachkala just the original capital and that event and ancient city, just south along the Caspian Sea Coast of Dagestan. What we don't have yet is a claim of responsibility. But as you say, we are seeing now some praise for this attack on an ISIS affiliated telegram channel and a channel used by the Islamic State Khorasan Province, also known as ISIS-K, the same group that almost immediately claimed responsibility after that very deadly terrorist attack on Moscow, the Crocus city concert hall three months ago. So this is different, this is not a claim of responsibility. So this means that there are still questions around who exactly was behind this and whether or not there are still accomplices or attackers at large the Investigative Committee which is now handling the criminal investigation into this says that five militants were killed, but we understand that there are still efforts on going to find more accomplices. But as I said, this is just three months after the deadliest terror attack in Russia in several decades at the Crocus city concert hall. So there will be questions being raised serious security questions over why another attack has happened again.",

Salma look, we finally have the official death toll number after frankly many days, Saudi Arabia saying the unauthorized trips accounting for many of the fatalities.

We know that becauseshe was in court with both, Trump and his co-defendants lawyers on Friday, as well as the prosecutors from the Special Counsel's Office. They're back again today in part two of a four part hearing, there are four different things that she is going to be looking at and questioning over the course of three days in court. So today, this morning in about an hour, she's going to start looking at the funding of the special Counsel's Office. A special prosecutor appointed by the Attorney General is the money that's being used for that legal under the way Congress dedicated those funds. Now, that is a question that others in other cases have tried to test. And they have not succeeded as if that, but Judge Aileen Cannon. It's her courtroom. This is a separate district, a separate case. So she is going to be looking at that. And then this afternoon, it turns to a prosecutor requests. The prosecutors are quite concerned about what Donald Trump has had to say publicly about law enforcement, specifically FBI agents that took part in the search of Mar-a-Lago in August of 2022. He said false and misleading things such as that he was in danger that they were authorized to use force against him. And we're looking to do that that is not the case. There were standard protocols in place for that search. And Trump wasn't even in Florida when it took place. So prosecutors are going to the judge and saying he should not be able to keep speaking this way. It is dangerous for the FBI and the agents involved. And potentially it could hurt the upcoming trial whenever that may be still a lot to go in this case heading forward. We don't have a trial date.

All right, well, just three days from now, U.S. President Joe Biden and Former President Donald Trump meet for the first presidential debates of 2024 here on CNN when they take the stage in Atlanta on Thursday. It will be the first time, a sitting U.S. president and a former president face off. Biden's campaign says the President spent the weekend hunkered down at Camp David for intense preparation and held mock debate sessions. Trump has taken the opposite approach by holding informal briefing sessions with his advisors and allies and as kept up an active campaign schedule so lots happening on that front. CNN's Kevin Liptak is focusing on Biden's campaign debates and prep. And we've got Alayna Treene covering Trump's campaign for us as well, bringing you both sides of the spectrum here.

And you know we don't actually expect to see President Biden before Thursday when he heads down to Atlanta for this debate. And I don't think it's any secret why his campaign and why the President is spending the better part of a week in these preparations. They know that they can't afford an underwhelming performance. And they recognize you know, any kind of slip up, a mental slip up, a verbal slip up, is just going to be magnified in the glare of those debate lights. And so that's why the President is spending so much time down there. I think one of the questions for the Biden campaign and one of the struggles in preparing for a debate with Donald Trump is you don't necessarily know which version is going to show up on the debate stage. Is it you know, pugilistic, interrupting, yelling Donald Trump, or is it a more restrained, more presidential Trump? And according to Biden advisors, they are preparing for both of those scenarios. Now, we did get something of an insight into the strategy heading into the debate. The Biden campaign put out this memo yesterday sort of laying out their efforts to boost enthusiasm among their supporters for this debate. But it also sort of laid out the issues that President Biden wants to really hammer in on and there are three of them in specific. One is on abortion, and certainly the Biden campaign believes abortion and the restoration of Roe vs. Wade will be a galvanizing issue for Democrats in November. The other is democracy, the potential threat to democracy that Trump poses. And the third is the economy, which is obviously the number one issue for many voters. So President Biden really hammering those issues as he continues this debate preps this week.",

But if you consider this sort of a test drive, they're halfway through it. And now they can't seem to finish. The issues are helium leaks and thruster problems or 24 thrusters on this. And they had a five -- four of them shut down, several of them shut down. I can't read the exact number on that they had five helium leaks that occurred here. Helium is an inert gas generally. It's not something that's going to react with a lot of things. But in space, it has a lot of applications, one of which would be to pressurized fuel tanks. So without gravity, it pushes the fuel to where it needs to be to be ignited. That may be the issue here. We don't know how much helium they lost, really, we don't know how much they had to burn and testing to figure out where the leaks were. And we don't know where that leaves them in terms of helium now, to use the thrusters to get away from the space station, and to deorbit. That's why this is concerning. The bottom line is it was supposed to come and go. And space is a place where you like things to be predictable, a lot of work, a lot of time and a lot of technology goes into just that.
