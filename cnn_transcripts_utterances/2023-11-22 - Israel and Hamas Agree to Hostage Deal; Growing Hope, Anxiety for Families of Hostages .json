And I say that from the perspective of the families of the hostages with whom we have spoken and at least according to the reports we're seeing and the numbers we have seen from the Israeli public. This is something they were waiting for, the first release of hostages.It is what one family told us the beginning of what they hope will be a process. Fifty women and children opens the door and builds a structure, a framework to continue this process and try to release more hostages if the pause in fighting holds and if this process works out. Crucially, we're not there yet, and the pause in fighting has not begun. And that's part -- and that's because the last part of the Israeli legal and political process is right now happening. After the full government vote late last night, or I should say early, early this morning, there's a 24-hour window in which someone can file an appeal to the Supreme Court to try to stop it. Once that clock runs out, then the government can announce that a ceasefire has begun. The release of Israeli hostages, women and children held in Gaza, can begin. The release of 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails can begin. Crucially, Israel put out a list earlier today of 300 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails. So it seems to be saying, Look, there's an offer here after this first 50 Israeli hostages. If you release ten more Israeli hostages, we can continue this on a day- by-day basis. So at least that window is there. Certainly, the international community trying to push this into something broader than just a single hostage exchange.",

M.J., walk us through a little bit more of what you've learned over the last 24 hours about how this deal came together. M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, all day yesterday, we were talking about Abigail Edan, the 3-year-old American citizen toddler and the hope that she could be among the first 50 hostages that are released. But now U.S. officials say that they know of at least two other American citizens, two women. So the hope now is that there could be three American citizens that are in the mix of the women and children that are first released in this first phase of the process. But as you say, Erica, there are ten Americans that are unaccounted for right now. And what isn't clear is could there be, for example, adult men in the mix who wouldn't be counted in that first phase? And how would the U.S. government try to get them out. And what they have said is that they believe this deal is incentivized in such a way as Oren was just talking about, so that after the first 50, Hamas would have an incentive to continue releasing more hostages. But obviously, this is a very slow process. And as far as the women and children are concerned, the ones that will be released, there is a very long road ahead of them in terms of medical attention and making sure that they can actually safely get out of Gaza, as well.",

Of course, there's been collateral damage, as there always is in war. I think Israel is bracing for a much different -- much more difficult advance into Gaza. So Hamas is under pressure militarily and, therefore, has to do this deal. And there is a sense that the world is recognizing the depravity of what Hamas did on October 7. And Hamas may not have anticipated the reaction to holding women and children. It's almost a concession by Hamas. This is a problem for us. We have to give back the women and children. That said, the risk is what happens after these four or five days. What happens when the 50 hostages are released. Does Hamas say, All right, we'll give you ten more. We'll give you ten more.

The one community or constituency we're not talking about in this conversation is the Israeli public. And this is gut-wrenching for the Israeli public. Just to put it in context, if you compare Israel's population to the U.S. population, so for every Israeli, there's about 35 Americans, given the differential in size. So if we're talking about 50 hostages, women and children, being released, that would be like 1,750 American women and children being held hostage and being released. There's still another 40 -- the equivalent, in American terms, 40,000 hostages.

Yes, we're starting to see it end across portions of Philadelphia and New York, but still dealing with some issues around Hartford, Boston, and especially interior. That's where we've got that rain and even a bit of freezing rain. Snow totals here, where you've got these advisories, about 6 inches.

Yes, as this system progresses Eastward, we are going to start to see things drying out slowly but surely as we head into the afternoon.
