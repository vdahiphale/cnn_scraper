We're standing by for lawmakers to reconvene at this pivotal moment in a partisan fight that began with a gun control protest.Also tonight, an employee opens fire at a Louisville bank killing four people and leaving nine others injured. We're learning more about the now dead shooter, the note he left behind and how he live streamed the attack as it was happening. And new moves to freeze a ruling that could block access to a widely used abortion pill starting this week.

Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.

He stopped here, so he's getting ready to speak to the crowd.Wolf, if you saw the crowd and how large it was to march from city hall to this location, there are hundreds of people who filed him back to the statehouse. Now, this is the moment he's going to talk. So, hold on, Wolf. STATE REP. JUSTIN JONES (D-TN):  Today, we're setting a resounding message that democracy will not be killed in the comfort of silence. Today, we send a clear message to Speaker Cameron Sexton that the people will not allow his crimes against democracy to happen without challenge. The people of Nashville have spoken today through their council members and democracy. We stand for the vision of a multiracial democracy. Democracy is our -- the vision we're offering to this body, this building that has forgotten it. And so we're waiting now for the minutes from the city council meeting, but I want to thank everybody for coming out, the thousands of people from across the state and across this nation who showed up. Because this is not about one person, it's not about one position, but it's about a movement of people power to restore the soul and heart of what this building should represent, and that is democracy. And so I want to thank you all for being here today, particularly the young people who are the heartbeat of this movement. It was students walking out of classes and taking to this Capitol that led us into the well that day calling for common sense gun laws, and the first thing I do when I walk into this building as a representative is to continue that call for common sense gun legislation. Secondly, we are calling on House Speaker Cameron Sexton to resign as speaker of the House. He is an enemy of democracy and the people have spoken. And so we'll continue to speak up and resist and show up because this is the rebirth, the resurrection of a movement in Tennessee that's going to keep going not just today, but in the days ahead. We will continue to show out in berth a new south because, right here in Nashville, we've had movements before, led by young people that transformed this nation and is our time again, forward together, not one step back.",

Wade and eliminating a constitutional right to abortion nationwide.But it's important to know that the Supreme Court did not outlaw abortion throughout the country, and, in fact, many states still allow it. And the most common method of abortion is this medication abortion pill that's at issue in these cases. It also involves FDA approval of a drug that dates back to the year 2000. FDA expertise in this, the judge from Texas last Friday, rejected and invalidated it. So, the judge put his ruling against the FDA and this drug on hold for seven days, and today, the Department of Justice went to the Fifth Circuit Regional Court of Appeals to say, give us a little more time to let appeals in this case go forward. Eventually, it will probably go to the Supreme Court where, as I say, it's a different kind of case, and I actually think because of what it involves, FDA authority and expertise over medicine and drugs in America, it has a stronger chance probably to prevail than what happened when we had the Dobbs case in the summer.

First of all, Wolf, it means that the U.S. government believes there's no reason, no legitimate reason for Russia to have arrested Evan Gershkovich and to have charged him with espionage.Essentially, they believe he's being held as a political pawn. The second -- the State Department deputy spokesperson saying today, journalism is not a crime. And now that they have this designation formally handed out, it means that Evan Gershkovich's case is going to be handled at the State Department, by the special envoy for hostage affairs and that will unleash the U.S. government to put forth all of the resources possible to try and secure his release as soon as possible.",

He's now been in jail for almost two weeks in Russia.We should note that he has been visited by lawyers who are representing him on behalf of \"The Wall Street Journal\". They have reported that he is in good health, but the fact that he hasn't been visited by U.S. officials is really concerning the State Department is pushing for that that we should note that it's pretty typical that Russia tries to keep out U.S. officials for as long as possible when Brittney Griner was detained by Russians last year.
