All of this beginning in Falls Township, Pennsylvania, a Bucks County community, about 30 miles northeast of Philadelphia. We've got team coverage of this breaking news, which is now zeroing in on the Trenton, New Jersey area as well. We'll get to former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey in a moment. But let's begin with CNN's Danny Freeman. You're very familiar with the Philadelphia area. But now we're talking about a manhunt that has now led to a barricade situation and reportedly involving hostages across state lines in New Jersey?",

Three people dead at this point, and as you said, reports now that not only is the suspect barricaded but also potentially holding hostages.But let me tell you, Fred, a little bit about how this all started. This started just before 9:00 a.m. That's according to Falls Township Police Department. They initially got a call of a shooting in Levittown, Pennsylvania, again about 30 miles north of Philadelphia. Police then said that 26-year-old Andre Gordon shot and killed two people. Then, he went to a separate address in Levittown, Pennsylvania, and shot and killed a third person. Then, he went to Dollar General in Morrisville, Pennsylvania. That's right on the border of Pennsylvania, New Jersey. Carjacked someone at Dollar General then drove over the line to Trenton. Now, like you said, police said that Gordon knew all of the victims that he shot and killed, not the person that he carjacked just on the border of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. And police also said that they believe he used an assault rifle in these shootings. Now, according to Jeff Dence, that's the chairman of the Falls Township board of supervisors. He is the one who gave us the information that this suspect is now barricaded in a building in Trenton, New Jersey with potential hostages. The one good news though at this moment is that, that shelter in place, that was in place for hours and Falls Township, in that Pennsylvania community, that has been lifted, again, according to Mr. Dence. But it's still tense, and you can tell that police are going to be untangling exactly what led up to this moment. And, of course, the ongoing situation in Trenton as we speak.",

That's according to police. But in terms of who may be with him in this barricade situation, we really don't have much more information.But I will say at one point, f Falls Township police said that he is known to have been homeless at times as well. So, it's unclear exactly what the ties are to Trenton. But, again, as you've been watching your television. The choppers are over watching these increasing police presence in this area of Trenton. It's certainly an active scene right now.",

And they found very quickly to deceased people at that home. We still don't know the genders. We still know the specific relationship, but they also realized that at that point, this -- the police, that Gordon, their suspect had already been driving a stolen vehicle. That was how they were able to trace to the second block in Levittown in the same community, where there was that second shooting, and a third person was killed. And then, that was where this all began. Again, police say that the suspect, Andre Gordon, knew all three of the victims that he shot and killed. So -- but again, I think the question as to what the relationship was? That is something we're still learning. And one thing I'll note, Fred is this area has -- had a tough couple of months. There was a story that I covered up there of a beheading in that general area. This is a sleepy, pretty calm, suburban community. Just I can't imagine the fear that especially during that shelter, Sesame Place is nearby. They had to shut their doors. That parade that you were speaking about for St. Patrick's Day also had to stop. Very unsettling for this area.",

We can hear chainsaws, crews have really been at it all day long, trying to clean up some of the debris that you can see behind me.Now, this is just a glimpse, Fredricka, of all the damage that we're seeing across Lakeview. And you can really see just debris scattered everywhere. Feet away from me is a roof that belong to the home right behind me. A car here, this Honda CRV has been smashed in with its windows blown out. And this, this object here, you can't really make out what it is very well. But the person who lives in this home told us that it's actually a dog house that flew out from a next-door neighbor that's now on their property. So, that cleanup process is ongoing.

She said they were there for about 15 minutes, but it felt like an eternity.I asked her as well, Fredricka, you know, do you remember the last conversation that you had when you got into that closet? And she told me, she described her husband's hand, she prayed and she asked the Lord, she said, to just keep them safe, keep them sheltered, as well as the other people here in Lakeview as well. And if you could see inside, from where we're standing. This is the room that we're talking about here. You can see a beam of wood smashed through the side of the wall. This roofs completely caved in. So, really their home has been severely damaged, but they're very grateful to still have each other. And also, the fact that the community has really been coming together through all of this pain, all of this destruction, it's going to be a long road to rebuilding. We heard the governor of Ohio mentioned how the community is going to bounce back, a lot of that he mentioned has to do with the strength of the community here. I also spoke with a contractor who is working for free to make sure that a lot of these roofs are waterproof.

And Jacob Hudson is here to tell us all about it. My goodness, Jacob. I mean, what a moment. You go shopping and then the next thing you know you all are you know taking shelter. So, did you know the storm was coming? What happened while you were in that Walmart? JACOB HUDSON, TRAPPED INSIDE WALMART DURING TORNADO: Yes. Well, we had no idea the storm was going to be anything like that. Actually, we live about 10 minutes away. And when we left our home, it was actually sunny and nice out. Kids playing outside and everything. And we got there -- we got to Walmart maybe around 7:30. By the time we got to you know, Winchester, the sky definitely turned and it was, you could see storms coming in. But we were just shopping like normal, and suddenly, everybody's phones in the store went off. And that was the tornado warning. And we were almost done. So, we were actually going to just try to get home and then, employee said, hey, you guys need to go to the produce area, you know, storm is coming in. So, just take shelter for now. So, some people stay in the produce area, some stayed in a office and he put us in a family restroom. And we were in there maybe 10 to 15 minutes, nothing was happening. We open the door tried to get some air and just hear what was going on. And then, suddenly a worker rush, she said it's hitting here right now. And came in and dove in there with us. We hurry up and shut the door and within seconds you could just hear wind going crazy and things banging around outside. And, you know, we just hid there -- (CROSSTALK)",

And I want to point out that March, tornadoes do happen. We just expect them more in the deep south, now, where they were in the upper Midwest. Well, here is a look at radar right now. You can see we've got lots of lightning as storms start to fire up across Texas. That's the area that's under the bullseye. Today, you can see that yellow slight risk for large hail damaging winds and a few more tornadoes also possible again today. But the threatened really zeroes in on hail in parts of Texas today. We're talking hail up to two inches in diameter. And you might be thinking, well, what does that look like? And we're talking about hail to the size of baseball, it's baseball sized hail, as we go through the day. That can honestly really cause injury to people. It could come crashing through windows, and you know, if that hit you, and hit you in the wrong spot, could really cause some injury. So, you want to keep that in mind. Again, if you're in Texas if you've got a place to put your car inside of a garage, you'll want to do that as you go through the day today for that hail up to the size of baseballs. This could also come with some flooding rain. We're talking about rain two inches per hour possible. So, could come with some heavy rain.

And you can see it it's a very, I would say typical residential area inside of Trenton. You see there, row homestyle homes with also duplexes. And what we've been watching Fred, to share with viewers is basically law enforcement officers decked out in tactical gear approach this one particular home at one point, even staging on what looks like the roof of the home and trying to what it looked like was free hostages from that particular house. Now, we had heard earlier in this afternoon from a township supervisor that they feared the suspect that we've been talking about, Andre Gordon, 26-year-old was inside of that home, barricaded with hostages. Well, the Falls Township Police Department, they then, confirmed to CNN as well. They believe that there are hostages in there, and now we've been seeing again, excuse me, again, these images of police dressed in that tactical gear approaching that home and at one point it seemed carefully taking someone out of that home that did not seem to be a suspect.

But this person allegedly is barricaded. That there are hostages.

And he has ties to Trenton, New Jersey, where this barricade situation is unfolding right now. So one would think that investigators are getting more of a clue into what the motive behind this may be. But that's the thing that we definitively know from police is that he knew those people, that he shot and allegedly killed, and that he has a reason to go into Trenton. And that was -- just to describe the area a little bit more, that area of Bucks County, it's on the border of Pennsylvania -- or rather, the border of New Jersey and where he's alleged to have stolen the car, Morrisville, New Jersey, at a Dollar General. It's right across the river, right across the Delaware from Trenton, New Jersey. So between that and between him having allegedly connections to that city, it makes sense that police would have been able to track him there, it seems fairly quickly.

And again, and initially, as you've been seeing on your television, we were given his mugshot -- or it's, I guess, his driver's license photo right there, just to put the alert out.

Yes, around 12:25, because the -- they are focusing in on this home right here. You could just see, I mean, the police presence is -- it seems to be growing. Some tactical vehicles right there.

Not just to bring people in who, like us, want to cover this and bring this story to the world. But more importantly, to bring those who are desperate to get out. It's been a lot of diplomats, in particular, that have left but others are on the list. In fact, some of the pilots that we've spoken with say they have lists that are hundreds of people desperate to get out. Of course, that is really a luxury. Many of the Haitians don't have that opportunity, nor can they even consider it. So for them, it's about having to deal with what is a worsening situation with each passing day and hoping that the U.N. or other foreign forces that might be able to bring aid can do that as strategically and quickly as possible.
