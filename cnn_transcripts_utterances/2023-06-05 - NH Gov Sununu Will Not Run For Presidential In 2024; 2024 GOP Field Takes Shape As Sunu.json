A 2024 announcement coming right here in just moments, standby for a CNN exclusive.Plus, President Trump's lawyers meeting with the Justice Department right now, as the special counsel's probe appears to be nearing its final stages. We'll walk through what those lawyers are asking for, and just what this could mean. And another CNN exclusive, Ukraine cultivating a network of agents inside Russia to carry out attacks of sabotage, and U.S. officials believe they were behind that brazen Kremlin drone strike just last month. We begin the hour, though, with a CNN exclusive. We know the Republican presidential field will grow by three this week. Mike Pence, Chris Christie, and Doug Burgum all have announcements teed up. That will get us to 10 declared GOP candidates. Will that be it, or will there be more? Chris Sununu has been a maybe for months, a Donald Trump critic who is also the popular governor of the state with the first primary on the Republican nominating calendar. Well, today, Governor Sununu is ready to share his decision right here. CNN's Dana Bash live in New Hampshire with this exclusive interview -- Dana.",

It wouldn't have been easy, but, boy, when we polled in a place like Iowa, where you look at, what, 80 percent of Republicans, something like that, don't even participate in the caucus, you got to invite them to the table. They want to have a voice. They want a candidate that inspires them and gets them excited. So, when we did all those numbers, while the math was really there, not easy, but a little unconventional, but definitely a path, and one I encourage all the other candidates to really look at. But I'm more concerned about the party as a whole. Look, I'm young. Maybe I could run in the future or something like that.

But nonetheless, without him in the race, it means everybody now has a clean shot and trying to win in New Hampshire, coming out of whatever happens in Iowa. So that's the first thing.I think the second is, the Governor Sununu is somebody who has, as we could see there, and as we've seen up to the run up to this moment is willing to speak his mind. And he seems determined to continue to do that. And if he endorses somebody that might have an impact. But I think the other point that he made, which is that he's going to be tougher on people who are hanging around and not making any progress to get out of the race.

We'll call them credible candidates, threshold candidates for president. The three to the right of your screen will make the official announcement this week.Mike Pence, the former vice president actually filed the paperwork with the Federal Election Commission today. So, by law, he is considered a candidate today, even though he makes his official announcement later in the week. You look at that group right there. And the governor said, he didn't want to name names yet because they're all his friends. But he also said he considers some of them, not his word, my word pretenders. People who are running for attention to sell books, or maybe for the possibility of being in the Trump cabinet or being Trump's vice- presidential running mate. The question is, he said, get out by Christmas time. That's before anybody votes. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Right. In some ways, is that sort of too late, right? I mean, to be getting out, if you're hanging around at six percent. If you're not really making any progress on the debate stage, if you're not really attacking Donald Trump, he is really going to be a voice out there. A needling folks who might not even be able to win their own home states, right? I mean, you think about somebody like Nikki Haley, which I think we'll talk about at some point, and Tim Scott, are they even going to be able to win their own home state of South Carolina? Or is Donald Trump just too strong? The other question about him, I think was he probably got out or decided not to run? Because I don't know if he went his own home state as a sitting governor in New Hampshire. So, I think he's going to be clearly out there. Maybe put his thumb on the scale going into New Hampshire? Who does that benefit? Does it benefit somebody like Ron DeSantis, who looks pretty strong as a number two. But at the same time, Donald Trump is still a pretty formidable number one.",

That's only one thing and he could come around it. DeSantis say, we disagree on this but we agree on that.The question is, A, can he be a kingmaker, or at least an influential player? And B, you just heard him talk about, you know, where Republicans on the environment? Where Republicans on homeless? This. I don't hear other candidates talking about that.

But at this moment in the race, he is the second leading candidate, at least by several metrics.And the Governor Sununu has been quite critical of him. We will see if that continues or not. But we, you know, it is still a wide-open contest, I think. I just got back from several days in Iowa. And I was struck via degree to which, if you like Trump, of course, you're with Trump. But if you're in that looking for someone else lane, there are people who have very open minds, and they are actually looking for someone else. And they're waiting to see this campaign develop. So yes, he will have a role in playing this, but I'm not so sure that he can be a kingmaker even in New Hampshire. As Chris Christie gets in, having a big voice there.

Instead, they went to one floor below the attorney general's office and met with most likely some career officials there.

That's what he promised to do when he appointed Jack Smith to oversee this investigation and the investigation is ongoing into January 6.And so, they did not want any interference with what the -- with the special counsel is doing. You'll remember though, in that letter that Rowley and Jim Trusty, and you definitely see in that those pictures. I believe the other one is Rowley. They said this in their letter, they said that no president of the United States has ever in the history of our country, been baselessly investigated in such an outrageous and an unlawful fashion. And they were saying that they believe that there is prosecutorial misconduct that's been ongoing in this investigation. Again, we don't know, in the end who they met with, John. We do know that again, they were here for about 90 minutes. And as you pointed out, you know, the grand jury is expected back. We know of at least one more witness who is expected to come before this grand jury, which hasn't met since this time last month. So, that could be an indication that we may be near a decision point for the special counsel where there could be charges that could be in the offing.",

Evan just detailed it, outlining what they view as complaints, you know about the process. But Donald Trump as this meeting was breaking up posts on Truth Social this. How can DOJ possibly charge me who did nothing wrong when no other presidents here were charged, when Joe Biden won't be charged for anything? And he goes on and on and on.But the first set inside of Donald Trump, how can DOJ possibly charge me? Is it your sense that this was a meeting on the letter that was complaining about the special counsels' conduct war, sometimes when especially -- when any investigation is wrapping up. The lawyers get a chance to come in and the Justice Department essentially says, here's your chance, talk us out of this? ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSIST, U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: Well, John, for Donald Trump's sake, I would hope it's the latter. Now, it's perfectly normal and common for defense lawyers to request and be given meetings with prosecutors, especially in the sort of closing moments of an investigation, defense lawyers come in. They'll argue to prosecutors. Here's why your case is weak. Here's some of the reasons you should not bring this case. Here's reasons why it would be unfair to bring this case. Now those types of pitches from defense lawyers, sometimes rarely, but sometimes can convince prosecutors either not to charge or perhaps to charge less severe crimes. But if Trump's team thinks they're just going to go in there and sort of vent, unfair, political, that kind of thing. That's just going to be a waste of time, that's not going to have any impact on prosecutors at all.",

If the special counsel wants to present charges, there's a process where they have to put it before the attorney general.But Garland essentially said, yes, I'm washing my hands of this until I have something I have to deal with. Do we even know are the attorneys meeting with special counsel employees? Or are they meeting with Merrick Garland's deputies, who might not have full eyes on the investigation?",

They don't even work in this building. So, they could have come in to DOJ to be to participate in this meeting or to listen in.But again, you know, it certainly doesn't seem like they got what they wanted, which is a meeting with the attorney general, they instead got with somebody who, you know, could at least hear their complaints.
