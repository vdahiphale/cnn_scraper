He's facing a grilling from Republicans about the origins of COVID-19.Also today, for the first time in history, the son of a sitting president of the United States is on trial. Jury selection now underway in Hunter Biden's federal gun case. And history is being made, Mexico electing its first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum. We'll have a live report. Hello, I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington. And you're in the CNN Newsroom. Happening now up on Capitol Hill, Republican lawmakers are turning up the heat on the man who led the U.S. government's response to the COVID pandemic. Dr. Anthony Fauci faces more questions on that response and the origins of the virus that killed nearly 1.2 million Americans. Dr. Fauci will also face questions about e-mail exchanges involving one of his top advisors. A subpoena from the Republican-led committee turned up e-mails where Dr. David Morens appears to be trying to avoid public record laws. CNN's Lauren Fox is up on Capitol Hill for us. CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell is also joining us along with Dr. Paul Offit, he's the director of the Vaccine Education Center of the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and a member of the FDA Vaccine Advisory Committee. Lauren, what will Republican lawmakers underscore in today's hearing?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I just left the hearing room, Wolf. And one thing is very clear, they are trying to lay out in specific detail why they believe Dr. Fauci has not been entirely honest about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, for his part, Dr. Fauci in his opening statement defended his actions during the beginning of that pandemic, laying out in details precisely the steps that he took in trying to understand the origins of the pandemic. He also made clear because of questions about some of his subordinates e-mail practices that he, to the best of his knowledge, he said this in his opening statement, never used his personal e-mail to conduct official business. That obviously is going to be something that Republicans are going to continue to press him at in this hearing.We should note that this is the first time that Dr. Fauci is appearing before a public committee hearing since he retired from NIH in 2022. He did appear, though, back in January in two subsequent days, private testimony behind closed doors, 14 hours in total, where he answered some of the same questions we expect he will get again today. For their part, Democrats are defending Fauci, saying that he is not some kind of villain, that Republicans are trying to paint him as. Here's Representative Raskin. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD), RANKING MEMBER, OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY CMTE.: This investigation of Dr. Fauci shows that he is an honorable public servant committed to public health, and he is not a comic book super villain. He did not fund research to create the COVID-19 pandemic. He did not lie to Congress about gain of function research in Wuhan, and he did not organize a lab leak suppression campaign to cover his tracks. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But already you're seeing from Democrats that they are thanking Dr. Fauci for his service during the pandemic, for his long tenure at NIH. They are also laying out the importance of the vaccine that helped shepherd through the process over the course of the pandemic, saying that it saved lives. That is something else that you can expect Republicans are going to be pressing on in the days and hours ahead. Fauci, or excuse me, Wolf.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, I mean, what you heard from Lauren is really what the focus is today. There isn't a lot of scientific discussion going on, at least good faith efforts, it seems, to talk about the origins of this virus, necessarily, or scientific questions about actions taken early on in the pandemic. We did hear an exchange between the chairman and Dr. Fauci about the efficacy of the COVID vaccine. The Republicans have pressed Dr. Fauci on claims at the beginning of the pandemic that the vaccine prevented transmission and things like that.Dr. Fauci says at the beginning it did look like the vaccine could stop cases of COVID but as time went on, it became clear that didn't last. But what he did point out is that the vaccine has proven to be quite durable in terms of preventing severe disease and death from COVID. He was then asked, is the vaccine 100 percent effective? And he said, I don't think any vaccine is 100 percent effective. So we are hearing some scientific and medical questions peppered in here, but primarily the discussion really has been about Doctor Fauci's oversight of questions about the origin of the virus. [11:05:28] Dr. Fauci really coming in and wanting to address four topics off the top, which really had to do with that, as well as people on his staff who have come into attention for potentially behavior that was not seen as the right way to be transparent about the early days of the pandemic and grants to a certain group, EcoHealth Alliance. But, Wolf, folks I've talked with on both sides of the aisle in the public health community, not expecting a ton of scientific revelations coming out of this hearing today more sort of political focus.",

Jeremy, I just got off the phone with Kristian Andersen and he related to me his concern about the furine site mutation in the spike protein of the currently circulating 2019 nCoV. I told him that as soon as possible, he and Eddie Holmes should get a group of evolutionary biologists together to carefully examine the data to determine if his concerns are validated. He should do this very quickly, and if everyone agrees with this concern, they should report it to the appropriate authorities. I would imagine that in the USA, this would be the FBI, in the U.K., it would be MI5. It would be important to quickly get confirmation of the cause of his concern by experts in the field of coronaviruses and evolutionary biology.In the meantime, I will alert my U.S. government official colleagues of my conversation with you and Kristian and determine what further investigation they recommend. Let us stay in touch. Best regards, Tony. Was this the e-mail where you were putatively trying to cover up the possibility of a lab leak? DR.

The New York Stock Exchange says that it is investigating what they're calling a technical issue involves what's known as limit up, limit down, which is really a safeguard put in place to prevent stock prices from moving too wildly. Now, in just the last few moments, the New York Stock Exchange sent out an update saying that these stocks that have been impacted, they are reopening or are in the process of reopening. And they say that the issue at the heart of this has been resolved. Now we're going to keep an eye to see how these stocks open up trading, because there was a bizarre situation where, as you mentioned, dozens of stocks were halted for no apparent reason.Some of them were showing really unusual moves, most notably Berkshire Hathaway, that's the big holding company run by legendary investor Warren Buffett. Class A shares for Berkshire Hathaway were listed down, trading at $185.10. That would be a 99.97 percent drop because normally this stock is trading above $600,000. So clearly something weird going on. I talked to one market structure expert who told me that something is wacky is happening. Hopefully this is going to be resolved and cleared up. We showed the big board before showing the Dow about 200 points. Not a major move. It does not appear to be directly related to these individual stock issues. The broader market does appear to be holding up and we'll keep an eye as these stocks start to trade, again, hopefully at normal prices. Wolf?",

So I actually think the defense is going through with this trial because they think they have some grounds for appealing.

In states like California, where you had two Democratic senators, certainly they would have had a veto power over the judge that was appointed.So I just think it's a bad way to look at this. It does what Donald Trump does, trying to turn this into a partisan battle. It's not a partisan battle. I think it's going to come down to, if they really go to trial on this, it's going to come down to whether or not Hunter Biden can get on the witness stand and convince the jury that at the time he thought he was not addicted and not taking drugs during that 10-day period. That's what it's all about. And I certainly wouldn't look at this in a partisan lens.",

The Republicans obviously are very determined to prove that he's committed wrongdoing. Democrats, though, want to show that they're neutral and unbiased and have no real reason not to, you know, not to go very hard against them.I do think, you know, if this was not such a charged situation, he might get a different deal. They might have gotten a deal more along the lines of what he had originally negotiated, but that's not where he's at.
