And with no letup in the fighting, senior Ukrainian officials are pushing allies to supply fighter jets and long-range missiles. For now, the U.K. says it's not practical, the U.S. has also said no. Ukraine is thought to have -- to receive -- is about to receive rather a dozen battle tanks from allies, the first deliveries from a dozen countries.

And it's continuing to acquire weapons and ammunition through increased domestic production and partnerships with authoritarian states like Iran and North Korea.So, is the Russian military actually capable of calling up 200,000 troops? Could they train them, arm them, feed them, send them into battle in what seems to be a fairly short period of time?

So, they do have some fresh units to put in, nothing like what they started the war with, but still.And that other 200,000, some of those will be thrown in probably as just individual fillers just to really meat into the meat grinder. But mass is important in this war, because there are limitations on the artillery, the artillery ammunition. And overall, the weight of the battle against Ukraine is very, very heavy. I'm very concerned about getting the equipment there that's been promised on time. We know the initial 50 Bradleys had been shipped. Maybe some of the tanks will get there from allied countries in Europe in time, maybe the crews will be trained.

Another radical Islam is the Hamas takeover.And if we just walk away, as people suggest, then you'll have Hamas and Iran move into the hills around Jerusalem, overlooking Tel Aviv. So, I think there's a formula for peace. But my view is because of the fact that the continuing, the persistent Palestinian refusal, which goes back a century to recognize a Jewish state, a nation state for the Jewish people in any boundary, that persistent refusal persists. If we wait for them, we're not going to have peace. People said, you have to work your way outside and first, inside out. First, these were the Palestinians peace with the Arab world. I think realistically, it's got to be the other way around. If we make peace with Saudi Arabia, it depends on the Saudi leadership and bring effectively the Arab Israeli conflict to an end.

CNN's Ivan Watson live for us this hour in Hong Kong. It is amazing how this opposition to this regime, this military regime has evolved over the last two years. IVAN WATSON, CNN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, from peaceful protests to armed rebels, and we are seeing the streets of the largest city Yangon largely empty today as people appear to be showing their displeasure on this second anniversary of the military coup by not turning out into the streets. In the two years since the elected government was swept from power and jailed, the country has been plunged into an economic retraction. The United Nations is estimating that this year some 17 million people in Myanmar will need humanitarian assistance and the country has also been plunged into a cycle of violence, a conflict with no apparent way out.

A deadly crackdown crushed anti-coup protests, forcing the opposition underground and into the jungle. Armed rebel groups, calling himself Peoples Defense Forces, sprouted up across the country, allying themselves with armed ethnic militias that have battled the military for decades.
