They were also prepared for legal challenges to come their way and there were two legal challenges over the past 24 hours that posed significant issues for them.That first challenge comes down in the state of Florida, where a federal judge blocked the plan that would release migrants from CBP custody without having scheduled court dates. This is a tactic that has been used in the past in order to try to alleviate some of the crowding concerns in facilities. That plan is now on hold for 14 days. A top DHS official said that that could lead to overcrowding in the facilities and also lessen their ability to quickly process and remove these migrants. The White House also had a response. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It's sabotage. It's pure and simple. That's how that reads to us.

That is a case that will still need to make its way through the court but both of those issues highlight some of the challenges, legal challenge that the Biden administration is facing in this moment.I also want to note that the White House and the Biden administration is also grappling with the death of an unaccompanied migrant child in HHS custody. There was a case from this week where a 17-year-old who was in HHS custody at a shelter in Florida passed away. There's a medical investigation underway. The White House has called that situation saddening and tragic. We've also learned, CNN has learned, of a second case from mid-March where a four-year-old unaccompanied Honduran child also died in HHS custody.

What is the situation on the border like today? Are you seeing any significant changes since Title 42 ended last night? REP. HENRY CUELLAR (D-TX): Well, you know, at least the good thing is that the Biden administration put a rule at 11:59 last night. Title 42 went away and a new rule came in. Unfortunately, there are some groups already filing lawsuits because they don't like what the Biden administration is trying to do. Again, we've got to give the president the leeway so he can have some -- get control of the borders down here. Again, we can have law and order at the border and still be respectful of the immigrants that we have down here. Border Patrol facilities, I think there are like a little bit over 24,000. Now, there are about 23,000. They're still high. Still most sectors are over 100 percent capacity, might be 124, some are 150 and some even higher than that. Encounters went down from 11,000 to maybe 10,000 a day. That's still high. I think we're going to end up this fiscal year way over 2 million individuals for one year.",

They say that Jordan Neely entered the subway. He was on the subway and he was, as they put it, making threats and scaring passengers. He said that is when Penny came up from behind and put Neely in a chokehold and then brought him to the ground.Now, the subway then went to the next station, and according to prosecutors, Penny continued to keep Neely in this chokehold and he said he held him for several minutes. He said that two other men then came in and helped restrained Neely's arms and then Neely, at some point, he stopped moving. They said that Penny continued to restrain Neely during this time, even after he had stopped moving. And then when -- they're in the subway station, the paramedics do arrive. Neely is brought to the hospital where he's pronounced dead. Now, Penny did appear today. He was released on $100,000 bond.

It's rarely hit.But the local authorities there are saying that there were two very significant blasts in an industrial area of the city injuring a number of people, including two teenagers. This is the claim from the Russian-backed side in that occupied area. There is allegations from that side that they may indeed have involved cruise missiles. Now, the cruise missiles available to Ukraine are their homegrown cruise missiles. And, recently, they've also taken delivery of the Storm Shadow missiles from the United Kingdom. I think it's unlikely they would have used Storm Shadow, which is much more high-valued missile, essentially, much more likely that they would go over higher value targets perhaps in Crimea for that. But I think we should also see this is potentially of the softening up process ahead of what's anticipated, Wolf, to be a summer offensive. But at the same time, Ukrainians are also enjoying finally some success in the battle of Bakhmut, with some successful offensives on two flanks there driving out the Russian military, including the Wagner Mercenary Organization, and some significant drives there, which I think has been a major morale boost for the Ukrainians, Wolf.",

So, there doesn't seem to be any doubt from the Ukrainian perspective that they shot down this hypersonic missile. With the new information now is that this was a missile targeting the Patriot battery itself, and that will be a deep concern for the Ukrainians.

This is actually the closest in proximity they will both be since President Trump announced and since we started to see this unfold. And also we've seen them taking more swings at each other. Just at our town hall, Trump went after DeSantis. He attacked him over and over again. And then following that, DeSantis' super Pac came out with the strongest attacks against the former president that we have seen to-date. Now, the important thing to note here is while President Trump's poll numbers here in Iowa and across the country do have him leading the primary field, it is still very early. A lot is going to happen in the next couple of months, including Ron DeSantis formally entering that race. And I'm told by Trump advisers they are very aware of this. They know that this is not a lead that is going to last forever, or that it might not. They don't want to take this for granted. So, we'll have to see how they both handle attacking each other in the other's presence tomorrow.",

Why do we have to give an hour to go here? What are we doing here? I was probably 4 or 5. And he said, well, you've been given a lot, you've been blessed with a lot, you have to say thank you. You have to be mindful of everything you have and give praise. And that always resonated with me for a very long time. And he always used to teach me, you're always loved, you're never entitled. There's people who have it way worse off than you do, and be mindful of that. And I think what you captured in that moment with Pope Benedict back then was that was a kid who grew up as an altar boy and was very much a product of his parish, and to have the opportunity to meet the Holy Father, that's something beyond the wildest dreams.
