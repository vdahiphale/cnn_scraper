      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, President Joe Biden is set to announcethe U.S. will build an emergency port in Gaza to facilitate aid deliveries. We'll have those details, plus the latest on those ceasefire negotiations. Then, we are just hours away from Mr. Biden's State of the Union address. We'll dig in to what to expect from the high stakes speech and why it could have major implications of course, for the 2024 race. Plus, Haiti extends its state of emergency until April. A spiraling gang violence leaves just one hospital operational in the capital. That and much more ahead this hour. But first tonight, we are just hours away from U.S. President Joe Biden's annual State of the Union address. And we are learning he will announce a major development tonight aimed at getting more life-saving humanitarian aid into Gaza. Senior administration officials say Mr. Biden will direct the U.S. military to set up a port on the Gaza coast as well as a temporary pier. They say he's reached a point where he's not waiting for the Israelis to get in more aid as starvation as we've shown you here on the show in Gaza reaches crisis levels. Hopes are fading meantime that a ceasefire can be reached before Ramadan. A Hamas delegation has left negotiations in Cairo and Israel, of course, didn't attend this round at all. International mediators were hoping as you know to reach a draft agreement this week. But a diplomat telling CNN that, that will not happen. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country must stand together against outside pressure to end the war. He is vowing to continue the fight against Hamas including, of course, in Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians are seeking shelter. Let's get more on all these trends for you. We're joined now in -- by Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv, Alex Marquardt, as we can see there is in Washington for us. And Jeremy, to you first. What more do we know at this stage about this port solution for humanitarian aid that President Biden is expected to announce later? Do we know where it would be in Gaza and the timeline here critically, because that adds an urgency to this?",

It's not just a matter of stopping the war, even if temporarily to getting those Israeli hostages home, but really getting that aid in and to where it needs to be. And because of the sensitivities around Ramadan, the Biden administration had really set that as a deadline and repeatedly, in recent weeks said that they wanted -- in fact, needed to get that ceasefire -- this ceasefire done by then. And Ramadan is expected to start late Sunday or Monday. Now, officials who were involved in the talks are acknowledging that, that is not likely. One U.S. official told me that hope is fading, and what we've seen over the course of the past few days are more of these back-and- forth and rather frenetic talks taking place in the Egyptian capital, Cairo. A diplomat told me that they were -- that they were quite frantic over the past few days, and that essentially, Hamas had shown up to these talks with a proposal that didn't sit well with anyone. I think what has really changed in these talks is the fact that last week we saw that horrible incident around that aid --",

The IDF opened fire, and so, Hamas has essentially altered some of their demandsI'm told, seeking more assurances, and one of the things that they're looking for is an assurance that in a second phase of this deal, that the IDF would fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip. And that is not something that the Israelis are willing to do. Israel for its part did not show up to those talks in Cairo, Israel has been saying, we need a list of the hostages who are still alive and those who are dead from Hamas, so that we can expect who we can get in a hostage exchange. The Americans have said that Israel has essentially agreed to the deal, that the ball is in Hamas' court. Hamas said they left Cairo, and they're essentially going back to Doha and back to discussions amongst their leadership to figure out where things stand. So, Isa, the talks are not dead, they are still ongoing, but there does appear to be this impasse with the mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the United States still working feverishly to try to get this deal across the line, something that could now happen during Ramadan, but almost certainly not at the beginning of Ramadan as they wanted.",

One woman fiercely campaigning for their release was a hostage herself. Chen Almog-Goldstein saw her husband and one daughter killed by Hamas on October 7th, she and three surviving children were then taken to Gaza and held for 51 excruciating days. Goldstein talked to our Christiane Amanpour about their terrifying ordeal. Have a listen to this.

We understand that they're mere cogs in the system that the captors -- and we're hoping that they're not going to have instructions to kill us and that they will do it. We would ask them, and they told us that they were guarding us, that they hoped that we were going to be OK, and that we were not going to die, that they were going to die ahead of us or we were going to die together. This was supposed to calm us down. We were not allowed to cry. They wanted us happy and told us to be OK. If we cried, we had to snap out of it or hide it.

We have enough food to feed people in Gaza outside Gaza. Inside Gaza, at any one time, you find we have one to three days of food in our stores. The moment we get it, we distribute it. So, there is access to food. The issue is how much of it is available to the population for example in the south that is facing a possible operation in Rafah? How much of it is nutritious food?

And you know, sometimes actual places where we are working very close to where fighting is taking place to reach distribution points. Now, if we are not enabled and facilitated, I think in a way that shows that there's meaningful wish to cooperate with the humanitarian system, and according to humanitarian law. Then I think we have to say that we're reaching a point where we have to find some other solutions to feed people especially in north Gaza. And when I'm asked whether air-drops are those solutions, for example, I can only say again, sure, let's find more solutions.

From the 24th of February to the 3rd of March, we dropped less than 1,000 trucks entering the Gaza Strip, where we were calling for 500 trucks. Those trucks would have brought the amount, the quantity and the quality of food that the more than 2 million people need, not only to remain alive, but to be healthy enough not to be malnourished. Malnutrition is a horrible way and a horrible illness. You can't see it on the streets, the people that are dying with malnutrition are at home, they're weak, they're the most vulnerable, they're children.

He'll also make a direct plea to House Republicans to approve desperately- needed U.S. aid to Ukraine and Israel. The address is a crucial chance for the president to push back against critics who say he's too old to remain in office. Donald Trump meantime, well, he's promising his own brand of counter programming, a live play-by-play rebuttal of Biden's remarks. Our Kevin Liptak joins us now from the White House.

President Biden will lean into his argument for protecting reproductive rights as you heard there, after Alabama state Supreme Court declared that frozen embryos are children. But overnight, Alabama's governor signed a new bill into law allowing IVF clinics to open back up today. The new legislation aims to protect IVF providers and patients from liability. Lawmakers scramble to get it passed over last month's controversial ruling, which stated that those who destroy frozen embryos can be held liable for wrongful death.

It is willing to maintain a very hard line, and certainly, all this is definitely not only hurting, obviously, travel here in this country, but also hurting the economy as well because of course, Germany is one of those countries where there is a lot of travel, there's a lot of industrial processes here. There's a lot of people who obviously need to get places. And so, that's definitely something that's really a drag on an economy that is already to a degree in trouble.

Strong, vigorous, calling the shots in his so-called special military operation, and letting his chief propagandists' campaign on his behalf on state TV.

We were in Haiti just before this recent surge in violence, people venting to us their frustrations. Wanting Henry to go, and barricading their neighborhoods to stop would-be gang kidnappers. Perhaps the biggest indicator of dysfunction comes from the top. All of this happening while a major mystery looms. Where exactly is Prime Minister Henry? He was last seen last week signing an agreement in Kenya, securing the deployment of Kenyan police officers to Haiti, expected to arrive any day now. The \"Miami Herald\" says, Henry then boarded a flight that went first to the U.S., and then on toward Haiti's island neighbor, the Dominican Republic for an indefinite stopover. But officials in the DR blocked his arrival. Instead, Henry's plane went on to Puerto Rico. The \"Miami Herald\" reporting that Henry was mid-flight when the Biden administration asked him to agree to a new transitional government and resign. The White House pushing back on that. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We are definitely not pushing Prime -- the Prime Minister to resign. That is not what we're doing. But we have underscored that now is the time to finalize a political accord to help set Haiti on a path to a better future.

It's clear from what we heard there fromour David Culver that we do not know where Henry -- Ariel Henry is. But if we leave the politics for just a moment, just talk to the impact of this lawlessness, where we have seen the healthcare system is now near collapse. PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN HAVANA-BASED CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely. It's a country that is being held hostage by these well-armed and increasingly violent gangs. And services like healthcare, like running water, like electricity, just basic security is being increasingly threatened. And Haitians are desperate. Are having to turn to looting to survive. And, you know, food can't come in by air across the border with the Dominican Republic if people can evacuate. I talked to one foreign diplomat, you know, understandably is much better off than the Haitians. But she told me that, you know, they had stocked up with food and water. Perhaps, you know, expecting that this could happen any day now, but of course the supplies are running low. So, you know, that's someone who's quite a bit better off than Haitians. Thousands of them have had to flee from their homes as the gang violence has unfolded here. So, you know, is there a political solution to this? You know, is there -- you know, just by Henry stepping down, is that going to placate the gangs? It's hard to see how that will happen if the Kenyan soldiers are expected, any time soon, where there's no update, no sign that they are coming to the rescue here. So, what will change in the short order? You know, announcing a transitional government in elections doesn't seem like it will do what these gangs are just marauding and rampaging. We should remind folks, that this is because they want to hold on to a very lucrative, legal trade, which is, you know, running drugs, kidnapping people. And they are afraid that would be threatened by some, sort of. international force coming in. So, they are certainly taking the fight to the Haitian government and at this point winning.",

But this, it's just incomprehensible how much these numbers are jumping up. It's about 1.77 degrees in February of global warming, the highest hottest ever. But this is the ninth month in a row. I sound like a broken record because that's all we're doing with heat records, is breaking them again and again and again. Those air -- surface temperatures, of course, lead to all kinds of problems, from drought to the melting glaciers, which cause floods, those sorts of things. But the ocean temperatures, on top of this, which is not as noticeable to the general public out there, are almost statistically impossible. Think about -- it was March 5th of 2023, over a year ago, when the first record was broken for a hot day of ocean temperatures. It has been broken every day since then, and just keeps going up. And that, not only is horrible for ocean life from the coral reefs, and all of that, but it means stronger hurricanes and more intense weather for people living on land as well. And unfortunately, these are also some of the coolest months of the rest of our lives because a lot of these -- the physics are built in to the heating system right now.",
