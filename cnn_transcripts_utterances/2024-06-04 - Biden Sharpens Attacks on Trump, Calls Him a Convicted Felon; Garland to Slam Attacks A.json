Biden was fundraising in Connecticut last night when he called Trump out as a convicted felon for the first time. It's also the first time that President Biden has talked about Trump's conviction on the campaign trail.The president also slammed what he called Donald Trump's all-out assault on the American justice system, which is now front and center once again today. And here is why. Attorney General Merrick Garland is headed to Capitol Hill this morning, expected to push back hard against the attacks from the right and from Donald Trump when he testifies before the House Judiciary Committee. And according to his prepared remarks just released, Garland will slam Trump's repeated attacks and conspiracy theories that he says is being weaponized against the Justice Department. Garland declaring, as John said, I will not be intimidated. CNN's Arlette Saenz has much more on this from the White House for us. Arlette, can you talk to me about this new line of attack, we do need to call it, from President Biden against Trump?",

We will continue to do our jobs, free from political influence, and we will not back down from defending our democracy. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is with us now.

      "sentences": "Really, very sharply worded from an attorney general who often isn't putting himself in the center of the political mix. Merrick Garland is responding to criticism and pressure from Republicans and what he plans to say on Capitol Hill today to the House Judiciary Committee.According to remarks we have obtained here at CNN in advance of that testimony, is that he wants to defend the people who work in the department and the department itself. He says he doesn't want the department investigations to be defunded by Congress on House Republicans, especially that he doesn't -- he wants to put an end to the conspiracy theories, he says, that Republicans have been spreading primarily Donald Trump, in saying that that conviction of Trump in New York was brought or motivated or that the Justice Department was behind it. In fact, it was not. It was brought by state prosecutors, a totally separate government itself. And then he also wants to defend his own FBI agents against falsehoods. They have come under attack, especially by Trump in recent days, with some additional misleading information about, say, the search of Mar-a-Lago back in August of 2022. So, Merrick Garland defending the department. What this is coming in response to, though, John, is that House Republicans, they are still trying to muster an impeachment proceeding against Joe Biden. They have been digging into the investigation around Biden of his own retention of classified records that resulted in no charges when Biden sat for an interview with that special counsel, a really unprecedented thing for a president to do. He had an audio recording made of that interview. House Republicans want that audio recording. Merrick Garland won't give it to them. CNN is also suing for it. The Justice Department won't do it. And Merrick Garland now being pressured to be held in contempt, he says certain members of this committee and the oversight committee are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining for no legitimate purpose, sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations. John, in short, that's Merrick Garland saying, we're not giving you that audiotape at this time.",

One of them expected to talk about how she and her children tried to help him get sober with details like this, how she searched his bags, his backpacks, his vehicle, discovered drug paraphernalia and drugs on multiple occasions.

One, who, according to the prosecutors, will tell jurors that she witnessed him using crack cocaine every 20 minutes around this time.Now, let me be clear here. He has been open and honest about his lifelong struggle with addiction. He wrote about it in his memoir. He's written op-eds about it.

He was charged with the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes back in January of this year. The D.A. said that they used this cutting edge, as they described, technology, nuclear DNA , to tie him Maureen Brainard-Barnes killing.And so we can only suspect that now they are using that sort of same technology possibly to tie him to some other killings. Of course, remember, it was, you know, a long time ago, 2010 to 2011, where ten people were found in total along the stretch of Gilgo Beach, but those Gilgo Four within like a quarter mile stretch. So, now, again, this is a big deal because it looks like they are tying him to people that were outside that are  sort of original Gilgo Four. So, we'll see who exactly this has to do with. There were other women that fit that profile of those other four women, like were sex workers, for example, were young, were certain body shape. But we don't quite yet know who this might be in pertains to or it could be more than one person, but we'll find out on Thursday. He's back in court. And, of course, we know also they searched his home just last month, and they found a lot of evidence, so we'll see what they uncovered when they released the details on Thursday.",
