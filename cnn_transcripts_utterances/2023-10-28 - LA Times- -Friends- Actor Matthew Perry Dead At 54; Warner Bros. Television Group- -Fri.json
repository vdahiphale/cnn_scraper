The Los Angeles Times quoting law enforcement sources, is reporting the \"Friends\" star was found dead about four o'clock this afternoon in a hot tub at his Los Angeles home. The LA Times reports its sources speaking on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing. It did not cite the cause of death. The paper reports there was no sign of foul play. But, robbery, homicide detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department are investigating the death, as would be routine in a situation like this.As you probably know, Perry appeared in countless other TV shows, but he is best known for his role of Chandler Bing in \"Friends\". The sitcom ran for 10 seasons. Perry appeared in every single episode, and we all -- so many of us learned just recently with his memoir, that in many episodes, he was struggling with addiction. His battle with alcohol and drugs, specifically painkillers was well-known. He wrote about that addiction in his memoir that he titled \"Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing\", including that he went to rehab more than 60 times. CNN's Camila Bernal is in Los Angeles. What more can you tell us tonight, Camila, as we learn this sad news about Matthew Perry's death.",

As you know, Camila, opioid addiction is a crisis here in America, and to see someone of his stature or his fame to open up about that, open up about his struggles. You talk about the fact that he was told by doctors that he only had a two percent chance of survival when he was 49-years-old and was able to bounce back, that give so many hope and inspiration that maybe they too could overcome the struggles and the evilness of addiction. Camila, stay with us as we continue to cover this breaking news tonight.Last year, Perry opened up about his addiction to drugs and alcohol in his memoirs, we've been talking about, and he also shared a lot of funny moments in his life, including reports that he had once beat up Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau when they attended elementary school together. It was a moment late night host Stephen Colbert inquired about. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, \"THE LATE SHOW\": Now, who gets recognized more in Canada? You or Trudeau?

This is the type of show that doesn't exist anymore. In the streaming era where there is so much content, this just doesn't happen. Remember, when \"Friends\" came out in 1994, there were just a few networks. There weren't many places to watch TV. This was truly must see TV, where 20 million people were tuning in every Thursday night on NBC to watch Matthew Perry. He is known among generations.Of course, when \"Friends\" first came on to streaming, it was a blockbuster deal on Netflix. And there are kids today who are just discovering the show, and just learning who Chandler Bing is. They know Matthew Perry as the 25-year-old who started on that show. In fact, Pamela, there are many people around the world who say that they learned to speak English from watching \"Friends\". That is what a big deal this show was.

So, to think that during pilot season, he was wanted for numerous shows. It just shows how immense his talent was. And when you watch \"Friends\", you see it come off the screen, his comedic timing, his jokes, the Chandler-isms. I mean, he really is a television character and a television star that is so rare to think that multiple generations. I watched the show with my mom and with my grandma, and I'm sure that you do as well. That's just not something that you see very often.",

So, the fact that Warner Bros. is coming forward, this is going to be the start of much reaction coming from Hollywood. We have not heard from stars of \"Friends\" yet. We haven't heard from Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox. I expect that we will hear from them, and they are going to be giving heartbreaking statements.Another thing that's rare about \"Friends\" is this cast. They truly all were friends. In Hollywood, we know that behind the scenes people sometimes aren't so close. They fake it on the screen. But, this was a cast that has stayed in touch throughout the years. They have remained so close. He wrote about it in his book. We saw them come together recently for the major reunion that was on HBO Max.

And it's really unbelievable, I think, when you watch those episodes, which we've all seen, all of them, numerous times, that he was struggling so much behind the scenes. You would never know that he was under the influence. But, he wrote about that.

They each negotiated together with their agents and got a million dollars an episode, because they knew they had true value. This was must see TV, Thursday night destination. It was comfort food.

She had been a model for Seventeen magazine, but they knew they really weren't a team. And you could see this in it. But, Matthew Perry's struggles with addiction was singular of this group. He just had epic battles with addiction. And when I interviewed, you met him at the same time about a year ago now, it's just traumatizing what he did to his body, the amount of abuse, and it was just -- it was unfathomable. I was concerned about this book tour that he was -- we living all of this. He would be shown his weight fluctuations, which went up and down 100 pounds during \"Friends\".And he had to relive this, but I think it was cathartic for him to do this book. He really saw this is another act, a fresh renewal, and he really hoped it would lead to new acting roles. But, I worried about how much he had to talk about this with you, with me. He almost died. His colon burst. He was in a coma for two weeks. He -- two percent chance of living. He was five months in the hospital. It was just -- it was -- I was -- he was so brave to share all this. Lisa Kudrow told me this. She couldn't believe his bravery. But, it was a nightmare, his addiction battles.",

But, it almost became a calling for him. And as you mentioned, maybe cathartic, equal parts liberating to share that part. And he talked about relapsing like 60 or 70 times, but it seemed as though he was coming out of it. He had reclaimed a lot of his autonomy and authority to be able to speak about these issues. And many thought when he first wrote a memoir at such a young age, even though he started at a young age, that it was almost premature to write about one's life.But, it really was prescient, thinking now about what he was able to offer, and the short amount of time that he was on this planet, and the foresight to have a memoir at this moment in time.
