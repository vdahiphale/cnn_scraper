Scarlett Johansson accused OpenAI of creating a voice for ChatGPT that resembled hers without her permission, although OpenAI has denied that.But what's really at the heart of this is that so many actors, artists, authors are concerned about the ways that these AI platforms may have been trained with their work or with something as intrinsic to them as their voice, and then profiting off of that without ever giving the artists compensation or credit.",

I mean, he had kind of developed computer skills because he liked video games. And then what he did was he began the website to host the website for his parish. And he liked to research Eucharistic miracles throughout the world, and he posted those on the website, including Marian apparitions.So he was a young man of faith, and yet, you know, he was also a soccer player, and as I said, video game player, and he kind of sounds like a normal kid too, so it's interesting that his faith was so developed at such a young age. In fact, his mother said that he brought her back to the faith. I mean, she had drifted away from the church, and through seeing her own son, she was influenced by it. Talk about God Influencer. He influenced his own mother to come back to the faith. So it's rather remarkable that someone so young would have been so devoted and so instrumental, I think.",

There was a Brazilian child, I believe, with pancreatic disease, and he was cured of that after prayers specifically for Carlo to intercede.And then the second miracle was a Costa Rican girl who had a bicycle accident in Florence, and she had brain trauma. And once again, I believe it was her mother who heard about Carlo and went to his shrine. There's a shrine to him already in Assisi and prayed to him, and they were able to take this girl out of this coma and this brain trauma. Kind of unexplainable. I mean, the doctor said it just kind of -- the damage disappeared after a while. And so then those things are investigated by the Vatican, and medical sources are interviewed, and then if it is seen to be accurate, they move toward beatification, which is the first step. You need one miracle for beatification, and then once the second miracle is verified, then you can move toward canonization. And I have to say, though, it's a really quick process for this young man. I mean, John Paul II in our lifetime, you know, is beatified and canonized rather quickly, but he was a pope. I mean, this young man, as you said, just died in 2006 and was already beatified in 2020, and now maybe sainthood. So it's really a very quick beatification and canonization, which I suppose has positives and negatives, but it's remarkable because I think a lot of young people maybe can identify with him. I don't know if you've seen the stained glass window, but he's carrying already, there's a stained glass window to him, he's carrying a knapsack and wearing sneakers. You know, when was the last time you saw a teenager saint with a knapsack and sneakers? So again, he's inspirational to many young people, I think.",

That what they're hearing from the military through their investigation is that they've made some change, and they think that they've fixed a problem, but at the end of the day, they don't know what the root cause is.
