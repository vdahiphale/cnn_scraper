The children, ages 10 to 15, were on their way to school when one of the cables snapped. Some of these students were reportedly slipping in and out of consciousness as helicopters hovered above.

Children were going through the regular school run.This is not uncommon for communities to be linked by cable cars. There is a lot of criticism mounting that there is not really a safety oversight on these cable cars that are made by the villagers themselves. You can imagine it's a sort of cage that has been kind of overturned and has been suspended so many feet above this rocky terrain. These children were going to school. It has been suspended by just one cable. The other snapped, which is why this rescue operation has taken so long. Many helicopters in the area are overseeing the rescue operation. Until a couple of minutes ago, there was a lot of fear that the operation perhaps would not be possible as the day went into night. What we are hearing is that the blades of the helicopters are causing that one cable to move and it's a very fragile situation. It's a sling operation. Two of the kids have been rescued. They are very unwell up there. One child who had a mobile phone, was speaking to the media and he said that a few children had vomited. One or two have been moving in and out of consciousness. It has been a very long day for these people trapped above ground. Again, the prime minister has said he is very alarmed.

He would have been obliged to be arrested by South Africa as a signatory to the Rome statute, which governs the International Criminal Court if he had set foot here. Now very few people believe that actually would've happened. But that open question leads to two things. One disagreement that was mutual according to the South Africans is that he is not coming in person and, two, the limit of the extent of the connections that the Russian president can say he makes in person. This would've been a very symbolic moment for him to be on stage with the leaders of Brazil, India, China and South Africa. But the fact that he will be on screen is certainly a blow in terms of his power and influence. But I think the main discussion here will be something that Putin likes.

Parliament has elected Thai real estate mogul Srettha Thavisin, paving the way for a coalition government. The vote was overshadowed by the return of Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister, who was ousted in 2006 and the country's most famous politician. Local media covering his every move, from his arrival at the airport to his arrest over allegations he said are politically motivated. He is linked to the same party as the prime minister and into speculation that he has made a deal with the country's military and political elite. Paula Hancocks breaks it all down for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Cheers from supporters welcome Thaksin Shinawatra back to Thailand bowing to a portrait of the king amid speculation the ousted prime minister may seek a royal pardon. We've been meeting his followers, Thaksin was taken into custody into court where he was sentenced to eight years on corruption charges brought during his 15-year self imposed exile, charges he denies. A doctor says he has underlying health issues and will be held in a separate room under 24-hour supervision. The former prime minister was ousted in 2006 by a military coup but is still considered an influential and divisive figure. This supporter says, \"I am so happy I'm delighted because I have been missing him. I have joined his fight since it all began, the same day Srettha Thavisin, the candidate for the Thaksin backed Pheu Thai party, was voted in by parliament to become Thailand's new prime minister. Speaking to CNN before the election, he said the economy was the priority. SRETTHA THAVISIN, THAI PRIME MINISTER-ELECT:  Thailand has been in a bad economic situation for the last 5 to 8 years. OK? We were kind of in a coma. HANCOCKS (voice-over):  The Thai only came second in the election but the progressive move forward party, which won the most votes, was blocked from forming a government by conservative military-backed parties.

The very latest that we are hearing, Becky, of these 18 bodies that have been found in this northern remote woodland that is close to the border between Turkiye, Bulgaria and Greece. And what firefighters say is simply because no one has been reported missing, what they fear is that these could've been 18 migrants trying to get across that wooded part of northern Greece and on their way to Europe out of Turkiye. For the time being though, no confirmation of those bodies. Are there are other fires across Greece, some closer to Athens. Bear in mind that, back in July, we have seen extremely difficult forest fires with the biggest evacuation ever carried out by Greek authorities of tourists largely from the island of Rhodes.

Just over 12 years ago, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off Japan's coast triggered a tsunami. Power was cut at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Its cooling systems stopped working and the plant went into meltdown. Water was pumped in to reduce the temperature of the reactor cores becoming radioactive; 1.3 million metric tons has been kept here ever since. It's been treated to remove and dilute the most dangerous elements. On Thursday, Japan will begin to release that water into the Pacific Ocean.
