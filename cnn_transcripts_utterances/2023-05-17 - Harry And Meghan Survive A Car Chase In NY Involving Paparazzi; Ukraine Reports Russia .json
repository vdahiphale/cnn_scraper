We are following breaking newson what by all accounts was a very scary and dangerous incident involving Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan and Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland. Harry's spokesperson says they were in a near catastrophic car chase in New York City involving aggressive paparazzi that went on for two hours. Our law enforcement source says there were numerous close calls but no actual car accident. The couple has been attending an awards ceremony Tuesday night in which Meghan was honored. These are images you're seeing now of Harry and Meghan leaving that event. Well, let's bring in CNN's Royal Correspondent Max Foster for us. So, Max, tell us what new details you're learning on what actually unfolded on Tuesday night and how close this came to disaster because we're hearing that this car chase could have been fatal.",

Went on for about two hours, they had to swap cars, they had to go through lots of different dangerous situations and at certain points there were people crossing the road, there were people on the pavements as well and they looked like they were in danger and they could have been killed by the process here. So, they were jumping red lights for example, they were blocking in the limousine that Meghan and Harry and Doria Ragland were in and they said it was deeply traumatizing and there were lots of violations along the way. And they're basically saying that it was deeply traumatizing and they were very, very relieved to have got back. There wasn't a crash but it was a very dangerous situation and I've just been speaking to the head of their security detail who described how they were trying to stay within the law which is why it took so long to, you know, negotiate these streets. But it was very difficult when everything was so chaotic around them. So, a deeply traumatizing moment happened around midnight, the early hours of the morning. So, we've got this long statement from the Sussexes. We're told that no members of the royal family have reached out to them yet. We haven't heard anything from Buckingham Palace or Kensington Palace about this. So, we're waiting to get responses all round. But obviously, a deeply traumatizing moment and obviously speaks to Harry's upbringing where he's traumatized by how his mother died, chased by paparazzi in Paris and he always vowed that he would protect Meghan from a similar fate. He's afraid that she would suffer in a similar way, which is why they moved to America.",

They're trying to create some distance. And this is becoming worse and worse. So finally, in frustration, they made a command decision, you know, trying to first slow down traffic, block a street and get some distance that didn't work because then the scooters and the motorcycles flew down the sidewalks with pedestrians scattering, you know, no regard to law or traffic regulations or people to keep up. So, they went to the 19th precinct, that 67th street in Manhattan, they blocked off both ends of the street. They created basically a buffer, and then they spent some time trying to cool down from this and say, all right, what's our strategic plan to get to the next location without bringing this entire crowd because the protective detail is to protect from stalkers, attackers, the things that royals and famous people have to deal with. The actual threat and the hazard had become the paparazzi and I don't have to remind us. We all know the history of that. And you know, that has led to terrible consequences within that family.

I don't think he really distinguishes between the mainstream media or the broadsheets and versus the tabloids. He's not afraid of taking them to court, not just for paparazzi behavior, photographing, following what he regards as harassment, but also for even more covert methods, things like phone tapping, phone hacking, voicemails, speaking to people off the record, using back channels. This certainly gives him more grist to the mill. And he's unafraid precisely because of his own wealth and privilege, the fact that he really feels that he has right and virtue on his side. He certainly has proof on his side as tragically, we know. And the reason we are all compelled by it is precisely because of the source of pain in his life which was his mother's death. He has a fair chance of standing up against the media equally in court but it depends how cynical you are about the ways of the media and the media will always say listen, we would not employ this paparazzi or these methods unless there were lots of eyeballs out there looking at the photographs.",

Repairs made in hedgerows because workshops are getting targeted. The shrapnel holes don't matter, this tank commander tells us. What's important is the engine and the reactive armor. Locations of repair hideaways like this one are a closely guarded secret. Once the counteroffensive begins, they will be even more vital to keep the military and its machines moving. In a combat bunker buried outside Bakhmut, troops have no idea when or where the big offensive will come. They're monitoring the battlefield from here. We can't show you the screens that they're looking down from drones. As soon as a Russian soldier puts his head up and moves, you see it. Morale here, high, because they've recently made gains across fields surrounding the town. Early success in the coming counteroffensive will be critical. The lessons of Bakhmut, momentum and motivation is all. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (on-camera): And what the Ukrainians are seeing is that where they do make those successes in and around Bakhmut, the Russians have to pull in troops from other areas and of course, all of that helps Ukrainians figure out where the Russian lines become weaker when they push in another place and where they therefore might exploit for this expected counteroffensive.",

And at one point the car -- the limousine that the Sussexes and Doria Ragland were in was blocked off and the paps were taking pictures, I'm told by the head of security, and they had to maneuver their way out to get away and it was very dangerous situation. It's going on for something like two hours and they had to swap cars so, it was a really detailed operation. So, that's really where the concern was. They, at no point, felt as if their lives were at threat because what they were trying to do in the convoy was adhere to all the road rules. They were much more concerned about people on foot, effectively, on the pavements, with about a dozen, you know, about a dozen vehicles, cars, bikes, push bikes, but also motorbikes, were sort of driving very erratically and jumping through red lights.

Now, it's such important context we heard from Max here that they themselves, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, had never felt threatened, but had feared for the lives of others. Because, of course, that does draw an important distinction between what happened here in Paris nearly 26 years ago and what unfolded in the streets of New York City last night, which doesn't take away, of course, from the fact that for him specifically, who was 12 years old when he learned of his mother's death, and has been speaking at length ever since about the profound impact it had on him. There's nothing to take away from what he would have felt and the perils that he would have felt, that sense of being hounded that we've been speaking about so much this morning as we try and imagine how they felt. And that is precisely what happened to Princess Diana. She had been hounded in what was her new life with Dodi Al Fayed, had come through Paris for a night, extraordinary lengths had been taken to try and get them safely from the Ritz Hotel to an apartment not very far away from where they were due to stay. A decoy car had been sent to try and get the paparazzi off the scent. They had, nonetheless, been found. That car crash, terrible car crash, of course, ensued in the tunnel under the Pont de l'Allemand and she died very shortly afterwards. Now, of course, ever since then, so much attention has been paid to the specific circumstances in which she could have found herself so -- not just scrutinized but hounded by the press that that should have been able to happen. There have been inquests, there has been so much talk about it over the years. And yet, of course, here we are realizing that Prince Harry is as little protected from that press interest as was his mother 26 years ago. There are different consequences, of course, in the events, nonetheless. Also, I think Christina, it's important to remember that at the time some of those images that emerged from those terrible incidents under the Pont de l'Alma on the morning of the 31st, some of those dreadful pictures that were taken of the immediate aftermath of the crash were initially published in countries like France, Italy, further afield, before being retracted, and then they were taken offline, and you really won't find them anywhere. Now, what we understand is that Prince Harry did at one point ask to see those pictures for himself. So, he's taken a very personal and graphic interest in exactly what happened to his mother. And I think, of course, when you think about that and you bear that in mind, I think it puts into context a bit better what he might be feeling today having escaped those two hours and looked back on them and felt what he did, Christina.",

Many people were stuck on their roofs. The region has experienced severe droughts, which dried out the land, reducing the amount of water it can absorb. That's making the floods even worse. Meanwhile, more rain is expected. Barbie Nadeau joins us now live from Rome with an update. And Barbie, as I was saying there, this comes after, I think, months of drought. So, what has been the scale of the damage of these floods? BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (on-camera): Well, you know, they haven't even begun to count the economic damage. This is a very important part of the farmland -- farmland of Italy here, and they suffered a terrible drought last year. There was almost no snow this summer. So, the River Po, for example, is almost dry. We took a closer look at some of the incredible rescue operations going on here. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADEAU (voice-over): Roads turned to rivers, as rain many hoped would alleviate drought conditions, now a serious threat in the central Italian region of Emilia-Romagna. There are already victims, and rescuers are searching for the missing. Hundreds of people were rescued from flooded homes, many brought to safety in rubber dinghies on flooded streets. More than 5000 people are under evacuation, according to the Civil Protection. Among them, a four-month-old baby and an elderly handicapped man. The region had been undergoing severe drought. In 2022, low rainfall and extreme heat depleted the River Po, a crucial waterway for transport and irrigation. A winter with very little snow did little to help. And as bad as these floods are, they are only a drop in the bucket for what is needed to reverse the drought. Earlier this month, a downpour swelled the Po by five feet. This deluge of water will raise it even more, but it is still well below average. Extreme weather events are threatening other Italian regions, from Venice, where the Moselle floodgates have been raised to protect the city from high water, to Sicily, where heavy storms downed trees and flooded homes. (END VIDEOTAPE) NADEAU (on-camera): And you know, you just look at the devastation there. It's gonna take months, if not longer, for people to try to get their lives back. They've had to cancel sporting events, the Formula One that was supposed to be held this weekend in Imola, canceled. But you know, when you come to talk about the loss of human life, eight people we know so far, and that death toll could rise because there are people missing, that's what's really important here, Christina.",

More than 5 million people are estimated to have been in the storm's path across Rakhine and the northwest. Hundreds of people, including Rohingya Muslims, are feared dead and unspecified numbers still missing. The storm, one of the strongest to hit the country, washed away shelters, destroyed homes, uprooted trees and brought down power lines. The embattled state of Rakhine, home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya, has been hit hard. Videos from the region bet testament to the widespread damage, especially around state capital, Sittwe. Myanmar's shadow government, the National Unity Government, says people living in refugee camps drowned in floods after seawater raced into the city. Sources speaking to CNN say many bodies of Rohingya victims have already been buried according to their religious customs. It's been a truly terrifying experience for those in the path of the cyclone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (through translator): Nine out of fourteen of my family members were killed because they couldn't resist when strong winds swayed them away. UNKNOWN (through translator): All of my belongings, rice, and even dishes are gone. Now, I have no money to rebuild my house. We are starving. I haven't eaten for two days. How many days does a person have to go hungry? (END VIDEO CLIP) SUD (on-camera): Damage to communications and road infrastructure is making it difficult for agencies to deliver aid to affected areas. It may take days to understand the true impact of the cyclone in one of Asia's least developed countries. Vedika Sud, CNN, New Delhi.",

The dead are two personnel from the U.S. Consulate and two police officers. They were not American citizens. The attack happened in the southeastern part of the country. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has lost his appeal against a 2021 corruption conviction. The Paris Court of Appeals upheld his three-year prison sentence with two years suspended home on one at home wearing an electronic bracelet. Sarkozy's lawyer says he's innocent and will appeal to the French Supreme Court. U.S. President Joe Biden is on his way to Japan for the G7 Summit. Looming over his trip, debt ceiling negotiations. That prompted Mr. Biden to cancel his second leg of his trip. It included stops in Australia and Papua New Guinea. On Tuesday, Mr. Biden met with Republican leadership calling those talks productive. Turning now to Ecuador where the country's security forces are on patrol outside the National Assembly. This comes after embattled President Guillermo Lasso announced the assembly's dissolution earlier today as he tries to avoid impeachment. In a speech to the nation, President Lasso called for snap elections. He's accused of turning a blind eye to embezzlement, which he denies. Well, I want to bring in Journalist Stefano Pozzebon with more on what the President's decision means for Ecuador. And Stefano, how unprecedented is this and what are gonna be the next steps here?",

It's the first time in Ecuador's recent history that both aPresident faces an impeachment trial in the National Assembly, in parliament. And at the same time, it's the first time that a President invokes this provision of the Ecuadorian Constitution called Muerte Cruzada, the mutual death, which grants the President the power to dismiss the National Assembly, call for new elections --snap elections for both his charge, his Office as President and Congress. He probably realized overnight, because he made the announcement early this morning at around 7 a.m. in Ecuador's time. He realized overnight that he didn't have the numbers to survive to that impeachment trial that was looming before the end of the week. And in his address, he spoke, why he thinks that going to a new election is the best way forward for Ecuador. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUILLERMO LASSO, ECUADORIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is a democratic decision, not only because it is constitutional, but because it returns to the Ecuadorian people, to you, the power to decide their future in the next elections. This is the best possible decision, which opens the way for us to regain hope, tranquility, and will allow the government to focus all its efforts on meeting the needs of Ecuadorian families.
