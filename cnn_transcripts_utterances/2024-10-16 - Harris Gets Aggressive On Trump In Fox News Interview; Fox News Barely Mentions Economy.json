And after an actor publicly criticized Barack Obama's lecture to black men, the former president gives him a ring. Hear what happened next. Live at the table, Kara Swisher, Scott Jennings, Coleman Hughes, and Nayyera Haq with special guest, Actor Wendell Pierce, and a debate between Kevin O'Leary and Catherine Rampell. With 20 days to go, Americans with different perspectives aren't talking to each other, but here they do. (END VIDEOTAPE) PHILLIP (on camera): I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. Was that worth it? Tonight, Kamala Harris joined Fox News' Bret Baier for an interview and it turned contentious pretty quickly. One of the most fiery moments happened right after Baier played a clip of Trump talking about, quote, the enemy from within. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARRIS: With all due respect, that clip was not what he has been saying about the enemy within that he has repeated when he's speaking about the American people.

Her best moment was when she busted Fox's chops for running, you know, a clip about the enemy within, which was not about the enemy within. It was much more benign for the former president who, you know, has been crazy, talking crazy about subversives within the, within the government. So, she really -- she did well to point that out.What she did very poorly, it seems to me, Abby, is how in the world where everybody in this whole country knows that immigration is now the issue. It is the issue of the moment. Maybe it won't be three weeks from now. Maybe it will be. But for right now, immigration is the issue. How could she not be prepared for Bret Baier showing the photographs of the, of the tragic victims of illegal immigrant criminals? She should have an answer for that and answer other than, oh, you know, it's awful, and, you know, it deserves some, some, some real substantive thought. For instance, here, let me just read you one quick sentence. This is from Jason Riley, the father of Laken Riley, one of the victims that was portrayed. And it's about how the memory of their loved ones are being exploited. This is from Jason Riley, Laken's father. I think it's being used politically to get those votes. It makes me angry. I feel like they're using my daughter's name. And she was much better than that. And she should be raised up for the person that she is. She was an angel. Why couldn't Kamala Harris say something like that, that humanized her concern for the loss, and then called out those who would exploit it?",

It's about showing people that she can be tough, she is a leader, and that she is willing to go in the lion's den and not roll over and get her belly scratched or try to play by some other rules of whatever the game is on whatever bias network, you know, we can talk about at the moment. She is showing that she's taking the fight and she's going to handle it like a prosecutor. She's going to prosecute her case as a leader.
