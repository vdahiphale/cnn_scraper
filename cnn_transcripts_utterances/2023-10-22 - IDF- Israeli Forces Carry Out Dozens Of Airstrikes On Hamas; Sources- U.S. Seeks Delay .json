And the conflict in the Middle East continues to escalate amid dozens of airstrikes carried out by the IDF on Sunday. Hamas says its fighters clashed with Israeli troops inside Gaza. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to troops in northern Israel reiterating the stakes of the current initiative.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): You fought with exemplary heroism in Gaza. Your stories are very inspirational. I know that you lost comrades. This is very, very difficult, but we are fighting for our lives, for our home. This is no exaggeration. This is war. We are now in a double battle. One battle is to block them here. The second battle is to win a crushing victory that will erase Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Journalist Elliott Gotkine joins me now from London with more. So, Elliott, obviously everyone anxious about the start of a ground operation.

As Nic was reporting, you know, the most intense bombardment since the drop targeted (ph) to Hamas terrorist attack on October the seventh with airstrikes. And as you say, there were also the first skirmishes on the ground inside the Gaza Strip between Israeli troops and Hamas militants. In that clash, one IDF soldier was killed and three were injured. And Hamas says, from an anti-tank missile, Hamas says that it managed to destroy a couple of bulldozers and a tank.But if (inaudible) it doesn't seem the starting gun for want of a better phrase of a ground invasion. There could be all manner of reasons as to why it's not happened just yet. Everything ranging from the weather, to attempts to secure the release of more hostages to perhaps indecision or perhaps just simply changing facts on the ground. We don't know when or how Israel is going to go in. It is adamant that it is going to go in. At some point is what we're all expecting, I suppose is what the Israeli public will be demanding, given the savagery and the gravity of the attack. And of course, Hamas holding those 200 plus hostages still inside the Gaza Strip. But right now, Michael, I'm afraid we still don't know when this is going to happen.",

And a warning that we're about to show you some images you might find disturbing. Parents in Gaza writing their children's names on their legs and arms, in case they need to be identified should they or their family be killed. A CNN photographer captured these gut wrenching images of dead children indeed with names written on their legs. Well as Israel has been ramping up its aerial bombardment, hospitals in Gaza say they've been overwhelmed with casualties. One hospital officials summing up Sunday in two words, a quote \"Bloody Sunday.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. IYAD ISSA ABU ZAHER, DIRECTOR GENERAL, AL AQSA MARTYRS HOSPITAL (through translator): it's impossible for any hospital in the world to admit this number of injured. And it's impossible for any medical crew to work with these large numbers of injured. And every injured person needs four or five specialized surgeons and surgeries. And this puts a large burden on the medical crew. And can't offer medical services the same way in a war zone that you would give to patients in a normal situation, injuries and the dozens. There is no room or hospital beds for these injuries. The injured are at the doorstep of operation theater rooms, and on top of each other each waiting their turn for an operation.

But the fact remains that without a ceasefire, without a massive increase in aid, we are going to see the number of children, of boys and girls in Gaza, the number killed, we're going to see that skyrocket. We urgently, Michael, need a massive increase in aid there. It really is a matter of life or death now.Getting medicines in, getting water in, there has grave shortages. So it can, unfortunately get much worse. It's hard to say that when -- you quote the numbers you say, of children being killed, but there is no doubt that the situation could get much worse for them because aid, the amount that they need right now is not nearly enough. You know, Michael, UNICEF has enough aid for a quarter of a million people. We could get that into Gaza in a matter of hours. We're not able to do that right now. That has to change.

And for the children in Gaza, the trauma is at levels we've probably not seen before, probably affecting every single boy and girl there.And yes, UNICEF, we are frontline. I have colleagues in Gaza. And what we know is the longer that fighting goes on, the longer the intensity, the longer we wait for the adults to bring a ceasefire for these children, the more ingrained that get.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): House Republicans remain in turmoil almost three weeks after the unprecedented ouster of a sitting speaker. Kevin McCarthy was pushed out after eight Republicans joined with Democrats and voted out Kevin McCarthy as Speaker. This was initiated by House Republicans and they have not been able to coalesce around anyone to replace McCarthy as of yet. And the House can't do any business, no legislating at all until the speaker is elected and they have been unable to unite behind any candidate. Firstly nominated Steve Scalise, the House Republican majority leader, he was unable to get the votes to be elected Speaker. He bowed out before going to the floor. Jim Jordan, the House Judiciary Committee Chairman was nominated then to be the next Speaker of the House. He did go to the fourth, three times and he failed to win over enough support. He can only afford to lose four Republican votes on this party line vote. He lost 25 on his third ballot. Ultimately, he bowed to reality and stepped aside. And now nine Republican candidates have filed to run for Speaker unclear which of those nine will ultimately get the Republican nomination. And more importantly, who can get the 217 votes that they would need on the floor of the House to be elected speaker. It is unclear if any of them can given the sharp divisions within the ranks.",
