      "sentences": "Thanks for joining us here for the second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Erica Hill in New York.At this hour, oh, to be a fly on the wall in Washington, D.C. with just five days left now before Christmas and frankly hours until a partial government shutdown for the U.S. government. The way forward is unclear at this hour after the House rejected a revised funding bill, a bill that was backed by President-elect Donald Trump. The latest from Trump, well, he just posted, if there's going to be a shutdown of government, let it begin now, saying, as you see there, he wants it to happen under the Biden administration. All of this as two of America's most recognizable brand names are facing challenges of their own in this busy holiday season. Contract delivery drivers for Amazon on strike across the country, while Starbucks union employees are also walking off the job in three major cities. So how are investors reacting to all of this? And today's release of new inflation data? You see right there a whole lot of red on Wall Street. The personal consumption expenditures, price index or the PCE reflects how much Americans spent on goods and services. And it does show price growth cooling a bit. So the inflation fight is working even if nothing else in Washington seems to be. We will get you up to speed, of course, on all the international headlines as well in just a moment. But we did want to take a closer look at some of these U.S. economic headlines, starting with that chaos on Capitol Hill over government spending. The bill the House failed to pass included a provision, this second bill, I should point out, last night, included a provision that would raise the debt ceiling, infuriating Democrats who are frankly already fuming over the moves by Trump and Elon Musk to tank that previous bipartisan spending bill. Leaders of both parties had agreed to it. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Vice President-elect J.D. Vance holding what appeared to be a last ditch meeting with a group of Republican lawmakers this morning in an effort to get another funding vote to the House floor. CNN's Annie Grayer has more on Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

As you can see, lawmakers are leaving, and one of them came out and said they think that Republicans can vote as early as 10:00 a.m. this morning. But the question is on what are they going to be voting on. Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team put a new plan on the floor last night. We saw 38 Republicans vote against it, and they're going to need a lot of Democrats to get on board to get this to pass before government funding runs out tonight. Last night, we didn't see -- we only saw two Democrats support it. Not nearly enough. So there's a lot of discussion about what could -- what they could put on the floor today that could maybe get more Democratic consensus. And, you know, there's no question of just the role that Donald Trump has played here looming large over all of this. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They wrote, quote, if a shutdown occurs, employees should consider themselves furloughed unless told otherwise by their authorized supervisor or component leadership. Now, past shutdowns have shown us a little bit of what could be impacted. National parks and museums would shut down. There could also be issues at the IRS just as tax filing season is about to begin. Then there's a lot of questions about holiday travel. TSA agents and air traffic controllers are deemed essential, would have to continue to work. But in past shutdowns, some had called out sick, which caused delays to flights, really complicating travel at one of the busiest seasons of the year. Now, some things that would not be impacted, Social Security checks would continue to go out, Medicare and Medicaid benefits would also continue to proceed. But if an agreement is not reached, it could also jeopardize relief for farmers and also critical disaster recovery aid that many southeastern states still need in the wake of those hurricanes earlier this year.

It would make essentially the U.S. economy more expensive to do business with. And it really lowers the global standing of the U.S. when we are asking everybody to essentially help to finance the debt. You know, you asked sort of what are the downsides of this?

And I want to mention one thing that's very important, erica, and that is the low trust in institutions we have in this country, which is essentially a modern phenomenon. And elected officials in Washington rank toward the top of the list with the lack of trust. We did a survey of Americans at Bankrate asking them about whether they expect their finances will improve in the coming year.

We've always seen Congress get to the point where they have to kick the can down the road, extend again, and keep the government open for only a finite period of time at which they have to meet again and come to this legislative compromise. I just am not sure that we can find our way out of this era of 11th hour governing and essentially trying to serve the American people by inserting oligarchs into the equation. I mean, it's amateur hour when you think you can kill a bill and something will just crop up out of nowhere. At the end of the day, though, I do think that today they will sit down. They meaning Speaker Johnson and his allies, and try to not only get to what at the heart of what the Freedom Caucus folks want, but also bring Democrats back to the table, which they were not at when Musk and Trump injected themselves into the picture. Democrats were pushed away from the table, not even invited. That's not how Washington functions. And at the end of the day, the only thing that will change all of this is true systemic reform. I know a lot of people out there are feeling really like all hope is lost if one party really controls all three branches as it's been put, but the House is a place where compromise is necessary and vital to legislation getting passed.

Natalie, who went by the name Samantha, died by suicide after the mass shooting Monday at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin.

These revelations come as Mangione is facing a slew of new federal charges, including murder. CNN's Brynn Gingras following all these developments for us from here in New York. So, Brynn, walk us through some of these new charges.",

They call them prisoner transports technically here in New York, but I've never seen one like that. Obviously, just from the scale of the amount of law enforcement that was there, the helicopter brought in a bunch of drama. The length of the walk that actually happened while he was shackled. I mean, there's a number of reasons. When I talk to sources, they talk about the security aspect. You know, they go back to the way he sort of handled the moment he walked into that courthouse in Pennsylvania. They wanted to make sure that he didn't do anything sort of out of the norm. They also wanted to secure him in case there was anyone who wanted to maybe come after him. So it was certainly grand and optically, but it's not unheard of to have what we say in the industry a perp walk, of course, here in New York City. But having the mayor there, it was definitely interesting. I'm not sure what the reasoning was for that. You know, I think Twitter can answer that question.

This, of course, is related to their efforts to overturn the 2020 election in that state. An appeals court found a significant appearance of impropriety was enough to potentially taint the case against Donald Trump in the public eye. The election interference case was already on hold, but this long awaited decision is raising serious doubts about whether it will in fact move forward. Donald Trump, for his part, insists the matter is now closed, telling FOX News Digital, quote, \"It should not be allowed to go any further,\" adding she has been disqualified and her boyfriend has been disqualified and they stole funds and went on trips.

So there's still a chance that a prosecutor, through the process set up by the state and the prosecuting attorneys council, will make a selection, and they'll essentially see if there's any interest by a D.A. somewhere in the state to take this case forward. I think that's going to be a long shot. I mean, that's -- who would want that job, right? I mean, that would be like saying, you know, I've had this beautiful horse. I've now taken it out to pasture. Why don't you just go clean up the barn? And that's sort of what the prosecutor would be left with, is just cleaning up the mess after the fact. And so, you know, while the case is not technically dead, I think the reality is that Trump is partly right, and that is that the court has made a pretty, you know, strong statement that, in fact, there was so much of an appearance of impropriety that there was no public confidence in the D.A.'s office should be disqualified.
