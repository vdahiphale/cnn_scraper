That word coming just days after talks on a temporary ceasefire and hostage release failed to reach a deal. Israel had warned that it would launch the next phase of its war against Hamas if a deal was not reached by Ramadan, but U.S. officials say the Biden administration isn't expecting Israeli forces to imminently expand operations. Also, Israel promised to give civilians a way out before any major operation in Rafah, and that clearly has not happened yet. Meantime, Hamas says it is still open to talks with Israel, but there are, quote, \"no dates yet\" for negotiators to return to Egypt.

Well, Ramadan is here now, and that deal has not been made. There are also no signs of any kind of a negotiating breakthrough. Hamas left Cairo, where the last rounds of talks were being held on Thursday.

Hamas also continues to insist that no deal can be reached unless the IDF is willing to completely withdraw from Gaza and any ceasefire that's agreed to is a permanent one.

Briefly, before we get into the nuts and bolts, summarize that vision for us. SIMONE MCCARTHY, CHINA WRITER, CNN.COM: That's right, Michael. Thousands of delegates from across the country gathered in Beijing this week for what is really the Chinese government's most important opportunity to broadcast their overarching goals for the year ahead. That's on everything from the economy to social issues, to foreign policy. Chinese leaders were keen to project confidence in the economy this year. They set an ambitious growth target of around 5 percent. But one of the things that we saw that was really an overarching goal was this transformation of China's economy into a high-tech economy. There was a lot of focus on science and technology development, on innovation and on technological self-reliance.",

Michael, as you know, we've already seen a property sector crisis, a stock market rout. There's high youth unemployment, not to mention weak consumer demand.

We see that, of course, with the war in Ukraine, where U.S. and European partners have created a united front against Russia's aggression in Europe. We've also seen that in terms of in what China would consider its own neighborhood, with Japan and South Korea, where Biden has tightened security coordination across -- with both of those partners, as well as with the security conferences of OCAS (ph) and the Quad. So Beijing has been very concerned about this. And the other thing about that is that they see that some of those partners are then going along with what they see as U.S. policies, policy to suppress China. And that's something that we see with European countries de-risking their supply chains. And so, were Trump to come into office and then to continue what is more seen as his America first policy, well, that would certainly be something that Chinese leaders would look to benefit from. And I will just add one more thing on that point, Michael. And that's the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, has been very interested in pushing back against a world order that he sees dominated by the United States.
