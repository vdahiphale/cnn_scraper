I agree completely with what Beth said, but I think I would go further and say that the relationship between Beijing and Washington right now is probably at the lowest point it's been since Nixon first did the opening to China 50 years ago. That's saying a lot. I think that the areas where he was referring to about bluntness probably started with Taiwan, and probably continued with China's nuclear expansion, which looks like if you believe the Defense Department, they're going to try to get up to about 1000 weapons and begin to approach the size of the U.S. and the Russian Arsenal's, which creates a sort of three-way nuclear dynamic that's going to be hard to manage, certainly human rights, Hong Kong, and so forth. And certainly, on the Chinese side, the new U.S. sanctions against China. That deprives China of some of the most advanced micro- electronics that we and the rest of the West make in a clear effort to try to gain some time and slow down both their military and commercial development. So I'm sure this was pretty blunt that scarceness of what we heard versus the three and a half hours we know they met, even allowing for translation, that's a long time to be sitting there for an argument.",

This is where Republicans were zeroing in trying to pick up and flip that Senate seat for control of the Senate, potentially. With her victory projection on Saturday night, obviously, she not only won reelection, she defeated those Republican hopes of clenching power in the Senate.And so, she had a lot to say we talked about what this race looked like. We talked about her opponent Adam Laxalt. Obviously, as she noted there, he has not yet called her to concede this race. But we also talked about -- you know what the message she believes was sent with voters reelecting her. We talked about the Latino vote and what it looks like when the -- with the Republicans trying to make inroads there. She's obviously the first Latina senator, so a lot of questions there and also what Democrats are going to do when they get back to Washington. She was about to get on a flight and go back to DC.

And yet, when given an option, in many cases, they still sided with the party that they said they wanted to get rid of.And I think that much of this comes back to candidates in Republican primaries who made statements about the 2020 election that I think was intolerable for many of the independent voters and unwilling to support them, even if they were saying I'm looking for a change in inflation, I'm looking for a change in border situation, I'm looking for somebody helped solve the crime battles, they still felt like if somebody's going to deny the results of the 2020 election, that's a bridge too far.
