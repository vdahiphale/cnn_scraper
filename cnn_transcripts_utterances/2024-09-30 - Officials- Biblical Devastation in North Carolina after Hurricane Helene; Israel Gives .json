Those are the markets and these are the main events. Israeli tanks are gathering at the Lebanese border as Israel's defense minister says the next stage of the war will start soon. \"Biblical devastation\" in North Carolina. Residents facing severe destruction after Hurricane Helene. And just hours remain before US port workers are set to begin a strike. The stoppage would disrupt the shipments of bananas, clothes, and many other goods. Live from New York. It is Monday, September 30th. I'm Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And a good evening once more. Tonight, US officials believe that Israeli troops could imminently move into Lebanon for a limited ground offensive. Israel has moved roughly 100 military vehicles to its northern border and its special forces have already been carrying out raids in Lebanese territory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning today that there is nowhere that Israel cannot reach. Hezbollah meanwhile, says it will keep fighting Israel after its leader, Hassan Nasrallah was killed Friday by an Israeli airstrike. Nic Robertson is in Haifa for us tonight. Nic, good to have you with us. It does feel a case of when not if those limited and targeted ground strikes begin. What more do we know tonight about potential timing?",

I think what we are witnessing tonight and what actually I think we've been seeing over the past couple of days are the shaping operations for a ground incursion. We discovered or we were told by sources here in Israel that over the past couple of days, elite commando units have been conducting some limited operations across the border at Hezbollah targets, that is typical of what you would expect before a larger force might go in. One of the other indicators of a typical, what you might call again, military shaping operation comes right in the northern tip of Israel at the moment, around the small town of Metula. It is surrounded on three sides by Lebanon and Metula and a couple of other small towns nearby have been designated by the IDF now as a closed military zone. And a couple of miles away from there in Qiryat Shemona, the sound of heavy artillery fire can be heard and typically, you would expect the IDF to put down a lot of artillery fire before troops went in behind that. We saw that in Gaza, it is what the IDF have done crossing the border into Lebanon back in 2006. When are they actually going to move across? Typically that would be relatively soon after those barrages. It is clear, but the other indicators would be the fact that we understand the Lebanese Army have pulled back from some of their border posts, retreated a few kilometers, a few miles from the border, further north inside of Lebanon, and that again, would be an indicator, of course, the IDF are not going after the Lebanese Army, they are going after Hezbollah. So it appears that the Lebanese Army is stepping back and getting out of the way. But how many troops may go across, when they may go across, what they're expected to achieve when they do, that isn't clear, but the hardware that they will use has been clear, has been obvious for the past couple of days, not just the material video that the IDF has released, but what people have spotted from roadsides -- large numbers of tanks building up, armored personnel carriers, all the sort of equipment you would expect the IDF to deploy, to move troops in an aggressive way across the border -- Julia.",

Nonetheless, we are heard today, Naim Qassem, who is one of the senior deputies of the late Hassan Nasrallah coming out and saying that we are still standing, that we continue to confront the Israelis and in support of Gaza and the people of Lebanon and he insisted that every leader who was killed is replaced by another leader, that may be just rhetoric to try to bolster the morale of an organization that really has been battered and pummeled by Israel recently. But I do recall the last speech Hassan Nasrallah made, he actually goaded the Israelis into invading South Lebanon saying we know where all your soldiers are, we know where all your tanks are and we are ready for them.

Ben, thank you.Now, Bilal Saab is the head of the US-Middle East Practice at TRENDS Research and Advisory and he joins us now. Bilal, great to have you with us. I know you were just listening to that, too. The Israelis have said one of their principal ambitions here is to allow their people to return to their homes in the north of the country and we are talking what -- 60,000 Israelis for the most part. It is the equivalent of what -- two million Americans. So you can understand the importance of this moment, but certainly, the sequencing, the scale of what we are seeing feels like far more of a rebalancing of power not only in Lebanon, but in the levant, too. Would you agree? BILAL SAAB, HEAD OF THE US-MIDDLE EAST PRACTICE AT TRENDS RESEARCH AND ADVISORY: Look, I understand the goal of the Israelis to return the citizens of the north to their homes, but if that's the goal, it is not going to happen anytime soon if you're about to launch a ground incursion in Lebanon which turns to a mission creep and it is not entirely clear to me what the mission is. I am not even sure it is clear to the Israelis what the mission is. Are you there to create a buffer zone? Are you there to degrade the military infrastructure of Hezbollah? And then you withdraw? Do you have some kind of understanding of when diplomacy kicks in to actually reach some kind of diplomatic agreement? We don't have the answers to any of those things. So this could be in for the long run, therefore, delaying, postponing that goal of returning Israeli citizens to the north. And of course, on the Lebanese side, the Lebanese to the south.",

It is far more right-wing, aggressive, extreme as than any -- the very situation in the north is frankly unacceptable regardless of who is actually in power in Israel. And so they pretty much, they, being Hassan Nasrallah himself obviously and the leadership in Tehran, which sponsors Hezbollah basically made a huge gamble and it backfired. The gamble being that they thought Israel would still be retrained in its response when in fact, obviously we've seen that it has been the exact opposite. So you know, for a long time, Nasrallah was sort of the master reader of Israeli society, government, military, very much so.

That was a huge blow to that entire doctrine, right? He was a key figure, sort of like the glue that kept everything together behind that entire doctrine. So I don't know what the future of that is. Obviously, given the fact also that Hamas is completely decimated militarily speaking, so whoever is left, I mean, is sort of picking up the pieces, right? And the Houthis in Yemen, they are also being under attack by the Israelis. So you're seeing the entire doctrine now sort of attacked, right? It is not over yet, obviously. They played the long game, but right now, it is in pretty bad shape. For the Israelis, have they actually achieve strategic gains? I don't know, it is too early to tell. I mean, these are tremendous tactical advantages and successes that they have made, but they have to turn them into strategic gains. And you can only do that through diplomacy, which gets us into the second part of your question, only through diplomacy, you're going to be able to limit and to reduce that civilian toll, which is catastrophic. And certainly, the Biden administration is very concerned about that, but they are not just pursuing seriously -- sufficiently serious diplomacy to restrain the Israeli military machine, to get to some kind of an agreement.",

But I think this is a good idea that we actually can look at what was going down that river -- the lives, the homes, the pieces. These are not just sticks. So what happened? We had a Category Four 140 mile per hour hurricane. It made landfall in Florida. What in the world are we talking about Asheville for? Well, what happened was a predecessor rain event. It happened before the hurricane even arrived. Notice, it is already rain, it is already cloudy. Let me switch to the radar to give you an idea. Here is Asheville right there. Wednesday, it is raining. It is still raining. I can pause for a long time. It is Thursday, it is still raining. No hurricane yet. This is just the rain that came before the hurricane. And now the hurricane finally hits. And a half a meter of rain, three quarters of a meter of rainfall that came down in mountain towns that washed them away -- washed away the homes, washed away the bridges, washed away the roads. So many spots here. Greater than 10 to 15 inches of rain, widespread, not just like a neighborhood, but widespread 10 to 15 inches and even 20 inches at times. The storm went from 85 to 140 in less than a day. That is because the water is so very warm. The atmosphere is very warm, warmer than it has ever been. The water, warmer than it has ever been. This is a broken record. We already know this. But warm air, warm water can hold more moisture. That moisture falls out of the sky as rain. So we are increasing the amount of rain potential for the entire continental US, those big, heavy days are increasing year after year, decade after decade. Now for right now, things have calmed down with some light rain showers and yes, it would be raining in Virginia, maybe down in the coastal plain of North Carolina. But this is cleanup time.

One would be troops that would go in to help in the defense of Israel. Should we see a massive Iranian or even Hezbollah barrage launched like we saw back in April. Another would be to enhance U.S.' own air defenses for troops in Iraq and Syria and in other places. There could also be troops going into plan for different contingencies, and that would, of course, include an evacuation of American citizens from Lebanon, a NEO, a Noncombatant Evacuation Order. The Pentagon won't say what those prepared to deploy orders are for, whom they are for, or how many troops are put on those but it generally means those troops have to be ready to go within a very small window, usually somewhere in the 24 to 48 hours. That in addition to the fact that the Pentagon announced that there will be more fighter squadrons going in, that includes F-22s, F-15s, A-10s. So, a number of different kinds of U.S. fighter aircraft. Now these were regularly scheduled to rotate in anyway, but the squadrons they were supposed to replace, those will be staying in the region. And adding to the U.S. is already formidable number of forces there. And they could also help with air defenses. They're also, of course, a deterrent message to Iran or anybody else who might try to take advantage of the situation and widen this out to a broader war. On top of all of that, the U.S.' Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group is sailing across the Atlantic right now, heading east, heading towards Europe. That could be called in, should it be necessary. The State Department hasn't yet ordered a NEO, a Noncombatant Evacuation that would be an attempt to get U.S. citizens out of Lebanon. That's because, at least for now, there are commercial flight options for American citizens. The State Department is urging Americans to get out now. The expectation was that an Israeli ground incursion limited, though it may be, is imminent. That may be the beginning of what we're already seeing when you see explosions in the night sky over Israel's northern border. We have seen Israel move troops there, and we have seen Israeli politicians and the minister of defense effectively hint that that is the next step, and that it may be coming very, very soon, if it hasn't started already.
