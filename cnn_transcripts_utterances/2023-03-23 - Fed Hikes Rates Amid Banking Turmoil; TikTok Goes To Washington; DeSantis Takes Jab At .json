It is unlikely they'll hand down any indictment as sources tell CNN that prosecutors are considering calling more witnesses. Other sources say the district attorney's office is taking a moment to regroup after the events of the past week. Prosecutors are weighing charges that Trump allegedly falsified business records and violated campaign finance laws. Another investigation to the former president appears to be gaining momentum.

The questions that prosecutors want to ask him and the answers that they believe he will give are about whether or not Donald Trump was trying to break the law in the response to the classified documents probe at Mar-a-Lago.So, this is a crucial situation that is developed here over the past few hours and days. A federal appeals court in Washington on Wednesday essentially ordered that Corcoran would need to go and testify again to that grand jury, answer questions he hadn't before about his conversations directly with his client, Donald Trump. The appeals court also said that he would need to turn over documents that he had in his possession. Handwritten notes and transcribed verbal notes to the grand jury investigation as well. This is the grand jury investigation into the potential mishandling of classified records at Mar-a-Lago and possibly obstruction of justice. We don't know if there will be charges that emanate from this. But what the Justice Department has done so far to get us to this point, is really putting an emphasis on how close they believe they are to locking up this case. They believe that there was the advancing of a crime. It's quite significant. And Evan Corcoran really is the central person, the central witness to the conversations what was -- what Donald Trump was thinking and wanting to do as the Justice Department was trying to get classified records that he had at Mar-a-Lago back in their possession at the federal government, and that they weren't just turning over all of the things that were there.

DOMINIC THOMAS, CNN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR (via Skype): Well, as far as Emmanuel Macron is concerned the acid the legislation will follow its constitutional paths, will be reviewed by the (INAUDIBLE) and his hope is that by early autumn, this becomes legislation. That as we know, from just history, all the way back in 1995, one of his predecessors tried to enact such reforms. And ultimately, the streets spoke louder than the -- than the government's will. And at the end, they ended up backing down.

So, here he is very early on in his second term, determined to get this legislation through.For him, France is a country that does not compete on the global stage, when it comes to the retirement ages. It has one of the lowest ages of retirement and people are living longer. And it's costing more and more for the state to implement and these particular measures. The opposition see this very differently. They see it as a kind of competing social systems model.

As I mentioned, Emmanuel Macron claims to have a mandate that will people will argue is that in the first round of the 2022, general election, presidential election, they only had about 28 percent of the vote and that the rest then ultimately, in the second runoff stage voted against the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen rather than for him.And then he was unable to secure a parliamentary majority. So, there's sort of opposition to the idea that he can legislate without building these coalitions. I think, then when it comes down to the sort of the social system issue, I think the government has done and an adequate job of actually explaining the specifics all these reforms. How for example they apply to people that have worked very hard jobs for many years. [02:25:06] People who started working in a much younger age. People that have raised families or taking care of elderly or sick members of the family, for example. So, there's been a kind of marketing issue here.

He's deciding whether the facts that have been presented so far, both in his courtroom and in court filings. Whether those facts are sufficient for him to rule in favor of either Dominion or Fox News without this case, going to trial. Now, that is a very high bar and the likelihood here is that this case will go to trial, unless Fox and dominion settle before then.And then a hearing on Wednesday morning. There were also questions about how a trial would proceed. Judge Davis actually said, he could possibly compel Fox corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch to testify at any trial. And that's because as Judge Davis put it, Rupert Murdoch has a special role at Fox Corporation, and he was aware of the guests appearing on Fox News is air. In fact, Rupert Murdoch even acknowledged in his deposition that he could have stopped Trump's legal team from appearing on the network's air. Fox News attorneys that were saying that any compelled appearance by Rupert Murdoch on the witness stand, would just create an undue burden also a media circus. And in response to that, the judge did say that he'd consider bringing in high profile witnesses via zoom or some other teleconferencing platform. But the stakes in this case are very high. Dominion is demanding $1.6 billion in this defamation case, even though Fox News is saying that those numbers are inflated. But Dominion at the core of this is arguing that since Fox News executives and its hosts knew that they were putting on guests who were promoting false election fraud theories. They say Fox should be held accountable here and liable for defamation. Fox, on the other hand, is arguing that they are fully protected under the First Amendment. So, no matter which way you slice it, this is a high stakes case, and we'll see if it goes to trial. Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington.",
