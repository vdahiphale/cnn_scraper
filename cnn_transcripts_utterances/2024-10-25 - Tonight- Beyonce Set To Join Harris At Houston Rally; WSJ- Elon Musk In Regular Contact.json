We are still in a dead heat and even if you factor in those third party and independent candidates, we still know who's going to win this thing. CNN's Rosa Flores joining me live from Houston now ahead of the rally there, later today. Rosa, good to see you. So a big deal, right?

There's a very narrow, narrow exception for life of the mother and any private citizen can file a lawsuit against someone who, quote, aid and abets and abortion. And so this political expert told me, look, it's very clear, Kamala Harris will be in Texas tonight, but really the message that she sending to all of the seven battleground states is that if she doesn't win, then the country could look more like Texas when it comes to abortion rights. And that, that would be the realities for many more women around this country, and not just here in Texas.And so that's a really important point, Erica, because Kamala Harris is, again, not, not trying to say here that the 40 electoral votes from the state of Texas are going to go to Kamala Harris. But this is just the biggest stage where she can make this argument and really draw contrast with Donald Trump.",

I thought it was interesting a short time ago, the former president saying, hey, I don't know why Kamala Harris would be in Texas. Texas is not in play for her. It's not a swing state, doesn't she know where she is.It's interesting, Shermichael, because that's been some of the criticism when it comes to the president's choice in terms of places that he is going, that he is maybe not in some of these states where he needs to make a little headway. Is that what you say? That's accurate on either side? SINGLETON:  I would say it's accurate for Vice President Harris to pay in Texas because she's going to particularly give a boost to Colin Allred. I mean, Allred and Senator Ted Cruz are in a statistical tie. And so sometimes, when you're looking at some of these potential gettable seats, particularly at the Senate level, and you recognize that having your candidate there can gin up enthusiasm to particularly help a Democratic candidate get across the finish line, then there absolutely is a strategic case to make for the vice president to be there. She's going to be in Houston with Beyonce, strong African- American population there, a strong Latino population there, a strong younger population in Texas, in fact, because of a lot of families moving into the state. So even as a Republican, I'm looking at the numbers and I don't think the vice president will win. But I got to tell you something, Erica, I'm looking at Cruz and I'm saying do not underestimate the potential of Vice President Harris increase in turnout among key constituencies within the Democratic Party in the state of Texas.",
