But this really is putting people within the central part of Beirut on edge, not just residents, but also, of course, you have up to a million people who are displaced within the country at this point, according to officials, many of those have come from southern Lebanon, where there are many evacuation orders in place by the Israeli military, and come to the capital, where they have believed that they would be more secure.What we've seen at this point, and what we know is that this was an Islamic Health Authority. It was called, it's a Hezbollah affiliated building, or at least one of the floors within that building was Hezbollah affiliated, and it was targeted by the Israeli military. Just after midnight, local time, six people, we understand, have been killed. A number of others have been wounded. Now it comes as we're also seeing intense fighting in the southern Lebanon area, so just across the border from Israel. Now we've heard from both sides that there has been face to face fighting between the IDF and the Hezbollah militants. The Israeli forces calling it close range engagement, saying that they have destroyed more than 150 Hezbollah sites just on Wednesday alone. Now, from Hezbollah side, they're saying that they have carried out more than two dozen attacks against Israeli troops in the area. They claim that they are targeting the troops in northern Israel as well. We have seen that to try and stop the IDF from moving into southern Lebanon. Now, according to the Lebanese army, three times they say Israeli troops have moved into different villages in southern Lebanon, and there had been fighting with Hezbollah. Now the end of that, we know that there have been eight Israeli troops that have been killed, more that have been wounded. Now that is the first loss of life for Israel when it comes to this ground incursion that they are still calling, localized and targeted at this point. Or we do know, though, that they have added another battalion, which is potentially thousands of Israeli troops, which has moved to the northern border to support this operation. Lynda.",

SALEMOther parts of Beirut have also slightly emptied out, because the attacks have been mainly targeting the southern suburbs, but are targeting other points in Beirut as well. So the city is fairly paralyzed. Most of the south of the country has already been evacuated, and there are about a million residents that have been displaced and are either in the north or in the mountain parts of Lebanon, and a feeling that this is likely to go on for many weeks, maybe many months. It's also clear that Hezbollah has taken a very, very heavy set of hits, but is still operating, and is still able to function, both in terms of launching missiles, but also fighting on the ground in southern Lebanon.",

Now they feel Hezbollah is not a major threat, and now Israel is focused on going after Iran itself. And that tectonic shift is a shift in which Iran no longer has the balance of -- sort of there's no longer a stable balance of power or balance of deterrence between Iran and Israel, and we are on the brink of a major attack on Iran, which could be a major escalation for the region and, I dare say, for the global economy.",

Most importantly, and what we saw most strikingly two weeks ago was Israel clearly had developed a very detailed intelligence capacity, bolstered by artificial intelligence, and the way it deployed this intelligence, both to hit the pagers and then the walkie talkies, but also, through that artificial intelligence bolstered system is able to know where every arms depot is, where every Hezbollah leader was to target them. I don't think we've seen this in Modern Warfare. This was a real innovation on the Israeli side. Of course, they have the massive arsenals, you know, from the U.S. and so on, that Hezbollah doesn't have equivalently. But I think Israel and Hezbollah learned different lessons, and it showed.",

They know them well.[01:10:000] They've built elaborate tunnel systems. Israel is entering sort of foreign territory, and in that close combat, the AI powered intelligence and sometimes the big, you know, weaponry is not necessarily the major advantage it is when you're fighting from the air or detonating pagers and I think Hezbollah will be able to put up more of a deterrence, more of a fight. We've already seen that Israel lost eight soldiers in just kind of a minor skirmish in one of the towns. I think this type of warfare is something Hezbollah is more prepared for, and is more costly for the Israelis if they're to do it town by town.",

      "sentences": "This filing is the first time the public is getting to see Special Counsel Jack Smith's full argument for why he believes former President Trump was acting in his private capacity when he allegedly tried to undermine the 2020 election.Now this is important because the Supreme Court ruled in July that Trump cannot be prosecuted for things he did in his official capacity or for official acts. So, prosecutors in this filing emphasizing things that Trump did as an office seeker, not an office holder, saying quote, at its core, the defendant's scheme was a private one. He extensively used private actors and his campaign infrastructure to attempt to overturn the election results and operated in a private capacity as a candidate for office. This new filing also includes some never before seen evidence, including conversations he had with then-Vice President Mike Pence and his White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows. It's unclear, though, if the prosecutors will be successful in using that because the Supreme Court also said you can't use anything you do in your official capacity as evidence, and those are, of course, two of the President's top advisers. Now, this is all coming out because the judge overseeing this case, Judge Tanya Chutkan is allowing this to be released. Special Counsel submitted nearly 200 pages detailing his argument, but it was up to the judge to allow this to be released. Lawyers for former President Trump have objected to the release of this evidence, especially so close to the election and after it was disclosed today, they started shifting to political arguments. Trump arguing that this was, quote, a political hit job, and then the campaign framing it as an effort to interfere with the election. Now they write in a statement, quote, the release of the falsehood ridden unconstitutional, January 6 brief immediately following Tim Walz's disastrous debate performance, is another obvious attempt by the Harris-Biden regime to undermine American democracy and interfere in this election. This is similar to the arguments we've heard across all of Trump's four criminal cases. They have repeatedly argued that he is somehow the target of some effort to interfere with the November election. But it is important to note that it was up to the federal judge to release this not the Special Counsel, Paula Reid, CNN Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And now, according to news from Israel, an additional division is being deployed to the northern border in anticipation of what could be a full-scale Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Wednesday, Hezbollah organized a mob of media for a tour around the southern suburbs to show perhaps they're still in control. I asked spokesman, Mohammad Afif how Hezbollah will deal with Israel's repeated blows, a question he didn't like. \"I won't allow for that expression,\" he replied. \"Your Arabic language is not correct.\" His aides chant loyalty to their assassinated leader. \"We haven't taken blows.

Well, Vuhledar sits about 30 miles south of Pokrovsk, which is sort of the main area of attack in the east of Ukraine where the Russians have really been pushing over the past couple of months. And the Russians have been trying to take Vuhledar for about two years now and taking significant losses. While it's not a transport or logistics hub, it has been seen as a critical intersection of Ukraine's eastern and southern fronts. There have been videos in the past of whole Russian armored columns destroyed by the Ukrainians. But the fact that the Russians have now been able to take Vuhledar certainly shows that they do appear to have a good degree of momentum on the eastern front. It also calls into question Ukraine's own incursion into the Kursk area in the west of Russia. And the Ukrainians say it also shows how badly they need further western military aid. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's very clear to me that Pope Francis doesn't quite understand women and their vocations. And so my hope and prayer is that he really gets to encounter women who experienced the call to ordain into ministry, to listen to their stories, the pain that they carry, and the love that they have for the church. So I feel like there's just a big gap in his understanding of where women, how women want to contribute to the church and the discernment that goes into them claiming their call to priesthood.
