It is midnight in Israel and the beginning of day nine of Israel's war with Hamas. Israel prepares the world at this crucial hour. Its military is working toward quote, \"the next stages of war\" and that likely will include a ground invasion into Gaza. More than 300,000 Israeli soldiers with heavy equipment are at the border as we speak awaiting orders from Israeli Defense Forces and turning it over to my colleague Erin in Tel Aviv. Erin, what can you tell us?",

Today he posted a video online of his visit with troops at the frontline.Israel as you mentioned has ordered those troops to the border and ordered more than a million civilians to evacuate in northern Gaza for their own safety. Today the State Department is urging Palestinian Americans in Gaza to move closer to the crossing into Egypt. It is called the Rafah crossing. Minutes ago the U.S. State Department confirmed that the American death toll in Israel has climbed now up to 29 Americans confirmed dead. And today, Jim, we visited Kibbutz Be'eri (ph), and that is right near actually where Benjamin Netanyahu actually went in today to visit the troops. 1,100 people lived here, more than 100 were dead. And you know, we were there today, we could smell the death. I will say it's a distinct and immediately recognizable, horrible smell to any human being. We saw things like these tractors, airplane toys of children, all burnt out and destroyed. Inside one home, in the kitchen you can see it was the microwave, the fridge still full of food. On a counter, I even saw days-of-the-week medicine dispenser, bullet holes in almost every single home and in Arabic on the side of one graffiti that says a \"Al Qassem Brigade\", \"Allah Akbar\" and the word \"victory\". And everywhere you see next to the destruction IDF soldiers, Jim, on patrol, on-duty in what is now a death zone and an active fighting area. Incredibly sobering to see it. You see the detritus of life that was just in the midst of being lived. Children's playing guards (ph), kids homework just completely destroyed and shot up. And again, that horrid, horrid smell.",

You have to actually decide what that next stage will be and move on it.You know, you've got a country where businesses are still not fully open. You've got kids not all the way in school. You've got all these things on hold. As you've got those hundreds of thousands of troops amassing on the border. So there is a very palpable sense. And even when you talk to people. People saying well, they think it will be tomorrow. These are civilians but they get this feeling that it is imminent, that it is about to happen.

You know, we're on the other side, Jim, of that confrontation with Israeli troops in the north of Israel, very close to the Lebanese border, quite close to the Syrian border as well. It is a short distance from here.So you can see we are with some Israeli forces that have begun to gather and sort of encamp in this very volatile region. Of course the majority of Israeli forces bolster themselves for a possible assault which we are expecting in the south in Gaza about 250 miles to the north here where people and soldiers are bracing for the possibility of a second front opening, a rocket barrage, of a fear of ground incursion from across the border in Lebanon and possibly elsewhere as well as I mentioned. There have been some exchanges of fire. You mentioned some artillery fire that has been going out from the Israeli side toward Lebanon. That was in response to a mortar attack, I'm told by the local soldiers here just a short distance from here. There has also been rockets fired from Syria and there has been an Israeli response to that as well. You can see a huge buildup of forces here in preparation for the possibility of that getting a much bigger confrontation. At the moment, Israeli officials say that the level of confrontation in this part of the country has not got to the point of escalation. That is the phrase they use. It is not big enough yet to warrant a full-scale escalation. But the Israelis are also warning that if it does breach that point then they will take decisive action. They have appealed to Hezbollah the Iranian backed Lebanese militia to say, don't provoke the destruction of Lebanon. That is an overt threat that if there is a kind of massive barrage of missiles across the border from Lebanon from Hezbollah, the Israelis will respond in kind and with strength. And so that's the situation here. At the moment it is pretty quiet apart from the isolated incidents that we have spoken about earlier. And Hezbollah has not launched a full-scale strike yet on this part of Israel. But let's see what happens in the next few days because there is all sorts of concern at what the regional reaction once that very provocative, potentially very bloody ground operation in Gaza gets underway, Jim.",

But also because it knows very well that the Palestinian rockets that have been fired at its settlements over the course of the past week or so, and of course, beyond that pale into significance compared to the strength of the rocket arsenal, the missile arsenal that Hezbollah at its disposal.It is heavily supplied of course, directly from Iran. It is essentially under the command of Iran as well and at the moment Israel is doing everything it can to make sure that that full-scale war does not break out. I think by the same token, Hezbollah is not necessarily gunning for a second front at the moment either because it knows what will come. Not only does Israel have significant antimissile defenses in this region but it is made quite clear it will strike back hard. There is also U.S. forces in the aircraft carrier group off the coast of Israel in the eastern Mediterranean that could well be brought in to a confrontation if Hezbollah were to unleash its missile arsenal on northern Israel. And so look, if that step is taken, if that Rubicon is crossed, then we will be in a very different geopolitical and fighting situation in this part of the world.",

Tonight we have learned President Biden has spoken with both the leaders of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu and of the Palestinian Authority. And we're also learning that the number of Americans killed in last week's attack has now risen to 29 American lives lost. Let's discuss more with Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts. He serves on the House Armed Services Committee. Congressman, really appreciate you being here. You know, I guess right now we just don't know what happens next but it sounds as though that something is imminent. What are your thoughts? We were just showing these eerily quiet live pictures of Gaza a few moments ago, but all indications are that something -- an escalation in this war between Israel and Hamas is going to be happening soon. REP. SETH MOULTON (D-MA): Well, I think that's right, Jim. I think it's is pretty clear we all know what is coming which is an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza and there are a lot of different ways this could go. But as the veteran of a few ground invasions myself, four tours in Iraq, I can tell you there are a lot of mistakes that Israel can make in the coming days. And so it's going to be a very tough operation. It's not going to be easy to fight through an urban environment like that. It would be very difficult. And if Israel is not careful to make sure that as many innocent lives are preserved as possible, then they run into this problem that we call insurgent math where they risk creating more insurgents, recruiting more people to the cause than Hamas fighters that they actually kill. So in other words, how Israel conducts this operation is critical not just for the safety of the people of Gaza, for the safety of the people of Israel, but ultimately for their success in this war.",

Perhaps this is what Israel wants the world to hear. I'm sure that's what it is.That they want to give the Palestinians as much time as possible to move to that southern part of Gaza. But he was very clear later on in the interview that Israeli Defense Forces are prepared to move in and that they will stay in that part of the world for as long as they think it is necessary to take out the leadership of Hamas. And I asked him, does that mean days, possibly weeks? And he seemed to indicate that yes, that they are prepared to stay as long as the mission takes. But that seems to go to the question that you raised, the concern that you raise, which is they may be stuck in some very hard fighting in the days and weeks ahead.",

In the First Marine Division in Iraq, we had our division motto which is \"No better friend, no worse enemy than a United States Marine\".Now, of course, that meant that you know, for our enemy, for Hamas in this case, you'll find no fiercer foe. We will hunt you down. We will kill you. Don't oppose us. But on the other hand, the first part of that phrase, \"no better friend,\" is really important, too. If Israel doesn't show that they can take care of the civilian population, fundamentally, it is smarter for the civilian population to side with the IDF then to side with the Hamas terrorists, then they are not going to win the long war. They are not going to win the long battle. What I hear out of Israel, a lot of talk about the tactics on the ground for how they take out Hamas, I don't hear much about this bigger picture strategy to produce a long-term viable political solution for all of the innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip.

Of course, we haven't been able to provide any additional aid for Ukraine or any of the other international issues around the globe. That is the fundamental problem that we face right now. But the other problem is that our adversaries, Russia and China, for example, are looking at the United States right now and just seeing this dysfunction.

They're saying, the United States, this democracy is dysfunctional. They cannot work.

They say they want to target Hamas leadership. And how you do that if Hamas is among civilians and you have a couple hundred miles of tunnels is, let's say we have seen that before. Is a very hard mission. The challenge now is, what is going to be for the Palestinian civilian population soon, so that there are alternatives to either a refugee crisis or radicalization. That's not going to flow through the IDF for Israel. That's going to flow through the Palestinian suspect. Whatever we think about the Palestinian Authority, it is better than the terrorist group Hamas. That's what we need to begin to build up. It has to be office.

This is one of those moments were any good intention of just going in after the Hamas leadership, taking them out one by one, on en mass, whichever way it is, all of that falls apart once by accident you hit the shopkeeper down the street. That is the kind of thing that is going to happen. And in this very charged environment, the Israelis are going to have a heck of a challenge when they deal with that kind of fallout. And it is going to be political as well as a military challenge.",

The international humanitarian organization is calling the timeframe of Israel's evacuation order of Gaza \"outrageous.\" That's their exact word. The executive director of Doctors Without Borders, Avril Benoit, joins us now. Avril, I appreciate your time. I want to try to get an understanding of what you see from people on the ground in Gaza right now. What is the situation for your teams in Gaza right now?",

The vast majority are Palestinian. They're there with their families. And we are asking for safe passage for them to leave. Many of them have sheltered in the south. They made the middle-of-the- night very harrowing journey with hundreds of other cars to a U.N. compound. It's a school, actually, where people are sleeping on blankets and mattresses on the floor, fearing the worst. Because there are thousands of them there. Many people trying to flee and our colleagues are caught up in this as well.",

You've got sick and injured people, people with disabilities, you've got the elderly who may have mobility problems. Not everyone has been able to. It's just impossible to imagine that. Those who have arrived in the south are reporting that there's a really serious shortage of water. We're asking for clean drinking water at the very least to be assured for these thousands of people. We also see that there is a looming shortage of food and of just about all the necessities of life. The health care system is, was always extremely fragile. We considered it a humanitarian chronic emergency over many, many years. And now it's a complete catastrophe. So with that shortage of water, the inability of people to get out. We're really beside ourselves, just calling for safe passage for people to be able to go through that Rafah crossing and to leave without prejudice, to find safety. Under humanitarian law, they should be allowed to do so.",

To be clear, that would not apply to many of the people you're talkingabout. Very few of the people in the Gaza Strip. But that border remains closed to absolutely anyone. What is the time frame here? In terms of, you talk about water, you talk about food. If even putting aside a possible ground invasion, more bombardments, those things Israel is in control of. In terms of food, fuel, how much time do you have left before you have a truly crucial life-threatening disaster on your hands? Things like water.",
