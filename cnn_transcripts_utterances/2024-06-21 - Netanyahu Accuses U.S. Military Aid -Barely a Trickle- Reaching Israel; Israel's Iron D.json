Israel's prime minister maintains his public spat with the Biden administration over U.S. military aid. CNN assets standing by in Washington ready for breaking news out of the Supreme Court where blockbuster opinions could drop any moment now. Ukraine hits Russian oil fields as Washington gives the green light for expanded counterstrikes. And these sizzling Spaniards and the tired lions will wrap the euros for you. All right. We are keeping an eye on those looming Supreme Court decisions. We'll get those as soon as they happen. First off, we start this hour with Israel's prime minister expressing his frustration with the Biden administration over military assistance. Benjamin Netanyahu saying that, quote, \"barely a trickle\" of American military aid is making it into Israel. In a new interview with Punchbowl News, he said he raised the issue with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in their recent meeting and that Blinken hold him the U.S. is working to clear up bottlenecks, something the prime minister says in the interview must happen. Well, his comments coming as U.S. officials expressed concern over the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome defense system. Multiple U.S. officials telling CNN they fear the sophistication and sheer number of Hezbollah's weapons arsenal could overwhelm the Iron Dome if all-out war breaks out along Israel's northern border with Lebanon. Kylie Atwood back with us this hour from the State Department with that reporting, and Ben Wedeman is in southern Lebanon. And Ben, I'm going to get to you in a moment. Let's start with you, Kylie. What has the U.S. said about this string of accusations from Netanyahu and the status of this political, geopolitical relationship at this point.",

Yesterday, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller specifically said that there are no bottleneck when it comes to U.S. weaponry going over to Israel, said, of course there is still the review on that one shipment of those 2,000 pound bombs. That shipment is obviously on hold right now as it was a few weeks ago. But other than that, that he said and we've heard from the White House as well that the United States has given Israel a tremendous amount of military support. They will continue to do so and there are no bottle necks currently in the system, so they have very bluntly said that they don't know what Prime Minister Netanyahu is talking about.",

They put out another video showing them knocking down in anti- drone system on the 16th of June, and you know, we're talking about the Israeli officials say they have estimated and I think these are pre-war estimates that Hezbollah has somewhere in the area of 150,000 missiles and rockets. But we've already seen the Israelis clearly are surprised by the sophistication of Hezbollah's weaponry and tactics as we've seen since the beginning of the war last October. And perhaps they may be surprised also by the sophistication and the tactics and the number of weapon particularly rockets and missiles, but drones more than anything else at this point, you know, because drones are cheap and they're easily available and they can indeed overwhelm a system that was really designed to knock things, projectiles coming out of Gaza. The terrain in Gaza is completely different. It's flat. Here in Lebanon, it's mountainous. Hezbollah in some areas possesses the higher ground. They clearly have capacity to inflict pain on Israel far more than Hamas does. And we heard Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of Hezbollah, the other day in his speech saying that they've only used a small portion of their weapons. The Israelis say that Hezbollah has fired 5,000 rockets and missiles at Israel. Well, if they have 150,000 indeed that is a minor portion of what they have and what they have could be focused on things like the Iron Dome. And as I was telling you in the last hour, Becky, in May of 2023 there was a brief war between Hezbollah, not Hamas in Gaza, and Israel. And I was on the edge of Gaza watching that system working. It's incredible how efficient it is. The Israeli say it's 95.5 percent effective in knocking down the missiles and rockets it's aimed at. But when the Islamic Jihad is one thing, Hezbollah is another. And certainly it might not overwhelm the system, but it will punch some pretty big holes in it -- Becky.",

So basically it means that Ukraine is moving to the top of the list here for those air defense munitions, which is really important because they are the ones arguably who need it the most right now, right? And the U.S. has said that if they don't get this very rapid supply of air defense, munitions, then there is a possibility that they're going to run out particularly before the winter season, which is when of course Russia is expected to begin hammering Ukrainian critical infrastructure making civilians, of course, even more vulnerable. So the U.S. now saying that they're making this, quote, \"unprecedented decision\" to basically put other countries that have long standing orders for these interceptors at the back of the line. And Ukraine has essentially moved up here. It is something that Ukraine has been asking for for quite some time now because they say that they are running very dangerously low on these munitions so the U.S. is making an effort here to try to prioritize them for the Ukrainians. It remains unclear how other countries are going to handle that because the U.S. acknowledges that this is going to be a very diplomatically sensitive conversation that they're going to have to have with some key allies who have placed these orders and who feel that they need them for their own defense. But still, two key countries that the U.S. says will not be impacted by this are Israel and Taiwan. The Israelis don't use these kinds of interceptors for their air defense systems so they won't be impacted, and similarly, according to U.S. officials, Taiwan will not be affected either in terms of the provision of air defense munitions. But all other countries, they will be impacted. But the U.S. hopes that they understand that just how dire the situation is on the Ukrainian battlefield.

You'relooking at what was in place at the time that certain laws were or the Constitution was passed or amended and it has been a valid complaint. And I think that Justice Roberts, Chief Justice Roberts is seeing that as being true. Even if we go back as far as the mid-1800s, we used to see a sign at a western town, for example, that said check your guns when you come into town and those type of statutes or ordinances were enforced for a very long time. I think that Justice Thomas was trying to defend the Bruen decision, which was based on the Heller decision which found that owning a gun is a personal right as opposed to the opposition that said, no, you're not a member of a militia, therefore you don't get to keep a gun. I think that he was trying to defend what he had to say. And I think Justice Roberts was fighting back and saying, we understand what you said in Bruen. But we also have a duty to protect the public and here it doesn't take a conviction to take a gun away. Just an injunction. I used to issue those injunctions and I will tell you one of the best parts of it was that we would disarm the abuser and make sure that he did not have the opportunity or she did not have the opportunity to harm the person that was a subject of their domestic abuse. So I think that they're recognizing certain realities. Part of what this said is if possessing -- that said Heller never established a categorical rule that the Constitution prohibits regulations that forbid firearm possession in the home. Basically what they were saying is what, you know, I actually teach and that is that the Second Amendment is not absolute any more than any other of the amendments are absolute. And I think that that's one of the things that Justice Roberts was trying to say. This is not an absolute right.

And if that's the case you still have to wonder why they could sit there and make such minutiae out of the bump stock case and find however that this deals with other people and the threat to other people, and a known threat. And so I kind of have a problem with that to the same extent I also see that this case comes out of the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit has been nothing but a thorn in the side of the Supreme Court. It seems like almost everything of import almost seems to come out of the Fifth Circuit most of the time. In fact, generally almost all the time they've had to reverse the Fifth Circuit. So there seems to be a battle going on between the Fifth Circuit, which is Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, and the Supreme Court. And somehow or another, they're trying to come back on them. He uses the word historical twin is not required. And that's accurate.

We can put it up on thescreen for you just so if you're watching now, if you haven't been reading through the opinion because it can be a little bit dense for those of us non-lawyers, here is the lone dissent. Again, Justice Thomas noting, \"Thus the question before us is not whether Rahimi and others like him can be disarmed, consistent with the Second Amendment. Instead the question is whether the government can strip the Second Amendment right of any one subject to a protective order, even if he has never been accused or convicted of a crime. It cannot. The court and government do not point to a single historical law revoking a citizen's Second Amendment right based on possible interpersonal violence.\" Jeff, what do you make of that?",

And I think that that really is kind of out in the woods some place. I don't know what makes him think that the public really would justify that kind of thought process, that if you have an injunction, then that piece of paper will protect you. The last I heard when I was doing domestic violence work was a piece of paper doesn't stop a bullet and if that's the case, how do you protect the abused person other than to take weapons away from the person who is the abuser? So I just see the connection to be too solid to really avoid it in the context of the Second Amendment is absolute unless you're convicted of a crime. A judge here has made a decision, issued an injunction and I think that that is evidence enough to disarm someone.",
