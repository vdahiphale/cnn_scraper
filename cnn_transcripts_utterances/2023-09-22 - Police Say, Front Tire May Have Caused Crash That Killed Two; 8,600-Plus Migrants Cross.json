And the question is, where are all of those people going to end up in the days and weeks ahead. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAVANDERA (voice over):  Dozens of migrants stand in the Rio Grande moments after forming a human chain to cross the river and through layers of razor wire trying to reach Eagle Pass, Texas. They tell me they're from Venezuela, among them a woman and her toddler. The danger for them is real. Two people, including a three- year-old boy, have drowned this week after being swept away in the river current. But after a nearly 3,000-mile journey, they accept the risk. How long are you going to wait here? They say they're going to wait here until they let them in. The migrants tell us they've been robbed and attacked on the Mexican side of the river. After hours of waiting, the migrants figure out a way to crawl under the razor wire. In a surreal scene, one man instantly apologized. They wanted to apologize for crossing illegally into the U.S. and that they're begging and asking for mercy. But to understand that they're coming from a country where they're persecuted and they feel like if they were to be returned home, they would be killed. The mass influx of migrants is causing tension between federal and state authorities. Texas Governor Greg Abbott posted this video accusing border agents of cutting razor wire at an undisclosed location in Eagle Pass, allowing trapped migrants to turn themselves in. DHS official refused to comment on the governor's allegation. On Wednesday, about 3,000 migrants crossed in Eagle Pass alone.",

These two men from Venezuela say they crossed illegally because they're desperate and have been waiting three months for the appointment to request asylum. It's a risk we had to take, he tells me. We know there's a chance we get deported, but it's in God's hands. (END VIDEOTAPE) LAVANDERA (on camera):  Phil, now, many of the migrants who have arrived here at the southern border have traveled through Mexico by train, jumping onto freight trains that come north. The operator of that train system has suspended those northbound trains, so that might influence the number of migrants arriving here at the southern border in the days and weeks to come.

And they believe, hold steady do not come down from those initial demands.There's another camp of people that believe that negotiations are about compromise. They have seen these companies come up from their initial wage increases of 10 percent all the way up to 20 percent and possibly more at this point. And they believe in order to get a deal, to get them off the picket lines and back to work, that the union will have to negotiate. I've heard that they believe they need to come down into the 30 percent wage increase, but that's still a large gap. 20 and 30, 35, still a long ways to go.

We're talking Warner Brothers/Discovery, our parent company, Netflix, Disney, NBC Universal. They are now going to be at the table for a third straight day trying to hash this out. And one of the writers I talked to told me, I understand that it's going to take a long time, because these issues are complicated. They're fighting for their wages. They're fighting for residuals, especially when it comes to streaming. And they're very focused on artificial intelligence. They want to be the ones writing and not machines. So, as you mentioned, Phil, more than 140 days and they're still willing to continue this as long as they get what they've been fighting for over the last couple of months.

      "sentences": "Well, down in Washington, a government shutdown feels a lot more likely right now after Republican hardliners tanked a military spending bill. Yesterday, Speaker Kevin McCarthy sent members home for the weekend. There has been no move on a stopgap funding bill. So what is the plan? Republicans will work on individual, annual, long-term spending bills rather than one big, comprehensive one.The trouble is, it's extremely unlikely to get those bills done by the deadline, which is next Saturday. Even if they did, those conservative measures are dead on arrival in a Democratic-held Senate. Other than that, everything is going great. Joining us now is Republican Congressman from Montana Ryan Zinke. He's a member of that Appropriations Committee. He's been at the center of this process, and that's kind of where I want to start. Because as an appropriator, you understand, A, the work that goes into spending bills, and, B, I think the time it takes to reconcile them with the other side to get them to the White House when it's controlled by the opposite party. My sense is the plan now is to pass 11 spending bills. You have eight days. I'm not sure how this doesn't lead to a shutdown. Am I wrong? REP. RYAN ZINKE (R-MT):  Well, and you look at where we're at. As a former Navy SEAL, I can tell you, never go against the troops. And we failed, and I would say, Republicans, remember, we had zero Democrat help as well, but we failed protecting our country with the defense bill. And the defense bill, I can tell you, is important. And right behind it is the Homeland Security bill, which is our, of course, our border. So, I think our focus right now is right now is to make sure we get the three most important bills across, that's our defense, secondly, our border, and, third, make sure we protect our veterans. We get those three across. And I think it's as long as the Senate picks them up, I think we'll avert a shutdown. And let me tell you, as a former secretary, a shutdown is not a good thing. The troops aren't going to get paid. And a secretary has a lot of latitude what he deems or he or she deems, you know, critical and essential. So, an administration that wants to do a lot of harm has a lot of latitude and administration, in my case, I didn't shut down the parks. I kept permits going. So, a secretary has a lot of latitude and shut down. And we do not want a shutdown.",

So, you're right. The goal line changes and you have a few people that won't vote for anything.But I think at the end of the day, we're going to get together because I think people understand the consequence. And it's right to do your job. Congress needs to do the job. And the last point is, look, we're talking about 25 percent of the budget with half of the defense. And we're not even talking about the big problem is on the 75 percent of the budget. And on both sides of the aisle, there's a grant that we need to get back to appropriating all sides of the budget to make sure that we prioritize the spending where it should be going and make the hard decisions.
