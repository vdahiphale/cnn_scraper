Uh, yeah, that`s not actually my car but hey look this is my story and I can dream if I want to. But what if I`m part of the last generation to get excited about driving a car? I`ve spent the last year traveling around the country talking to entrepreneurs, engineers and test drivers who are building the cars of tomorrow and when they imagine the future, driving a car isn`t part of it. They envision roads full of cars driven by machines. Where traffic jams are no more, where the death rate by car accidents drops to zero. The end of car ownership as we know it. Even to the point of human driving one day becoming illegal. I asked them all the same thing. What will the future look like and what will it take to get there? What I found was really exciting but also a bit shocking.",
