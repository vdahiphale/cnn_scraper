And then later, a potential breakthrough in treating Alzheimer'sas new data gives insight into where the disease is more prevalent. But first, tonight, a major symbol of Russia's grip on Crimea has been attacked again, and this time, Ukraine isn't waiting to say they did it. Video shows damage to the Kerch Bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland. Russia says civilians were killed in what they believe was a seaborne drone strike. And Ukraine's Digital Transportation Minister has just come out confirming the bridge was blown up with naval drones. The strike could hurt Russia's ability to move troops as well as supplies, of course, into Crimea. And it comes as a deal letting grain shipments pass through the Black Sea expires at the end of the day. Russia says the pact is already terminated, and the move to cancel isn't related to the strike on the bridge. This video, shot off Turkey, reportedly shows the last grain ship to leave Ukraine before the deal collapsed. Of course, Ukraine grain is vital for many in Africa as well as the Middle East. And the Kremlin is again accused of weaponizing food. Here was the head of the U.N. explaining what was at stake.
