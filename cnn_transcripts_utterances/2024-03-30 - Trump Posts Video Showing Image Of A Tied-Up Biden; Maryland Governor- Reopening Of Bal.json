The post shows a video of a pickup truck with an image of Biden tied up as if he is being kidnapped. The Trump campaign tried to explain it this way, saying: \"That picture on the back of the pickup truck was traveling down the highway. Democrats and crazed lunatics have not only called for despicable violence against President Trump and his family, they are actually weaponizing the justice system against him.\" CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins us now from the White House. Priscilla, has President Biden responded to this?",

They would not confirm or comment on what they call matters of protective intelligence. Of course, all of this comes as the Biden campaign in is trying to attract supporters of Nikki Haley, directly appealing to them in a 30- second ad that's going to be running in battleground states, that ad showing or highlighting moments in which Trump said that he didn't need Haley voters and also calling the former Republican presidential candidate, \"a very angry person.\" So, the Biden campaign, hoping that they can pull Haley voters in their direction, especially those who are turned off by the former president's rhetoric and actions. And of course, trying to target those suburban areas where Nikki Haley did well. Now of course, this also comes as sources tell CNN that campaign officials have been in touch with some of Nikki Haley's donors. So clearly trying to rake in more money here while also trying to bring on those Haley voters -- Alisyn.",

It just so happens that this year, Easter is going to be on the same day. Easter, of course, as often changes year by year.Now, in a statement, White House Spokesperson Andrew Bates said the following: \"As a Christian who celebrates Easter with family, President Biden stands for bringing people together and upholding the dignity and freedoms of every American. Sadly, it is unsurprising, politicians are seeking to divide and weaken our country with cruel, hateful, and dishonest rhetoric. President Biden will never abuse his faith for political purposes or for profit.\" Of course, one of those politicians who slammed the move was House Speaker Mike Johnson, but again, the Transgender Day of Visibility has always fallen on March 31st. President Biden recognized it in a proclamation for the first time in 2021 and has done so every year since then, Easter again, so happens to also fall on March 31st this year.",

But I think when normal people look at the way there in this sort of hermetically sealed extremist outfit, excusing whatever it is Donald Trump does, no matter the cost for democracy, they begin to see that this isn't normal. This is an assault on basic mainstream American values, and there is something palpably odd and a little dangerous about those folks, not in a way that's interesting, but in a way that we should keep them aside and sort of say, are you okay because what you're threatening to do and the people you're threatening to put in power don't seem to have the national interest at heart, not even a little bit.",

When I knock on doors across Suffolk County, I here -- talking to Democrats, the importance of defending our democracy against Trump. But the number one issue, everybody brings up is affordability, and that cuts across partisan lines. The cost of housing, the cost of health care, the cost of food -- that's something that people feel and I do think that strengthening and defending the middle class and make them feel like government and democracy works for them again is a key obligation.

This is what happens when ideologues and extremist capture our democracy. They don't try to solve problems on behalf of the American people. They think bipartisanship is the problem. I think most of us know it is the solution, that's how we solve problems in our daily lives and our daily jobs across all are interesting differences. I think that dysfunctional environment -- when President Biden and Nancy Pelosi was Speaker in the first year of the presidency, over 300 bipartisan bills got passed. This is a do-nothing Congress, but with an added degree of sort of dysfunction that's leading its own members to head for the hills.

The governor knows that those families are waiting for a resolution that they want and they need disclosure, and he has made it clear he is committed to that.

They won't have to fight with the heavy suits on, and they are just going to have to move some of the debris as one might suspect, having worked a couple of these deep water, this is only 50 feet. The good news is, it is close to shore, Alisyn. If did -- this couldn't happen as bad as this is and the empathy condolences we have for the family, but if this has happened offshore, this would be a lot harder job. So the industry will get in there, they will get this metal out of water and they have a good command structure to do it. With the governor overseeing this, but the president pinned the rows on the Corps of Engineers. It is their job to clear the waters and keep them clear. It is the Coast Guard's job to control the boats, and the actions of the boats on that water. So it will get done, but it is going to be -- it should be days, not weeks. You know, we built The Pentagon in 16 weeks. We need American industry to show up, our engineers to show up and work as a team and get this done and get the best and the brightest we've got in terms of our skilled water workers, which by the way, we have a lot of them in the Louisiana up the Gulf of Mexico who are capable of coming up and help.
