Twelve jurors and six alternates have now been empaneled and the judge told them to be ready for opening statements to begin as early as Monday. We'll have more reporting and analysis on this historic criminal trial of a former president. But, first, breaking news just outside that courthouse, right as that jury was seated, a man appeared to light himself on fire on the street. The NYPD responded. He was then taken away in an ambulance. We are standing by for an NYPD briefing at those podiums right there about what exactly happened. We're going to bring that to you when it begins momentarily. Joining me now for more is CNN's Marshall Cohen. Marshall, what do we know about the person who let themselves on fire here? What are the circumstances?",

It moved fairly quickly several days to empaneled the jury, but as the judge had, it seemed predicted, and one wanted full jury empaneled 12 plus those six alternates with a plan at least to begin on Monday with those opening statements. COHENwe started this week on Monday, a historic moment, the first ever trial of a former president and more history will be made next week with opening statements expected on Monday. But the process with the jury honestly the whole world is watching this one. But in some ways, it proceeded just like any jury I've seen lots of jury selection in other cases that are much less high profile, but the goal always is about, can you be fair? Can you be impartial? And we saw some of the people said, no, it's Donald Trump. I can. And other people that had been selected as jurors later came back and said, you know what, I don't think I'm up for it. But they found enough people to fill the ranks, 12 jurors, six alternates. The foreperson of the jury, he is actually from Ireland. He's a New Yorker now, but interestingly, he's from Ireland. Other jurors who are part of the 12, they are lawyers. There's a couple lawyers on there, English teacher, software engineer, a speech therapist, some of them have advanced degrees, some of them only have a high school diploma or a real cross of New York City. Those are the people that will be sitting in judgment of former President Donald Trump.",

Once you get in the courtroom, right. Once you're sort of in -- in it, you've got such a secure site, you've got multiple police agencies at the state and federal, I should say. You have the U.S. marshals for the judge side, you have DHS for the courtroom and the federal -- any federal entities which would be the Secret Service, you have a state and local apparatus, and then you just have the general concerns and law enforcement, state and local that would --",

But at 1:30 this afternoon, right here in Collect Pond Park, which is directly opposite of New York County Criminal Court at 100 Center Street where the trial of former President Trump is currently taking place. We observe a male walk into the park. He walks to the center of the park. When he's in the park, he starts shuffling around his clothes. He opens up a book bag. From the book bag, he takes numerous pieces of papers, pamphlets out. He throws the pamphlets throughout the park. And then he pulls out a canister, and pours some kind of liquid on himself. A liquid we believe is an accelerant. And he lights themselves on fire. The male, he takes a couple of steps why he's on fire and then eventually falls onto a police barrier and falls down to the ground. He's on fire in, another area in the park where some of the accelerant spilled is also on fire. Civilians called offices, members of the police department, they run into the park. They make efforts to put him out. They use their coats, they use fire extinguishers. Eventually, FDNY responds. We're able to put the male extinguish the fire and from that point, we remove him to Cornell Burn Unit where right now he's there in critical condition. At just -- at this moment, I'll let our fire commissioner talk about the condition of the male and the condition of people who also helped, and who were witnesses over there. Commissioner?",

The attacker or the person who set himself on fire in the park there, they say is alive in critical condition now at the Cornell burn unit. Four other law enforcement officer sears, who responded, received minor injuries.They identified the person as Maxwell Azzarello from St. Augustine, Florida, arrived in New York this week. And the motive here well, the best evidence they have as to the motive is that just before he lit himself on fire, he distributed pamphlets that contained according to police conspiracy theories about Ponzi schemes and the possibility of New York educational institutions being somehow tied to the mob. Our Juliette Kayyem is with us here. And to a question I asked you, Juliette, prior, they say the bomb squad is now looking to be sure there weren't any other explosive devices does not appear that they believe that there are. They said they were in touch with the Secret Service. Of course, president is -- the former president protected by Secret Service? Does this raise questions about security around there? Because here's someone willing to light themselves on fire who was able to walk into that park there right across the street from the courthouse and do what he did?",

I -- one of the officials said we are going to look at the possibility of closing the part. That's a big deal. But probably something they will do just given what happened today. But I -- you know, as I was talking before the press conference, you at some stage, your security apparatus is going to stop and on the other side of that, lots of bad things could happen.

All have said they believe they can be fair and impartial, and will consider the evidence. It is a major moment. Former President Donald Trump himself spent hours over four days listening to prospective jurors share their thoughts on him, answer questions, not all those thoughts about him were positive. And he is still effort in a new jury outside of Manhattan where he says he cannot get a fair trial. Just moments ago, we learned a New York appeals court will hear arguments this afternoon. On his change of venue motion, even as a jury in this venue, has now been set. For more on all this, I want to bring in Jeff Swartz, former Florida judge, professor at Cooley Law School. He's been helping us navigate the trial all week. Plus, Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, a jury consultant. Jeff, I want to begin with you because he's trying again, he tried this before the trial he had asked the appeals court to stop the trial so they can consider a change of venue, denied then.
