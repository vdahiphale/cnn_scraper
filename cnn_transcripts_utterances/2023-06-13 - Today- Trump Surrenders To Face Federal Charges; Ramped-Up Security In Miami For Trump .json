      "sentences": "And welcome back to our special live coverage. Former President Donald Trump due to arrive at the Miami Courthouse within the next hour and a half here, two hours. He's going to face a judge for the first time since federal prosecutors brought that 37 count indictment against him.Now, Trump is expected to plead not guilty on all counts that he mishandled classified documents, engaged in a conspiracy to obstruct justice. Disseminated and shared those documents with national security implications. We should be clear that there is no president in American history who has ever been in this position, ever been done these sorts of things and ever faced these charges. And Trump has just spoken out in a series of social media posts. Our Kristen Holmes is live near Trump's golf club where he will be tonight hosting a fundraiser. And Kristen, of course, he's going to, you know, his own social media to speak out here ahead of the arraignment. What's he saying?",

And you are also a former federal prosecutor. You've worked at DOJ for 15 years? REP. KEN BUCK (R), COLORADO: Three years at DOJ and 12 at the U.S. Attorney's Office. Yes.",

There's no doubt in my mind that there are allegations of criminal conduct. I'm not going to say that he committed a crime until he is convicted of committing a crime.But I do think that there were allegations of criminal conduct in other situations where crimes -- where charges could have been brought against Hillary Clinton and others. That doesn't excuse this conduct, but it certainly raises questions about equal treatment under the law. That's my only concern here. I think this case will go forward, and the results will speak for themselves. But we still need to explain to the American public why is it that there's an apparent disparate impact.",

He said that Hillary Clinton was unfit for the White House because of the way she handled classified information.He said that she wasn't even qualified to have a low level State Department job because of the way she handled information.
