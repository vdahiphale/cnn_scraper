I'm Jim Sciutto in Washington.We continue to follow breaking news out of Florida, where the FBI is now investigating an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump just two months after the former president was shot in the ear at a rally in Pennsylvania. Trump is safe. He was not harmed in Sunday's incident at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. A 58-year-old man, identified -- you see him there -- as Ryan Wesley Routh has been detained. He had weighed in on politics on social media in the past, at times criticizing Trump. A source says the FBI investigation has now gone global as officials look into the alleged assassin's background, or attempted assassin's background. Earlier the Palm Beach County sheriff said the Secret Service fired shots at a man who was holding a rifle in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club. A source says Trump had been playing golf at the time. He was moving between the fifth and six holes. His outing, we are told, was a last- minute decision. Officials described just how far the former president was from the man at the time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's 58 years old, and the car that he was driving actually belonged to his daughter. We understand from law enforcement that, when he was taken into custody, he was calm and that he was not displaying emotion, according to law enforcement. Now, we also know that he had with him, according to what was found at the scene, two backpacks and a GoPro, as well as an AK-47 style rifle. Now this all unfolded after Secret Service, who was on the golf course working the holes ahead of Donald Trump, saw the barrel of a rifle poking through the fence. And then they engaged the suspect with some gunfire. He took off. They made chase. They eventually tracked him down and took him into custody. Now, in terms of the law enforcement presence here, still at the International Golf Club, the roads have been closed since this incident occurred. That has continued much through the day here on Summit Boulevard, which is the main thoroughfare outside the front of the International Golf Club. That is where holes five and six, where this incident apparently occurred, those holes back up to Summit Boulevard where we are standing. And this has been closed for hours. So, that is sort of a key boulevard, as well as others that surround the club, which would be Kirk Road and Congress Avenue. All of them were shut down following this incident. The former president was kept here at the International Golf Club for hours, made sure that the area was secure, the entire golf club was locked down. And then he was brought to Mar-a-Lago, which he calls home about 15 minutes from here in West Palm Beach. So, we understand that he does still have scheduled events this week. And we will see what the week brings and what the investigation brings, as well. Randi Kaye, CNN, Palm Beach County, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

THE JOB DONE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. I AM VERY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!\"Joining me now from Palm Springs, California, is Bobby Chacon, retired FBI special agent, former leader of an FBI dive team. Bobby, good to have you on tonight. Appreciate your experience on this. As you listen to law enforcement, explain the situation leading up to this incident. They had agents a hole or two ahead of the former president. But as our reporter was saying last hour, they had not blocked off, it seems, access to the golf course entirely. And by the way, there are other players there. I suppose, to some degree that's natural. But does that strike you as a sufficient enough cordon, as it were around the former president, which allowed this attempted gunman to get within 300, 500 yards of the former president.",

But you know, what they do after each of these events is they do a hot wash to do what lessons learned.And so, one of the things coming out of Pennsylvania was to push these boundaries back. And one of the things coming out of this incident may be to actually extend the security perimeters even further. You know, I'm surprised they didn't deploy. This would have been a perfect example of deploying a drone that can fly over bigger spaces and give you kind of an eye in the sky and see those things. But it may be a result of lessons learned here that we push the security perimeter back even further. As you've spoken about tonight, you know, the caliber of this weapon. And I'm not talking about the particular -- the range of this weapon is such, and it's so readily available that they should consider starting to push these security perimeters further and further. SCIUTTO: When you look -- and I think we can put the picture back up on here, what was the position where this gunman was. You had this AK- 47 style rifle, long-barreled rifle with some range to it. But you also have these -- these backpacks that seemed to be -- as police described, it had ceramic plates in there, which are -- which are a form of body armor, in effect. The way it was set up there, does that look to you like a firing position in which he was trying to protect himself from the possibility of return fire?",

And he couldn't be in a prone position, because the land rose up on the other side. If he was going to shoot from a kneeling position, you can see him setting that rifle barrel in between those two backpacks, which could have provided him ballistic protection from -- from return fire coming at him. So, it did kind of look like a shooting position to me. If he was in a kneeling position, those plates were at the height where his head and the rifle might be.",

And in talking to local law enforcement, there are questions about how this man knew that. Now, it is true that Donald Trump is somewhat of a creature of habit. He does have a tendency the play golf on Sundays when he's in town. And the question that no one's able to answer yet, and hopefully, will be answered, is this person, the alleged assassin, appeared to have been from out-of-state. How did he drive down there? How did he case the joint? How do you know when the former president would be there and come within his potential line of sight. Just a whole load of questions.

But at the FBI with the lead, we're going to -- we're going to get answers to these.There's lots of different questions after Butler. Clearly, Butler, he was much closer. But there's a lots of questions as to how did he get this intelligence? How did he know that the president was there? How did he know that, not only was the president at the golf course, but where he was on the golf course? He was positioned in those bushes. How long was he positioned in those bushes? At what point did he do advanced work on this? A lot of these questions, but fortunately, for the FBI Miami division, they have a lot of electronic evidence. This individual clearly had a tremendous electronic presence. Social media, he was online a lot. He was over in Ukraine. He was traveling there. So, a lot of these -- this digital evidence is going to be collected along with what the SAC of Miami was asking for, was the community providing any video evidence, any you know, closed-circuit TV from stores that are across the street from the day before. Was that vehicle seen there? So, all this evidence is going to be collected together, and a timeline, a pathway to violence will be determined. And to find where did this pathway start? Where did it diverge from his travels in Ukraine to where he is now to figure out why did he -- what was his motivation? But the FBI will be leading that investigation and find out these things.",

I mean, as is so often the case, this is not his first run-in with law enforcement. A number of arrests, but this one in 2002, I just want to draw attention to. Barricaded himself into a business, had a firearm, but also was charged with carrying a fully automatic machine gun.

Along with the scope, every single piece, where did he get the ammunition? Where did he train? Did he practice with this weapon? So a lot of these things is -- it needs to be determined. And ATF working with the FBI, getting that information, fortunately, I'm sure they have the serial number already. I'm sure they already have where it was purchased, where it was sold. And getting this information, the fact that he has the 2002 arrest for, you know, having a barricaded situation and having that firearm back then, it is alarming. That needs to be looked at, as -- as to how he was able to get a new firearm. So, many years later, the anticipation of the event. He prepared for this, and that's what we're all going to look at now. There's going to have to be answers. But when the most important things is not going to be quick, it's not going to have answers tomorrow morning. The FBI needs to conduct their investigation. Just as Butler did, it didn't happen overnight. It's going to take some time to gather all this evidence and properly analyze it correctly and so we have information the first time correctly. SCIUTTO: Daniel Brunner, thanks so much for helping us understand. I'm joined now by CNN presidential historian Tim Naftali. And Tim, historically, we're talking about this last hour. There have been violent periods before in our nation's political history and were in the midst of another one, again. One difference, right, is that so many participants right now, very public participants in the political discourse deliberately do not condemn violence, right? I mean, you had very quick statements tonight from President Biden, Vice President Harris explicitly condemning all political violence. But the fact is our discourse that -- in our discourse, that is not a universal principle at this point, I guess; some that seem to openly encourage it.",

And I'm thinking the year 1968 and times around that and other difficult times. What got us out of that period -- of a period like that? What -- what were the elements?

We saw it again in 1972 when George Wallace was nearly killed by an assassin. In 1968, at a time of great political tension, Republicans and Democrats together voted for another Civil Rights Bill, one which desegregated federal housing. The housing bill. It was possible, even in '68, to reach across the aisle and reach an agreement. So, we have in the past, our leaders, our elected leaders have shown that they can rise above partisanship when the country seems on the edge of extremism. And the question today is, are we capable of it again? When so many it appears, or at least two this summer, have sought to deprive us of the vote by using their weapons against one choice by one major party.",

Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach presents its own set of unique challenges. The course sits along three heavily trafficked roads, and Palm Beach International Airport is nearby, as well.

Now, the question that -- the follow-up question is going to be -- and the Secret Service will need to address this -- is how was the outer perimeter, how was this shooter able to get to that outer perimeter, an area that, you know, should have been identified as a vulnerability previously? Again, if you are able to get line of sight from the fence line into the golf course where the former president is, in this threat environment, that needs lets to be addressed fully. [00:55:00] And as you may remember back in 2017, there was a -- you know, a CNN crew that was actually filming the then-president of the United States, you know, golfing with a clear line of sight that -- that was blocked or mitigated by a box truck. But -- so the thought that you have seen inside the golf course from the exterior, this isn't the first time this has happened. So, there are some questions that the Secret Service will have to answer for that. But at the end of the day, the protective model that surrounds the president worked. You know, we saw that happen. And more to the point, the communication, the immediate notification by the agent that, you know, shots were fired, that there was a suspect, that communication was immediately picked up by local law enforcement who were able to carry forward the -- the immediate action of, you know, setting up a perimeter around the golf course, and then getting the witness to identify exactly the vehicle, the tag number, and bringing a successful resolution to the immediate threat.
