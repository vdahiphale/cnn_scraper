We have brand new reporting on a phone call from Trump that prompted Gaetz to withdraw.Also breaking, Trump's controversial pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, tries to shore up his support up on Capitol Hill while being hit with a new bombshell, a newly released police report revealing graphic details about a 2017 sexual assault allegation against Hegseth. Plus, an exclusive interview with the embattled New York City mayor, Eric Adams. He joins us with his newly appointed police commissioner to discuss crime and immigration. I'll also ask him about his own historic criminal indictment and whether he's hoping to be pardoned by the incoming president. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get right to the breaking news on the implosion of Donald Trump's choice of Matt Gaetz to be the U.S. attorney general. CNN's Paula Reid is standing by with exclusive new reporting on the sexual misconduct allegations against Gaetz. But, first, let's go to CNN's Kristen Holmes. She's in West Palm Beach, Florida. Kristen, you have new reporting about when Trump and Gaetz last spoke.",

We are told by a source that with direct knowledge of the call that Donald Trump called Matt Gaetz this morning and told him that he did not believe that he had the votes in the Senate to get confirmed.Now, this source did insist that Trump did not pressure Gaetz to drop out, that he did not insist that he drop out, but instead that he let Gaetz come to that conclusion on his own. Now, one thing just to note here, Wolf, as we have been reporting, Donald Trump has spent an enormous amount of time calling some of these Republican senators directly, trying to lobby for Matt Gaetz. He had said that Gaetz was his most important pick, attorney general, being the most important pick to Donald Trump in his administration and one that he wanted to push through. Now, there had been conversations among Trump allies about how much political capital Donald Trump was willing to use on Matt Gaetz and how that would affect other nominees, particularly those that are more controversial. But, again, they are saying he did not push him out, but this call was to inform Gaetz that he did not believe that he had the votes. Now, one other thing I want to mention here, we were told by a number of Trump's allies that there was concern, there was more in that ethics report that had not yet come out, and that that was going to hurt Matt Gaetz, hurt the process, and that it was going to be impossible to get him confirmed. Among the things that we were told there was concern over was that there was a belief there were new witnesses that were interviewed by the committee, and that information was going to come out that was previously known.

He thought they were too stiff. He wanted someone who was a bomb thrower, and that is how he got to Matt Gaetz, essentially saying that he would put someone more straight-laced, like his lawyer, Todd Blanche, which he ended up doing in the deputy attorney general position, but that he wanted somebody who could go out and be a messenger. So, now, whether or not he continues down that path or goes a more traditional route, we will wait and see.

Like there was early reporting that he wasn't even getting it -- that there was 30 Republican senators already against him right out the gate. So, he was already on the back foot.I think that, you know, for the Republican senators, they're institutionalists. They want to exert their power and show that they want to work with the Trump administration on these nominees, but also that they have a really important role to advice and consent. And I think behind closed doors, you saw this exercise very much this week with the Matt Gaetz nomination. The Trump team, I hope, takes away from this that they should probably engage the senators early on and do gut checks with them to make sure that their nominees going forward can pass muster unless you buy into the conspiracy theories, of course, that this was all a crazy genius play to, you know, manipulate the nomination process and take away media attention from some of the other nominees.",

This is not a Trump enterprise like the stakes or that bogus university.

But I am one of those that believe that Gaetz was a scapegoat. I think that he was put up to really make those who are more dangerous, like Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard, more palpable to those Republican senators. So, again, I think it is a good day for America.

So, then he ended up with a cabinet of people he didn't trust and he didn't believe was fully executing his vision.DOJ in particular is a position in which he wants someone who is fully aligned on his belief that we need to root out the corruption of the FBI, that we need to shake things up. And he wants a bomb thrower that -- you just saw that in the reporting. I believe that his next nominee will also be a bomb thrower. I don't think he's going to back off of this at all.

I would hope, though, that he reevaluates going into the new Congress.He's made a lot of enemies.

It was taking Pennsylvania a while to get through all of the vote counting, provisional ballots as well, and we saw the margin shrink.Now, it was so large of a margin that we never thought really that he was going to have a chance of overtaking McCormick here, but it went just from a week ago, a 30,000-vote margin for Dave McCormick, and now it's between 13,000 and 14,000, as more and more of these provisional ballots got counted. What was clear to Bob Casey, there was no path there to actually overtake Dave McCormick. It was also within the state mandated 0.5 percent margin that triggered an automatic recount. And that is what the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was doing right now. Bob Casey says, no longer needed to do anything further here. I'm out of the race. Dave McCormick is the winner. And that gives incoming majority leader John Thune a 53-person majority. Now you and I just saw the Gaetz story today, right? No votes were taken, but it was clear that well more than four Republicans were opposed to the Gaetz nomination. The math wasn't there.
