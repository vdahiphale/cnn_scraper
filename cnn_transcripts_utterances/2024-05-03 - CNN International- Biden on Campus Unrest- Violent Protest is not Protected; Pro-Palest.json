If you're just joining us, here are some of today's top stories.A senior member of Hamas says the group is studying the latest hostage and ceasefire proposal, quote, with positive spirit. Ismail Haniyeh spoke with Egyptian and Qatari officials on Thursday. Hamas says it plans to send a delegation to Egypt as soon as possible to continue ceasefire talks. Plus, universities across the U.S. have been calling for stronger police presence to deal with pro-Palestinian protesters and their encampments. Police have now arrested more than 2,000 demonstrators over the past few weeks on at least 40 college campuses in at least 24 states. Meanwhile, the U.S. president is warning university students across the country that, quote, violent protest is not protected. He was making his first extensive remarks about the latest campus unrest. Now, some young voters have been souring on Joe Biden's ongoing support for Israel, and Republicans had slammed his relative silence over the growing pro-Palestinian encampments. CNN's Kayla Tausche reports from the White House. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And President Biden has said he has no plans to change his policy as it relates to the Middle East. The White House has said that it has high hopes that Secretary Blinken can secure a deal in the region to usher in a ceasefire and free dozens of hostages. Of course, that is something that has been in the works for quite some time. And the White House says both the U.S. government and the protesters want the same thing, and that is to end the war.

Jewish groups at the University of Sydney held a counter-protest today, and both sides remained peaceful.From marching against the Vietnam War to fighting South Africa's racist apartheid system, college campuses have long been the harbinger of social and policy change in the U.S. and abroad, but observers are asking if the current campus protests will affect what's happening in Gaza. CNN's Brian Todd takes a closer look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): 1968, student protesters at New York's Columbia University take over several buildings and briefly even take the dean hostage. One of the buildings they seized, Hamilton Hall, which students occupied during recent protests at Columbia.",

While skirmishes have broken out at UCLA and some other campuses during the current demonstrations, these protests have been, for the most part, peaceful. In the Vietnam era, violence broke out routinely and on many campuses, students often brawling with police.",

That tended to increase the sympathy for protesters, build the size of protests, and also increase the voice of more extreme activists.TODD (voice-over): In two horrific episodes, the Vietnam era violence turned deadly. In May 1970, on the campus of Kent State University, Ohio National Guard troops opened fire on student protesters, killing four of them and injuring several others. Days later, during racial injustice protests at Jackson State College in Mississippi, police fired at a dormitory, killing two students and injuring a dozen others. Possibly a closer comparison to what's going on now took place in the 1980s, when students across America protested against apartheid in South Africa. They called on schools to divest themselves from companies and groups that supported the apartheid regime in South Africa, much like students are now calling on colleges to divest themselves from Israeli-linked companies. Really, when we talk about boycott, divestment, and sanction, that's what it was. We are going to use non-violent, peaceful resistance.",

The protests of the Vietnam era prompted colleges and much of the country to change their collective view of the Vietnam War. The protests of the 80s led colleges to divest themselves from doing business with South Africa, and the U.S. government later followed suit.Right now, it's not clear if the current protests will change anything regarding the Israel-Hamas war or the U.S. government's handling of it.

One challenge, though, that China faces compared to the United States, and it's one reason why some people may say the United States has an edge, is because of the strong commercial space program in the United States from people such as Elon Musk.But China has really built this program from the ground up. It is having success and is getting attention from other nations by its fast and aggressive pace. But still, if we look at the global landscape, a lot of people are going to point to the United States as having the upper hand.

But the Chinese government has made it very clear that their goal is to get a man on the moon sometime in 2030.And it's not a message that we are hearing here for the first time. When we were attending the previous space launch with the three astronauts to the space station, it was brought up again. So this is a national priority for China. And, you know, there's no question it gives bragging rights to the rest of the world, but also can uplift the spirit of citizens, especially at a time when China is dealing with a lot of obstacles, especially economic ones -- Kim.",
