Today does a deal as a House Democrat says exchange Ukrainian lives for asylum seekers' lives. A member of the Hispanic Caucus and House Homeland Security Committee who says she is a hell no on what the White House is considering is with us. Plus, she calls it supporting Palestinian rights. A middle school teacher is being kept out of the classroom over an email signature that included a controversial phrase. That teacher is here to explain her intent and her discrimination complaint.Plus a 10-year-old boy arrested for relieving himself in public when he couldn't find a bathroom. You'll hear from the boy and his mother who say this went too far. I'm Victor Blackwell. Let's start the show. A growing number of immigration advocates and Democrats are furious over concessions that President Biden is considering to secure aid for Ukraine. And the White House's urgency to get that money has put Democrats in an uncomfortable position. They may have to support policies they once criticized when proposed by former President Trump. Now some of the policies considered raising the credible fear standard for asylum seekers, increasing deportations, and expanding detentions. The changes would be significant, in some ways divisive. Still, some Democrats say they support the concessions. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. HENRY CUELLAR (D-TX): If you look at the people that come in, they get in. And then at the end of four or five, six years when they go in front of an immigration judge, almost 90% of them're going to be rejected. So why are the taxpayers paying for all this time? And then at the same time, it's not fair to give these people false hope. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Congresswoman Delia Ramirez of Illinois is one of those vowing to vote no. She's a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and on the House Homeland Security Committee.Congresswoman, good to have you. I mean, the Republicans have the numbers in the House. So I just wonder how much this would cause a problem within the party. You say you're a held on what's being discussed? Are you uh, no on all policy proposals out of the HR to Republican border bill? REP. DELIA RAMIREZ (D-IL): I serve in Homeland Security. And I actually was in that markup for 17 hours. I know the bill pretty well. Most of that will take us back to the draconian policies. I mean, you're talking about HR to what the House members want the House Republicans, they want to retaliate against any organization that were served on migrants under any program. I mean, that's how extreme HR-2 is. That means if Catholic Charities happens to help or the Red Cross during FEMA during a major catastrophe, and then all of a sudden they serve or they feed or they shelter a migrant family during that moment, they were slashed the funds for that organization. That's how extremely charged to is, in addition to everything you've heard, mass deportations, reinstating family detention, the list goes on. I mean, it's deplorable. And the fact that we haven't had immigration policy over three decades, I was just a little girl. And when we had the very first I gave my parents citizenship, and now we're not going to actually resolve the immigration problem. We're going to go back and make it even harder and increase the number of people who are coming illegally because we're not creating legal pathways. We're creating these horrible draconian policies that will make it impossible for people to seek asylum.",
