      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, cruel, flawed of betrayal. That's how some progressive members of Joe Biden's own party are describing his sweeping new restrictions. Now in effect at the southern border. Moderate Democrats under the same political pressure as Biden say it had to be done. Will the president's attempt to deal with a massive political liability, help him in November?Plus, emotional and deeply personal testimony. Hunter Biden's ex-wife is on the stand right now, detailing the first son's struggles with addiction. We're going to bring you the latest from inside the courtroom. And where should the president eat a cheese steak and other issues are very important in Pennsylvania politics. Senator John Fetterman is here to talk about what Biden needs to do to win that crucial swing state once again. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First step, Biden's border gambit. As of midnight, those who unlawfully crossed the southern border will be barred from seeking asylum in the United States. It is the most aggressive action that president has taken to address a years' long surge of migrants at the border. CNN's Rosa Flores is in Hidalgo, Texas. Rosa, what are you seeing now that this has taken effect?",

      "sentences": "Dana, I want to start from the top because this border stuff can be so confusing. I'm at Hidalgo, Texas. I want you to look behind me because this is the international bridge that leads to Reynosa Mexico. First of all, this executive order does not impact international trade. It does not impact commerce. That's why you still see this free flow of traffic into Mexico at a port of entry.Now, migrants who crossed the border illegally, that's the impact of this executive order. If they do not express fear, then they will be swiftly removed back to Mexico or to their country of origin, depending on their demographics. Now, what does that look like? We shot some video earlier today. And I want us to roll this video because this shows you what this would look like at the border. You see a white bus. Now this is a government bus and normally transports migrants around in this area. Now you see that government bus, drive into the port of entry. And then you're going to see border patrol agents that are escorting migrants back into Mexico. They're literally walking them to the international bridge and walking them back to Mexico. Now we don't know if what you just saw are the first signs that this executive order is actually in effect because we've seen this before. That is what we've seen in the title 42 era, for example, when there's very swift removals. What we do know from a source is that we would expect to see more of that happen very quickly. Migrants being very quickly returned either swiftly to Mexico or we would see more deportation flights to other countries to return them back. Now, there's important nuance here because Customs and Border Protection will still be fingerprinting these migrants. They will still be doing background checks to see if there's national security risks. And if migrants do express fear, then there will be credible fear interviews that will be conducted either at Customs and Border Protection or ICE facilities. But the standard, Dana, that migrants will have to meet to seek asylum will be a lot higher. So, the probability that those migrants will be returned, just like you saw in that video moments ago is a lot higher. Now, I know we're almost out of time, but I have to add this. When this executive order is not in effect, that doesn't mean that the laws are not going to be applied. This, Dana, is simply and the easiest way for me to explain it. Is border security on steroids? Everything just happens a lot faster. Dana, back to you.",

CNN's Isaac Dovere, Nia-Malika Henderson of Bloomberg and CNN, and Hans Nichols of Axios. Hello, everybody. Happy Hump Day.Let's kind of take a step back on the politics of this. I mean, obviously, I just laid out the very deep rub in and among Democrats on this issue. But the question that we genuinely don't know the answer too and it is the gamble that President Biden is making, is that this is going to help to soften the very big political problem that he has on the issue of immigration. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, listen, it gives Democrats a talking point, right? Ruben Gallego, for instance, who wants to be a senator in Arizona. He welcomed this because they are now seeing that the politics around immigration have moved to the right, which Democrats who go to vote for Democrats. They have a problem with the scenes from the southern border. So now they're able to say, President Biden is doing something on this. And look at what Donald Trump did and look at what Republicans who are in Congress now, they rejected an even more comprehensive approach to securing the border. So, I think the politics of this are great for Biden in the sense that you have progressives hammering him. So, he does now look like sort of the moderate in the centrist, which I think most Americans want a sort of pragmatic solution.",

That you have a situation here, where -- look I was at the White House yesterday when the president announced this and afterwards saw some of the reactions that were coming from all those people who stood with him.And they said, people like Tom Suozzi, won that special election. A lot of it on the immigration issue he said, this is not what we wanted to happen. What we wanted was that bipartisan deal in Congress. He said -- I mean sort of funny. He said, you know, we all joke about how Joe Biden is a creature of the Senate, nobody wanted a legislative deal more than Joe Biden, whether or not that's true. We can debate but it is definitely the case that there was movement toward a bipartisan deal that was stopped in its tracks by Donald Trump saying to Republicans, he didn't want it to happen. And so, what Joe Biden does get to do here is take -- it's not just saying something he's done something now, and we'll see if it has the effect that he wanted to have. But it does something, it puts a direct contrast to Donald Trump. And it is absolutely in the context of the run up to the debate at the end of the month.",

This executive order is going to test the proposition on whether or not you can unilaterally shut down the border without actually having any funds. When you look at the mechanics of what's going to happen on the border. People are going to come in, they're going to apply for asylum.Once we hit this trigger, they're no longer -- they can be turned away quickly. But at a certain point, you have to listen to these people and their claims. And that requires agents, people on the ground. So, I mean, by the White House's own math, when they initially requested, they asked for 13 billion. I think in the ultimate Senate package, it was 20 billion. It's a lot of money. And there's a real recognition across all parties to solve this. You need the funds and Biden still doesn't have it. So yes, to Nia's point he has a talking point. He has a counter. I'd also sort of suggest that any day that the country is talking about immigration is probably a day Republicans like as opposed to Donald Trump's court challenges or any other host of issues.

And for that group to be effective, it's a volunteer grassroots group. They have to have their volunteers motivated and they have to have their volunteers ready to talk to their friends and make the case for Joe Biden. And what the group is saying now, nothing is final. They can come out and give a full-throated decision. And in all these decisions, it's always a question of the alternative, like Sunrise is not going to endorse Donald Trump. I think we can be pretty careful on that. Just pretty clear in that -- just how apathetic they're going to be.

First Abbe Lowell was arguing that Hunter Biden didn't knowingly lie on the form because he thought -- when he was asked, are you using drugs? That meant right now. That is, you know, it's like Clinton's is -- are you right now stoned, and they can't prove that he was. And number two, that as addicted as he may have been, like many addicts, he didn't identify as a drug addict. He resisted internalizing his addiction until, you know, he went for rehab and treatment and finally came clean. So, I think it's a good defense. I just don't know what's going to work.",
