The closing arguments that play out in the hours ahead will be the last word from lawyers on both sides before jurors decide if Mr. Trump becomes the first ever former president convicted of a crime.Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass will today try to weave together weeks of testimony and evidence to make the case that Mr. Trump was involved in a criminal conspiracy and falsified business records, arguing that he sought to cover up his alleged affair with Stormy Daniels and her hush money payment in an illegal attempt to help his 2016 presidential campaign. But first up, the defense gets to give its summation in accordance with New York state law. And we're told that Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, will zero in on the prosecution's star witness, Michael Cohen, taking aim at Cohen's credibility, as he tries to convince jurors there is sufficient reasonable doubt to acquit Donald J. Trump. CNN's team of reporters and producers inside the courthouse are going to bring you constant updates on these closing arguments, capturing all the drama as it unfolds.

They're telling the same story, just different versions of it. And Donald Trump's culpability and closeness and proximity to all of it. And so that's really what they're bracing for today.They are a little bit concerned, and as I believe the prosecution is as well, that the jury's just had a week off and they need to be reminded of a lot of what they heard over those six weeks of evidence and witnesses that were coming before them. One thing I will say about how all of this is going to go down and what I've heard about the order of this is Donald Trump is frustrated and he learned in recent days that the last word that the jury hears will be from the prosecution, not from the defense team, because unlike the opening statements where the prosecution went first, laid out its case, and then Trump's attorneys made their argument to the jury.

But I do think there's a little concern from they've forgotten key pieces of this. So, they're going to be trying to remind them of the most dramatic moments. Michael Cohen getting caught when he was talking about the 14-year-old prank caller. Small moments like that.

He's been questioned by past prosecutors in the DA's office when they were investigating Michael Cohen on this, and he said he couldn't remember Trump's involvement - or he didn't recall Trump's involvement in this at all.

And they used much less polite language to describe that.And, you know, I'll be honest, for the lawyers at the table, one of the thing that - things that fascinates me the most about this is the idea of peer pressure in a jury and what it takes to actually get to a hung jury, which I think especially the Trump team, certainly when I talked to his allies, they talk about that as something that could, you know, could happen to him, potentially could save him from this. But I was talking to another source who basically said, it takes a lot of guts - again, a less polite word used - to be the one juror that, like, in a room with your peers objects to it all.

We are standing by for the crucial closing arguments that could sway jurors one way or another. The defense will go first. It all begins just minutes from now.Welcome back to our continuing coverage. I want to turn to criminal defense attorney Ron Kuby. Ron, appreciate you joining us this morning. How important, in your experience, are closing arguments? I mean, do they really make or break a case?",

During summation, Todd Blanche, who will be appealing, not to an audience of 12 plus alternatives, but to an audience of one, can call Michael Cohen a liar and a crook and a grifter and a cheat, a boot-licking lackey, whatever he wants. And so he's going to spend a lot of time doing that because that's really what his client wants. And that can be effective.Unfortunately, there were very few holes made in the actual story that Michael Cohen was telling. It was corroborated. It was uncontracted. And it sounds plausible. You know, Keith Schiller and Weisselberg, the jury can hear from both the defense and prosecution. And both of them say the same thing, if they were going to be good for x, x would have called them. If Keith Schiller was going to support Trump, Trump would have called him. And the defense, likewise. I don't think they'll be a factor. The jury doesn't know who these people are. They don't know that they're - whether they're in jail or they've had a stroke or anything like that. So, I don't think what the defense says about them will be an issue. Certainly the jury is going to wonder, I think, that given the fact that Keith Schiller was in the room, Donald Trump didn't testify. Michael Cohen gave one version, whereas Keith Schiller, and they may wonder about Weisselberg as well. But again, you have his notes and memos and other things.",

We would look for the hidden words or the rabbits in the picture and sort of circle all of those and show the jury that there are so many separate, reasonable doubts here they cannot find Donald Trump guilty.",
