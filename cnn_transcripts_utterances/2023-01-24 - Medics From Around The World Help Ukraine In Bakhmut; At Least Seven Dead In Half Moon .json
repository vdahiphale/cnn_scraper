Authorities want to intimidate ordinary people, she said, they want to turn people into emotionless machines. We can't even gather together to grieve. Police swiftly crackdown on the protesters in some cities violently pushing and dragging the demonstrators but the Beijing protesters peacefully dispersed. Afterwards, police blanketed protest sites. In some places, authorities check cell phones for virtual private networks and track down participants with cell phone data. Soon after, China dropped its zero COVID policy and opened up. In his New Year's Eve address, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said it was \"only natural for different people to have different concerns or hold different views on the same issue\".

In her final words in the video message, she made this call for help. Don't let us be taken away or convicted arbitrarily. Don't let us disappear from this world unjustly. WANG (on camera): CNN has asked Beijing authorities for comment on the young woman you saw there along with the other detentions but we have not heard back. We've learned she's one of eight people who have been quietly detained after the protests. People who know these women tell us they were confused as to why they were taken, describing them as young female professionals working in publishing, journalism and education, saying they are socially minded but not dissidents or organizers. Experts say the police may have been suspicious of young politically aware women.

Current and former U.S. officials say the campaign was likely a warning to European governments, which have supported Ukraine since Russia's invasion began. They expect Russia will continue to look for proxy groups to drive up fear of possible terror attacks. CNN has obtained Ukrainian military documents that outlines the unique threat posed by the Russian mercenary group, Wagner. It vividly describes the brutality of the private military force, and explains how effective its methods have been in Eastern Ukraine. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more on this.
