Trump, now mulling over who to choose for high powered spots in his administration. CNN learning the first announcements could come within days. And unlike the start of his first presidency, when Trump chose many career diplomats to guide him into what was then uncharted political territory for him, the new White House is expected to be full of Trump loyalists, less likely to challenge any of what are, to many, his controversial decisions. Were all backed by a Republican controlled Senate and likely a Republican controlled House. It looks like this could be the full sweep for Trump and the Republican Party. In his analysis online, CNN Politics senior reporter and good friend of this show, Stephen Collinson writes, \"Donald Trump believes presidents have almost absolute power. In his second term, there will be few political or legal restraints to check him.\" Stephen Collinson joins me now from Washington. What will be the consequence of that?",

Even if there's a Democratic house, which seems quite unlikely, as votes are still counted, what are they going to do? Are they going to impeach him again? He's already been impeached twice, which is the constitutional remedy for an overreach by a president and a step into beyond the bounds of law. Trump has been impeached twice. It didn't do anything to him. It didn't stop him coming back to power. So that is one area where Trump will be able to act pretty much how he likes. We recently had a Supreme Court ruling, granting the president quite a lot of immunity legally for official acts committed while they are in office. This arose out of Trump's election meddling case, which also is now going to go away. So Trump has extreme constitutional and legal latitude here. He's expanded the Office of the Presidency, which was already very powerful. And it's very difficult to see, in the next four years, armed now with a big mandate from the American people, how he could be reined in in any way.",

Since then, of course, we have had the conflict roiling since the terror attack on Israel back on October the 7th. Two wars raging in region, one on Gaza, one in Lebanon; attacks between Israel and Iran and a Gulf which, frankly, is getting extremely tired with conflict, wants to see de-escalation, economic integration and to move on from this cycle of containment. So what is Donald Trump's policy on the Middle East? Can you be clear at this point? All we've heard at this point is there won't be any wars. There will be peace in the Middle East.

When president Trump came into office,you had a terrorist caliphate in the heart of the Middle East. You had our Gulf partners feeling betrayed by the Iran nuclear deal. And you had increased attacks by Iranian proxies. President Trump came to the Middle East in Riyadh at that Arab Muslim summit; 55 nations were there. And he laid out a very coherent strategy for how we are going to focus on shared interests. We're going to combat ideologies that are killing not only American troops in the region but also citizens of Arab and Muslim nations. And we're going to do that in a spirit of friendship and partnership. And so, over the course of those four years, he executed against that strategy, defeated ISIS, put Iran in a political and financial crisis, deepened his ties with Israel, deepened his ties with our Gulf partners, got out of the Iran nuclear deal and did four peace treaties in five months. I would be very happy to put president Trump's record in the Middle East against any other president.",

And if the United States, working with our Gulfpartners in Israel are not able to deter Iran and its proxies, you have war and violence and bloodshed in the Middle East. And if you take a policy of appeasement and accommodation with Iran and increase the daylight between America's partners, calling countries pariahs and lecturing them on how they're supposed to live, you lose deterrence. And if nobody believes that you have a credible threat of military force, then you're going to lose deterrence. And so I think president Trump, as he demonstrated during the four years of his first term, weakened Iran economically and militarily and weakened its proxies. And he deepened his alliances with Israel and Gulf partners. And if you do that, it's a winning formula. If you do the opposite, which is the policy of the Biden administration, you have the Middle East that you just accurately described, Becky.",

I remember president Trump said in Riyadh, it's not the role of the United States to tell other people how to live and to lecture them and to impose our way of life on them.

So this is something which president Trump cares deeply about. He loves the Middle East, loves the people of the Middle East and very much thinks that there's so many overlapping interests. And I think that if you're interested in pursuing the kind of things that the president wants to -- and I know the leaders in the region, there's so much overlapping interest -- we can get a lot done.

But there are many Democrats who are placing the blame for the loss in this election squarely at President Biden's feet. There is some frustration from some in the party with the fact that Biden decided to run for a second term at all, announcing that reelection bid when he was 80 years old, at a time when polling had shown that Americans disapproved of his time in office and also had questions real concerns about his age. And then there was the fact that, when he finally did bow out of the race after that halting debate performance against Trump, that he did so, leaving with the incoming nominee with just over 100 days to run this campaign. Now, of course, there is the view within Biden world that this is not just the president's fault, that there is other factors at play. But there is also concern about some of the policies that had been enacted and the messaging around that as inflation and the economy continue to top Americans' concerns heading into this election. One big question heading into President Biden's upcoming speech is whether he will try to address any of -- any of that, of what exactly went wrong for Democrats in this election. Advisers say that he is expected to talk about the results of the election, trying to bring the country forward but also focusing on that transition period. His advisers have said President Biden remains committed to ensuring that there is a peaceful transfer of power, something that was not afforded to him by former president Donald Trump back in 2020. So they want to make sure that they are moving forward with that. Biden has called Trump to congratulate him and invite him here to the White House, a meeting that sources say could happen as soon as next week. But there will be a lot of questions facing not just the Democratic Party but also President Biden about the path forward for Democrats. And he right now is facing the very real reality that his legacy could very well be shaped by this election.

That came after Hezbollah said it fired a barrage of rockets at Israel; 40 people were killed in strikes in Lebanon's Baalbek region on Wednesday.

Ali, let me bring you in here because, during Trump's first presidency, of course, he significantly intensified pressure on Iran, which experts say increased its isolation and crippled its economy. The Iranian foreign minister said today that the U.S. election provides -- and I quote him here -- \"opportunities for revisiting and reconsidering unjust and ill-suited approaches.\" You might say, he would say that, wouldn't he? What's the sense in Tehran, is it clear? I mean, how much concern is there about what happens next? ALI VAEZ, CRISIS GROUP'S IRAN PROJECT:  Becky, it's great to see you and be here with Firas. Look, the reality is that Iranians are in a particularly vulnerable position on the one hand. Iran obviously has witnessed a series of upheavals in the past few years and the regime's legitimacy, I think, is at its lowest point in decades. And that, to many people in the Trump administration, who have been dreaming of regime change in Iran, is a very attractive prospect for doubling down on a pressure centric policy toward the Iranian regime. Iran economically is in more trouble than it was when president Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran in 2018. And Iran in the region is weaker than ever because Hezbollah is on its knees and Hamas is -- has been significantly degraded. But on the other hand, in 2018, when Trump withdrew from the deal, Iran had basically -- Iran's nuclear program was rolled back and put in a box and under very heavy monitoring. And as a result of Trump's withdrawal from that deal, that program was put in a microwave (ph). And Iran is now closer than ever to the verge of nuclear weapons. And so it has more leverage. And we have to see what kind of balance we will end up in the Trump administration as Firas said in terms of personnel. But I fear that president Trump is too wrapped in a anti-Islamic Republic ecosystem to be able to side with those who are advocating for de-escalation, deal making.",

Benjamin Netanyahu, of course, was quick to congratulate Donald Trump on his election win, who, as we know, has stated he wants the war in Gaza to be over. Something that might thrust Netanyahu's legal cases back into the limelight. How will Donald Trump deal with this relationship with the Israeli prime minister?

And that is exactly what was quietly happening behind the scenes, both among Trump allies and some in the private sector. The private sector, because the federal government often relies on contractors to help manage and build these facilities. And so they have been quietly preparing, with discussing what the possibility of this could look like. And now sources tell me they are expecting that to ramp up. Now, a key component of any type of mass deportation plan is going to be detention space, because whoever they arrest, they need to put them somewhere. And so the federal government has, over the last several years, been quite limited in how much detention space they have. Only tens of thousands. But still far less than where many in the incoming Trump administration would want that number to be. Now even so, even contractors are lined up and there are some who are. Money is going to be critical to this. This is going to be an expensive operation. Previous analysis has shown that it costs nearly $11,000 just to arrest, detain, process and remove one individual, plus whatever it would cost to fly them out to their home country. So certainly this is an expensive endeavor. Officials say they are preparing for that. Now at the Homeland, the Department of Homeland Security, they -- it has been has been a mixed bag of emotions.
