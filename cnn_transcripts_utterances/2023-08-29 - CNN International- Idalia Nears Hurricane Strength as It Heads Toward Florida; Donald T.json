So first, the Washington, DC, Federal Judge Tanya Chutkan, she has set a trial start date in the special counsel's case of election interference against Trump. The start date will be in just about six months, March 4th, 2024.Now Trump's team, they've warned that that won't be enough time to provide the legal assistance they need to the former president. But the judge has said that Trump has more resources at his disposal than the average criminal defendant, and she believes that the case is streamlined enough for the defense to be ready come March 4th, 2024. So we will see at least one trial early next year. Now meanwhile, the Fulton County, Georgia DA is aiming to start her trial against Trump and his 18 co-defendants. As soon as October. But Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, was on the witness stand already in federal court on Monday trying to argue that his case should be moved out of state court into federal court since he, his argument is, he was acting under his official duties during all of the conduct surrounding January 6th that's been alleged by DA Fanie Willis. So prosecutors actually asked Meadows about his involvement surrounding that date, including the call to the Georgia Secretary of State in early January 2021, when of course, Trump asked to find those extra votes so he could be declared the winner in Georgia. And now it's up to the federal judge in Georgia to decide whether Mark Meadows was in fact acting within his capacity as a federal official. And this is all while Trump's legal calendar is getting increasingly tight and packed. If all holds, he'd see all four of his criminal trials starting sometime between this October and March of 2024. That federal case, set to start just one day before Super Tuesday. Jessica Schneider, CNN Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The important thing to know about Paul Whelan, of course, the background of his case arrested in 2018 in a hotel in Moscow. Charged with espionage by Russian authorities, something of course he denies. Now in prison for that. The U.S. considers him wrongfully detained.

They don't believe that the GOP has uncovered enough evidence yet to directly link Joe Biden to his son's foreign business deals.And I think the White House response to all of this is very telling. I wanna read you part of the statement from Ian Sams. He is a White House spokesperson. He said in a statement: Instead of continuing their extreme far-right political warfare to lie and try to politically damage the President, House Republicans should work with him on the issues that really matter to the American people, like lowering costs and creating jobs, or strengthening healthcare and education. So Democrats, clearly looking to make this a political liability for Republicans. Hoping that they're overplaying their hand. And McCarthy recognizes that, but at the same time, he is under immense pressure to show his right flank, and former President Donald Trump, that he is getting aggressive and moving forward with this effort.
