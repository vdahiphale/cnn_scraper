Well, nationally right now,the price of gas as we`re filming this is $4.30 cents a gallon. Here in California, where we`re filming this it`s even higher. The highest in the country. Right now it`s $5.70 cents a gallon. So what goes in a gallon of gas? Let`s break it down. Here in California, they publish a breakdown of what actually goes in the cost of a gallon of gas. So we`re -- we`re going to focus on them and they use $5.19 cents a gallon for this. So those are the numbers that we`re going to be using. First up, taxes. There`s local, state and federal, and there`s a wide variance in state taxes. The median national excise tax is just over 25 cents a gallon while the lowest is Alaska. It`s 8 cents. But here in California, it`s $0.51 cents a gallon. Those costs go to things like maintaining roads and infrastructure. Then you have other local state taxes and fees that adds on and another $0.13 cents. And then there`s the national gas tax that adds $0.184 cents per gallon. And this number actually hasn`t changed in decades. So across state houses and federal government, people are calling for a gas tax holiday to help keep the price of gas lower. But others are arguing that no, this is too important. A revenue source to come, then it on $0.36 cents for the distribution, marketing and profits of the gas stations. That money goes towards things like rent, wages, utilities, the cost of the pump, insurance, advertising, and then the gas station`s profit. All that in $0.36 cents. Then there`s the cost of refining the gas. That adds $1.12 cents per gallon. That includes refining the gas, also transporting it and the profits for those companies. Then we get to the biggest piece of the pie, the cost of crude oil. Right now that adds $2.87 cents per gallon. Now, this is the largest and most volatile part is what makes up a gallon of gas. When you see the price of gas going up, you can count on the cost of crude oil, having just gone up as well. All of those factors go into what you pay at the pump. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
