I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.A mugshot of the world's number one golfer, being led away in handcuffs after trying to get into his championship tournament, Scottie Scheffler detained and then released on charges, including a felony. We will have all the details. The Israeli military expanding its ground offensive in northern Gaza, targeting the center of Jabalia. We are live in Jerusalem. And a deadly storm rips through the state of Texas, leaving at least four people dead, hundreds of thousands of people without power, and a warning of more to come across the southern U.S. We want to begin with this stunning series of developments involving the world's number one golfer. Scottie Scheffler was arrested by police in Louisville, Kentucky, on his way to the PGA Championship. Now, he has since been released, but does face four charges, including a felony charge of second-degree assault on a police officer. Here is video of the arrest outside the Valhalla Golf Club. Now, Scheffler was handcuffed after driving past a police officer near the scene of a fatal traffic accident that happened earlier. In a statement on Instagram, Scheffler says that it was simply the result of him misunderstanding an officer's instructions. And now, the Masters champion is back in the game. He teed off just a short time ago for his second round, as the crowd cheered him on. Let's get straight to CNN's Andy Scholes for the latest on this. Really rapidly evolving story. Andy, this all happened within a few hours. What's the latest here?",

And the latest news is really that nothing can rattle Scottie Scheffler despite everything that happened this morning. Scheffler, he made his tee time. He birdied the first hole. He birdied the third hole. He did have a bogey on two. But, just amazing that he is out there golfing and then doing well.And Rahel, I'll walk you through what happened just in the past six hours. At about 5 a.m., there was a fatal accident involving a pedestrian that created a massive traffic problem. Then at about 6, Scottie Scheffler, he was trying to navigate his way through that traffic and then was detained by police after trying to go around it. At about 7:30, he was booked into a Louisville jail, and 8:40 Scheffler was released. About 30 minutes later, he arrived at Valhalla Golf Club. Then at 10:08, he teed off for his second round. And here are the charges Scheffler is now facing, second-degree assault of a police officer, which is a felony, third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving, disregarding traffic signals from an officer. Now, Scheffler, he released a statement before he teed off, saying I was proceeding as directed by police officers. It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so considering the tragic accident that occurred earlier. And there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do. I never intended to disregard any of the instructions. I'm hopeful to put this to the side and focus on golf today. Of course, all of this, all of us involved in the tournament express our deepest sympathies to the family of the man who passed away in the earlier accident this morning. That -- it truly puts everything in perspective. But, Rahel. I mean, just what a series of events, and the fact that Scottie Scheffler is out there playing right now and doing well is just remarkable.",

We're going to have more on this story later in the show.But, in the meantime, we want to turn our attention to the Middle East. The Israeli military there expanding its ground offensive in northern Gaza, targeting the city of just the center of Jabalia. Now, here you can see the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike on the Jabalia refugee camp. The IDF says that, over the past week, they killed more than -- they killed 60 more Hamas militants. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, at least 31 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in just over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, officials at one hospital say that since fighting ramped up in the north, they have received over 100 dead bodies. Meantime, some critically needed assistance is now moving into Gaza after arriving on a floating pier built by the U.S. military. Now, even with the pier now operational, the White House still stressing that more aid is needed. Let's bring in Jeremy Diamond, who is live in Jerusalem. So, Jeremy, give us a sense, now that this pier is operational and you and I have spoken for months now about this, how much more aid will be able to enter Gaza through this pier?",

We're told that this began today around 9 a.m. this morning, local time, according to the U.S. military. This is one ship that is being unloaded today. And then, once it gets to the shoreline, it's the World Food Programme that's going to be responsible, we're told, for offloading and then distributing the aid.Now, in terms of your question and the amount of aid that we could see flow through this new floating pier, the U.S. military has said that they hope to get about 500 tons of humanitarian aid per day, that's about 90 trucks a day, via this floating pier, but they hope to ramp that up even further to about 150 trucks per day. And all of this is coming, of course, at a critical time. Even as humanitarian aid officials say that land routes are the best way, this is nonetheless going to provide additional humanitarian aid to Gaza at a time when the Rafah border crossing has now been closed for nearly two weeks since the Israeli military moved troops into eastern Rafah, capturing that critical border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, ongoing negotiations between Israel and Egypt to try and reopen that crossing have so far gone nowhere. And so, with that crossing closed, this maritime route is going to provide some additional -- an additional way to get more aid in. But, as I said, nonetheless, humanitarian aid officials say getting those land crossings back open is going to be critical, especially at a time when the Israeli military is intensifying military operations, not only in southern Gaza, but also in northern Gaza. And we're seeing more than a half a million Palestinians currently being displaced from Rafah, alone. Rahel. SOLOMON: And Jeremy, to that point, I mean, tell us what is the latest in terms of this increased military operation, not just in the north, but, as you point out, in the south, in Rafah.",

And we are also watching the Israeli military intensifying its operations in northern Gaza, now saying that Israeli troops are operating in central -- in the central part of the Jabalia refugee camp. That's an area that was a Hamas hotbed early in the war. It was the site of so much of the intense fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas. It was also the sight of so much of the intense bombardment that Israel delivered in those early months in the Jabalia refugee camp.Just overnight, Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza says that 12 Palestinians were killed in these military operations, constant sound of gunfire, as those battles between Hamas and Israel continue.

We saw the two men embrace each other. They said goodbye. They had a hug. Earlier, we saw the two of them sitting together, sipping tea. But, this is much more than just pleasantries, which is an important image to convey. [11:15:00] It was also a chance for these two men to share to the world how they feel about the West and the United States, in particular, viewing the United States as a de-stabilizing force. We heard from the two of them, they released a joint statement toward the end of this visit, a 7,000-word statement covered everything from Taiwan to Gaza. Let me just read a part of it to you because it does summarize how these two world leaders view where they stand in the global landscape. This joint statement says \"Russian and Chinese relations stand the test of rapid changes in the world, demonstrating strength and stability, and are experiencing the best period in their history.\" But, this is an alignment of two nations that goes far beyond words and philosophy. There is an economic relationship, as you mentioned, but there is also a military relationship. These two leaders talked about the importance in the future of holding joint exercises, joint training, as well as joint sea and air patrols. The South China Sea, where I am here in Asia, is a very volatile part of the world. So, it is going to be interesting to see how these two nations perhaps work to patrol this area, or at least establish the barriers. So, what has this mission accomplished? The answer is, yes. The world now knows that Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping share this \"no limits\" friendship between themselves personally and also between the two nations, Rahel.",

They have since been returned to Israel, and the families have been notified.Let me now bring in my colleague Nic Robertson, who joins me now.

So, these three bodies that they've recovered of three young people who were at the Nova Music Festival, who managed to escape the festival, get to a place that they thought would be safe, only to have Hamas come and not take them hostage alive, but kill them and then take their bodies back to Gaza. So, the IDF, the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently under a huge amount of pressure to prioritize that they are trying to recover the hostages, not just go after Hamas leaders in the military operations. So, for the IDF, for the Israeli government, this is a very important message to communicate. This will be a priority. They've been -- they've lost a number of IDF soldiers, five in friendly fire earlier this week. A number of others have been injured as well. There is huge pressure on the government to show that this is worth it, and that they're prioritizing the hostages as well.

But, what Hamas did was lay out a very clear framework for how many hostages released, how many prisoners they wanted to release, the exact timeframe for it. And that really raised in many people's minds in Israel the possibility that this -- that was an achievable deal.And the polling at the beginning of last week, I believe, showed that the majority of people supported a deal to get hostages out, over and above, over and above what the IDF is actually doing on the ground now, which is prosecuting an offensive in Rafah and a major offensive ongoing again in the north of Gaza as well. So, the sense that, given a choice, operation in Rafah where the leadership of Hamas was supposed to be hiding out, an operation there to capture or kill them, versus doing a deal to get the hostages out last week, majority of people wanted the deal on the hostages rather than the Rafah operation.",

There is also an extreme sense of connectedness here in Israel to this issue of the hostages. And one of the reasons for that is in part events like the Nova Music Festival, which brought together not only people who lived close to the Gaza Strip, like those communities where we saw so much of the death and destruction take place on the 7th, Be'eri, Kfar Aza, Netiv HaAsara, those communities.But, the Nova Music Festival brought together Israelis from all across the country, from Tel Aviv, from northern Israel, from the southern part of Israel. And so, the result of that is that so many Israelis now know someone who was either killed on October 7th, or who was taken hostage, and that has certainly contributed to a sense of connectedness, a shared sense of pain and of loss, certainly a sentiment that is being felt once again today.",

You'll recall, Rahel, that in the 2020 cycle, he was on the losing end of a number of primaries, and what turned it around for him, the African American vote in South Carolina. He owes his presidency, I think, to the support that he received among folks of color. Donald Trump, in that cycle, won only eight percent of the black vote, but is now running at about 20 percent.

And some believe it's an actual -- I mean, it is offensive. It's an offensive sort of implication. But, you're right, that it is a part of the conversation. I do want to know, the NAACP President sort of pushed back or dismissed some of the polling. That suggests that Trump is making these inroads with black voters. But, I wonder, Michael, I mean, you're talking to voters, you're talking to viewers every day, should they sort of pay attention to these polls? Is it the right choice to dismiss them as they've been wrong before, they'll be wrong again?",

I think that the Times/Siena College poll that landed earlier in the week and showed that Joe Biden is trailing in each of the battleground states, except one, was a wake-up call for the campaign. And I happen to think that it's the reason that President Biden then sort of laid down the challenge about debates and was able to very quickly conclude a debate deal with Donald Trump.I think they believe they need to right the ship, because, Rahel, voting is going to begin in like three months. This is no longer, hey, what's going to happen in November? As you well know, more and more Americans every cycle vote by mail, and that commences just after Labor Day weekend.",
