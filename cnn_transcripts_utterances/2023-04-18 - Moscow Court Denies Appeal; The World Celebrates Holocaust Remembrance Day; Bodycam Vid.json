Eighty-four-year-old Andrew Lester is facing felony charges now for shooting a black teenager on his doorstep in Kansas City, Missouri. The teenagers showed up to the wrong house. He was supposed to be at another address to pick up his siblings. Sixteen-year-old Ralph Yarl has left the hospital and amazingly he's being able to recover at home after being shot in the head. And, happening now, Dominion Voting's defamation trial against Fox News. The trial is underway after a 24 hour delay that raised questions about possible settlement talks. Kate.",

And appearing in court today was the first time that we were able to see \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan -- Evan Gershkovich since his detainment. The U.S. ambassador to Russia was on hand to support Gershkovich in court, and she also spoke out forcefully outside the court once the proceedings wrapped.CNN's Matthew Chance is joining me now. He's been watching all of these proceedings. It was -- it's hard to say great to see him because he was behind this glass partition, but it was great to see Evan Gershkovich's face.

And, you know, he had a consular visit as well from U.S. diplomats yesterday. And they said he seemed to be healthy. He looked very strong. And that seemed to be borne out by the images we saw of Evan Gershkovich standing in that glass courtroom cage in the Moscow court earlier today as well.You're right, the appeal against his detention was rejected. His defense lawyers had asked for him to be released on house arrest or to be granted bail of 50 -- they offered 50 million rubles, which is just over 600,000 U.S. dollars. That was rejected out of hand. He's facing charges of espionage, remember, which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years. Outside the court, Lynne Tracy, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, expressed her outrage and her concern. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYNNE TRACY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: I was able to meet Evan yesterday at Lefortovo Prison. It was the first time we were granted consular access since his wrongful detention more than two weeks ago. I can report that he is in good health and remain strong despite his circumstances. The charges against Evan are baseless and we call on the Russian Federation to immediately release him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
