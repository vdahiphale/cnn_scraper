Disgraced South Carolina lawyer and now convicted killer Alex Murdaugh, he wants a new trial. We've just learned that the request by his legal team will be based on allegations of jury tampering and Murdaugh's double murder trial earlier this year. A jury, if you'll remember, convicted him of killing his wife, Maggie, and his son Paul. He took the stand in his own defense, and has maintained that he is innocent. Joining us now for more on this latest twist is defense and trial Attorney Misty Marris. So, Misty, jury tampering as the discovered -- newly discovered evidence which had kind of teased out, we're going to be apparently hearing more from his legal team late today about this. But what are you hearing then?",

Jury tampering is generally some sort of outside undue influence exercised on the jurors for the purpose of influencing their determination at trial. So, it can be something really extreme like a bribe. It can be coercion. It can be a threat, or it can be something less extreme, for instance, sharing information with a juror about stuff that didn't come into the trial about evidence that was not admitted.So, there's a whole gambit of what it could be. There is jury tampering, that's really severe. Then there's jury misconduct, which is generally not criminal, but could still form the basis of overturning the verdict.",

The latest poll of polls shows Donald Trump up more than 40 points over his nearest rival Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.Joining me now is Former Republican Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker. Governor, great to see you. When we last spoke, it was the day of the first Republican debate in your home state of Wisconsin. Now, we're a couple of weeks after, what changed since the first debate? SCOTT WALKER (R), FORMER WISCONSIN GOVERNOR:  You know, there's some movement within the second tier of some in terms some of the candidates did better coming out of the debate, some went down a little bit. But by and large, nothing changed when it comes to Donald Trump. He still has an enormous leap. It's kind of, like, the Home Run Derby last year, Aaron Judge is way ahead and the fight was for who is going to come in second. I would imagine the second debate can happen a few weeks may be a factor, a little bit more than the first but I still haven't seen anything, any of these candidates are saying that would make Trump supports move off the dime.",

So, there's a lot of that going on. And as much as people sometimes grumble about these early states, these voters really do take it seriously. They don't make a decision often times until they've talked to candidates three or four times.And so, putting a time, putting effort, not just for the show, it's got to be more than just showing up and making a T.V. appearance. You literally have to talk to voters in a town hall setting, particularly in New Hampshire. You need to show up at things like the state fair in Iowa. That, to me, at least the only shot they've got, show some momentum, maybe come in a close second to President Trump in one of these early primaries and show maybe that you the one who could be the viable alternative. But again, I have yet to see, certainly on the debate stage and on the campaign trail, that anybody is moving people who are firmly behind Donald Trump.",

You lay out a loose agenda. I think there has to be a very specific proposal. You have to talk about a series of things that make you different, not only Then-President Trump, but then anyone else in the race. You've got to show that you're going to be as aggressive, if not more so.Remember, part of the reason why so many primary voters are firmly behind president Trump, even if they don't always like his tone or his tweets. And to be clear, there's some that love it. There are others who don't. But the vast majority of people out there are firmly behind the president liked what he accomplished. And so, if you are a candidate, and particularly in these early states, you have got to show how you will do as well or better, and that is a high bar. Because people have said -- I've seen it. I know the pressures President Trump faced. I saw what he did, he didn't back down. So, you got to make that case. And then there -- I think the other pivot is these candidates got to show voters they're more likely to win. If they could do that, maybe they've got a shot.",

This is an indictment for a physical crime to get someone.I think what -- while a lot of folks who look at Republican primary votes and wonder how could people still be with President Trump? I think many of them feel, understandably so, that he's been targeted. And even if you don't agree with his assessment of the 2020 election, I think there are many who feel like he felt that the election had somehow been stolen from him. I'm not arguing whether that was the case or not, but that's what he felt. And so, a lot of folks feel like this has questioned the timing, they questioned the circumstances, they questioned the politics involved with this.

But you know, it's been two decades since an American man last won in front of a home crowd at the U.S. Open, that was Andy Roddick in 2003. For the first time in any major since 1968, we'll see two black American men now in the quarters, 10th seed Frances Tiafoe and the unseeded Ben Shelton will play each other later on tonight.Tiafoe is in the quarters for a second straight year. He's only dropped one set in four matches so far, but he's never faced Shelton as a pro or his big powerful serve. Just 20 years of age, he fired up a pair of a 149 miles per hour serves in his match on Sunday. The fastest of the entire tournament. Now, there are actually three American still in the men's draw, all toll, the first time that's happened at the U.S. Open since 2005. Ninth seeded Taylor Fritz will have a daunting task ahead of him this afternoon if he wants to reach a Grand Slam semi for the first time. Who's he got? He's got, oh, only to 23-time major champion Novak Djokovic. Friz has never beaten Djokovic. He's 0 and seven all the time. And lost in straights when they played last month in Cincinnati. But the day begins in just over an hour from right now, Kate, when young Coco Gauff takes to the court at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The 19- year-old phenom has already made history, becoming the first American teen to reach the quarterfinals at the U.S. Open, in fact, about a year since a certain Serena Williams did it. Her next challenge reaching the semis in the Big Apple for the first time to do that, she must get past Jelena Ostapenko. No small task as the Latvian is one very formidable player. She's coming off a brilliant upset of the world number one pole Iga Swiatek in the round of 16. Fascinating hours ahead, Kate, in New York City. Back to you.",
