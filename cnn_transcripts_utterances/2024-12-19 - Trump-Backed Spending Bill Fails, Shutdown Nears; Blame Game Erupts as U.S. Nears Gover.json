(END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP (on camera):  Good evening. I'm Abby Philip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about, shutdown. We're just over 24 hours away now, and there is no solution in sight after Donald Trump and Elon Musk blew up a bipartisan spending bill. Tonight, the new one that was backed by Trump just failed, and failed badly. The deal needed two thirds majority to pass, so that means Speaker Johnson needed to get Democrats on board. But still, 38 Republicans voted against it. One of those Republicans is Congressman Chip Roy, who spent the day getting berated by Trump on Truth Social. Trump called him weak and ineffective and very unpopular. He said Republicans like him need to be done away with and that he hoped Chip Roy would get primaried. So, what exactly did Chip Roy do to deserve Trump's wrath? Well, he espoused a position on the spending bill that was, well, a very Republican position. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX):  To take this bill yesterday and congratulate yourself because it's shorter in pages, but increases the debt by 5 $trillion is asinine. And that's precisely what Republicans are doing. I am absolutely sickened by a party that campaigns on fiscal responsibility and has the temerity to go forward to the American people and say, you think this is fiscally responsible. It is absolutely ridiculous. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This process is broken, and nobody's really serious about solving this debt problem.And if you ask outside of campaign season what our biggest threat to this country is it's our debt. It makes us militarily weak, it makes us economically weak, when I watch things like the ten-year note over 4.5 percent today, and continuing to climb, it's a true threat. And, you know, Scott reminds us every day, on the day, on the hour almost, that this is what America signed up for was change, and we're certainly going to get change. I hope it's positive change.

Like when there is an authoritarian presence, you don't fear the voters, you don't fear the people, you fear an authoritarian. And that's what we saw today because there was a bipartisan effort to do the work of the government, what the voters vote for you to do. And in you, as in the past, if you didn't do that, there might be repercussions at an election. But the repercussions at elections now are, is Trump for you, or is he against you, in the Republican Party? And so, this is what authoritarian looks like.

The idea that this is somehow a novel thing, this is brand new, respectfully, I disagree with that premise, because look at how Congress has worked or not worked candidly for so long. People are frustrated. If Congress truly feared the voters, they're really going to be repercussions of the voting booth. We wouldn't be saying in the position where we are.

As the nation barrels toward a shutdown, the president is largely MIA. Biden himself has not made any on-camera comments about this looming crisis. And this disappearing act comes as The Wall Street Journal reports how signs of the president's decline arose just months into his term, quote, administration officials noticed that the president became tired if meetings went too long and would make mistakes. They issued a directive to some powerful lawmakers and allies seeking one-on-one time. Those exchanges should be short and focused, according to the people who received the messages directly from White House aides. If the president was having an off day, meetings would be scrapped all together. Scott Jennings, you were just talking about this, so I'll go to you first because I know you have a lot to say, but this piece does show Biden having all of these sort of walls up.",

But there's a bigger problem here, and that is that I think Democrats are at the point where Republicans might have been right after the Bush election or after the Bush term was up, which is that I think Democrats are starting to mistrust their institutions.And this goes back to a bipartisan effort to lie us into the Iraq war, not just by George Bush, but also by a lot of Democrats. It has to do with the fact that Barack Obama did not hold anybody accountable after the 2008 crisis, which also happened on George Bush's watch, but he became president. He never threw a hostage on the tarmac from Wall Street. You saw the rise of Bernie Sanders as a result of that and saw a lot of institutional Democrats, me included, saying no, this is not the time. We have to stick with the institution. I think you have a lot of Democrats now, me included, who are pretty sick of the institution and trusting people in institution. And this is just one example, most recent example, I think, of people institutionally lying to the American people.
