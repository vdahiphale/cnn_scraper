A U.S. report sheds light on the atrocities suffered by civilians in the Israel-Hamas conflict, including the disappearance of thousands of Palestinians. Plus controversy and arrests at pro-Palestinian protests unfolding on college campuses across the U.S. And Myanmar's military says former leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been moved from prison to house arrest. We'll speak with her son to learn what he knows of his mother's condition. The U.S. has listed Israel among countries with human rights issues, citing cases of systemic torture and inhumane treatment of Palestinian detainees, as well as the forced disappearance of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza. The assessment is part of the State Department's annual report on human rights around the world, released Monday by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The report also covers cases of killings, abductions and sexual violence by Hamas and other groups during the October 7th attacks on Israel. Blinken points out the report does not represent the U.S. government's conclusions, but relies on a wide variety of sources, including government officials, abuse victims, international organizations and the media. And he says the U.S. applies the same standard for all. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Do we have a double standard? The answer is no. As this report makes clear, in general, as we're looking at human rights and the condition of human rights around the world, we apply the same standard to everyone. And that doesn't change whether the country in question is an adversary, a competitor, a friend or an ally. And that's hugely important. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Trump, of course, denying it. But these business records really as something of a pretext, a pretext really covering up hush money payments. And I think the prosecution also made this about the larger issue, not the salacious issue about Stormy Daniels, but the issue about election interference, the issue about the nature of why these payments were made. Right? And the payments being made to influence the election. And that's important because it's not just about the falsification of business records. It's about why they were falsified. And so I just think as a general matter, in opening up the case, the prosecution was very clear on the nature of the fraud, the purpose of the fraud and the illegality of the fraud relating to the president's cover up in this case.",

Is it merely an admonishment of telling Trump, listen, this time I'll let it pass the next. It's not going to be the case. Will the judge be sterner and say, I'm going to give you a $1,000 fine for each violation or will the judge take the really critical step, which I don't think at this point the judge will do.
