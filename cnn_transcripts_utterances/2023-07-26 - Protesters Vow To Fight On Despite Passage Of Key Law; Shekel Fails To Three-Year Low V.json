This is a warning against investments in Israel.Basically, Moody's is calling the international investors, step out, this is not the right time to move in. But in their explanation, they're really hitting the nail on the head. The problem is the constitutional setup that Netanyahu coalition is designing for Israel. So, from decades of research in economic history and political economy, we know that institutions matter, and the constitutional setup of the country matters for its long run economic outcomes. And specifically, countries that are wealthy and prosperous, are countries in which there are inclusive institutions where the Constitution's set up is sharing, inclusive, and there are checks and balances. And the executive is not free to do whatever it -- whatever it wants. And if you look at the common denominators of all of the components of the judicial overhaul, it's just one. It's about concentrating power at the hands of the governing coalition. Right now, the Supreme Court and to some degree, also the bureaucracy are the only real guarantor of checks and balances in the Israeli system. And all of those laws in many different ways are trying to neutralize them and to subdue them to the governing coalition. And if ever everything is going to pass, we're going to have a government, the coalition that governs the country without checks and balances. And it's very clear what the problem is. It's pretty scary, to be honest. What's going to be it's going to be a coalition government that serves the interests of a small majority, the ultra-orthodox, the extreme right wing, the settlers, and the populist right wing and the rights of the minorities and of the liberal, secular or moderately religion Israelis are going to be jeopardized.
