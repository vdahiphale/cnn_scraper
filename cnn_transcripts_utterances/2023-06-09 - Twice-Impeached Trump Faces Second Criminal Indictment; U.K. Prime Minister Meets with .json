Donald Trump is still under scrutiny by the same special counsel, and the sprawling probe into the January 6th attack on the Capitol, the efforts to subvert a peaceful transfer of power.

We'll be watching for all that to happen.I think the other big question, of course, is the security question, the question of Donald Trump's supporters. You know, talking about a venue in Florida is a very different than talking about a courthouse that is in New York, where Donald Trump perhaps has fewer supporters than he does across the state of Florida. You know, he has made at the time, the location of his appearance, public and as you pointed out, we learned from our colleagues last night that the U.S. Marshals, the Secret Service, were not given a heads of about this.

The real risk for the president here is, it is not just the willful retention of classified documents, it is also questions of obstruction, to move the boxes around. Did he engage and overact an agreement with somebody to not allow this investigation to go forward as he may have with some of his aides? This is a politically fraught investigation both for the president and the Justice Department because they are doing in the middle of an election cycle where the president of the United States who is just about the charges is of course running for office as well.",

So, that is where it is based in, and I would add this is not unique to the president or former president, meaning lesser people, lesser offenses have been charged for military contractors, for example, who have seen significant time.
