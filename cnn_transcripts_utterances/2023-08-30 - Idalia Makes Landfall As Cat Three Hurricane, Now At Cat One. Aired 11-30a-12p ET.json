Plus, two, we've got some lakes that have been knocked out due to either water intrusion or forced into lightning strikes that are moving all across our community right now. We've already had three tornado watches here in Citrus County since early this morning. So, we've got a long, long way ahead of us. Many hours of frustration, of course dealing with storm surge and the aftereffects of this storm. And we're going to be out here for a long time today, well into the darkness tonight and again tomorrow morning as we try to affect some recoveries. And unfortunately, just about a mile and a half from here up the highway, I ran into a gentleman who was on duty at one of our local gas stations.

And folks come to scallop and enjoy all the recreational activities over here. This is very dirty water. This is water that is washed up from the Gulf of Mexico has taken the water from our rivers, our base, it's pushed it off from our springs out here now. It's intermingled with other kinds of debris from the highways and a lot of things that you just don't want to be walking around in right now. So, it's very dirty and dangerous water to be in.",

While the hurricane made landfall, several hours go up to our north, its effects are going to continue to play out north of us for a long time to come.But this storm surge is going to be a continuing event well into the hours of darkness tonight. So, please don't venture out into it. We've got downed power lines. As I said earlier, we've had three tornado warnings and we've had loads of other challenges across our community. And the other thing I'll tell you is if they're storm water out here that you see that is surged into our major roads or even our side streets in places like Crystal River, down the road in Homosassa or down further in Chassahowitzka down near our county line, don't get out on that water because it is salt water mixed in with a lot of other things. And it's going to destroy your vehicles. And then it's going to give you a costly repair bill whenever you get past the storm and you try to figure out what's going to be the next move for you.",
