They did not intervene, though we do know that the woman did eventually get to the Mexican side of the border with the child. That video being filmed December 12th by an immigration activist who was in the area.

The Kremlin told reporters that they have neither the intention nor the ability to monitor the fate of prisoners. And prosecutors in Idaho have proposed a summer 2024 start date for Brian Kohberger's murder trial. He's accused of murdering four University of Idaho students last year. Prosecutors say a summer start date means avoiding the school year sparing students and educators the distraction of increased media attention. They expect the trial to last about six weeks. Last month, for the first time since April 2020, prices fell on a monthly basis. That is according to a report released by the Commerce Department, just out today. It also found inflation cooled a little bit more in November and is getting closer to the Fed's target rate.
