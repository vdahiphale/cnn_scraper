Tonight, we are learning new details about what happened in the moments that authorities captured the suspect in the killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO. Right now, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione is being held in Pennsylvania, arraigned this evening on five forgery and gun charges. But it was just after 09:00 a.m. today when he was arrested at a McDonald's, more than 250 miles from Manhattan. An employee there had tipped off authorities after recognizing him from pictures that had been on the news. When police arrived, he was wearing a medical mask, and sitting at the back of the restaurant in front of his laptop. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Also, Darrin Porcher, former Lieutenant at the NYPD. And Chris Swecker, also here, the former FBI Assistant Director. So, we have the perfect cast here to break it down. And John, I'll start with you, because you've been doing so much reporting on this. And you're also learning tonight that he actually mentioned, this suspect actually mentioned, UnitedHealthcare in this handwritten manifesto. Tell us what else was in that document that authorities now have in their possession. JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYST, FORMER DEPUTY COMM. OF INTELLIGENCE &amp; COUNTERTERRORISM, NYPD: Well, thanks. And it's great to be here with Darrin and Chris, my colleagues from the NYPD and the FBI. But it's really interesting note, because it is a note that takes -- it begins with the tone of resignation, right? The note is written with a pitch and tone, I am told, from people who have looked at it, on the assumption that he's either been captured and they have found the note, or even that he's been killed, and the note is his telling of the story. But it starts off with, I'm sorry for any strife or trauma this has caused, but it had to be done. These parasites had it coming. Note that parasites is plural, and we're talking about a case where he is allegedly behind the killing of one individual. It begs the question, was he on the way to do more or another hit somewhere else, maybe in Pennsylvania. But the note goes on to really frame the health care industry, and United in particular. He refers to it as United. As growing too fast, making too much money and ripping off too many people.",

We want to try to elicit as much information as possible from these individuals before the actual warrant is lodged. Because once the warrant from the NYPD, or the City of New York, is lodged, against this individual, then he has the absolute right to counsel. So now, we're kind of conducting this backwards investigation, if you may want to refer to it as that. That backwards investigation consists of when the actual crime occurred, when he shot the CEO of U.S. health care, up to and including this point. We're going to look at all of those components in between, and we're going to unmask as much discovery as possible to present, because we're going to get the probable cause for arrest. But now the focal point would be the court proceeding, because we want to gain a conviction. And that standard of proof for conviction is beyond a reasonable doubt.

He's bright. He's got a couple of degrees. He's a true believer. And apparently, he has his cause, like the Unabomber did, and others like him, Eric Rudolph, and others, they always seem to have some deeply- held ideology. And that, as was just mentioned, I mean, we're going to build out his social network, his electronic devices, his friends, his family, and the picture will emerge in greater, in more clarity tomorrow. But we have an ideologue here, someone who felt so strongly that he went out and killed a human being. And maybe, as John points out, maybe there were other targets.

The ego and the narcissism that says, This is my responsibility alone to go do this. And thinking back on that note, it was almost written with the idea of, Once I go on this mission -- or these missions, we still don't know -- I pretty much understand, I can't go home again, I won't be able to resume my normal life.

So, that being said, I think that is fortunate that we have that symbiotic relationship with police and community. And just one quick point. I see strong parallels between Bryan Kohberger, and the suspect in this case, as it relates to the sensationalism of individuals that don't have a criminal record. But they're very bright.

So, I think there's a temptation, unfortunately, for some, to try and appease Trump, after they've opposed Gaetz, by supporting some of his others.
