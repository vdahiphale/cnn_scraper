      "sentences": "OK, so this is new to us, just that the call was recorded.Again, as you said, it was former President Donald Trump and he was essentially urging the late speaker of the Georgia House to try to convene a special session so that they could overturn the results of the 2020 election. Now, actually, Ralston spoke about this call in an interview. And here's what he said about his conversation with the former president. He said, \"Obviously, he would like a special session of the Georgia General Assembly. He's been clear on that before and he was clear on that in the phone conversation yesterday.\" \"You know, I shared with him my belief that, based on the understanding that I have of Georgia law, that it was going to be very much an uphill battle.\" Now, it would have been an uphill battle for two reasons. Georgia's General Assembly can only be called into a special session in one of two ways. One would have had to have been through the governor, Brian Kemp. And Trump tried to pressure Kemp. Kemp rejected that. The other way would have been for the General Assembly to convene themselves as a special session. And what we've learned at that time is that you would have to have the signatures of three-fifths of the House members to actually go forward with this, and they just didn't have enough Republicans at that time. Again, this was a recorded call. And as you mentioned, these jurors said that they were listening to this as part of their evidence that they were presented with. And this is, again, just the third recorded call that we know has been presented in this case. When you look at this, it's all different manner. One, you have trying to convene a special session in the case of Ralston. On the second one, Frances Watson, he was trying to encourage her to find fraud in the election. And the other one, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. They were trying to get him to, quote/unquote, \"find votes.\" The reason this is so important, it gives us more of the insight into what exactly the grand jury was hearing and seeing as it was asked to recommend or decide upon these indictments.",

And the longer video is about 30 to 40 minutes, we're told.But you can see here, the dumping of the fuel over the drone, as described by the U.S., denied by the Russians. And then there's a highlighting of the damaged propeller that forced U.S. remote pilots to have to bring it down into the Black Sea. It's now under 4,000 to 5,000 feet of water. The Russians now in the area, who say that they are going to try to retrieve that. Let's bring in now, retired Colonel Cedric Leighton. Ahead of, hopefully, the section where they talk about this video at this briefing. We'll take everyone there. What are you expecting to hear, Colonel, once we check in with Brigadier General Pat Ryder? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, so what I'm expecting to hear is perhaps some more detail, Victor, on exactly what happened. You know, we do know that they dumped fuel on the drone, as you mentioned. We also know that they clipped the propeller. And we saw that damage, that you pointed out there. So those are things that affect the air worthiness of the drone. It could have caused serious damage. It could have caused the damage to careen into an area where it could have potentially killed somebody if it had been over land. Of course, it wasn't. It was in the Black Sea. What's also is interesting is that this occurred in waters that are not only international, but much closer to Turkish waters or Bulgarian waters than to Russian or Ukrainian waters. So it's very interesting to see the story about this. But I'm expecting more technical details and perhaps some indication of what the DOD response is going to be to this in terms of more flights and more things that they might do from a reconnaissance perspective in this particular area.",

That it may have gone up to the head of the Russian military in terms of ordering this interception, right? And the question is whether or not actually hitting this drone was their intention. But the maneuvering was. It's clear of that. The other issue is that we heard today from military officials that this aggressive, the increase in these intercepts and Russia's aggression has dramatically increased since March and that the Russian military has been conducting similar-type operations and dangerous maneuvers in Syria. So does this tell you perhaps that this is sort of a new strategy being conducted by the unction military? Before - (CROSSTALK)",

We were tracking this video as it was moving through that declassification process, essentially. But it also underscored that the account of the U.S. was the one that more accurately depicted what happened here. This, after the Russian ambassador to the U.S., pretty quickly after this all came out, denied that there was any contact, physical contact between the Russian and fighter jets and the drones.

Sometimes they will be much more aggressive when it comes to intercepting reconnaissance flights.Other times they will just allow them to pass through. They'll take a look other than intercept. They will never do things like we see here in the video with the MQ-9. But with their more aggressive approach, that all changes. The rule book becomes a different one. And what the Russians end up doing is they end up taking very aggressive maneuvers against manned and unmanned aerial vehicles.

The Russians will look at it as getting a propaganda coup if they can get this up in a profitable fashion.If they can pull up a piece of the MQ-9 and say, look what we have, that will be a propaganda thing for them. As far as the U.S. is concerned, you know, it would certainly be good if we could take it back, if we could get the pieces and parts that have crashed into the Black Sea and safeguard them from the Russians. But it is not absolutely essential that we do so. Basically, with the rendering null and void of the software that was onboard, it really takes out all of the intelligence parts that are really important that would be useful to the Russians. And so if that is true, they were able to in essence zero all the data that was important and it's not that important that we get this back.

All your fertilizers run off and hurricanes mix them up in the gulf and then you see these toxic blooms. It could be a similar trend with this stuff. But it could also be an ally. And there's a fix for this, actually. I was talking to Agua Culture specialists, who are in the business now of capturing carbon with seaweed. And say, tomorrow, you could have a dozen guys from Maine down there with the equipment to do it, use trawlers and nets. Scooper it up, chop it up on barges at sea and sink it into the ocean, which is a net positive for the earth. It pulls carbon out of the sea and sky and locks it away below.
