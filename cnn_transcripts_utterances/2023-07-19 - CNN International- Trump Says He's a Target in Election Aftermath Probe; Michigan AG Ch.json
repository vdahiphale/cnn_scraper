When in fact Joe Biden had one this state by 154,000 votes. Dana Nessel's investigation has been ongoing since January. And she is now charging those 16 individuals who will be expected to turn themselves in. Now, this is all happening while investigations into fake electors' plots are ongoing in the six other states where those fake electors' plots happened, including Arizona and Georgia. And at the same time the special counsel Jack Smith, he has been investigating the efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Some of these fake electors have even testified to the grand jury. So there's potentially a lot more charges to come in other states.

      "sentences": "Well Christina, Army Private Travis King is the U.S. soldier who broke away from a tour group and crossed into North Korea willfully and without authorization. The U.N. command, a US-led group, says it's working with the North Korean military to resolve the incident. And on top of everything else, earlier today North Korea fired two ballistic missiles. So tension is high.Now, King was not in uniform when he crossed into North Korea. He spent some 50 days in a detention facility in South Korea for assault involving at least one South Korean national. King, we learned, was facing disciplinary action by the U.S. military. He was set to be separated from the U.S. Army. And a U.S. official told CNN that King was escorted to the airport to go back to U.S. but because the escorts couldn't go through customs with him, he was able to leave the airport. And then King later crossed into North Korea during a tour of the joint security area or JSA. Now let's bring up footage of what that area looks like. The JSA is located inside the DMZ -- that's the highly fortified border separating the two Koreas. The tour is organized by U.N. command. It is open to the public. And while there are check points to get to the JSA, once you're there, the actual border between North and South is only this small, raised line that's on the ground. I want to show you these images. Let's bring it up for you. You may remember this, former U.S. President Donald Trump when he met with Kim Jong-un at the JSA in June of 2019, there they are standing right next to that very line. So during a JSA tour, participants they're usually kept about 20 yards away from that line. Now this border crossing incident, it comes at a time of high tension. This year North Korea has already fired around a dozen missiles including long range ICBMs. And earlier this morning North Korea fired two short range ballistic missiles into the waters offer its eastern coast. That happened just hours after U.S. ballistic missile submarine docked in South Korea for the first time in decades. And now North Korea has an American soldier in its custody. This is a very sensitive time, Christina. His fate is uncertain. Back to you.",

They say 14, so not even half of them. 32 Shahed attack drones in which they shot down the majority -- 23 of them. But still some did get through.We're hearing of injuries on the ground, most of those, it should be noted, from the affect of air defensive, fragments falling, damage on the ground from pieces of missile craters, blast waves, things like that. It is a very serious threat, the fact that these missiles are literally being shot down in the skies over residential areas. They are saying that several missiles that did get through hit a grain and oil terminal at Odessa port, a fire broke out there and that is still being put out. So really serious. The Kremlin of course did say that it is considering further proposals to respond to the attack on the Kerch Bridge. I think that we can view it in the context of that. Perhaps also another way to express its disdain of the grain deal which it pulled out of on Monday. And just quickly, we're hearing about a separate incident this morning in Crimea. A fire seems to have broken out at a military training ground. They've evacuated some 2,000 people from villages nearby, closed a section of highway -- that's Russian occupied Crimea of course.

One of the proposals that they come up with, is to call on the ICC to essentially issue a similar arrest warrant to what they issued in March for the President of Russia Vladimir Putin and his Children's Rights Commissioner over a scheme to illegally deport Ukrainian children into Russia.So they are suggesting some complicity of the Lukashenko regime. And we don't have evidence that ourselves and we don't have any reaction as a yet from the ICC. But it does speak to a seriously deteriorating situation in Belarus when it comes to political prisoners -- they say there are 1500 of them -- repression, all kinds of different things. And of course they're really concerned about the proximity of this regime to Moscow and increasingly coming under their control. I think a sign of the times is that we're getting a report today from the Belarusian opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, that another Belarusian journalist has been detained earlier this week.

But every country in this heatwave is worried about their own situations with fires. In terms of the temperature, we broke a record yesterday in Rome, 41.8 degrees but that record was only a year old. So it tells you how this is just a continuation of a problem that's going to, you know, not go away anytime soon. Now we are at 10:00 in the morning and there are tourists here at the Spanish steps. They are out in the sun. Authorities have warned, please do not stay in the sun during hot times of the day from about noon to about 6:00 p.m. We've seen a 20 percent increase in emergency room calls from people who are suffering from heat-related problems. That's very, very concerning because it's not just as if it's been one day of hot weather. We're in the second week of it. And even if it does cool down, Christina, it's going to get down to like 35. 35 is still very, very hot. And you know, tourists who come to Rome want to spend every minute that they can in Rome.

Han said that China and the U.S. will issue a joint statement. We're expecting that later today. That will send a positive signal to the world. And he praised Kerry for the close communication and dialogue that he has maintained with China even during these months and years of strained relations. As we know, Kerry is not your average U.S. diplomat. He was a presidential Democratic nominee, U.S. Secretary of State under President Obama, he is well liked and respected by the Chinese. We heard from China's top diplomat Wang Yi and the Premier Yixiang Li yesterday, they both referred to Kerry as an old friend. Now Kerry this morning, he spoke and he said: If we can come together over these next months leading up to COP28 -- which is that U.N. climate summit -- which will be the most important since Paris, we will have an opportunity to be able to make a profound difference on this issue. The Paris reference is that agreement signed in 2015 to keep global warning below 2 degrees Celsius of preindustrial temperatures. That was later revised to 1.5. On this trip, you know, Kerry has been calling on China to curb expansion of coal plants and reduce its use of methane. China has always, you know, resisted these calls, Christina, saying that it's a developing nation. It needs to use fossil fuels to support its economic development. So, you know, we will hear from John Kerry probably sometime next hour. He will hold a press conference before the media, before flying back to Washington -- Christina.",
