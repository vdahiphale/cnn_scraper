They warn that lifting it next week will result in a complete loss of operational control over the southern border, and they believe it will have a profoundly negative impact on these border communities. One of the lawmakers who represents those communities is Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar. He represents a southwest border district and joins us now. Congressman, if Title 42 ends as scheduled, how much more difficult does managing the migrant crisis become, do you believe?REP. HENRY CUELLAR, (D-TX):  Communities are going to be overwhelmed, not only in El Paso. We've seen that in the past with Rio Grande Valley, we've seen it in Eagle Pass, Del Rio. They're going to be overwhelmed. There's just not enough shelters and border processing centers to handle the large numbers of people. And what Border Patrol is doing, it's almost like whack-a-mole in the sense that if there's a surge in the valley, they'll move people down there. If there's more people crossing, let's say, Del Rio, Eagle Pass, they'll move agents over there. Now they're moving agents to El Paso. So this is not the way to secure the border. We can do two things at the same time. We can provide a compassionate way of treating the immigrants that are trying to come in. But at the same time we have to secure the border, because the only thing that the Border Patrol is doing is processing a lot of them to come into the U.S. and then returning some of them under Title 42. If Title 42 goes away, this is going to just open up large numbers of people coming to border communities.",

So why are we not doing this? Why are we not saying that there's an asylum seeker coming in from another country and they pass a third country? And I've been talking about this for about four, five years where they can seek asylum somewhere else. Why is the U.S. the only place that they can get away from persecution? There's a lot of countries on the way over here that they can ask for that. Or if they can do it in an orderly process, ask for asylum in one of our consulates or embassies abroad. It's got to be orderly. What you've seen in El Paso, what you saw in Eagle Pass, Del Rio, what you've seen in the valley, I don't call that orderly, and I don't understand why the administration doesn't understand that.

And he was just -- I got so many texts about him. But what Celine, who was a Medical Contributor to CNN as well, what she was talking about was the major blood vessel called the aorta, lives the heart. And that then gives off tributaries to all these other organs in the body.Sometimes that blood vessel itself -- I don't know if we have an image of it -- but it can actually start to weaken. It's made up of all these layers, and some of the layers are weakened. So, it actually, instead of being sort of -- you see that sort of in the middle of the screen, that candy cane looking structure, instead of being normal sort of contour, like that will actually start to get a balloon -- become the shape of a balloon. And that balloon is weaker. As the wall sort of distend, the walls become weaker as well. And with time, it can rupture. Meaning, that those walls can actually break apart or you can get blood that actually dissects through the walls of the aorta. Either way, it can be a catastrophic problem. I will say that it's pretty unusual. It typically happens in people who are older. And there's really not some sort of way that he probably knew that he had this unless he was -- had a family history or was being screened for some reason, it is likely he didn't know this. From what I understand, he was having -- he thought it they were upper respiratory symptoms. He thought he had bronchitis. And sometimes that ballooning can become so large, it can actually start to push on other things in that part of your body in your chest.",

But the thing is that it's so rare that it's not recommended that people go out and get screened. About 20 percent of the time, there is a family history. So, if you have family history of this, then that's something that you should potentially get checked out. And you can do that with imaging tests.I will point out -- you know, one thing -- one of the first stories I covered here at CNN back in 2003 was actually the story of John Ritter dying. He was 54 years old. Remember John Ritter? And he basically had the same problem. He was a few years older than Grant is now, but basically the same problem. They thought it was a heart attack. Initially, they weren't sure. It ended up being an aortic aneurysm that had dissected, similar to what saline was describing. Again, that's rare. So, screening tests are not recommended across the board. But, you know, obviously, these sad, sad stories like this do happen.",
