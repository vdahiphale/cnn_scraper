I just want to sort of expand on what Matthew Miller was saying there. The State Department essentially saying, look, even though Israel is not a party to the ICC, even though they didn't recognize his authority, Israel went out of their way, they went out of their way to cooperate. They went out of their way to be transparent. Israeli officials met staff from the ICC multiple times in Israel. And in fact, today, to date, ICC staff members were set to land in Israel, and instead, Karim Khan went on TV to announce these charges. And so, Israel really feels blind-sided by this. What has the ICC -- just in terms of them releasing a statement, what have they said to that?",

Now, there has been according to the prosecutor, and I called the office after this backlash from the State Department, I asked him specifically, why would you not let the Israeli system of a democracy deal with these kinds of accountability issues? And he said to me, and they stand by what they said to me that, they have tried to engage in good faith on many occasions and over a period of some three years because there have been investigations as you know by the ICC over other issues in the occupied West Bank. And they had not got the kind of cooperation or the kind of understanding that Israeli authorities would actually take up this judicial matter themselves. So, that is one thing. I spoke to a very senior juror as Geoffrey Nice about the issue that is also being complained about, and that is equivalence, moral equivalence or factual equivalence as Israel and its allies, and including Prime Minister Netanyahu who have charged between them and Hamas, saying that the prosecutor made that as a statement in these announcements today. Geoffrey Nice says he doesn't see that at all. There's no statement of equivalence whatsoever. It is just based on the evidence, and that is what I also talked to prosecutor Karim Khan about. He said, this is not about politics, this is not about emotion. This is not about one side or the other, this is about where the evidence has led us. And this evidence has been as he said, being gathered ever since October 7th. They -- he had been in the aftermath to the worst-affected areas that were attacked by Hamas on October 7th. And obviously, there's no independent access into Gaza, but there had been many interviews, investigations, video evidence, and the like, including from the international community that led him to produce what he did today. And he told me with the sort of bar being charges that could stand the test of a conviction in court, not just being brought to trial, but a conviction in court. So, on this side, they are very sure that they've done it right. They predicted that they would get this backlash. They had been threatened by a group of American senators, Republican senators, even before this happened, to cut off funds, to you know, sanction the prosecutor and his team and their families to bar them from the United States. Things like that. So, they expected this kind of backlash, but they assured us and the world that this is not political. It's where the facts and the evidence have led them, and that is the ICC's mandate.",

And maybe people that were entirely uninvolved killed as a result of this. And this is absolutely regrettable. But there is not a policy, there has never been a policy of killing innocent civilians while the terrorist organizations are entirely based on killing innocent civilians as a goal, as the basic policy of this organization. Now, what disturbs me and disgusts me is the fact that it took them seven months to decide that they have to issue an arrest warrant against them. Terrorists committed these atrocities on the 7th of October.

This afterearlier cross-examination continued of Michael Cohen, pictured there. In that cross-examination, Cohen admitted to stealing tens of thousands of dollars in the past from the Trump organization. This part of a ongoing effort by the defense to undermine his credibility. Joining us now, Joseph Marino. He's a former prosecutor for the Justice Department. Good to have you on. Thanks for joining. So first to the defense's efforts here to undermine Cohen's testimony about the payments to Stormy Daniels by identifying other times, and we saw this previously last week where Cohen lied, including under oath. And now this instance where he admitted to stealing from the Trump organization. I wonder, in your view, has the defense accomplished its task of raising enough doubt in jurors' minds about Cohen's testimony, about the Stormy Daniels payments, other issues? JOSEPH MARINO, FORMER U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROSECUTOR: I have to think that they're doing the best with what they have to work with. And while this latest indicator, this latest admission from Cohen that he stole, it's shocking. I'm not sure if it's surprising. I mean, we knew weeks ago that Cohen was a bad guy, right? We know he lies. We know he surreptitiously records his clients' conversations. So I'm not sure at the end of the day it really changes the fact that we know he's a damaged witness, but he's what the prosecution is standing behind.",

So it helps a bit solidify putting a time and a place and some circumstances around it. And obviously the more specific Cohen can get, the more believable he sounds. And if you can corroborate that with photos or other testimony, all the better.",

The defense has done a pretty good job under Todd Blanche of shaking things up, of trying to narrow basically the prosecution's entire case behind the testimony of Michael Cohen. It really comes down to him. So to the extent they can cast doubt in the jury's mind about Cohen's testimony, they've done a good job. That being said, the facts here, I've never thought were very complicated. And the prosecution has laid them out. And so if you simplify the case, the jury doesn't have a whole lot to really kind of deliberate about because the facts are fairly straightforward. So again, if they believe Cohen, I think the case goes to the prosecution. If they don't, maybe Donald Trump gets either a mistrial or maybe even an acquittal.",

I mean, to your point, Joseph, it comes down to really do the -- does the jury believe the case, right? And do they believe the witnesses Cohen among them here? But how about on the legal question? Because going into this trial, the challenge, as I understood it for prosecutors, was not just to establish that money was paid to Stormy Daniels to kill her story during election, but that in order for it to be a felony, to have been done in violation as well of a federal law, they had to prove intent, as I understand it, but also Trump's knowledge of all this and specific knowledge. And I wonder beyond the credibility issues, do you believe the prosecution has established that connection?",

They have to show that Donald Trump was not only aware of the transactions, but wasaware that they could be in violation of federal campaign finance laws and he had the intent to violate those laws. And then again, it comes down to Michael Cohen's testimony. That's typically the most difficult thing to prove in cases like that, is the intent of the defendant. And so, you know, Michael Cohen, he has said it. I don't think Donald Trump's going to get up there and rebut him from the stand. I think it's way too dangerous. So again, the jury's going to put their stock in Michael Cohen and say, you know, either we believe him or we don't.",

Hewas killed in a helicopter crash in northwestern Iran on Sunday. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has announced five days of public mourning and world leaders, including those from Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and China and Russia, have been sending in their condolences. A short time ago, the U.S. expressed its official condolences and also reaffirmed its support for the people of Iran in their struggle for human rights. Presidential elections are now scheduled for June 28th. That is according to Iranian state media. CNN Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman joins us live now. So Ben, let's talk a bit about President Raisi's legacy, his legacy within the country. Obviously, he took the reins most recently back in 2021, but he was a very divisive figure in Iranian politics.",
