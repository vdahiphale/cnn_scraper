A four-day truce between Israel and Hamas does now appear to be taking effect. Seven weeks of a punishing air and ground campaign to root out the militant group. Hamas now on hold. It's part of a deal to secure the release of Israeli hostages captured in the October 7th terror attack.CNN's Jeremy Diamond and his crew near the border with Gaza report what sounded like artillery fire in the early minutes of today's truce that started two hours ago, but that has since stopped according to Qatar which was absolutely instrumental in brokering this deal. The first hostages from Israel are now expected to be released at some point after 4 P.M. local time. That is about seven hours from now. Women and children, some from the same families, will be turned over, or at least this is the plan, to the Red Cross. Gil Dickman's cousin is amongst those held hostage in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, we appear to be hearing and seeing a truce between Israel and Hamas actually beginning to take hold. It certainly did not seem that way in the first 15 minutes or so of when this truce was supposed to begin.In those first 15 minutes, we continue to hear the sound of heavy weaponry being fired. We were hearing loud booms inside Gaza. We were hearing continuous small arms fire, as well. But since then -- since those initial -- and what we also heard, I should note was rocket sirens in two Israeli communities on the border with Gaza. But since then, what has taken hold is a relative calm, the, you know, calm, first calm that we have seen in these 48 days of war as this truce between Israel and Hamas appears to finally be taking hold. That is obviously welcome news for the families of those hostages who are set to be released, the first 13 of them, women and children around 4 P.M. this afternoon. We expect that those hostages will be taken by Hamas, transferred over to the Red Cross before being transferred to Israeli forces at various potential points along Israel's border with Gaza. We don't know yet exactly which of those 13 hostages are expected to be released, but we are told that their families have been notified. One thing is clear though, Becky. This temporary pause in fighting over these four days, to allow for the release of those hostages, it could be extended for a few more days to allow for additional releases, 10 hostages per day perhaps. But the Israeli military and its political leadership is making very clear that this is simply a pause in fighting and that their fighting will resume after this pause ends. Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant yesterday, indicating that the fighting could go on for at least two more months until Israel achieves its goal of eradicating Hamas, removing its hold on power in Gaza and also freeing all of those nearly 240 hostages.",

Some of those, we were told, were going to begin crossing in, or at least undergoing the security checks on the Israeli side of the border, right after that truce took hold. But humanitarian agencies, United Nations and others have warned thatthese trucks of aid will still be insufficient to match what is simply an enormous need for aid inside of Gaza. We have already watched as so many essential services in Gaza have broken down after weeks of bombardments that they have been facing. Hospitals, many hospitals in Gaza are out of commission. They are lacking fuel. They are lacking food. They are lacking water. The water problem is one of the main reasons why Israel agreed last week for the first time to begin allowing some fuel into Gaza, the concern being that if those water, the sewage system and the water system in Gaza can't operate, that you could see an outbreak of very serious disease, which Israeli officials said would also imperil their war effort. But there is no question that this initial pause of four days to allow some aid in, to pause the fighting, will be a very welcome reprieve for the civilians of Gaza who have endured terrible tragedy over these seven weeks of war.",

They are now, you know, they've stopped their activities and that is part of the deal. But just for the sake of our viewers, we heard some Palestinians and some residents of Gaza talking about just how important this lull in the fighting will be.

Well, the Israel Defense Forces, the IDF, say they detained the director of Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza.The IDF says he was transferred to the Israeli security agency, the Shembet, for questioning. Israel says it has evidence that the hospital served as cover for a mass command and control center and wants to ask the director what he knew about that. Israeli officials say the Hamas tunnel network under the hospital used power and resources taken from the hospital and says Hamas stored weapons inside and on the hospital grounds. Meanwhile, the Hamas- controlled health ministry has suspended cooperation with the World Health Organization because the director was detained while traveling in a convoy coordinated by the WHO. Well, doctors in Gaza tells CNN the hope is that the truce will allow for patients and staff --hospital patients and staff to safely evacuate from north and central Gaza. Information trickling in suggests the number of people killed in the enclave continues to climb. That is according to the Hamas authorities in Gaza who say the death toll from Israeli attacks now stands at more than 14,850. An injured Palestinian man evacuated from Gaza to Egypt described life in the enclave during the war.",

Germany's interior minister says the country is keeping up his crackdown on radical Islamists after police raided the homes of Hamas members and supporters in at least four regions. The raids also targeted the pro-Palestinian network Samidoun which advocates the use of violence. The two groups were banned in Germany earlier this month. Officials say Hamas supporters still tried to raise money for the group, but affect the political discourse in Germany. In Ireland, police say the streets of Dublin are mainly calm after violent clashes broke out between police and protesters. It happened after five people, including three children, were stabbed in the central part of the city. Police say a man in his 50s has been detained as a suspect in the knife attack. Officials believe the stabbings weren't terrorist-related. Ukraine says one person was killed and another wounded in a barrage of Russian strikes on the Kherson region. Ukrainian officials say Russian forces launched a 65 attacks on Thursday using mortars, artillery rockets, and drones, among other weapons. The attacks reportedly hit residential areas as well as businesses and medical facilities. Chinese health authorities are explaining why there is been a spike in cases of children with pneumonia or respiratory illnesses in the northern part of the country. They told the World Health Organization on Thursday the uptick in cases is stemming from typical seasonal germs rather than any new or unknown bacterial or virus. They say the illnesses can be treated with antibiotics. And we'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
