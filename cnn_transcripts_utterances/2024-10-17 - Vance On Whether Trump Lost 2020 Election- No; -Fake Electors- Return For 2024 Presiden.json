The charges were later tossed out by a judge because they weren't filed in the proper jurisdiction.But new this morning, CNN has learned that more than a dozen of those same fake electors who participated in the scheme serve as official electors for Trump in this election, including several who are currently facing criminal charges. CNN's Marshall Cohen joins us live from Washington with more on this. Marshall, this is new reporting from you. Obviously, critical here as we start to look toward potential issues with the certification process if, in fact, the -- especially the Republican ticket, Trump and Vance, challenge results of the election that they may or may not like. What have you learned here? MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, we've learned Kasie that election denialism is alive and well in the Republican Party. So remember, these are the Republicans who back in 2020 signed those phony certificates -- you just saw the clip from Nevada -- those certificates that Donald Trump tried to use on January 6 to overturn the results. So this is no little thing. And in several key battleground states the Republican Party has brought these people back into the process and selected some of them to serve as official electors this year. Look at this map, Kasie, state-by-state here. In Michigan, six of the 15 electors for this year are fake electors from 2020 and facing criminal charges. In Pennsylvania, five of the 19 for this year were fake electors. In Nevada, two of them were fake electors. And New Mexico -- not really a battleground state but Trump tried to overturn the results there anyway. One of their five electors this year were fake electors in 2020. This matters, as you mentioned, Kasie, because the Electoral College process is how we transfer power in this country from one administration to the next. And if these people were willing to subvert that process four years ago the fear is that they might be willing to do it again if Donald Trump loses.",

Sabrina Ionescu coming up in the clutch to move the Liberty to a win away from their first-ever WNBA title. And New York -- they were down by as many as 15 in this game but they came all the way back. With the game tied in the closing seconds, Sabrina makes the move and pulls up from way downtown. The 28-footer putting the Liberty up three with a second left. The Lynx would then not get off a great shot. New York wins the thriller 80-77. Breanna Stewart led the way with 30 points and 11 rebounds. But afterwards, Sabrina called it the biggest shot of her career. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Walker Buehler -- he started and pitched four innings of shutout baseball, and then the bullpen just took over. The Dodgers' staff has now thrown a shutout in four of their last five games.And as for the offense, L.A. getting three home runs in this one, including Shohei Ohtani hitting just a majestic shot in the eighth inning. The Dodgers would win 8-0 to take a 2-1 lead in that series. Game four of the NLCS will be tonight. That's after game three of the ALCS. The Yankees trying to take a commanding 3-0 lead over the Guardians. You can watch that one on TBS and stream it on Max. The first pitch just after 5:00 Eastern. All right, in hockey last night, Penguins star Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin had a milestone night together. Malkin becoming the 48th player in league history to get to 500 goals. Crosby, meanwhile, getting to 1,600 career points in this one. He's just the tenth player to ever do that. Just an incredible run of nearly two decades together for Crosby and Malkin. The Penguins beat the Sabres in overtime in that one 6-5. Finally, Davante Adams rocking Jets gear for the first time yesterday. After the trade from the Raiders he's now reunited with Aaron Rodgers. The two played together for eight seasons in Green Bay and well, now, trying to rekindle that old magic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
