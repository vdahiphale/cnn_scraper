I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And as the war in Ukraine enters its second year, the U.S. and its western allies are reaffirming their commitment to support Ukraine. Another round of sanctions is targeting Russia a year after its tanks rolled across the border, and the U.S. is also delivering another $2 billion in military support to Ukraine. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy was defiant when he spoke on yesterday's anniversary. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  If we all do our homework, victory will be inevitable. I am certain there will be victory.

All along that line and at several lines along it, and according both to Ukrainian sources and to Russian state media, what we have been seeing is an increase in the violence along that front line, and specifically along areas around Bakhmut.What we've been hearing this evening, Fredricka, now that all the ceremonies for the first year anniversary have passed, is that the result of the intensification of the fighting appears to be gains for the Russian side. That is certainly what the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, that group that's been so instrumental in allowing Russia to keep adding to the depleted ranks it has around the town as it tries to encircle it, is that a couple of key villages to the north and northwest have now fallen. And we're also hearing from the Ukrainian side how difficult it is for the Ukrainian army to continue holding the town, specifically complaining about a lack of aircraft, a lack of long-range artillery, and a lack of tanks that is making it difficult for them to keep control of it. Clearly if it fell, this would be a major gain for the Russians. They've been trying and concentrating for so much, for so long now, their resources on this town, that if it fell it would, of course, be a gateway to other towns in the Donbas, which would mean they might achieve this objective that Ukrainians fear they have, of trying to take the whole of the Donbas by the end of March. So it is that line in the east that we're looking at very carefully. Elsewhere in Ukraine, things have been relatively quiet. We've seen over the last couple of days ongoing strikes against infrastructure in places like Kherson, but more broadly those major attacks, that major uptick were the symbolic attacks that the Ukrainians have been warning off simply haven't materialized elsewhere. It is very much a focus on that front line as Russians try and push it forward, Fredricka, inch by bloody inch.",

      "sentences": "Priscilla Alvarez, Melissa Bell, thanks to both of you. Appreciate it.Let's bring in now retired general Wesley Clark. He is a CNN military analyst and former NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. Good to see you. So we've heard President Biden say that Ukraine doesn't need the F-16 fighter jets right now. If not now, when, in your view? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET), FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER:  Well, they are already using their own high-performance aircraft, the Ukrainians are, and these are somewhat obsolescent, but they're still useful. They're making air strikes every day. The aircraft are wearing out, they're replacing parts, they're bringing in parts from other countries, and they're struggling to maintain it. But if you're going to provide F-16s, you've got to have a training program for it. You can't snap your fingers and say, OK, you're going to get some F-16s. We're going to fly them over tomorrow, take over. No, it's about a nine-month training program for a Ukrainian pilot to go into an F-16. So I would like to see the training programs begin now. They should have begun a long time ago. Then you can make the decision when they need it. But here's the thing, Fredricka. We're in a seesaw battle in Ukraine right now. And as your correspondents reported, there's really heavy pressure on the east. We don't know what Ukraine has in its pocket to do the counteroffensive. They're keeping that very closely held. But if Ukraine can't pressure, what Putin wants most, which is Crimea, then he's unlikely to come to the negotiating table this year. It's going to be another year, another year after that. And so it would be really smart to start the training for these Ukrainian pilots on the F-16s right now.",

Russia has got a dictatorship, four times the population.So he mobilizes that, pushes those troops forward. He could do it this year, next year, and China is waiting in the wings. So I would be arguing that we need to accelerate our weapons deliveries, get the pressure on Crimea, announce the conditions for negotiation, don't let China do that. Say Russia out, abductees and prisoners returned, reparations, war crimes, get all that out on the table, take the initiative diplomatically, and provide the military wherewithal to drive Putin to the negotiating table.",

They had leadership there with the separatist units that were there. So it was a tougher fight. And Ukraine at the beginning only elected to hold in the east.So Ukraine had three defensive lines in the east about where they were, and they basically held. Then Ukraine concentrated on regaining terrain in the north and the south and protecting Odessa. So this is a logical consequence. Now Russia is putting its offensive power there in the east because this is the shortest supply line back to Russia. And they're operating from the stronger defensive positions in the east. So that's why this has heated up here. But what they would like to do is bleed out the Ukrainian forces, either get a breakthrough or force Ukraine to send its operational strike force in as reserves to prevent a breakthrough. [14:10:06] WHITFIELD:  I want to shift gears just a little bit, but it still pertains to Ukraine.

And that's not going to result in anything favorable to Ukraine or to the west.So we're looking with concern at the Xi visit and what he's saying, because as the intelligence indicates, there is consideration by China of upping war support. There are already, obviously, some Chinese military observers and other people, no doubt, who are closely connected, watching the Russian operations. We don't ever hear about this. I'm sure it's there because it's just a normal thing that they would do. China doesn't want to get in with Russia if Russia's losing. But China doesn't want Russia to lose. So it's a difficult position for China. Xi Jinping is still trying to rebuild his economy. His military is not quite ready to go after Taiwan, so this is not the climactic period that we're afraid of. So he's marking time on this. But what he would be happy to have is a continuing bleed-out of the west and the distraction of the west toward Ukraine rather than focusing on strengthening deterrents in Asia.",

So travel, again, the roads are already slick, but then visibility becomes a big issue. So again, travel not advised.The system itself still sitting over southern California. This is going to be an ongoing thing for the next 24 hours for many of these alerts. Heavy snow still falling through parts of the Sierra Mountain ranges and down into the southern California higher elevations. And then rain finally starting to taper back, but still dealing with the threat for flooding. Blizzard warnings, again, still in effect for that area highlighted in orange. We do have winter storm alerts all across the southwest part of the country as the system continues to take its trek farther eastward. So the four corners getting in on the action by the time we get into Sunday morning, and then, of course, the severe weather threat as we roll into the plains over the upcoming next system. Watch this, roll in as it presses into Monday and Tuesday. So more rain to come for northern California this go-around. As for the first system, you're noticing the pink, the darker pink. That's 18 to 24 more inches on top of what we've already picked up through Sunday. And then, of course, the greens and the yellows there for the valleys just south of L.A., talking about picking up close to two to three more inches of rain on top of what we've already dealt with. So, again, travel not advised, not only for the snow and ice, but the threat for flooding. If you do come across a roadway with water, turn around and find a different route. That will save you life. We talked about that system pressing further eastward, dealing with the threat for severe weather. There it is highlighted in red now, a moderate risk for severe weather for western Oklahoma.

When the Fed has raised interest rates in the past, most of the time, again, to deal with inflation, most of the time they have accidently pushed us into recession.
