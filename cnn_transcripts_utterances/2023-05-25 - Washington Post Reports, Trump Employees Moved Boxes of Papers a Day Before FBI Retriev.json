And in Ukraine, CNN is speaking with the anti-Putin Russian fighters claiming responsibility for cross border attacks. They say they're using American military vehicles during the raids. We'll get reaction from a key White House official, John Kirby. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room.

So, what we're learning is that one day before federal authorities came to Mar-a-Lago last June to pick up classified documents in return for a subpoena that video camera footage shows two Trump employees, two employees of the former president in Mar-a-Lago, (INAUDIBLE) boys moving boxes back into the storage room.As you remember, when the feds arrived at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's team said, come with us to the storage room. That's where the documents are. You can do a search. They would not let them in the boxes. What we reported is the boxes were previously moved after the subpoena arrived and then the night before federal officials came to Mar-a- Lago, they were put-back into the storage room. We're also reporting that federal investigators probing the classified documents handling of former President Trump have multiple witnesses who have told them he displayed classified information to visitors, left it out and showed it to others. And we're also reporting that before this time where they did not give the documents back, they went through what was called an apparent dress rehearsal, according to a federal judge, when the National Archives asked for the documents back before. So, out of the same playbook on how not to give the documents back was what they did with the National Archives as well.",

Most key witnesses have been interviewed. And what we see now is that a lot of the investigation is not about the former president taking the documents originally but is about efforts to get them back, how those efforts were potentially obstructed, why the former president did not want to give the documents back and whether or not at Mar-a-Lago the documents were mishandled.If you remember correctly, the former president and his team had previously said, you know, these were just boxes in a storage room. But what we're learning now is that it was a lot more than that. And there was a comprehensive effort behind the scenes to keep a lot of these documents and some of these documents were not just in a storage room, they were being showed to visitors at the Florida resort at home of the former president.",

Was this normal part of looking for classified documents or was this intentional? If it was intentional, well, who directed them to be moved? Why were they directed to be moved? Where did they go? A lot of questions, again, about intent, why these boxes were moving in and out if it wasn't a normal course of trying to search through the storage room.But even if prosecutors come to the decision that they do want to pursue potential charges of obstruction, what we've seen with this Justice Department is the attorney general, again, he doesn't make the first decision here, Jack Smith will, but this attorney general has not shown an interest in pursuing cases that are just about obstruction of justice without another underlying crime. So, even if they find evidence of obstruction, the next question is whether they find evidence of any other potential underlying crimes because that's the way so far we've seen in other high profile investigations that this Justice Department has preferred to advance.",

It's not just the waving of a wand, as he went on to talk about, and the idea he can declassify with a snap of a finger, of course I'm paraphrasing, but it also is about the substance of the information. I remind the viewers, we still do not, sitting here, know the full breadth, scope and underlying content of all of the documents. We are talking about thousands, though, that contrast with what they originally handed over, what the attorney said that they had finished the handing over and what ultimately, they recovered from a duly executed search warrant of the Mar-a-Lago estate.

Kelly Meggs receives 12 years in prison from Judge Amit Mehta today. But these two men represent two different aspects of the Capitol riot. Now, whenever Rhodes spoke to the judge today, he expressed no remorse, said that he believed the election was still illegal in 2020, that the Biden regime is -- that was his word -- he believed that was also still illegal. And the judge said that he believed Rhodes was an ongoing threat to American democracy. Now, Kelly Meggs, the deputy in the Oath Keepers unit, that was a different situation today. He expressed remorse before the judge and the judge remarked that it was astonishing to him how average Americans somehow transformed into criminals in the weeks before and on January 6th. Now, after the sentences were handed down today by the judge, Stewart Rhodes' attorneys left the courthouse and spoke about the First Amendment and that they were ready to appeal.

But in light of what he said and his belief, as one of Rhodes' attorneys emphasized that Rhodes would continue to be a danger, I would have actually expected him to be more closer to the department's request for the 25 years.The other defendant expressed remorse. Remorse goes a long way in reducing the sentence. Here buys him six less years. Rhodes being such a mastermind and his extraordinarily reckless doubling down on the lies and how he still thinks that the Biden administration is illegitimate, I would have expected as a defense counsel, as a prosecutor, that I think the judge would have gone more in line with DOJ.

There's no strategic value on that fron around Donbas. It doesn't really give the Russians much in terms of leeway or more flexibility. The Ukrainians will respond and they'll respond appropriately. They'll conduct this counteroffensive on their own terms. When, where, how they'll strike, they'll make their own decisions.What we're focused on is making sure that as they make those decisions and as they conduct those operations, they've got all the tools and capabilities and the training that they need.

In policy, in some respects, trying to say he is the true conservative in this race. We're getting some hints there might be some ideological differences and actually a debate in this primary session.And he's also just going after what he's been saying for a while, the culture of losing. He's trying to implore the importance to Republicans of winning back the White House. He makes the case he is the most electable. But, Wolf, the challenges of last evening on that failed launch on Twitter are still hanging over him. Of course, he was mocked by the former president throughout the day and certainly was not a good beginning, but he was trying to hit the ground running. And this morning, before sun up he announced they are going to do some actual campaigning, spend a couple days in Iowa next week, and then on to New Hampshire and South Carolina.

You know, as Alice noted, his strongest argument is the idea that Donald Trump can't deliver the policies that Donald Trump advocates because he's not going to win again. There is a culture of losing and that I am more electable than him. The problem is that he's mostly tied himself to Trump on issues and when he has differentiated himself from Trump, it's mostly been to move to his right, on abortion, on other questions, and today kind of signaling again that, you know, he used the January 6 investigation as an overreaction. The problem with that strategy, either Trump moving to the right is that he can undermine the ability to be more effective in the general election which is in the end the strongest argument against the former president.",
