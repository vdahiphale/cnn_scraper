The US takes another step closer to running out of money to pay its debts, despite a deadline as close as twelve days away, the high stakes negotiations between the White House and Republicans have broken down and it's not clear when they will resume. Meanwhile, President Biden will cut short his Asia trip to address the looming debt crisis. But before heading home tomorrow from the G7 summit in Japan, Biden will meet with Ukraine's president. President Zelenskyy is making a dramatic appearance at the gathering to ask world leaders for more help in the war against Russia. Zelenskyy's plea comes as Russia claims a major victory in Ukraine. Today, the head of the mercenary Wagner Group says his fighters have captured Bakhmut after months of brutal fighting. Ukraine, though, says it still holds a small portion of the city. CNN's Bill Mattingly is at the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, Japan. Bill, President Biden's meeting with Zelenskyy is just hours away. So, what is expected to come out of it?",

In fact, US officials say they are working on another defense assistance package will be hundreds of millions of dollars, and really focus on the types of munitions that are needed for what is expected to be a Ukrainian counter offensive that could launch in the coming weeks.I think that's one element of this, right. We saw this over the course of the last ten days. President Zelenskyy going to European capitals in France, in Italy, Germany, in the UK, also showing up in Saudi Arabia at the Arab League Summit before making that surprise visit. Here, doing it in person. He's been through kind of a diplomatic sprint over the course of his time since landing on Saturday afternoon here, meeting with, yes, G7 leaders. Their support for Ukraine has been steadfast and extraordinarily durable over the course of the 15- month conflict. But also meeting with some leaders whose countries have remained more neutral, even to some degree, aiding Russia in some cases, including Prime Minister of India Modi, who had a lengthy sit down and conversation with President Zelenskyy. When we talked to US officials, Paula, they make clear that is a critical piece of his visit here. Yes, there will be defense assistance. Yes, President Biden earlier this week signed off on a US participation in training of Ukrainian pilots for F-16s, made clear that the US would not block the export of F-16s from European allies. Those are critical given the conflict that's underway, but so too is meeting with and having a chance to present his side of the equation to leaders who perhaps haven't been willing to have those conversations or have been on the sidelines up to this point. So this is a critical moment both in the war for President Zelenskyy and for the G7, given the durability of the support up to this point. The fact that there's no end in sight here that's going to have to be maintained for months, if not longer, to come, Paula.",

It's a chance to talk behind closed doors about some of the things India has been up against.India needs Russia to offset its enemy, China. India still needs Russia as the supplier of the parts for most of its Soviet era weaponry. But Ukraine and India had good relations before this invasion, and that is the kind of thing that they would like the Ukrainians would like to remind them of and restore.

There's concern that if there's a Donald Trump victory in 2024, or just a GOP victory, that Washington will pivot away for support for this war.So by Biden saying yes, for instance, to the F-16s now, that leaves Ukraine in a better position in the long term. For instance, if the battle gets frozen after this latest Ukrainian offensive, Ukraine will always have those F-16s if Russia tries to attack the larger country and seize it again. Because if you might remember from the second Gulf War, those were F-16 style jets against Soviet T-72 style tanks, the kind the Russian is using now, and the F-16s won every time.",

Presidents don't get that. Elected officials, they don't have security clearances. They gain access to this material simply by virtue of the fact that they were elected. So when you're the president, you are not the one who is actually going into the logbook and doing the entries to declassify something. You're just saying to your staff, hey, this document here, I want declassified. Then you kind of take it with you. Now, should the staff have followed certain procedures? Sure.
