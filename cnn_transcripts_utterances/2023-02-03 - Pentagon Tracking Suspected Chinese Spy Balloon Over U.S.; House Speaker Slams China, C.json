The U.S. says they believe, they're very confident, in fact, that it's from China, a balloon that drifted in or came in over Canada, and has been over sensitive sites, depending on admits, over Montana. Now, they haven't specified what those sites are. But, Montana is home to several ballistic missile fields, ballistic missile silos, and perhaps that's what this surveillance balloon was going after.The Pentagon says, when this first came over and they started watching it, they did launch F-22 fighter jets. In the end, the decision was made not to shoot this down. President Joe Biden asked for military options for the possibility of what it would take to shoot this down. In the end, senior military leaders, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, the top U.S. officer, recommended against shooting it down, for a number of reasons. First, there is a risk to what's on the ground, facilities and people there on the ground, even if it is Montana and isn't densely populated. More importantly, though, the Pentagon says they don't believe this has intelligence gathering capabilities, what satellite communications above what Chinese spy satellites already have. In the end, the decision was made not to shoot it down. But, depending on emphasize that should they determine this is a high risk, they do retain that option of carrying out a military option against this, of essentially shooting this surveillance balloon down. The Pentagon will keep watching this. It's important to note that the Pentagon did bring this up through diplomatic channels both in Washington and in Beijing, and it comes at a time of incredibly high tensions with China.

But, when you look at what a balloon can do, there is a greater loitering time than some of the satellites.
