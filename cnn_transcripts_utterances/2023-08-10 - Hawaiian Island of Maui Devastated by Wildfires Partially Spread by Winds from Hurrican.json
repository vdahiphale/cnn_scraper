He has already pleaded not guilty in the earlier charges in the classified documents case.And we will see the property manager, Carlos De Oliveira. This is the first time, Poppy, that he will enter a plea. He was in a Miami court last week without a Florida barred attorney who could enter a plea on his behalf. So we expect that he will be able to enter a plea here today. This is expected to be a very quick arraignment. They will have the charges read to them by the judge when they appear in court. Those charges do include false statements, conspiracy to obstruct justice as well as concealing documents, and all of this, Poppy, relates to interviews that they gave to the FBI talking about those documents there. Both men had said that they were not aware of the documents, but the prosecutors do believe that there is video of them moving the documents around Mar-a-Lago. And of course, there are the alleged attempts by both men to try and destroy the security camera footage that would have possibly shown that. Of course, the trial for the former president is in question here because of these hearings and these codefendants that have been added to the case. Some of this could be delayed. So the question is whether or not Donald Trump will actually go to trial on this case before the presidential election, Poppy. It's scheduled for May of next year, but we will see if that sticks.",
