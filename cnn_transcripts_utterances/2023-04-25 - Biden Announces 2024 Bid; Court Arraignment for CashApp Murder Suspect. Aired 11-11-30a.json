And we still are. The question we're facing is whether, in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer. I know what I want the U.S. to be and I think you do, too.

Advisers say not to expect the president to be out there on the campaign trail to hold the large rallies but said one of his selling points for the American people is simply doing the job as president. He is going to be speaking to the union event and then hosting South Korean president here at the White House. A little later today, Vice President Kamala Harris is going to be speaking at a reproductive rights rally at a time when abortion is a mobilizing issue for Democrats. This is coming as the president is officially rolling out his campaign and drawing comparisons to the 2020 launch, when he had warned that there is a battle for the soul of the nation. And he said that battle is not complete and he needs four more years in the White House. He is also trying to warn that American freedoms are under siege by what he describes as MAGA extremists. And he used the images of the January 6th insurrection and highlighted two Republican men, one of which could be his matchup in a general election come November 2024. Take a look.

He did a lot for the progressives in the first two years and, going forward, the progressives are going to be answering a call to defend democracy.

People always say the same things about Joe Biden -- I often say the things and then I have to eat my words because, later on, it turns out he was good for progressives. I think he is will be able to hold on to the moderates going forward, because the Republicans are going to be so extreme. And he can probably pull it off.

He is currently being held without bail. Now he is expected to enter a plea this morning and we believe that the arraignment may take longer than normal, because of the discussion about his bail. But to go over again what occurred on April 4th in the early morning hours, the police documents show that Momeni and Lee were spending time together and they were in Momeni's car. Momeni drove them to a dark secluded place in San Francisco and surveillance video, according to the document, shows two people. And while the faces are hard to make out, the police say that the clothing is consistent with what the two of them were wearing earlier in the day. And the person who is wearing what Momeni had, makes a sudden movement toward the person and the victim walks away injured. And police say the defendant threw the knife, fled in his vehicle left the victim to die slowly. This was a planned attack, according to the police, and they say that the suspect brought the kitchen knife with him and they found the knife later in the vicinity of the crime scene. We also believe that there may have been some argument between them, according to the document. The suspect's sister texted Lee and had said, I just wanted to make sure that you are OK, because I know that Lee came down hard on you.
