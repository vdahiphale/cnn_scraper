      "sentences": "In the last hour, a major wins for President Biden as a Supreme Court dismissed as a challenge to his border policies. We're live at the Supreme Court with more on that and much more on CNN NEWS CENTRAL.We all want to know why OceanGate's Titan submersible suddenly imploded killing everyone on board. Investigators are searching for answers now on the ocean floor looking for debris as experts pieced together Titan's final moments. Here's what we know. Experts believe the sub suffered a catastrophic implosion, which is a sudden inward collapse of the vessel due to the tremendous amount of pressure that was on the Titan at those depths of the ocean. Officials say the implosion would have happened in a fraction of a millisecond. For example, by the time you count to one, it would have already happened when experts said no one inside would have even realized there was a problem before their deaths. As far as timing goes, the U.S. Navy now says that on Sunday, they detected an underwater sound consistent with an implosion. But at the time, it was not definitive. The Navy says at least five different major pieces of debris have now been located. But experts say it's unlikely that any bodies will ever be recovered. CNN senior international correspondent Miguel Marquez is there in Newfoundland. Thank you so much for joining us again, Miguel. You've been, you know, on this story for so long, can you give us a sense of what it is like there now, now that we know that these five souls will likely not be recovered? MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, there's a real sense of mourning here, flag at half-staff here at the park next to the harbor that some people are starting to bring flowers down to various areas of the park here. They were awaiting the arrival of the Polar Prince. The Polar Prince was the mothership for the Titan, it took it out over a week ago and then dropped it into the sea on its skids. And then the Titan went off of that into the ocean in order to get down to the Titanic wreckage. There was real, real hope, even if it was minor, even though everybody knew the stakes here and the risks, there was hope that they might find them alive. And you know, that's what this enormous search and rescue effort was undertaking that the effort in the event that they survived whatever event happened there and they were under the water in icy conditions, running out of oxygen pitch black that sort of stuff of nightmares was certainly driving a lot of the hope here that they would find them in that situation and the urgency of the search for them that it didn't happen and that their end came so quickly and merciful, I think that at least gives people a little bit of solace here today, but it is really a day of sort of reckoning.

Republican officials from Texas and Louisiana had argued that the new policies prioritizing who should be deported conflicted with federal immigration law, the court didn't see it that way.

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, it means that immigration officials will now in fact be able to prioritize who's arrested who's deported based on these 2021 guidelines. It's something that they've been blocked from doing for the past two and a half years because of this court fight that was playing out. But today, it was an eight to one decision written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, where the Court said that the attorneys general of Texas and Louisiana they just never even had the legal right to bring this challenge, saying that essentially, these Republican officials didn't have the power to force the Biden administration to make the maximum number of arrests at the border.So here's one part from the opinion, saying the states have brought an extraordinarily unusual lawsuit. They want a federal court to order the executive branch to alter its arrest policies to so as to make more arrests. Federal Courts have not traditionally entertain this kind of lawsuit. Indeed, this state cite no precedent for a lawsuit like this. So this was a battle to give you some idea where these conservative states they were trying to thwart the Biden administration in laying out the most important people to target at the border. It was a 2021 memo from the DHS Secretary. It said that border officials should essentially focus on three groups of people when deciding who to arrest who to deport, first of all, those who are a danger to national security, those who pose a threat to public safety, and also those who are a threat to border security. So Republican officials they sued. And they said that, no, you shouldn't prioritize that all illegal immigrants should be deported. Biden officials responded, but that's really impossible. They say that there are 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. DHS just lacks the ability to deport them all. So Sara, today, the Biden administration has prevailed. This, you know, they're allowed to have these guidelines go into effect. And in addition, this ruling does significantly strike down the power of Republican-led states to sue administrations, or really any political party for certain policies that they don't agree with. So a big win for the Biden administration. And now those guidelines can take effect. Sara?",

In this case they're saying, standing stops states just from going to the federal courts and saying, hey, could you do this for us? It's a political thing. You have a lot of red states trying to challenge the Biden administration. It's -- you also have other states challenging Republican administrations, when they're in office, it's actually been a kind of a conservative judicial crusade to limit standing in the past.So it would have been a big reversal of the ideas if they had done it, but it is a win for the Biden administration. What kind of clues does it offer for the big cases coming up next week, it's hard to say. You've got affirmative action and other things, which, which will have very, very big impact.",

You have to be able to say, I am somebody who got injured and I need a court to rule on it.So it's possible that the court could be saying even as they move in a conservative direction as a lot of matters, you know, we want to limit how many people come to us there was a little bit of a touch of annoyance in this ruling today, hey, why did you come to us with this case? I think it's also interesting that this was something where one federal trial judge tried to set the rule for the whole country. The Supreme Court has never ruled before and whether that's allowed, liberals use it, and also conservatives use it.

They are political, they already illogical but they also have to be well aware that public support for the Supreme Court has collapsed, it is now seen by many more Americans as just a political body. And if they just ruled, you know, in a way, like they're just expressing their political rulings, their credibility will be entirely out the window.

That's what happened with the abortion case. But on this case, and maybe on others, you might see them pulling back.It doesn't change the overall very conservative direction. But I also do think, again, that the court has to be aware that their credibility with the broad public depends on them looking like a court and not just like a panel of pundits.

And I will tell you, as much as there's no doubt that the actual implosion was instantaneous.
