They're much more pinpoint. They're designed to eliminate the threat from terrorism, they say, but also designed to try and locate some of the hostages that are being held by Hamas militants inside the Gaza Strip, or at least to look for evidence as to where they might be. And remember, this is one of the major complications of any big assault on the Gaza Strip. It's densely populated. It's got a network of tunnels underneath it. But there's also 100 to 150 hostages that are hidden somewhere, secreted around that very densely populated area.Already, Hamas say that because of the intensive airstrikes that have been carried out by Israel on areas of the Gaza Strip, airstrikes, by the way, that have leveled entire neighborhoods in Gaza City, 13 of the hostages that they've taken have been killed. That hasn't been verified. But again, it underlines the problem military planners have considering going into Gaza.",

Hezbollah has said, if you go into Gaza by land, we're going to strike. In the past, they've done that. In '26, we were both there, in fact, in northern Israel, when Hezbollah unleashed its arsenal of rockets onto it. It was a tough fight.  --",

And I think one of the reasons Hamas is saying that is because they are concerned as Palestinian nationalists that if Palestinians leave areas like north of the Gaza Strip, they'll never get it back. That will be another sort of loss of land to the Israeli state. Remember, there are millions of refugees all over this region that left their lands thinking they were going to go back. They're now in Syria, in refugee camps, in Lebanon, in Jordan, and they can't get the lands back. And Israel's built a country on it. That's what Hamas are talking about.But just a humanitarian obstacle to transferring more than a million people from the north of the Gaza Strip, which is the most densely populated to the south. It's basically not feasible, is what everyone is saying. The UN, the United States, the European Union, and it will complicate the already severe humanitarian crisis. Remember, there are more than 400,000 people in the Gaza Strip that have already been displaced. The hospital situation is dire. People are short of food, of water, of fuel.

The reason why it's relevant to what we just did now is that one of the munitions that the United States is providing Israel with as part of this latest package is additional Iron Dome missile interceptors. And beyond that, they're also providing cluster munitions as well as precision-guided munitions. I was able to speak with the Secretary of Defense today as he greeted this military cargo plane landing at the Neva Team Air Base. I asked him, first of all, about what this means for Israel, what kind of a show of support this is, but I also asked him whether he has gotten any assurances from the Israelis about how they will use this given the concern about civilian casualties.

But he also made very clear that there is no daylight between the United States and Israel. And he insisted that the shipments that we saw today, the shipment that we saw earlier this week, it is only the beginning of much more U.S. security assistance to Israel to come as Israel prepares for the next phase of its military campaign against Hamas.

And so, this was certainly kind of in the camp of strategic warning, right? And I think based on what our sources are telling us, for a lot of officials who were reading this intelligence, they were interpreting it correctly as like, look, there's heightened tensions in the region, there's something to be concerned about, something could happen here.But they were sort of viewing this as likely another round of cross- border rocket fire, you know, maybe the Iron Dome intercepts some missiles, maybe Israel retaliates, you know, maybe we even see something as dramatic as the clash that took place in 2021 in between Hamas and Israel, but they weren't in any way sort of imagining that these warnings were indicating something of the size and scale of what we did see on Saturday. As for whether or not this was shared with Israeli officials, but -- because the United States doesn't do a lot of its own intelligence collection inside Gaza, it really relies on Israel to do a lot of that sort of raw reporting and a lot of that collection, it just sort of takes the information and then analyzes it for itself. Many of the officials that we spoke to said it wouldn't necessarily be indicated for the US to sort of turn around and share these reports or share these sort of assessments with Israel, again, because much of the raw information in these intelligence assessments was coming from Israel in the first place, and Israel wasn't raising these alarm bells with the United States.",
