And we're monitoring several new developments in Israel's war against Hamas. A short time ago Israeli military officials updated the number of hostages held in Gaza. They now say there are 239 people who are being held captive from the Hamas terror attacks three weeks ago.With the safety of those hostages a top priority, today Israeli forces continue their advancement into Gaza admitting new expanded phase of this war. (VIDEO PLAYING) Gunfire and explosions were heard across Gaza today. The IDF says airstrikes hit more than 450 Hamas targets in just the last day, including command centers, observation posts and missile launch sites. There are also -- they are also rather seeing dramatic developments at Gaza's second largest hospital. The Palestinian Red Crescent says nearby Israeli shelling caused extensive damage, even as 12,000 Gaza civilians are currently sheltering there. And today, President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi about the need to protect civilians and to provide humanitarian assistance. Their conversations come as U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan warned there is an elevated risk of the conflict expanding into other parts of the region. Sources tell CNN the U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting tomorrow about Israel's ongoing ground invasion. Meantime, more humanitarian aid is slowly making its way into Gaza. Today, another 10 aid trucks were able to pass through the Rafah border crossing. Let's go now to CNN's Jeremy Diamond live in Ashkelon, Israel. Jeremy, what more do we know about Israel's military advance inside of Gaza?",

As Israel launches hundreds of airstrikes, it says, are aimed at Hamas targets, civilians say they are being caught in the middle. Scott McLean has more on the impact of the airstrikes on Gaza.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  There isn't much left of the Bilal ibn Rabah Mosque in central Gaza. The building was flattened by an overnight Israeli airstrike. People inside the neighboring apartment blocks weren't spared either. Roofs were ripped right off, everything now covered in a pale shade of gray. More than a dozen were killed and more injured, according to medical staff at the local hospital, where outside the bodies of those killed are wrapped in white sheets and marked with their names. Both the IDF and the Israeli prime minister have renewed calls for civilians to urgently evacuate northern Gaza. The apartment buildings next to the mosque were filled with people who had heeded those warnings, believing central Gaza would be safer. There were no warnings at all, this survivor says. We have seen the entire thing collapsing on us. We didn't know exactly where the hit was. We started running to get our children out. It's a miracle they survived. This man said there were no warnings. It was a strong airstrike. The people pulled us from underneath the rubble and took us to the hospital. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment. Israel said that overnight some 450 terror targets were hit and say that some strikes were directed by troops now on the ground inside Gaza. This was the aftermath of one of those strikes on a family home in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. A desperate scramble to move slabs of concrete, hoping to find survivors. Instead, they found at least one body. By daybreak, the urgency has gone. A pile of rubble is all that's left. Hospitals already at the breaking point are only getting more overwhelmed. In Deir al-Balah Saturday, doctors operated on this boy on the floor. The Palestinian Red Crescent now says that Israeli authorities called al-Quds hospital in Gaza City twice with a clear and direct threat that the hospital must be evacuated at once. Otherwise, the Red Crescent holds full responsibility for the lives of everyone inside. That amounts to hundreds of patients and thousands more people taking shelter. Israel says it called more than twice since the war began and says that Hamas is shielding themselves inside hospitals. Foreign aid is entering Gaza at a trickle. For desperation, apparent in this video of people ransacking a U.N. warehouse carrying out bags of food. Maybe a temporary lifeline for those people, but the U.N. calls it a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down as the situation in Gaza only gets worse. Scott McLean, CNN, London.

County Medical Examiner's Office, which appears to be saying that they need just more work in terms of their investigation here to let us know exactly what the cause of death was. And usually, to get a complete autopsy and toxicology report, it takes a couple of weeks here. So, we will likely by waiting a few more days, maybe weeks before we get answers to exactly what happened after this 911 call was made yesterday around 4:07 p.m. It was for a water rescue and it was LAPD who responded at 4:10 and indicated that this was now a death investigation. So, there's a lot of steps here, a lot of questions to be answered and we continue to press LAPD and of course, continue to ask the medical examiner's office to give us updates on exactly what is happening here. But at the moment, his death is being labeled as deferred, which again means that more investigation here is needed, Fred.",
