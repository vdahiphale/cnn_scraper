      "sentences": "Hello and welcome. I'm Rosemary Church. Just one day after surviving an assassination attempt, former U.S. President Donald Trump has traveled to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the Republican National Convention is set to kick off in the hours ahead. Trump could be seen pumping his fist as he left his plane on Sunday.A source says the former president underwent a precautionary CT scan after the shooting at his rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, and the results came back clear. Despite the violence over the weekend, the Secret Service says there are no plans to tighten security at the convention this week, but the shooting has prompted Trump to rewrite his convention speech, and in a new interview, he says he plans to focus on unity in an effort to bring the country together. The attempted assassination of a U.S. presidential candidate has no doubt shaken the country. The FBI says the motive for the shooting at this stage is still unknown. U.S. President Joe Biden is condemning the violence. In an address to the nation from the Oval Office late Sunday, he said it's time to tone down the heated political rhetoric. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But this is not anything new to our political process. I don't want anybody to think that this is an aberration. I mean, we've had Steve Scalise, a Republican member who was shot at a baseball game. We've had Gabby Giffords, of course, who was shot at a rally. I believe that was in 2010 or so. We've had -- since those two incidents as well, we've had Paul Pelosi, the husband of Nancy Pelosi, who was attacked with a baseball bat. We've had attempted kidnappings of the governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer. And so this isn't something that is new. And so I believe we have to take stock of where we are and figure out, as Bernie Sanders says, how do we progress and move forward safely and intelligently.",

I want to remind people, though, Joe Biden and my colleagues in the Democratic Party still have to go about prosecuting the case against Donald Trump and show that there are clear differences between the two. Mark Robinson, one of the individuals who will be speaking at therally, who is running for governor of the state of North Carolina, a swing state, just a week ago said that people need to be killed. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is one of the most avid supporters of Donald Trump, basically said the Democratic Party, it's a good versus evil and she listed out the reasons why the Republican Party was that party that was good and our party was the one that was bad. And so I still think that you show what Project 2025 would do and how that type of authoritarianism, how that type of policy would take our country back to a place where we don't want to. So I firmly believe that you can share condolences. I was one of the first people to put condolences up. I'm extremely glad that President Trump is alive. However, I'm still very clear eyed about the fact that this country would go to a place that we don't want it to go if President Trump is reelected.

Or do you expect the opposite to happen? SELLERSreally make sense for the president to step aside. I think one of the things that you saw prior to the incident that occurred yesterday was you saw the polls come back down to life. And let me just tell you and your viewers, particularly internationally, something about the polls. You know, Joe Biden is still within the margin of error in six of the seven swing state polls and down four points in North Carolina. So it's still a one- or two-point race, which is still extremely close. And in those same polls, they have Donald Trump getting 20 percent of the black vote and 45 percent of the Hispanic vote. Ms. Church, I will sell you a bridge in Brooklyn if Donald Trump gets 20 percent of the black vote or 45 percent of the Hispanic vote. Those just things are not reality. And so while we're having this discussion, I think that those calls will cease because this race has come back down to the fundamentals. Things that happened in July or June, whether or not it be a debate or an assassination attempt, are not going to change the fundamentals, which will lead to the outcome that we'll see in November.",

What we know right now is that this building where the shooter had climbed up onto and shot the former president from was outside the security perimeter.This building was about 150 yards from where the former president was speaking at the podium. And multiple law enforcement sources that I have spoken with have expressed real concern, real shock that a building that close, 150 yards or so from the podium, was not included in what they call the hard perimeter, which means it would have been subjected to an extensive security sweep, that it would have required anybody trying to enter that building to go through a magnetometer. So many more questions there. Additionally, the big question, again, centering on this building, is in what way this building did factor into the overall security plan. So another question is whether or not the building was left out of the perimeter, because for whatever reason, the Secret Service decided that it did not present a security risk. For example, did they determine that the building could not be accessed, that the doors were locked, that no one was inside, no one was likely to go inside? These are the questions that the service would have been asking as they assessed the site, as well as continuing to ask themselves in this extremely pivotal moment. The investigation is also shifting to the gunman here. This is 20- year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. What we know now is that he was not known to the FBI, he was not in any databases, that he used an AR- style 5.56 rifle that belonged to his father that was purchased legally, and that law enforcement has his cell phone, and what they're trying to do now is get into that cell phone and get some insight into what his motivation was. That is the big question, and at this moment, it is not clear why he did this. Whitney Wild, CNN, Chicago.",

It's the highest elevated event in terms of planning.You get federal, state and local authorities working together. You have an incident commander. It's a very sort of long process, 12 to 14 to 16 months. And so it's a well-structured so, in other words, it is secure. But the idea that you wouldn't respond or the Secret Service wouldn't respond to a new threat environment, which we're clearly in, seems odd to me. And I thought that that was just a weird first salvo by the Secret Service. Their job is to not only assure the protectee that they have his or her back, but that the American public can have confidence that what was once an elite law enforcement agency can perform its primary function to protect the people who represent the constitutional order, that they can continue to protect them.",

We're going to learn a lot more.I'm going to be a little bit cruel here. I think that the president should put the head of the Secret Service on leave. I think that they essentially had one job and they failed. And I think if this agency is going to move forward, people have to pay the consequences for it. You can't simply put this on, oh, it was that agent or that agent. As I said, this is their primary function and they failed. I think that if you can begin to think about the Secret Service of getting new leadership and potentially, honestly, outside leadership, the Secret Service needs an outsider to come in and to really focus on what its primary duties are and what happened in this in this terrible incident.",

First is that the FBI believes at this point that Crooks was working alone. They also said that there was no indication that Crooks had any mental health issues. Also, the FBI said at this its point they still don't have an idea of ideology or a motive for this attack, but they do believe that this answer might lie in his cell phone. However, at this point, the FBI has not been able to access the cell phone, so that cell phone is on its way to Quantico, Virginia, FBI headquarters, to get further analysis.

On one hand, we have the Chinese government offering a very safe and sanitary response, expressing concern and sympathy to President Trump.Yet, if we look at social media and then state media, which you can argue as a messenger service for the Chinese government, you could say that its promoting some themes of discontent in the United States under that narrative that President Biden brought out about this idea of foreign actors, fanning the flames. Let me go to some specific examples, first from Chinese state media, I want to focus in particular and editorial that was seen here in China, in China Daily, it's an English publication by Chinese state media. The headline there, Trump incident reflects U.S. polarization, divisions. This is commentary from state media, trying to promote this common theme of political discord in the United States. Another example from state media, China's global times with the headline there reading, shooting at Trump rally shows rise in political violence as U.S. divides further. Again, this is all serving as a tool for China to discredit the American political system globally, but also to the Chinese population. And then we have Chinese state media. We've been seeing a lot of chatter about all of this. It is typically heavily censored by the Chinese state government, but we are seeing a lot of comment, especially as its portraying the United States in a negative light. Let me point out something particular, for example, on Weibo, which is Chinese version of X or Twitter. What democracy and freedom? I now think elections in other countries are not so different from talent shows. The world is but a circus. That's one example to discredit the American political process. But we're also seeing some more general benign comments referring to the U.S. as a house of cards, we've seen references to gun violence, references as to how this may bolster Trump's chances in the upcoming election with people saying he came across as strong. Others calling him lucky. Rosemary, this is just a collection of the reaction that we're getting here from our vantage point here in Beijing.",
