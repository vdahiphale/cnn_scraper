He supports a return to slavery, says he wants to get a few slaves himself. He brags about spying on a woman's locker room during his teenage years. And that's just the stuff we can tell you on TV. Some Republicans blaming the lieutenant governor for hindering the GOP's chances in elections across that battleground state.

JEFF JACKSON (D-NC): Normally, someone running for governor, even if they turned out to underperform, wouldn't be someone who would impact the rest of the ticket, but this isn't normal.

I can't remember, and Trump helped recruitment to be lieutenant governor supported him in the primary. And that's why he became lieutenant governor, and then waited in 2023, '24, kind of -- and that's why he's the gubernatorial nominee. So he's a little more closely identified with Trump than sort of just a random local politician who happen to win the nomination. And then that case, I think it wouldn't spill over much. So I do think it hurt -- and I think that Democrats could do a pretty good job of he's a MAGA Republican. Trump's the head of the MAGA Republicans. You just can associate them. Obviously, it's not going to move tons of voters I don't think. But 1 or 2 percent, I think it could. I mean, I think in Georgia, which is the place Democratic dollars went to die until they didn't in 2020, which is sort of could happen in North Carolina, in Georgia, I think Brian Kemp, who is a respectable mainstream Republican governor, who stopped Trump from stealing the state, hit the election in 2020, but he still supports Trump. And I think if you're a moderate Republican, nervous about Trump, you're saying, well, look, Kemp's okay with him as president, it can't be that dangerous. I think it's the opposite in North Carolina. It's like jeez, this is the party Trump and Robinson. Maybe I'll stay home this time. So I think it could make a difference. In addition to running the ad that the Harris campaign is tying Trump to Robinson -- well, exploiting the ties that already exists, the ties are there. What -- what would a Democrat do?

This is another significant escalation in this 11- month conflict in the Middle East, started when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, last year. And this targets not just enemies of Israel, but some enemies of the United States.Here's CNN's Jeremy Diamond. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For the third time this week, death and destruction on the streets of Beirut. At least a dozen people killed and many more injured after Israel struck a multi-story residential building in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military says it killed one of Hezbollah's most senior military commanders in the strike Ibrahim Aqil, the group's operations chief, alongside commanders from Hezbollah's elite Radwan force. Aqil was also wanted by the United States, accused of involvement in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut. DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESMAN (through translator): There were about ten commanders who were killed and we're talking about the commanders who planned the shooting every day of missiles, rockets the operation into Israeli territory. I know that the residents of the north have been going through a very, very difficult reality in the last few months. We've been working since the 8th of October, and a very determined way to change this reality.",

There are only 46 days until Election Day, and the Harris-Walz campaign is struggling to appeal to a group of voters that could determine the outcome of the election, and that is men.That's not a group that seems to be a problem for former President Donald Trump. He plays golf with Bryson DeChambeau. He shows up on Theo Von's podcast. He meets up with boxer Jake Paul. If you don't know any of those people, talk to your 25-year-old gamer son, he knows them. I want to bring in CNN's Audie Cornish, host of \"The Assignment\" podcast, and Peter Hamby, host of Snapchat's \"Good Luck, America\". And, Peter, you argue that Trump has more of an appeal among young men, whereas the Democrats haven't had a cool guy candidate in a while, you say some of it's because of Trump's more macho brand, but other parts of it is because the economy? PETER HAMBY, HOST, SNAPCHAT'S \"GOOD LUCK AMERICA\": I think so, Jake. Thanks for having me, by the way. First of all, it's true in the polls and some of this has been noise over the -- over this last year and we haven't been able to really clarify whether it's happening. I think it's absolutely the case and probably unrecoverable for Democrats that men under 30 are drifting toward Donald Trump, an ABC/\"Washington Post\" poll from last weekend -- I'm sorry, just ABC. Forgive me Kamala Harris is winning young women by 38 points. She was only winning young men by three points. And that shows up in other polls. If you go back to Biden 2020, Hillary Clinton, Obama's two elections, they were winning young men by 20 points, double digits. So that lead has gone away. I do think there is a cultural appeal. It's -- it's pretty apparent if you talk to young man, white, Hispanic and black, that Trump just connects on some level, it could be changing notions of masculinity. It could be the fact that they're growing up in a media environment where they listen to Theo Von and Joe Rogan, and it's a nontraditional environment. But the number one issue for men in any poll, like most people, is the economy. Kamala Harris's campaign is talking about the economy, yes. But a lot of it is geared toward abortion and abortion rights, which is the number one issue for young women. And, look, the labor force is changing. It's more female, college campuses are changing. Male enrollment is falling, while female enrollment is going up. So, it's a mix of factors, but I absolutely, Jake, think that this spread could be crucial. Democrats need to win 60 percent of the youth vote to win the election.",

It doesn't show you images as to why.Audie makes a great point. A lot of this is a branding problem. John Dellavolpe who runs the Harvard youth poll, I believe he's been on your show. We all know him like the gold standard of youth polling, he is found that among young man, among Gen Z men, their values around the role of government, around health care, around climate change are actually still more aligned with Democrats. It's just a branding and messaging problem. So my question is, and I wrote this for \"Puck\" this week is who are the Democrats who can go into a Theo Von space, go on Joe Rogan. These are not Republicans. They might like Trump notionally, but just go in there and validate Kamala Harris's economic message, validate her in some ways, it used to be that Barack Obama could do that by going on SportsCenter. The media environment is so fractured now that it's more difficult to reach those audiences. And then who does it? Maybe Tim Walz. He's obviously done the football coach shtick. But it's hard to think of someone other than Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama. Just look, I don't want oversimplify just a dude type who can go talk to these other dudes.",
