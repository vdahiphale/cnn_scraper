America's top diplomat addressing hopes of a potential deal to free hostages from Gaza in exchange for a pause in fighting there. It has been a whirlwind day; nay, a whirlwind week for the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Today, he held talks with Israeli leaders. He says much more work is needed to finalize any potential agreement. Earlier, an Israeli official close to negotiations says there's no way Israel would accept a counterproposal by Hamas, which included the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. The Israeli prime minister is set to hold a news conference. One assumes he'll put more detail on this in around 2.5 hours from now, stay with CNN for that. All this as aid workers sound a new alarm about the IDF expanding operations in southern Gaza; 1 million people there are currently living out of tents with nowhere else to go. The U.N. is also raising new concerns about acute malnutrition amongst children. Jeremy Diamond covering developments from the Middle East, while Jennifer Hansler has reaction from the State Department. And Jeremy, let me start with you because, at the end of the day, we should be squarely focused on what is going on in Gaza as we speak, as we continue to monitor what is going on in mediation around this conflict. Things are as acute, it seems, as ever, not least in the south of the country. Certainly no evidence at this point that Israel is set to pause its operations.",

      "sentences": "No, certainly not. And in fact, things could get a lot worse for the civilian population in Gaza ifthere is no ceasefire agreement, if there is no hostage deal. And that's because already we are seeing a desperate humanitarian situation. We are seeing people who are gathered to collect humanitarian aid fleeing in panic as shots ring out. And around the hospitals in southern Gaza in Khan Yunis, where thousands of displaced Palestinians have been sheltering, we are seeing intense heavy fighting, reports of snipers firing at people in the streets around that hospital. And now there are also reports about the Israeli military potentially moving to Rafah, where we know that more than half of Gaza's total population has now been sheltering. And so Israeli military operations in that area would certainly be disastrous for people there. But all of this comes in the context, of course, of these ongoing negotiations over a potential deal and Hamas today returning to Israel with a counter proposal, one that would see three phases, broken down in 45 days each. And in that first phase, you would see what Israel has proposed as well in large part in terms of women, children, the sick, the elderly, those hostages being released first in exchange for additional humanitarian aid being brought into Gaza, a temporary ceasefire in the withdrawal of Israeli forces from population centers. But when you get to phases 2 and 3 of this Hamas counterproposal, you come across a total breakdown between the Israeli and the Hamas position because Hamas here, you can see, is clearly pushing for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza entirely as part of phase 2. Israel in contrast, has ruled that out effectively, with the Israeli prime minister saying that the Israeli military will continue up until victory. Only be willing to agree to a temporary ceasefire to see the release of hostages. But Hamas is clearly staking out a very, very different position. And so the, now the main question is whether or not they can reach an agreement perhaps on that first phase, where there seems to be significantly more agreement, although we should note not entirely. But certainly this is part of a process and we're going to see this process continued, including today as the secretary of state is in Tel Aviv, meeting with Israeli officials.",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, that's right because we are starting to see a lot of that pressure playing out here inthe United States. We have seen large protests, massive anger over the Biden administration's handling of the situation in Gaza and the fact that they continue to lend support to Israel with no conditions on aid or any sort of guardrails to this point. Now four months into this offensive. So we know Blinken was coming to the region to press for these humanitarian pauses. We have not seen the Biden administration call for ceasefires. This has been a continued -- something they are not calling for yet but they do want to see these pauses go into effect. U.S. officials have indicated that these pauses are crucial to getting a lot of these priorities in place, to getting the hostages out, to getting more aid in and to see these longer-term solutions come into effect as well. We know Blinkn has been traveling throughout the region in the leadup to his stop in Israel. He was in Saudi Arabia and then Egypt and then yesterday in Qatar and he was talking about this day after for Gaza. He wants to see a two-state solution. The Biden administration has been pressing for an independent Palestinian state. Now of course, this is something Netanyahu has repeated heatedly, publicly rejected. So we are going to see if he can bring this pressure to Netanyahu, who'd to say, look, your Arab neighbors are ready to help but you have to be committed to making these hard decisions to get to a two- state solution. And to this point, we have not seen Netanyahu prepared to do so. So we'll be watching and waiting to see what both the prime minister and the secretary have to say later today, Becky.",

It is apretty wide ranging and detailed proposal. It has to be said. And Jeremy, pointing out there, just doesn't talk specifically to the hostages that remain in Gaza and the truce, the temporary truce in the first instance, Hamas looking for a permanent truce going forward but also what happens in the aftermath of this when those guns ultimately go silent. Really important stuff and we will continue to monitor. To both of you, thank you very much, indeed, both for your reporting and for the legwork on this. Well, Ukraine says a massive Russian missile attack has hit at least six parts of the country, including the capital. Four people were killed by a strike on Kyiv; 38 others were injured, including a pregnant woman, according to local officials. And you can see large fires burning across several stories of this apartment building, for example. Parts of the city also left in the dark after the mayor says missile fragments downed power lines. On the front lines, Ukrainian troops face a growing challenge. They aren't just running low on weapons and ammunition, as CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports, they are also struggling with a shortage of manpower. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The explosions are dangerously close as the drone team from the 92nd assault brigade set up their bird, attach the bombs and head off into battle. While drone technology is often seen as the realm of tech savvy youngsters, one of the pilots here is over 50. \"One way or another, everyone should serve,\" he says. \"It is our duty to defend our land, our families, our motherland. If you do not want to fight, what kind of citizen are you?\" Ukraine is badly outgunned by the Russians but the reality is they're also outmanned. Unable to recruit enough soldiers willing to join the military, especially younger ones. Decimated and exhausted, Ukraine's top general, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, has called for a new mobilization drive, maybe including up to 0.5 million people. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is unconvinced. And sources tell CNN he has informed Zaluzhnyi he'll be fired with differences over troop numbers a key reason why. Mobilization is unpopular and in front of Ukraine's parliament, some are protesting for their spouses to be de-mobilized. Antonina (ph) says her husband is too old to be serving this long. \"My husband is 43 years old,\" she says. \"It is difficult for him to endure all this time on the ground, jumping from shells and performing all those tasks at the front line. And there are many people like him.\" \"I'm here for my dad to come back,\" her son says. But on the front lines, like in this rocket launching unit, some say they need more people to give those who've been in combat, nearly nonstop, a breather. The commander of this launcher is 59. In Ukraine, people can only be drafted until they're 60. \"All of Ukraine is at war and each and every man who thinks he lives in Ukraine must go through it,\" he says. \"It's irreversible. People here are tired.\" Ukraine's parliament is working on a law to make mobilization more appealing and possibly allow soldiers to exit the military after three years. But back at the drone unit, they don't believe the talk. \"There should be no illusions,\" he says. Also, among soldiers whom politicians have given hope that there will be demobilization, there will not be any -- Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We are not. But the feeling is there and we have to improve that. SHUKLA (voice-over):  Following an explosive investigation from the news outlet Correctiv, AFD lawmaker, Dr. Hans-Christoph Berndt hailed the so- called remigration plan discussed as a promise. At this hotel, far-right leaders suggested mass deportations, including for German citizens of foreign origin. HANS-CHRISTOPH BERNDT, HEAD OF ALTERNATIVE FOR GERMANY, BRANDENBERG (through translator):  It is not only legitimate, it is necessary to think about remigration. Since 2015, more than 10 million foreigners have entered the country and a large proportion of them are not willing to integrate and live in German society but are instead building parallel worlds. The federal government is not putting the interests of the indigenous population first. SHUKLA (voice-over):  In the real world, the report sparked waves of anti- AFD protests. Berndt's response is to shout conspiracy. BERNDT (through translator):  Yes, without the government campaign, people wouldn't be out in the street. I am very positive.
