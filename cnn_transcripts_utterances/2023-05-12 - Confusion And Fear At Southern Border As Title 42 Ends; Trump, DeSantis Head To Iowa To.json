      "sentences": "Good evening.There is still concern tonight that there may be a rush of migrants across the southern US border after a pandemic or health policy known as Title 42 that allowed authorities to quickly expel migrants seeking asylum was allowed to lapse. Earlier this week, President Biden had warned it could be \"chaotic for a while.\" Tens of thousands of migrants are believed to be massed in northern Mexico and two Texas counties issued disaster declarations in preparations. Today however, there is no evidence of a rush, at least not an immediate one. This video from the US-Mexican border is probably the best evidence of that. On the left, you see the border as it was yesterday with migrants camped just outside it; on the right, the border as it was today. There's a lot of theories of where those people went. We'll get to that in a moment. A source tells CNN that according to account by Border Patrol, around 23,400 migrants were in custody as of this afternoon. That's slightly lower than earlier this week. Nevertheless, the administration is still preparing for more migrants seeking asylum. ICE, for instance, is adding 5,000 detention beds. There's also the political chaos where Republican calls for the border to be shut down and the Biden administration saying Republicans are trying to \"sabotage\" its efforts on the border after a federal judge's ruling in Florida. Ed Lavandera starts us off tonight from El Paso, Texas with the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): After Title 42 ended late Thursday night, some migrants discovered they didn't make it in time. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) LAVANDERA (voice over): This father and son from Venezuela were turned away, but he says the goal is to get to the other side to find a way to reach the United States, but we'll have to wait and figure it out.",

More than 23,000 are now in CBP custody, down slightly from earlier this week. But the end of Title 42 did not trigger the historic wave of migrants rushing to cross the border Friday that was predicted.

It is designed to be able to hold about a thousand migrants at a time. And as you can see, construction crews are working to expand and we're told by CBP officials, in June they'll have room for another 1,000 migrants to hold at this facility. LAVANDERA (voice over): In Brownsville, dozens of buses line up near an intake facility, but a major humanitarian group in the area tells CNN they only had one bus of migrants arrive today. About 155,000 migrants were estimated to be in shelters and on streets in Mexico waiting to enter the US, a source familiar with federal estimates said. Migrants will still risk their lives to make it to the US and from now on, people who cross the border illegally will face a tougher path to requesting asylum. Many will be deported, like this group who were shackled and led onto a repatriation flight like this one leaving for Guatemala on Thursday. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And then I was just down there where Ed was talking a few minutes ago, I just got back from there and the numbers are way down. On Monday, we saw about 3,000 people there. And the Border Patrol, with assistance from a lot of agencies went in and handed out handouts to be able to help them register and get processed, so they could go into the processing centers and be able to go on to whether it is shelters, immigration centers, or anything like that. But the numbers have changed and then I was in Juarez a week ago and they had told me, it was ten to twelve thousand people ready to cross at any moment. I went into their shelters, and there were 20 people in there. And now, I went in two days ago to see what to expect.

The evangelical base, as you mentioned, is a real religious group, you know, they really want to see a national federal ban on abortion. They want to see this go as far as they can toward protecting life. And so, you know, they're looking at Donald Trump with, you know, a bit of a complicated lens, right? You know, he created the pathway, you know, for Roe versus Wade to be overturned. But after the midterm elections, he turned around and blamed, you know, Republicans' focus on abortion for losing some of those fights. And so, in that vein, I think Republicans are a little bit skeptical, but they also look at him as being, you know, the most pro-life president in history. And so they've got a mixed bag with Donald Trump. But you've also got people who really just want to win the election. They want to be Joe Biden.
