My colleague Ana Cabrera has the day off today.So, you had the turkey and the stuffing, the beans, greens, potatoes, tomatoes. Maybe you already had leftovers for breakfast or lunch. Now it's time to burn those calories with Black Friday shopping. But, this year, high prices and wavering consumer confidence could throw a wrench into the holiday shopping tradition. That's putting retailers and economists on edge. To get a look at what's happening on the ground, let's go to one of the busiest department stores in the United States. CNN's Alison Kosik is live from the Macy's flagship store in New York City. And, Alison, it looks like there's no shortage of Black Friday shoppers where you are.",

      "sentences": "Boris, the crowds are definitely growing as the afternoon goes on right around here where I'm standing at Herald Square, the iconic Macy's, the department store right behind me, everybody feeling festive, everybody out, beginning their holiday shopping, because Black Friday is the unofficial start to the holiday shopping season.And the deals and discounts, that's what's expected to really bring out record crowds for this holiday shopping season. Just this weekend, meaning the holiday shopping weekend that began on Thanksgiving Day, all the way through Cyber Monday, 166 million people are expected to get out there and shop; 115 million of those are just expected to shop only today, on Black Friday, across the country. And most of those people are expected to shop inside stores, because what they're going -- what they're going for is those deals and discounts, because weighing on their minds, of course, is inflation. That seems to be the elephant in the room these days, how to sort of manage the budget and buy those gifts and keep that festive atmosphere going when you're dealing with inflation. So a lot of shoppers that I have been talking to said they are managing their budgets. They are really sticking to their budgets this year. And they're really weighing on their decisions on how to decide on which gift they're getting based on the discount, how deep it is. Also, one thing to think about, next week -- next week, the National Retail Federation is expecting that spending will increase 8 percent this holiday shopping season to around $940 billion to $960 billion, so a lot of positivity for this holiday shopping season, despite the weight of inflation -- Boris.",

      "sentences": "Yes, interesting to see spending going up even as inflation is as high as it is.Let's figure out why. Alison Kosik from the Macy's in New York, thank you so much. We're digging deeper now with nationally syndicated personal finance columnist Michelle Singletary. Her latest book is \"What To Do With Your Money When Crisis Hits: A Survival Guide.\" Michelle, we're grateful to have you today. At this time last year, the concern was supply chain issues. This year, it's inflation. But as Alison just laid out for us, holiday sales are forecast to be up, especially compared to last year. Retail sales actually surged last month. So why do you think it is that consumers are seemingly ignoring inflation? MICHELLE SINGLETARY, PERSONAL FINANCE COLUMNIST, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\":  Well, I think there's still a lot of pent-up demand from when people were shut in and mostly just shopping from home during a couple of holiday seasons. And people -- so, people are out and about. They want to treat their family members. And so they are spending. Now, they may not be spending as much, even though the numbers up. The dollar isn't going as far as it used to go and did go a year or two. And so people's budget might be $800 to $900, but they're not getting as many items for that money. But they're still shopping. And so I think people have cut their list down, so that their budget might be the same, but maybe they're buying for fewer people.",

So, if there is a popular item where they have a lot of, expect big discounts on those areas. So it's still the big holiday shopping things, electronics, phones, televisions, whatever the trendy toy is, clothes. So all of those major items are where people go for in the stores. And I think you are going to see more discounts, particularly when you go to the brick and mortar stores. But don't ignore online. What I do is, I have my phone while I'm shopping in the store, and I'm price- matching to make sure that I'm getting the best deal.",

Same thing with ordering online. It may not get there in time. I mean, I ordered something from a retailer like four weeks ago, and I still don't have because it was a popular item. It was just something for me personally. And I imagine my stress level would be higher if I was trying to send that to somebody for the holiday. So if it's something that your heart desires, and you really want to get it for someone, I would say get it when you see it, because it may not be there if you wait.",

He had been on the Carnival Valor which was sailing to Cozumel, Mexico, from New Orleans. He was last seen on the ship Wednesday night. He wasn't reported missing until Thursday afternoon. And that's where CNN Nick Valencia picks up the story. Nick, this is nuts. This story usually doesn't end in a happy ending like this.",

It's the wildest story of the day, and I think this guy, this 28-year-old is going to have a story for the rest of his life, Boris.The U.S. Coast Guard says he was a passenger on the cruise ship for Carnival Valor, and that was scheduled to depart Wednesday from New Orleans to make its way for a five-day cruise to Cozumel, Mexico. And it was about 11:00 p.m. that this 28-year-old man's sister says that they were at the bar. And it was at 11:00 p.m. that he said he was on his way to the restroom, but he never came back. She went to bed, wakes up the next morning, reports him missing at about noon. They check the vessel. And it was at about 2:30 that the Carnival cruise Valor locator -- notified, rather, the U.S. Coast Guard. They got involved in a search-and-rescue operation. The ship actually stopped, retracing its route to try to participate in that search-and- rescue and spot him floating in the water. He was eventually located by a crew for a bulk carrier. They spotted him floating. And, by our math, it was about 8:30 p.m. That's more than 20 hours that he was potentially in the water in the Gulf of Mexico. We understand it was about 70-degree water, we heard this morning from a lieutenant with the Coast Guard that we're about to hear in just a little bit. Carnival Cruise releasing a statement to CNN saying, in part: \"We are greatly -- we greatly appreciate the efforts of all, most especially the U.S. Coast Guard and the mariner who spotted the guest in the water. We will defer to the U.S. Coast Guard officials on any other information to be released.\" Just really quick, this man, we understand, is 28 years old. He is listed in stable condition, was transported to get medical attention in New Orleans. And we are told that, as of 7:00 a.m. this morning, the man's family was still on the vessel. So we don't know if they were just unable to get off, but, again, Boris this man in stable condition with a miracle of a story on Thanksgiving -- Boris.",

We launched a 45-foot vessel from Station Venice, a helicopter out of Air Station New Orleans, and a plane from ATC Mobile, understand we did have a big time delay.

So, we executed the mission with that mind-set, with the goal of attempting to locate him. Just to give perspective of how broad the search area was going to be, the vessel had tracked about 200 miles into the Gulf of Mexico. And we kind of determined an approximate search area.

And authorities are responding with more lockdowns, mass testing and quarantine. And people here are getting more and more frustrated. Adding to that anger is a fire that broke out in the capital of China's far west Xinjiang region on Thursday night; 10 people were killed and nine injured in a fire at an apartment building. Most parts of Xinjiang have been under lockdown for more than 100 days. The deadly fire sparked nationwide outrage, because widely circulated videos, which have now been censored in China, show that COVID lockdown measures very likely delayed firefighters from getting to the scene. State media claims that people in the compound were allowed to leave the building. However, videos show fire trucks unable to get close to the scene because the compound entrance was partially blocked. The video shows it's blocked with fences, tents, and metal barriers that are normally used as part of COVID measures. The video shows smoke and flames coming from a high floor of the building, but the water failing to actually reach the fire. What adds to the tragedy is that those who died in the fire likely spent their last three months largely confined to that building, if not entirely. This tragedy really struck a chord with the public here, because these scenes of suffering and tragedy have played out over and over again since the start of the pandemic, so many stories of people struggling to get enough food, necessities and emergency care in lockdown. Three years into these harsh policies, frustrations are more frequently turning into protests, which are normally rare in authoritarian China. So, last week, in the southern city of Guangzhou, some residents revolted during lockdown by tearing down barriers and marching through the streets. Then there were violent clashes at the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou this week. But, still, there is no end in sight to zero COVID. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
