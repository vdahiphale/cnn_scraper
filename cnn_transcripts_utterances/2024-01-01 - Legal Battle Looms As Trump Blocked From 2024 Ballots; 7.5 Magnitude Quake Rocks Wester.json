Plus a powerful 7.5 earthquake striking western Japan. Thousands of people fleeing coastal areas. Over fears of a tsunami. We'll have the latest on that. In just hours into 2024, Russia launches intense attacks across several key Ukrainian front lines. Vladimir Putin saying more strikes are coming. We're following these major developing stories and many more. All coming in right here to CNN News Central.A new year and a new test for American democracy as several high stakes cases could put the 2024 campaign calendar on a collision course with the Supreme Court. And it all centers on former President Donald Trump. Tomorrow, Trump's lawyers expected to appeal a pair of highly controversial decisions that bar him from the 2024 ballots in Colorado and Maine. There are also Trump's pending criminal cases. And some key aspects of those are also on a fast track to the Supreme Court. And did we mention primary season is now in full swing? Just look at that calendar. If it seems overwhelming to you, imagine logistics of being a part of the Trump campaign and the legal teams that are dealing with this right now. I want to break it down with Lawfare's courts correspondent, Anna Bower. Anna, first, should we expect the Supreme Court to clarify the insurrectionist ban issue once and for all? Or could the justices end up landing just on a narrow decision that paves the way for more controversy?",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, Brianna, first of all, Happy New Year. And thanks for having me on this first day of 2024. I think that the Supreme Court is very likely to take up this appeal that relates to the disqualification in this landmark ruling from the Colorado Supreme Court, in which they found that Donald Trump under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment ought to be disqualified because he engaged in insurrection. I do think that this is something that the Supreme Court must take up.We've been tracking these nationwide efforts to bring litigation related to Section 14 -- excuse me, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. And we found that there's over at least 30 challenges that have been brought. There are more challenges that are coming in other states. So, it is something that is going to continue to be an issue as we go through the primaries and then into the general election. So, I do think that it's something that the Supreme Court certainly will take up as to whether they will actually clarify, though, whether what it means to engage in insurrection and whether Donald Trump did. I don't think that it's something that the Supreme Court will actually clarify, though, whether what it means to engage in insurrection. That is to be seen. There are some ways that they could skirt the issue. They could, for example, decide that the Section 3 does not actually apply to the office of the presidency. Or they could decide that the clause is not self-executing, and that Congress would actually have to implement some kind of legislation to kind of make it effective. So, there are a few different ways. Potentially, the justices could kind of skirt the issue of actually declaring whether or not Donald Trump engaged in insurrection as it relates to the events of January 6th. It is a very contentious issue. And I think that the court, having gone through some of the challenges to its credibility that it has in recent months, is going to be very cognizant of just how highly politicized this issue is. So I certainly won't be surprised if they end up avoiding the issue and deciding on other grounds.",

      "sentences": "So, I don't know whether Clarence Thomas will recuse himself, but it is important to note that he has previously recused himself in cases related to January 6th committee litigation. If you recall, there was a case in which the January 6th committee attempted to get documents from John Eastman. Some of those documents included emails between Eastman and Jenny Thomas, Clarence Thomas's wife. And Clarence Thomas did recuse himself in that case.There is a federal law that requires that a judge recuse themselves when there might be some reasonable question as to the appearance of impartiality. And that includes instances where, for example, they might reasonably believe that their spouse could be a material witness in the case. And again, Jenny Thomas is someone who had communications with people like Mark Meadows about efforts to reverse the results of the election, had communications with people like John Eastman, and is someone who was at the January 6th rally and Trump's speech. So, it is certainly the case that there is a colorable argument here that, um, she could be someone who might be a material witness in as it relates to the Department of Justice case against Trump. So there is an argument there for Clarence Thomas's recusal based on all of that. However, there are some signs that we've already seen that potentially Clarence Thomas will not recuse. If you recall, there was just a Supreme Court petition brought by special counsel Jack Smith in relation to the federal election interference case against Trump. And in that petition, where Jack Smith asked the court to kind of jump ahead of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and decide this presidential immunity issue, the court declined to go ahead and do that. And in doing so, there was no indication in the denial of the petition that Clarence Thomas had recused himself from voting on whether to accept or deny the petition. So that might give us an indication, Brianna, that Clarence Thomas may not recuse himself from the Trump-related criminal cases or some of the Section 3 of the 14th Amendment cases. And there's not really much that can be done as to Senator Raskin's question about, excuse me, Congressman Raskin's question about what could be done if he does not recuse himself. At the lower courts, you can seek something called a mandamus to kind of force a judge to disqualify or recuse themselves if they refuse to do so. But there's really no equivalent at the Supreme Court level. It's something that's a decision of the justice themselves. And so, if Clarence Thomas decides not to recuse, there's really not much that can be done.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Brianna, that's right. So, if you look just today at all of the polls in the early voting states, Donald Trump clearly is the GOP frontrunner and by a pretty significant margin. And we have one poll here I want to show you from Iowa and kind of break down what exactly we're looking for as we kick off this primary caucus season. This year, Iowa poll has Trump at 58 percent, Ron DeSantis at 22 percent, Nikki Haley at 13 percent, Vivek Ramaswamy at four percent and Chris Christie at three percent. So we're going to see what's going on in Iowa. Now, the Chris Christie is not surprising. He has spent almost no money in Iowa. He has been solely focused on New Hampshire. But what is surprising, at least maybe surprising, is that DeSantisstill has a big gap between he and Donald Trump. DeSantis really is all in on Iowa. This was the state that he has said that he wants to win. And when you talk to Iowa operatives, they basically believe that he needs to win this state. Now, when it comes to Donald Trump what they want to do is they want to make sure this margin is as big as possible because they're really going to be setting the tone for the rest of the primary season. You look in New Hampshire, while Donald Trump still has the lead, there really is getting to be a smaller and smaller gap, not between Trump and Ron DeSantis, but between Trump and Nikki Haley. Nikki Haley, again, seeing a small surge there, but all of the tone is going to shift and a lot of what we see is going to change based on what happens in Iowa.",

Now, New York Times did a poll in which Joe Biden was trailing Donald Trump overall nationwide, 44 percent to 46 percent. Donald Trump with 46 percent. But perhaps more interesting was our CNN polls, where we really went into these critical swing states, particularly Georgia and Michigan, both states that were won by Biden back in 2020, that have him trailing by a pretty significant margin.If you look at Georgia, Trump is beating Biden in this hypothetical poll, 49 to 44 percent. In Michigan, where Biden really won by a larger margin in that state, he is trailing by 10 points, with Trump at 50 percent. And Biden at 40 percent. But again, it is still very, very early, Brianna.",

Local media reporting that first responders are rescuing people as we speak. And public broadcaster NHK says about 1,400 people are stranded on bullet trains even more than 11 hours after the quake hit. One video shows the sheer power of the shaking as this occurred around 4.10 p.m. Japan time.

      "sentences": "You know, Brianna, I received a text from a friend of mine in Japan who lives in Tokyo, which is a good 200 miles away from where this happened. So it is clear that this quake was very intense. As you mentioned, there are rescues taking place, but I think right now we're still about three hours or so away from sunrise in Japan. And broadly speaking, rescue teams are, one, assessing what the current situation is, and then, two, trying to take action. One issue that they are going to sadly have to confront is homes, or homes that have been completely destroyed. We have some video right now that we will soon show you of a home that essentially was flattened, pancaked, and it looks like someone almost dropped a bomb on it. It just collapsed.You see here people driving up, to this home. If you could hear some of their reactions, there's a woman in Japanese saying something to the effect of, oh, my God, oh, my God. It's that startling. But as you can see, this home is basically rubble, and that's the big concern, that people may be trapped. Some rescues, we know, are taking place now, but there is going to be this broader issue of just how widespread scenes like this truly are. We know a big issue that is facing this part of the country right now is  infrastructure. Five highways are damaged. As we've seen from the video, many roads are cracked. There are some problems -- at least one airport. So, getting people, getting supplies from point A to point B, things such as food, clothing, water, even emergency responders is going to be a challenge. There was a report that doctors at one point were having a hard time getting to health care facilities because the roads were blocked and in such poor shape. Brianna, we don't know how many people right now are homeless or stranded, but this happened in the middle of the day or late in the afternoon on New Year's Day. As we saw, people were out shopping. A lot of people are stuck. And as such, at least 20 schools have been set up as emergency shelters. That's certainly a number, Brianna, that could grow in the hours ahead.",

Dr. Prager, first, what stands out to you about this particular earthquake?DR. ELLEN PRAGER, CHIEF SCIENTIST STORMCENTER COMMUNICATIONS: Well, it's considered a major quake. 7.5 is a big quake and it was shallow. And that's why you're seeing a lot of the impacts in the homes and in buildings and roads cracking. And because it was so shallow and such a high magnitude quake, it's those things combined.",

And I wonder what you have observed in the shaking, because it does appear at one point that the shaking is moving objects one direction. And then it kind of moves them perpendicular in direction. Did you notice anything about that?DR. PRAGER: Well, you're going to sort of see that in general, especially with something where you've got these ground waves like that. But for me, the other thing that stands out is, one, Japan has an early warning system. So even seconds in advance, they knew something was happening. And their building codes are really good. And so, if this kind of quake had happened somewhere else, the damage would, I mean, there's no damage, but it would have been catastrophic in other places.",

They were good about putting the warning out, getting people to high ground as soon as possible and keeping the messaging going. I think that was also very impressive that they didn't just put it out. They kept telling people where to go. They haven't even said it's safe to return because there could be changes in water levels still. Things could have been damaged. They don't want people going back to the coast.
