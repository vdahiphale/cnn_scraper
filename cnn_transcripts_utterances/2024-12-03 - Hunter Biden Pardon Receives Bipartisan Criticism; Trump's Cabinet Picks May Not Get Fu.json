Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. With just weeks until inauguration day, a tension in Washington and around the world, shifting rapidly away from Joe Biden and toward President-elect Donald Trump. The president, as you saw there, right now on one of his last trips abroad as president. The trip is designed to showcase American investment and aid to Africa. But it's been overshadowed by Biden's announcement of a sweeping pardon for his son, Hunter. That decision, managing the rare feat of uniting Democrats and Republicans in condemnation of the president's reversal of his repeated claims that he would not issue the pardon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): He didn't need to tell the American public, I will not do this. And he did. And when you made a promise, you've got to keep it. SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R-ME): His decision further undermines the public's confidence in our judicial system. SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO): It just gives the American people a sense that there's one system for the rich and powerful, and another system for everybody else. SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI (R-AK): I was surprised. I was disappointed. I think it was -- it was out of bounds. SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): We operate under the rule of law, and we hate to see precedents being set. SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE (R-AL): Don't lie to us. Don't tell us you're not going to do it, and then do it. That's not what a president should be like. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As Peter Baker of \"The New York Times\" writes, quote, \"Mr. Biden issliding toward the end of his presidency in lackluster fashion. He has largely ceded the stage to Mr. Trump, who is already conducting his own foreign policy. Withdrawing from the fray, Mr. Biden maintains a light public schedule and has not held a news conference or given an interview since the election. He was such a marginalized figure during a recent international summit in Brazil that when he was late for a group photograph, other world leaders did not bother to wait and went ahead without him.\" This emerging reality being made clear yesterday when we learned that it is the president-elect, and not the president, who's been invited to the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral, set to be held in Paris on Saturday. Sources tell CNN the invitation came from the office of French President Emmanuel Macron, who was also the first world leader to congratulate Trump on his victory last month. The trip will be Trump's first since the election and will Mark his grand reentrance on the global stage. Shall we remember what that was like? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, I do think there is a cost that comes with that. And I wish that he had done that differently. I don't think the pearl clutching from -- from Republicans about, again, you know, we've somehow -- Biden has somehow, like, blown the doors off -- you know, using the justice system in an independent way. I don't think that carries a lot of water. I do understand why Democrats are frustrated that Biden was not more forthcoming about how he was thinking about this. MATT GORMAN, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Look, I think Democrats were the ones that lectured the Republicans throughout the entire campaign that we were the ones that were saving democracy. We were the ones that were upholding the rule of law, in a way, conveying this superiority. And it's been laid bare that they weren't. And I mean, I remember being on the show in June, and Alex Thomas and I were talking about the fact that, like, hey, he could pardon, you know -- like, I would not be surprised if this happened. And honestly, I would have respected it more if he just said, you know what? Bleep you people. I'm not letting my son rot in prison during my -- you know, who knows. Like, another last decade of life, possibly. I'm not letting that happen. I don't care. I have the power to do it. Instead, I think to even your point, like, he concocted this self- righteous cloak, where it was just a bunch of baloney. And really, what it was about was I had the -- I had the ability to get this done. You wish you had it for your family, possibly, but I do. So, I'm going to do it. And I think that is where it's just clearly -- clearly lays bare the -- kind of there's two sides to the judicial system. And I think tactically, this makes it a lot easier for, say, someone like a Kash Patel to get through where it lay -- it really does somewhat convey what he's been saying and has a lot more conveyance now.",
