      "sentences": "Yes, a lot.M.J. Lee, thank you so much. Joining us now CNN political commentator, Shermichael Singleton. He's a Republican strategist, and Tara Setmayer, who is a former GOP congressional communications director and the co-founder of the Seneca Project. She backed Harris for president. And, Tara, I wonder what you think. You hear from that source saying, stop sh-tting, you know what, on us on the campaign. What blame do they deserve, not deserve, considering this was a pretty historically short time to pull off a campaign. What's your assessment? TARA SETMAYER, FORMER GOP CONGRESSIONAL COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR &amp; CO- FOUNDER, SENECA PROJECT: Well, I mean, whenever you lose, the finger- pointing begins rather quickly. And for those of us who we're pro-democracy and were extremely concerned about what a second Donald Trump term would look like for the future of our country, it was incredibly disappointing. But we also have to understand that it was a truncated campaign. They ran -- actually they ran a pretty good campaign under normal standards. But it's difficult when they make certain decisions to do rely on certain groups or consolidate money. I didn't grow up in -- politically, in the Democratic Party. I come from a Republican world and we did things very differently as far as messaging and how we messaged. Which is why, from my bipartisan super PAC, we took some of that messaging for women to try to speak very directly, very -- you know, meet people where they are. Not too highfalutin. Sometimes Democrats have a tendency to bring a policy to a political warfare fight. And messaging matters. I think there were missed opportunities. But all things considered, they actually ran a pretty good campaign. But ultimately, things, messages didn't break through. And I hope, like Republicans did in 2012, that Democrats do a postmortem to assess where they went wrong. Because the country -- I don't think a lot of people who voted for Donald Trump this time around, because they we're dissatisfied for whatever reasons with the Biden administration, are fully aware of what they have wrought on this country moving forward. I really don't think so. And there, it comes from a failure of certain messaging.",

Whether the question is an issue of messaging or the -- as Tara put it, the situation the Biden administration wrought on so many of the American people when it comes to the economic issues that folks are facing, the costs everyday goods.And the fact that Harris had to have led this truncated 100-ish day campaign. Was there more she could have done that would have tilted the scales or was this inevitable? How do you see it?",

      "sentences": "I mean, not necessarily. I know a lot of people have compared this race to 2020 in terms of the vote count.But 2020, in my opinion, Boris, was a bit unprecedented because you had unprecedented absentee ballots, vote by mail because of the Covid pandemic. So for my perspective, I've gone all the way back to 2016 to really try to compare numbers. And in that case, Vice President Harris actually received three million more votes than Hillary Clinton in 2016. Obviously, Donald Trump received 10 million more votes compared to 2016 this time around. I think that's a more accurate place to start if you're going to try to compare how her overall performance was. I agree with Tara, messaging was certainly a part of the problem. Tara comes from GOP politics and she knows how we message, and we go to war when we're trying to win electoral campaigns. Because the objective is to win. Also I think there is some policy and ideological positions that Democrats moved way too far on the left. And they need to recenter themselves. Whether that's cultural issues, where a lot of people who are middle of the road are thinking, wait a minute here, this is a bridge too far for me. You have to be super careful in how you talk about every single issue. I don't think that's how most people live their lives and when they're having regular conversations with friends and with their families. There's obviously some detachment there. And regardless of what people may think or like or dislike about Donald Trump, people do see some authenticity in the way he communicates. And I think that was sorely missing on the other side. And I think that's going to be a part of that restructuring that Democrats are going to have to do as they move forward for the next two years and the next four years.",

      "sentences": "Well, first, I want to be clear, when I said voters are unaware what they brought on the country by voting, I meant by voting for Donald Trump and ushering in another administration with him given the chaos we saw and lived through in 20 -- after 2017.This time around, he has no guardrails. And he has worse people around him. And so his extremism, a lot of what he said he was going to do and implement, I don't know that people are fully aware of what that's going to mean and what the consequences are. And to Shermichael's point about crime and immigration, the economy and our standing in the world, those are all things that are interestingly not traditional Republican perspectives. Yes, people are -- we should be concerned about what's happens and pay attention to what's going on, whether we leave NATO, we leave Ukraine hanging out to dry and cozying up to Vladimir Putin. Elon Musk is now apparently involved in foreign policy decisions. As reported today, he was on call that with Donald Trump and Zelenskyy. And these are all things people really have no idea about. Do I think that there was sexism and racism involved in some of the reasoning behind why people didn't vote for Kamala Harris? Sure. Yes. I mean I'm a woman of color. I live it every day. I see it here, the vitriol and the comments. And we saw what came out of Donald Trump's world, what MAGA world thought of women. You see it online. You see it by the people he's surrounded with what they think of women. Which is partially why we thought for sure that there would be enough women, particularly white women, who would vote their interests and vote against what Donald Trump and what MAGA plans to do for women, and yet white women overwhelmingly still voted for Donald Trump. Now, women overall voted for Kamala Harris. But suburban white women made different decisions here. And we shall see what that looked like. How when you lose a right, it does -- it's very difficult to start getting those back. And perhaps the implications and the lives lost and the women who have lost their fertility and the horror stories we've heard about the practical implication of taking away reproductive rights from women hasn't been fully felt yet across the country. But we will. We will see.",

When you vote for Donald Trump and MAGA, you don't get to pick and choose.Well, I like the tax cuts, but I don't like the fact they are going to mass deport people or call women, you know, second-class citizens or think woman shouldn't have a right to vote or should get back into the kitchen, or that Haitians are eating dogs. You don't get to pick and choose. You own all of it. So I think, by acknowledging that, that is important to be intellectually dishonest and say that you don't own all, everything that comes with MAGA, pointing out those things. And a lot of people can rationalize in their own minds that they voted because of the economy or the cost of eggs, but they really need to take a look at why it was OK for them to accept voting for a fascist felon over decency and democracy because of the cost of eggs?

And the people, the number of people who know how to fix them quickly and effectively is fairly small. So now the administration is hoping that by allowing these contractors to go inside Ukraine, this will be a big shift and allow the Ukrainians to fix things faster than they we're able to over the last two years when things had to actually be shipped out of Ukraine to places like Poland and Romania to be repaired. So this is, hopefully, going to give Ukraine that advantage. But of course, it all remains to be seen whether the policy will remain in place under a Trump administration. Trump, of course, has been deeply skeptical of the war in Ukraine. He has said that he wants to hold peace talks and get this all solved within 24 hours of taking office. So whether or not he allows American military contractors to actually remain in the country there and keep operating on these DOD contracts, it really remains to be seen at this point.",
