There is so much momentum and excitement and enthusiasm here on the ground among democratic supporters, including young people who will be so vital in this election. Take a listen to how they're thinking about this moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLIVIA JESSUP-ANGER, FIRST TIME VOTER FROM WISCONSIN: I think she is iconic. And then also, I agree with her on policy. I'm so excited for the debate, seeing a prosecutor against a felon. I think that's going to be really interesting. And I just agree with her a lot policy-wise. And just overall, seeing a strong independent woman on the ballot this November is really promising to me. Obviously, abortion is at the forefront of all of our minds.

Congressman, to you, as we note that Harris still does have her work cut out for her here, there is a lot of excitement. And I wonder what you think is we certainly -- we're waiting polling numbers, right? We want to get a better sense of where things are. But I wonder what you think of the state of the race here.ADAM KINZINGER, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Well, I think there's a lot of energy now on the democratic side because think about it, there was a lot of dread between another Trump Biden rematch, right? I mean, you heard that from everybody. This is like an X Factor thrown in the race. We don't quite know yet how Kamala Harris is going to do on the campaign trail. Early signs are pretty good. But definitely, she's a different person now. And so that dread that I think a lot of people were feeling, they can now look at and say, well, I either have to go with Donald Trump again, which has kind of been there, done that, or there's this new opportunity over here with Kamala. So I think there is a lot of energy now with the democratic side. Is it going to shift the polls massively? Probably not, at least in the short-term, because, again, you know, this is a very divided country. But whenever you can enthuse, get enthusiasm in your base for election day, that's a huge benefit, making sure everybody turns out to vote. So I think it is pretty accurate to say that the battlefield map may be expanding now in the Democrats favor as long as they can hold on to this momentum. And I think fundraising is certainly going to be on their side now as there's this new level of energy with them.",

I mean, surely those concerns don't just completely evaporate.LOCKHART No, they don't. But, you know, as Joe Biden once said, you know, he's running against Donald Trump. He's not running against God. I think what's happened in the party is that even those who had some doubts about the Vice President have now seen this as a clear choice. They see the excitement, they see the money, and they see what their choice is as Democrats and as activists and partisans. They have one person to get behind. We were able to avoid a free for all between now and the convention, which really could have strained a lot of relationships. So I think, again, it's early.

And as -- you know, as much as people in the last week have said he's changed, he obviously, by his tweet, youk now, explosion today. There's nothing about him that's changed. He's all about himself, not the American people.So I don't think it's going to be a big surprise that I would do that. But, yeah, I think the big thing is just for her, not for me, but for Republicans like me, is just to show a desire to unify the country. I don't think Republicans like me are looking for her to become a Republican or all of a sudden change what she believes, but just to understand that there's a place for us in America. What Donald Trump has made clear is that there's not a place in America for people that disagree with him. He has this, like, term about real Americans versus whatever a not real American is. I guess, people that live in cities, which actually outnumber people that live in rural communities. So I think that's what she has to do.

This caps a tumultuous time in Washington for someone who had rose over the last three decades from someone -- a rank and file member of the House to one of the most powerful people in the Senate as a Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Now, Menendez had been facing the threat of possibly being expelled from the United States Senate after his conviction, after he was found guilty on those 16 felony charges.A number of Democrats had said that they would be open to the idea of pushing him out of the Senate. That is something that is rarely done, but something would require two-thirds majority in the United States Senate. Almost all of his Senate democratic colleagues had asked him to resign. So his support had been crumbling when he was indicted initially and then especially so in the aftermath of his conviction when the Senate majority leader joined those democratic calls for him to resign. So now that Menendez will resign effective August 20th, that's when the governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, who is a Democrat, will appoint a replacement. That replacement will serve to the end of Menendez's term, which is the end of this year. There are questions about who he might replace, but almost certainly a Democrat that would potentially include the democratic nominee, Andy Kim, who's a congressman right now. He's the -- he's favored to hold that seat for Democrats in the fall, but also potentially the governor's wife as well, Tammy Murphy is someone to look at as potentially someone he could put in that seat in this interim period. Murphy, his wife, tried to challenge for that democratic nomination before ultimately stepping aside and leading to Andy Kim's ascension. But this is a significant moment because, as I mentioned, Menendez came from -- became someone who is a pretty powerful figure in the United States Senate, was influential on immigration policy, influential on foreign policy. He even won an effort to -- when he was indicted back in 2017 because of a hung jury on a separate corruption case. But in the aftermath of that, that's when prosecutors said he started to take bribes in this other corruption case that ultimately led to his conviction just a couple of weeks ago. So we expect this announcement, guys, to be made shortly after Menendez privately told his staff and others that he would step aside, effective August 20th.",

But both of those dynamics reversing themselves in dramatic course in just the two days since Vice President Harris assumed the reins of the democratic candidacy for president here.The campaign says that more than $100 million in fundraising has poured in. The majority of which it says is coming from first time donors. She's racking up new endorsements. And more than 58,000 volunteers have signed on to the Vice President's ground game for this sprint to the finish line. When Harris visited the campaign's headquarters yesterday that's now being rebranded as Harris for president, of course, before she names her running mate, which we expect in short order before the convention, Biden called in and said that he would still be supporting her all along the way through his support behind his vice president, and said that while the name atop the ticket might change, the mission has not changed. As for the mood on the ground at the event that you guys were just showing guys, campaign spokesperson tells CNN's Betsy Klein, that the 3000 people in attendance at that event is the largest crowd of any democratic campaign event this cycle.
