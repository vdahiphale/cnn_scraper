So far, Pence has avoided giving evidence under oath. And just last week, Pence told our Jake Tapper, he is not cooperating with the House Select Committee. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, this is a very difficult scene to work up. Even for forensic scientists who are very experienced with bloody sins. There are a hell of a lot of murder cases in the city of Moscow. So, you know, when you have something like this a quadruple homicide, people are frightened and they want instant action, they think, you know, it's like television, you turn it on 60 minutes later, you got the crime solve, that's not the way it is. You've got a lot of different kinds of forensic experts working this case, there are fingerprint people trace evidence people, there are people doing DNA analysis. And also, don't forget, you had the autopsy, which is a very important piece of information, I think out of that autopsy, what we learned was that the murder weapon is probably a military style knife, whether it's serrated or not, comes out in the autopsy. Or if there's a straight edge that comes out in the autopsy, the width of the blade that comes out in the autopsy.So, there's a lot of information that we have gathered already, that is just not being revealed, we just don't know all the details yet. It will take a lot of time, there's a lot of information, finding the point of entry is very important. There aren't a lot of possible points of entry. At that point, you've got to look for all kinds of evidence that might reveal the name of the person who did this, there are only really two kinds of forensic evidence that can turn up a suspect instantly. And that is fingerprints and DNA analysis. So, you're asking the right question, DNA can do it, fingerprints can do it. But sometimes this takes time.",

It's going through video surveillance, but then now you have to expand out because if a turret the longer this case goes on, and they don't identify the offender, it ends up being more likely that the offender is an actual stranger with no prior interaction with the victims and it becomes very, very hard at that point.

So, it was one of those afternoons I was sitting there looking out the window and the car drove down the streets and it had two Ukrainian flanks flapping. This one's flapping from the windows, on either side of the car. And I was like, OK, this is probably just somebody you know, being brave. We hadn't seen Russians for a couple of three days, but then it was released. So maybe a minute, a minute and a half, a pickup truck came down the streets with a bunch of people in the bed with an enormous Ukrainian flag. They were honking, they weren't being discrete at all, honking, shouting, cheering. And that sort of opened the floodgates down the street came. I would say hundreds maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but a lot of cars, honking, screaming, flags flying.So, I was like, OK, I walked down in (INAUDIBLE) towards (INAUDIBLE) which is the central, the epicenter of Kherson in front of the governance house.

Some of the flags would like dirty and tattered from people who had buried their flags so that they wouldn't get in trouble with the Russians.
