I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with a frigid final stretch before the first vote of the 2024 presidential election. Freezing weather causing major disruptions at the Iowa caucus campaign trail. They are now just two days until caucus goers make their picks, but today, much of Iowa is under a blizzard warning. Temperatures dropping into the single digits. And that's cooling off what's typically a fiery final blitz for campaigns. Candidates are scaling back in-person events across the Hawkeye State, even as they tried to lower those still undecided voters. CNN's. Jeff Zeleny and Jessica Dean are braving the elements on the Iowa campaign trail. Good to see both of you. Jeff, you first. How much of an impact is the weather expected to make leading up to Monday's caucuses?",

But the reality here, the winds, the punishing winds. You can feel them as they hit your face here. That is the issue. And this is the warm spot. It will be colder tomorrow and even colder on Monday night. So, the campaigns are doing a variety of things behind the scenes to really try and make sure their supporters get to the Iowa caucuses. One of the challenges is, in some of the rural counties across Iowa, there is only a couple precinct locations for the whole county. So, some people may be driving a great distance to try and get to their caucus location. So, former President Donald Trump has canceled his in-person rallies today. He was supposed to be having a couple of rallies. One in Atlantic, Iowa, which is in the western central part of the state, and then, one in Sioux City. He's canceled those, he's been unable to fly here. His rivals, though have been on the campaign trail. Ron DeSantis this morning, Nikki Haley as well. But Fredricka, there is no doubt the expectations for high turnout have certainly been revised by Republican officials. Now, it's just a question of who turns out? So, the campaigns are certainly going through their paces here. But the weather absolutely could impact things Monday night. The cold is not that uncommon. The snow is not, but it's the punishing winds, and that dangerous winds chill that has worried so many here, Fredricka.",

If people are willing to come out and hear from me, I'm going to show up all the way until the end of this caucus, you're going to see me everywhere.

It will have an effect on turnout on Monday night.Now, you -- first of all, you're going to see older voters, you know, decide not to go out and freeze their buttons and possibly break a hip in or getting out to the caucuses. And so, you know, the candidates that benefit are the ones who can really mobilize the younger voters, and also the ones who have a robust ground organization, who can get their four-wheel drives out -- drive people to their caucuses, clear out their driveways, if necessary.

He has built up a more robust ground organization.

Now, Nikki Haley, they have an advantage also of people who might be supporting her who don't necessarily show up in all the poll., People who might change their voter registration, for example, at the caucus, or people who might be Democrats who change their voter registration to support her.

That we still have blizzard warnings in effect for a lot of northwest Iowa, including Des Moines, up towards Spencer and Sioux City. And it's not really because we're getting that much more snow today. It's because we have all the snow on the ground, you might get another inch or two. But we still have gusts up to 45 miles per hour. So, it could create what we call a ground blizzard where just the blowing snow could still drop visibility and make things very dangerous, even if you're not seeing too much snow fall out of the sky. Then, we're looking at the wind chill warning that's in effect through Tuesday, because we can find those wind chills up to 45 degrees below zero. That is dangerously cold. When you put the frostbite time on here, it's 10 minutes. Frostbite in 10 minutes in Des Moines, Iowa. Overnight Sunday going into going into Sunday. Just incredibly cold. And then, even as we get towards caucus day, we're going to still find these wind chills. You know, as you're headed out in the evening to the polls, you are looking at them as cold as 25 to 30 to 35 degrees below zero. So, again frostbite in 15 minutes or less.

While America's regional partners, Saudi and the UAE worry about escalation, a potential return to Houthi attacks on them.

The United States, the U.K. and others in the coalition get drawn in for the long haul. And as the Houthis is saying that they are doing these strikes -- that the United States is doing these strikes to get essentially in support of Israel against the people of Gaza. And that narrative is amplified by Iran. It serves Iran's purposes for the United States to stay engaged for a long time, because Iran wants to drive the United States out of the region. And to be able to maintain that narrative that United States is there against Arab interests and supporting Israel's interests. It's a narrative that's clearly doesn't hold water.

This is their first press conference after confirming that they have accepted their election win, the two opposition parties the parties that were considered friendlier to China both conceded earlier in the evening on Saturday.The election results came through relatively quickly just a few hours after the polls closed here in Taiwan. This island democracy has a reputation for being very efficient when it comes to tallying the election results, partially because there are just under 24 million people living here and nobody can vote with absentee ballots. So everybody who cast their ballots, the millions of Taiwanese who voted actually had to do so in person in their hometowns. But a lot of people turned out there were just under 2,000 polling sites here in Taipei alone, and there were lines that a lot of them throughout the day, because of what is at stake in this election. China had told the Taiwanese people warning them in the run up to this election, that this was a choice between peace and war, prosperity and decline, implying that the Democratic Progressive Party, which is openly loathed by Beijing's communist leaders, is the wrong choice in China's view, to lead Taiwan for the next four years. And they've been making their point, not only with bellicose statements, but also with actions including just in recent days sending spy balloons over Taiwan, unveiling imagery of their third most advanced aircraft carrier, one of the most advanced in the world that experts say once it completes the trials will play a vital role in any potential invasion of Taiwan, which China has never ruled out, as they say that they will eventually reabsorbed this island as part of their territory, even though the communist rulers in Beijing have never actually controlled it. And of course, there's always the looming threat. But people here, the supporters of the Democratic Progressive Party, see that's exactly why they have decided to give the DPP four more years in Taiwan because they believe that the party's strategy of a close alignment with the United States prioritizing military, diplomatic and economic ties with the U.S. is the way to protect Taiwan from a Chinese attack as opposed to the opposition's argument that in fact, remending fences with China. Rebuilding that relationship and recalibrating the U.S. relationship would have been the way to dial down the temperature and avoid cross strait conflict.

We have really heard both of them reaffirm that they will continue the policies of the current president, Tsai Ing-wen, that is preserving the cross street status quo.And I think they both realize that they only won 40 percent of the vote. That means that 60 percent of the people in Taiwan voted for one of the other candidates. The DPP ruling party also lost its majority in the legislature. And so it will be more difficult to pass laws going forward as a result. Hence, so this is going to be, I think, a challenge for the DPP.

It's unbelievable, the damage and there could be more on the horizon. Our Polo Sandoval is in Paterson, New Jersey. Is there a way that people can brace for what's to come?",

And now the more immediate threat at least here in Paterson, New Jersey, flooding. All of this water, the source of it is actually the Passaic River that you mentioned a little while ago, the river about maybe 90 or 100 yards away from where I'm standing.According to New Jersey's governor, the Passaic has already been at flood level for the last several days, so any additional rain could lead to even more flooding potentially worse than what we experienced in December. These neighborhoods that you're looking at right now here in Paterson, these are some of the low lying areas. So the folks who live and work in this part of the neighborhood are quite familiar with the flooding potential of the Passaic. So authorities have been closely monitoring the forecast and calls for another two feet above what we're seeing right now, which is why authorities has actually set up these sort of barricades throughout the neighborhood. We've been here for quite some time here, Fred, that people who are taking their chances, choosing to actually drive in while others are simply just shifting into reverse, which is perhaps the wisest thing. In neighboring New York, a flood warning, coastal flood warning in effect for another hour and a half or so. So it really does speak to the advisories, the warnings, the watches that are in place for so many people who live and work in the Northeast. Fred?",

This is literally just developing within the last few minutes. So I think fair to say I step very rarely seen in terms of NFL history, but a very necessary one. As I was saying, you got the gusty winds there, and just look at these images here, Fred, they kind of speak for themselves, really.The blowing snow as well that's expected in Buffalo Sunday afternoon. New York's Governor making the announcement at a press conference a very short while ago. Let's hear and let's listen to exactly to what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): And that is why I'm pleased to announce that in the interest of keeping both Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh fans safe. I just spoke with Commissioner Roger Goodell who shares our concern that safety should be the top priority. I've also spoken to the mayor and our county executive about keeping our fans safe. The NFL has agree with our assessment that we need to postpone tomorrow's playoff game until 4:30 p.m. Monday afternoon. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It is hard to even use words to describe it. It was just so horrific.This is an individual who planned this out who became radicalized, plan this out, drove 200 miles, researched the place that would have the highest number of African Americans went to a store, grocery store that he knew there would be people at that store at that time, went in with a helmet and body armor. He was live streaming it at the same time, hoping to start a race war. This is somebody who has already gone through the legal process in the state of New York. But it does not have the death penalty. He's already going to serve a lifetime in prison. Many of the families are happy that the government is seeking the death penalty, some families are not. Mark Talley spoke to cameras shortly after they were informed of the government's decision. And he spoke out about his mother, Geraldine Talley, who died at that Tops friendly supermarket in Buffalo on 514, 514 is what they call it in Buffalo. And it is etched into their memories there.
