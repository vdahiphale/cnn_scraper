      "sentences": "Well, that's all unfolding as Israeli forces continue to operate in Jenin a day after launching its largest military operation in the occupied West Bank in more than two decades. The airstrikes killing at least nine people and injuring about 100 others, according to Palestinian officials. Israeli officials say it was targeting a militant command center as part of an extensive counterterrorism effort.And joining us now is one of the foremost experts on the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, former State Department Middle East negotiator Aaron David Miller. I appreciate you joining us, in part because you had made a point on social media a week or two ago -- I can't remember when it was -- about how this has kind of -- they're in a bloody cul-de-sac with no way out at this point in time. You could see this accelerating over the course of the last several weeks on the political, on the military -- on all the dynamics geopolitically as well. My question is given the scale of the military operation underway, where does this go from here? AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR, SENIOR FELLOW, CAMEGLE ENDOWMENT (via Webex by Cisco):  You know, I make a lot of predictions and most of them, frankly, are wrong. The problem here I think is the notion of a cul-de-sac. You have -- you have three factors that are driving this train -- this very bloody, volatile, and tragic train. Number one, you have a Palestinian Authority that is weak, divided, and simply unable to assume responsibility, particularly in the northern West Bank -- Jenin and Nablus. Number two, you have the most right-wing fundamentalist government in the history of the state of Israel committed literally to pursuing policies, which they are doing now, to basically enact the West Bank in everything but name. And third, you have a new phenomenon and to say informal groups of young Palestinians roughly between the ages of 15 and 25 in Jenin, in Nablus, supported, facilitated, and encouraged by organized groups such as Palestine Islamic and Jihad and Hamas, which are demonstrating a fierce determination to resist Israelis and to plan attacks in the West Bank and in Israel proper. And the problem is that there doesn't seem to be any way to counterbalance this. The international community has checked out. Governing is about choosing with respect to the Biden administration. They have other priorities. And it's hard to see this not necessarily blowing up to a third Intifada. There are reasons that I think may prevent that. But you've got a new normal here, which is -- which is this bloody (INAUDIBLE) when Israeli Defense Forces and armed groups are informal -- encouraged by organized (INAUDIBLE). None of this, frankly, is going to stop. It's a -- it's a veritable -- not a cycle of violence so much as it is deeply entrenched factors who, right now, are not vulnerable to (INAUDIBLE).",
