We have a live report from Ukraine and I'll talk to the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States about the state of the war.Also tonight, President Biden faces a growing crisis right now with a special counsel now in place to investigate his handling of classified records. We're learning more about documents that were found as the White House fails to explain its delay in revealing key details. And new scenes of devastation in the southeast, the death toll rising after dozens of tornadoes including a powerful twister that pounded Selma, Alabama. We're getting official updates on this disaster and the rescue and recovery operations that are now underway. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. And we begin this hour in Ukraine and the stunning video just into CNN, a huge explosion in the eastern town of Soledar at a building apparently occupied by Russian troops. Russia and Ukraine at odds over whether the town is under Russian control. CNN's Scott McLean is following all of these developments from Kyiv for us. Scott, what more can you tell us about this explosion?",

And at that point you can see this massive explosion.CNN has geolocated that video to Soledar. Ukrainian troops say they have been monitoring that spot since the morning and they say that the fight for Soledar continues. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (voice over):  Major developments as Russia attempts to notch its first significant battlefield win in months. Ukrainian forces vowing the fight is not over in the small eastern town of Soledar, which is emerged as a flashpoint in the war now approaching the one- year mark. Fighting has raged for weeks in this desolate landscape where 10,000 people used to live. Russia's defense ministry on Friday claimed the victory, saying the town had been liberated, claim the Ukrainian were quick to deny. Captain Taras Berezovets, a Ukrainian Special Forces soldier, who says he was around Soledar on Thursday, told CNN that the town had little strategic value.

GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  The fight is very intense and it seems that Russia doesn't fully control Soledar or the rest of its efforts there on the eastern front, Wolf. This is a very active battlefield and it's face-to-face in some of the locations like Soledar. It is a very tough fight. Russia is not winning yet.",

And in reporting on those final weeks for Joe Biden as vice president, what was made clear by officials that were familiar with that moment in time was just how disjointed that process was. Biden was on the road visiting Ukraine, visiting Davos, meeting with foreign leaders. It was very much almost an acceleration of his work, something that made it extremely difficult for staff trying to pack up and close out that office. However the documents ended up in the two locations, now currently under investigation, you can add the House Judiciary Committee to those looking into this process. The new chairman of that committee, Jim Jordan, sending a letter to the Justice Department making clear his committee had opened an investigation and asking for a wide range of documents and what is expected to be one of several probes from Capitol Hill, the administration is facing as they deal with this new special counsel.

A second discovery was made on December 20th. And so -- and I think this has created problems, perhaps more problems than they would have had if they would have been more forthcoming from the beginning. But I don't know what advice they're getting, Wolf, from their lawyers. I don't know what requests they've gotten from the Justice Department. I just would caution this. We, of all, everyone on this panel, has lived through these kinds of stories over a long period of time. And we -- they always start as five-alarm fires.

And I think that at least from the position, short-term position of Republicans and Trump supporters, more advantageous for Trump just in terms of muddying the water, but these are two separate investigations.And while, yes, there are aspects of these two instances and cases and problems that look similar, from what we know, and, again, to David's point, there is still a lot to learn, but from what we know, these are not identical situations. The main difference is just the alleged obstruction by Donald Trump over and over and over for a very long period of time when the Archives were trying to get those records back and then when the Justice Department got involved. But I do think that the Trump people feel like this makes it easier for them. Again, that is purely from the standpoint of, you know, the public is probably not paying attention to the fine points of this.

This is a live radar and you can see just torrential downpours especially across Central and Northern California, portions of Oregon very heavy snow falling across the Sierra. There is a closer look. We are going to see rainfall rates at half an inch to possibly an inch per hour in some of the heaviest downpours. So, this already saturated ground as just going to continue to flood as we go into next week. You can see just surges of moisture pushing in all of the rain, the snow coming down. Some areas across California, Wolf, have received more than half a year's worth of rain just since Christmas. So, it has been remarkable to see.

In 2021, a firm that Santos worked for was accused by the SEC of being a Ponzi scheme and Santos, in an attempt to defend himself, said he was not aware of any allegations of fraud or wrongdoing about this firm that he worked for. But in 2020, our KFile team discovered a now deleted tweet where Santos was responding to a customer who was making a fraud allegation. He responded directly to that person. So, it seems to contradict his claims that he was unaware of any allegations of fraud or wrongdoing about this firm. So, this really just speaks to the fact that every day there seems to be a new damaging revelation about Santos. And speaking of fraud, we should point out that there is a fraud case in Brazil against Santos. So, this is not just about his embarrassing lies about his resume. This is about legal issues that Santos is facing and it is becoming a huge distraction for House Republicans, Wolf.",

We saw that with former Congressman Duncan Hunter when he was charged with misusing campaign funds. He was forced to relinquish all of his committee assignments.But as of right now, Kevin McCarthy can really hide behind the idea that Santos is innocent until proven guilty. And there is a political calculation here at play for Kevin McCarthy as well. Because if Santos were to step down, that would tee off a special election in a Biden- won blue district, Democrats would likely have a real shot at flipping the seat and that would make the House GOP's razor thin majority even slimmer.
