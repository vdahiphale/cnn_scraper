And then, according to witnesses, Israeli forces opened fire. The health ministry in Gaza reports at least 112 people killed, close to 800 injured. Many were trampled in the chaos, others run down by drivers of the aid trucks trying to escape the gunfire. But according to the Israeli military, warning, shots were fired by nearby tanks which were there to secure the area for aid distribution. And Israeli forces opened fire only on Palestinians who were approaching in a threatening manner. Now, a senior Hamas leader has one hostage, and ceasefire talks are in doubt.

Brazil and France want the world's ultra wealthy to pay their fair share in taxes. The resolve         called on G-20 countries to come up with a shared plan to prevent billionaires from dodging taxes. France proposed a global minimum tax on the very, very ultra uber- wealthy, like the United States (ph). Countries in the G-20 account for 80 percent of the global economy. The Brazilian finance minister says it will take international cooperation to crack down on tax evasion and inequality. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You typically don't go there initially, because they're bringing income into the economy, right?Well, what's the other easiest way, John, that other countries have done? They've taxed other countries on trade goods, on tariffs, on specific goods that they know they can grab that. But we live in an economy now, it's really interconnected, where there isn't that much delta, meaning that much money that they can make up off the specific countries. So when you think about the lowest resistance, the easiest pool, when it can be game changing of a number, it is the billionaires in that aspect to be able to come as a global tax.

The other thing, too, John is you have to identify what -- what moneyare you taxing them on? Is it net worth? Is it actual personal income? And what does that look like?
