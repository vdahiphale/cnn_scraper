      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome, everyone. I'm Michael Holmes. And what a finish at the Super Bowl.The Kansas City Chiefs beating the San Francisco 49ers in overtime to repeat as NFL Champions. CNN's Andy Scholes is at the Super Bowl live in Las Vegas. He joins me now by phone for the moment. We'll get him on camera later. Andy, I think it's the second time ever in Super Bowl history that a game went to overtime. What a time to be a Chiefs fan. Break it down for us. ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT (via phone): Right, Michael. It was the second time it's gone to overtime. And poor Kyle Shanahan, the head coach of the 49ers, he's been on the wrong end of both of those overtime games. The first one was between the Patriots and the Falcons when the Patriots made that epic comeback to win the Super Bowl after being down 28-3. Shanahan was offensive coordinator for the Falcons in that game. And here he was the head coach of course of the Niners. And what a game this was. You know, the first half, awful for the Chiefs offense. They just could not get anything going. It was their worst offensive performance in 54 games points wise for them. But in the second half Patrick Mahomes just coming through big time. He -- when the game was on the line he made the plays that mattered most, Michael, and in O.T. when he had the chance, he had to go 75 yards with a chance to win his third Super Bowl title, and he did just that. A game-winning touchdown on the final play of overtime to beat the San Francisco 49ers. And Michael, you know, people were complaining early on, this game is boring, it's not great. It was one of the most fantastic finishes we've ever seen in Super Bowl history.",

And I guess also for quarterback Brock Purdy who was the first Mr. Irrelevant, the last man picked in the draft to lead a team in the Super Bowl. SCHOLESplay their hearts out. And for Brock Purdy it would have been just the ending. I know it's been a fairy tale ending to what's just an incredible two years of his career. He was the first ever Mr. Irrelevant to lead his team to the Super Bowl. And here he was with a chance to walk away winners. There were some big plays in this game. The Chiefs were fourth and one in overtime. The Niners if they stopped them there they would be Super Bowl champions right now. But, again, it was Mahomes making the play when he absolutely had to. And he's just proven over and over again why he's considered one of the best to ever do it. They're just handing Andy Reid the Super Bowl, the Lombardi Trophy right now, with some big cheers from the Chiefs fans in attendance. You can assume that they're going to name Patrick Mahomes Super Bowl MVP. He threw for 333 yards, two touchdowns. Made all the big plays. It's just a fantastic performance. And now, Michael, you can really start that discussion. Is Patrick Mahomes going to one day catch Tom Brady's seven Super Bowls and end up the greatest of all time? It is a real possibility as Mahomes is just 28 years old and has just had arguably the best first six years of a career of anyone ever.",

This will be something that they've been waiting for, hoping for, that the IDF could free hostages.What we know about this, Fernando Simon Marman, 60 years old, and Louis Har, 70 years old from Nir Yitzchak which is a kibbutz very close to the south end of Gaza. They've been held since October 7th, were freed in a raid that the IDF said that they've been planning for some time. They were waiting to set the conditions for it. They were able to put a covert team onto the second floor of a building in the vicinity of the location where the two were being held. And then they say by distraction they targeted -- or for distraction they targeted a battalion, a Hamas battalion in that area. We understand from the Palestinian Red Crescent in Rafah that overnight there had been 60 fatalities of Palestinians. The local hospital in Rafah saying it's overwhelmed, can't treat them according to the Palestinian Red Crescent information. Two mosques and about a dozen houses were hit. Now we're not clear if this was the distraction of which the IDF is talking about, if this was part of their military operation to free the two hostages, but we're told that the hostages are taken to a hospital here on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. The operation happened around about 1:00 a.m. in the night here. So we're talking about five hours ago this all took place. The two men are in good medical condition. There was only one light IDF injury in the operation, we understand. Also that the families of the men, we understand, and this is first early information we're getting here, either are with the two released men or will be with them very soon. Of course for all the hostage families this means so much. It means that the military is actively trying to get their hostages out, free them. There's only been one other instance of this, and you have to go all the way back to the end of October, when a young female IDF soldier was released by the IDF, freed by the IDF in a military operation. But this one, this operation in the heart of Rafah, covertly done, will be for the military at least a huge momentous moment. There's been massive pressure on them to be able to release hostages here -- Michael.",

And as you and I know, and Coy of course covered a lot of these, so I'm not there with you guys, what a scene that is certainly you're living right now. But you know, we know that these games have an ebb and flow to them. And this was one of those kind of defensive struggles.Lots of mistakes. I mean, the 49ers, I've been listening to you guys, you know, talk to us as I've been, you know, awaiting to have our conversation. And the 49ers had that golden opportunity to start the second half after Mahomes threw the interception. And as you are talking about Patrick Mahomes, you know, there are many quarterbacks that would just say, wow, you know, this is a tough day for me or whatever. Not Mahomes. There's magic there. He is a magician. He is a Houdini. He is throw all the cliches there. This is a guy that when he must do it he does it over and over again. And Kelce the same thing, of course, and the magic of that story. And Taylor Swift. I mean, if we had -- you and I had gotten together with Coy and decided we were going to write something like this at the beginning of the year I would have been, you know, been laughed out of the room. And yet there are champions who can pull this off. And we're seeing someone who's a once in a generation player in Patrick Mahomes. And as you said, he's 28.
