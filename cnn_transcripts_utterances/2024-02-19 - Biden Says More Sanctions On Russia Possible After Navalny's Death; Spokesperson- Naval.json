But no additional details were given by the President when he was speaking to reporters.You know, over the weekend, the President also talked about this critical Ukrainian town that fell, and administration officials have been warning for months and months that if U.S. funding runs out, that there are going to be detriment detrimental effects are on the battlefield for Ukrainian forces running out of ammunition, running out of important equipment. And that is what Ukraine is saying is happening already. And the President over the weekend did say that he was concerned that additional towns could end up falling if Congress doesn't take prompt action. But of course, the political reality that he is grappling with right now, as we just heard him talk about is that there is a small faction of House Republicans that is not willing to take up this national security supplemental bill that does have some $60 billion in additional aid for Ukraine.

Yulia Navalnaya, met with several E.U. foreign ministers this morning and before those meetings, she posted a new video online promising to find out how her husband was killed.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YULIA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEI NAVALNY'S WIDOW (through translator): In a cowardly way, they're hiding his body not showing to his mother not giving to his mother.

      "sentences": "Yes, well, that they say that this investigation is underway and that this investigation is open ended, that it's unclear what exactly the results of this investigation are going to be which it appears to me that if you take into account the spokesperson of Navalny's comments that apparently the body for at least the next 14 days is going to be under some sort of investigation. There might be some sort of autopsy or other tests that are going to happen.Obviously, as we've heard there from Yulia Navalnaya herself, she does not believe in any of that. She does not believe that the Russian authorities are telling the truth. She was referring there to Novichok apparently wearing off that, of course, is a reference to the chemical nerve agent that not only Navalny's organization, but also internationally. A lot of countries said that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with earlier a couple of years ago, where then he ended up in treatment where I am right now in Berlin. Of course, at this point in time, it's very difficult or impossible to say what exactly happened to Alexei Navalny. But what we can see there from his widow, from Yulia Navalnaya, is that she does not believe anything that the Russian authorities are saying, and certainly what we've been seeing over the weekend is Alexei Navalny's mother trying to get some sort of access, first of all, to the morgue, where they thought that the body was and then also to the forensics lab where they believe that some of these tests are being done so far to no avail. All of this happening in the way north of Russia above the Arctic Circle, just to give an impression of how difficult it is for Alexei Navalny's organization and also for his family to get any sort of access. These are, of course, extremely remote parts of Russia where even communication can be quite difficult from those areas. So we heard there from Alexei Navalny's widow that they want to find out what exactly happened. But I think one of the other things, Fredricka that you also said is also very telling and very important, and that is the fact that she is already meeting with E.U. leaders with E.U. foreign ministers trying to continue his work, which is what she has vowed to do, guys.",

Basically, whatever the Kremlin says, be it Dmitry Peskov, Putin spokesperson, Putin, or any representative of the Kremlin all the way down to the prison authorities of the prison where Alexei Navalny was killed.Whatever they say, it's opposite of the truth. That's it. So the other thing I would say is that when they say the body won't be released for another 14 days, it doesn't mean that the body will be released in 14 days, nor does it mean it will be released in any kind of state in which the family can use it to conduct an independent investigation. I would not be surprised if, you know, after a month or two, the relatives get a box of what is said to be Navalny's ashes and whether they are or not, we won't know. But I think what's clearly happening is the state is trying to cover up what happened and trying to hide all evidence of this and make sure that we never know what happened. And in fact, we saw this when Navalny was poisoned with Novichok in August of 2020. He investigated this himself with his team of investigators as well as with Christo Grozev that was on the CNN documentary, Navalny. The -- when he called the FSB agent who was one of the people responsible for poisoning him, he explained how -- what they did to cover up what they did. So I'm sure that that's exactly what's happening right now.",

What she means by that is that it does not seem like people are as enthusiastic and as supportive of Joe Biden, as they would need to be to turn out November give them the votes to be where they need to be to beat Trump in the quest for a second term here. What she has been doing in meetings and conversations that she has been having on the side of events or inviting people over to the her residence at the Naval Observatory is trying to get some information from the ground that goes for a group of governors that she had at the Naval Observatory last weekend for a session there, or she's had meetings with several groups of black men leaders, people like D.L. Hughley and Don Cheadle, who were there for a Black Entertainment celebrity meeting in December or another one in January that was about political and finance leaders.

And I'm concerned about Super Tuesday.So I'm one of the people saying that she should stay through Super Tuesday because as we know coast to coast, lots of races, some are winner takes all. But after that date, the way I see it, it becomes mathematically impossible for her to win the nomination in a very conventional way, of course. But here we are in this moment where it is looking dicey and her campaign recognizes that. So I'm not surprised to hear her sort of really peel back the veneer sometimes of her of this very fancy, traditional conservative, she is starting to go for the jugular more. It remains yet to be seen whether that is going to be impactful. But again, there is a strong camp of folks including former Congresswoman Liz Cheney that believes like me, she should stay in through South Carolina, past South Carolina and into Super Tuesday to see what happens there.",

I think she's looking to stay in for the long haul. And as long as she is reaching that sort of 40 percent threshold, there are buyers for Nikki Haley. There are buyers and voters, there are buyers and donors. People want an alternative to Donald Trump, and she is giving them that alternative. And I think she's looking past South Carolina.

So that means to get tidbit of news from over in Russia, even though he frequently calls people commies. It just doesn't add up. And most thinking Americans believe this. They know the former President is trying to save himself. And he will pick up this narrative and continue forth with it for so long as he continues to get praised in places like South Carolina from sitting elected, like Senator Tim Scott and Congresswoman Nancy Mace who know better.
