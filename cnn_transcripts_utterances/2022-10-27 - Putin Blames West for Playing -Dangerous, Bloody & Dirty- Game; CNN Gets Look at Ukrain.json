(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: This is where power plant officials say one of two drones slammed into the ground. It was the same day the plant was hit by a cruise missile as well. The drone, they say, got tangled up in the high-voltage cables up here, ripping equipment apart. All on the ground here, all around burnt-out cables and, over here, burnt-out equipment. And the problem, officials say, is that this part of the site was the most sensitive part, the place that's the easiest to take the whole system down. The plant now completely offline. And the other problem is some of this equipment here is very hard to replace. It's scarce. Some of it is not even made anymore. What they're saying they're doing is turning to other power plants across the country to scavenge useful items. Repair work is going on all the time. But for many of the engineers here, part of their days are spent underground in bunkers. You still get a lot of air raid siren alerts. This is still a target. And they're worried about it. Already, some of the easier to repair parts of the plant have been put back together. New concrete columns here. A cruise missile landed right here, taking them out. But it raises the big question for the government now, can they repair at a faster rate than Russia is destroying? And 30 to 40 percent of the country's electricity-generating capacity is down. The public have been told to expect blackouts. They've been told to keep their phones and power banks charged. Not to use high-energy appliances in their homes, particularly during peak hours in the evening. It is really a problem facing the government. A real pressure point that President Putin is putting on them right now. Nic Robertson, CNN, at a power-generating plant in Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Still no word about what was stolen in that break-in or the identity of the suspect. Also in Arizona, a pro-democracy organization filed federal lawsuits this week against groups and individuals accused of trying to intimidate early voters at ballot drop boxes, sometimes with guns. Joining us now is Arizona Democratic Congressman and BOLD Pac chairman, Ruben Gallego. Congressman, good to have you back on the show. Let's start here with this break-in of Katie Hobbs' campaign headquarters and her calling out Kari Lake. She said that, for nearly two years, Kari Lake and her allies have been spreading dangerous misinformation and inciting threats against anyone they see fit, pointing directly at her opponent. The investigation is just starting. You think that's appropriate to draw that connection to Lake? REP. RUBEN GALLEGO (D-AZ): Well, I don't think Katie is just talking about this particular instance. We'll hear -- we'll hear what happened. Look, we have armed men standing at drop boxes stalking people with cameras, videotaping them as they get into their cars and driving -- writing down driver's license. This is all coming from the rhetoric of Kari Lake and Mark Finchem, basically trying to continue this lie that, in 2020, the election was stolen, right? So this increased rhetoric, this increased potential violence is being caused by those two candidates, in particular, because they're just stoking their own base with these -- with these lies. And, you know, they're responsible for this.",

We should, number one, make sure they're not dangerous. Number two, what is the organization that is supporting them? And, you know, is this going to spiral out of control? Because at what point does a family feel like they can't go drop off their votes when they feel they may be a threat of violence. What does that mean for Election Day?

That's just not the case. In certain areas, that's the case. But not across the country. Number two, what we're doing right now, what we have been doing -- hoping we should have been doing in the past, is that early contact with Latino voters, talking to him about the issues that matter to them. This is the first time I actually have seen very strong investment by the Democratic Party, a very strong investment by individual candidates. And it was early. It was not waiting until the last two weeks of the campaign. I think that's extremely important. It's a very hard year because of the economic environment. And we're going to have to work extra hard to make sure we keep the margins that we have consistently had in the past. But let's be clear it's an election that's going to be decided by Latinos. If we keep our margins where we usually do in the 64 percent range, we're going to win a lot of these races. When we fall below that, that's when we lose. But it's not something that is shifting strongly towards Republicans. That's just, I think, some campaign rhetoric that continues being amplified incorrectly.",
