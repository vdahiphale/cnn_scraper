You know, I got out 59 different people -- 59 -- and I didn't pay money. And they allowed some really rough people out. You know that, right? SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We have to ask ourselves why are they coming home, and I think it's because bad guys all over the world recognize Donald Trump's about to be back in office, so they're cleaning house.

There's absolutely zero evidence at all that this deal was brought about because of some potential fear of who might be the next president.This deal was brought about because the president had -- President Biden had alliances, and partnerships, and trust he could build on, particularly with the German chancellor who had made a brave, courageous decision to let Mr. Krasikov go. That's what -- that's what brought these guys home was really solid relationships and trusting confidence that the president has built up over years with foreign leaders, and a lot of hard work and some tough decisions by some very strong leaders here in the United States and around the world. As for the previous comments by the previous president, Trevor Reed was taken in the previous administration's time in office. Mr. Biden got him home. Paul Whelan was taken in the previous administration's time in office. President Biden got Paul home. And I would stress that zero dollars were exchanged in this deal that brought these people home last night. It was all about people-to- people exchanges. And the last thing I'll say Kate is that the previous administration also conducted prisoner exchanges. The previous administration also had to make tough decisions to get Americans home. And I can't dispute Mr. Trump's number there, 59, but I can just tell you President Biden has gotten more than 70 Americans home. That's what you have to do when you have people in harm's way over there. You've got to make these tough decisions. It's not easy. Sometimes it's gut-wrenching and sometimes you have to look the other way while somebody really bad, like Krasikov, becomes a free man. But in the balance -- in the end, it's better to bring innocent people home and not let them rot in a Russian jail than to take the risk that somebody bad, like Mr. Krasikov, is going to go back to his ways. And look, if he does, we'll be ready for him.",

And I told Elizabeth, his sister, right after that I've never seen Jake so committed.

Everybody was superstitious because there have been so many other false hopes. Joe Biden worked hard on this.
