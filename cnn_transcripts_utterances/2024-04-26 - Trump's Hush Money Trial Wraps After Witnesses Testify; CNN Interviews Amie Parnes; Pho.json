We're at the end of a very long week in the Trump hush money trial. You know, court is actually dark on Monday, but they will get going again on Tuesday morning at 9.30.So just what exactly will jurors take away from what they heard in court today, and what are they going to be thinking about over their long weekend? Well, there were three witnesses who took the stand today. You had David Pecker, who wrapped up more than 10 hours of testimony over a period of four days, also Trump's former longtime assistant, Rhona Graff, who was only on the stand for what, a half an hour? And then Michael Cohen's former banker, Gary Farro, who is second to continue testifying this coming Tuesday. And the prosecution wants jurors to remember Pecker's testimony, that his intention was to never publish Karen McDougal's story of an alleged affair with Trump. From the transcript, he said, \"Had you published a story about a Playboy model having a year-long sexual affair, while he was married, with a presidential candidate, would that have sold magazines do you think?\" His answer? \"Yes.\" \"That would be like National Enquirer gold?\" \"Yes.\" Going on to say, \"And despite the fact that publishing that story would have helped your bottom line, you killed the story because it helped the candidate, Donald Trump?\" \"Yes.\"",

      "sentences": "And then there was Rhona Graff, Trump's longtime gatekeeper over at the Trump Organization. Her desk was, at one point, just outside of Trump's office. From the defense's standpoint, she was there to show what you might call a kinder, gentler version of her boss.She testified that, \"Sometimes, if it was a long day in the office, I appreciated it, that he joked, he poked his head in and would say, 'go home to your family.' It was very thoughtful of him.\" She also confirmed that he kept contact information for Karen McDougal and for Stormy Daniels, who she said she saw at Trump Tower and assumed that she was being considered for \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" From the transcript, \"Am I correct that prior to Stormy Daniels coming up to the office at Trump Tower, you recall hearing President Trump discuss whether Stormy Daniels would be a good contestant?\" Answer, \"I vaguely recall hearing him say that she was one of the people who may be an interesting contestant on that show.\"",

And then last up today, you had Michael Cohen's former banker, Gary Farro, a connect-the-dots kind of witness, who said that Cohen coordinated with him to try to create an account for an LLC that Cohen would use to pay Stormy Daniels at $130,000.Now, from the transcript, \"Did he tell you what the new account would be for?\" Answer, \"The same. For real estate.\" \"And did he express any type of urgency in opening the account?\" Answer, \"Every time Michael Cohen spoke to me, he gave a sense of urgency.\" \"And this is one of those times?\" Answer, \"This is one of those times.\" Let's talk about it now with former federal prosecutor Gene Rossi, he represented Keith Davidson, who actually negotiated the NDAs with Karen McDougal and also Stormy Daniels, former Trump attorney Tim Parlatore, CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams, former Republican senior congressional advisor Rina Shah, and law enforcement reporter for \"The Washington Post,\" Devlin Barrett, the author -- the co-author of the \"Trump Trials Newsletter.\" So, I want to begin with this idea of Gary Farro because his testimony, in many respects, was one I think that people may not have anticipated. They were thinking about a Michael Cohen, a Stormy Daniels. They were thinking about, of course, David Pecker, maybe Karen McDougal. Talk to me about the decision to have this person testify.

I think that's important, Abby, because jurors spend so much time and energy focused on these interactions of people.Jurors can't be told the law, they don't know a lot of the intricacies of what's going on, but they really focus in on how everyone interacts with each other.

In fact, the tally showed that Donald Trump interrupted either Joe Biden or moderator Chris Wallace north of 90 times during that debate.It was the nuttiest thing I've ever seen. Afterwards, there were curse words flying on CNN. And it isn't so surprising when you go back and watch some of those interruptions. I believe I have some of those. So, let's take a listen.
