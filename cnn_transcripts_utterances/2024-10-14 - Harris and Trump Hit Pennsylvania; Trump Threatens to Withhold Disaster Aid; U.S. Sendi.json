      "sentences": "Later today, both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will hit the battleground State of Pennsylvania as polls continue to show a dead heat between the presidential candidates. In CNN's most recent poll of polls, this is an average of recent polls, Kamala Harris has a 50 to 47 edge over Donald Trump among likely voters, but there's still no clear leader.Let's bring in CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton and Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky. Julie, let me start with you. Why is this race so close? I asked John Fetterman about this earlier on in the program and he just said, you know, Donald Trump just has this ability to hang in there and in places like Pennsylvania, it is just going to be extremely close. JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND CO-FOUNDER, LIFT OUR VOICES: Look, ultimately, I think Donald Trump was absolutely right that he could do no wrong in the eyes of his supporters. He could actually shoot somebody in 5th Avenue or for that matter and cite a riot on January 6th and they will support him to the end. And so, when you have a base like that, it just means that he's got a very, very, very high ceiling, but he's also -- sorry floor, but he's also got, you know, a ceiling that can't go much above what he's got now. And so, as I've said from the beginning, this is a turnout election. It's not so much a persuasion election anymore, or really ever has been. He has persuaded his candidates and his supporters. Now, she has to -- Kamala Harris has to persuade and turn out the people who are opposed to Trump. I believe there are more of those people than people who support Trump, but it's a question of getting them to the polls, and that is all that she needs to worry about right now.",

According to Bob Woodward's new book, Trump's former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Mark Milley, says the former president is a, quote, \"fascist to the core and the most dangerous person to this country.\" I mean, when you hear things like that from Mark Milley, if the quotes in Bob Woodward's book are accurate, he hasn't come out and said, I didn't say this, how seriously should voters take that?

I think if you're a Republican and you're an arm supporter of the former president, you're going to dismiss it and say, this is just political jargon because they dislike him. Even if you're a Trump skeptic, but you're looking at Harris and you're saying, you know what, I don't like the guy, but I think he's better on a set of issues. I will still vote for him anyway. I'm not convinced that this will change the needle.And I think to Julie's point about this being a close race, I think the question, if you're Democrats and you're looking at some of the deficits there, how do you improve if you're Vice President Harris with some consequential groups? And if you're Republicans and you're advising Former President Trump, then the question becomes, in a state like Pennsylvania, not only must you turn out your voters, but what about some of those low propensity voters that our data suggests the former president is doing well with, can you move enough of them to get a victory? And so, I'm looking at two different dynamics here, Jim, and assessing this from both perspectives and there's still some work to be done by both camps.",

There are anecdotes about the fact that he wanted to withhold federal aid as president to Northern California during their horrible wildfires a few years ago and it had to be shown that those areas actually had Trump voters before he released that aid.This is not something that's hyperbolic. It's here. He's done it before. And now, he's not going to have anybody around him. I just want to be clear about this. He's not going to have anybody around him to show him federal data to say, wait a second, President, maybe you should reassess. And I want people to understand that. Because I think the answer to your question, Jim, is that people have forgotten what he did as president before, and they need to be reminded over and over again. This is not Donald Trump saying crazy stuff. This is not hyperbolic. He has done this before. There were people around him to stop the worst impulses, including general Milley.

ROGINSKYBut here you have a fascist. And General Millie is right, because all the markers of a fascist exist in Donald Trump. And yet, our news media has not done enough by any stretch of the imagination to call this out. You know, Kamala Harris can call this out every day, but if it's not covered, if people keep asking on 60 Minutes, something like, why did the vice presidential candidate, Tim Walz, not -- why did he say he was in Tiananmen Square anywhere in Hong Kong during Tiananmen Square, over and over again, as opposed to actually asking questions that matter to the voters.

He led the recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina. General Honore, great to see you as always. I do want to talk about Florida a moment, but I need to ask you about this. I don't know if you saw this headline, but aid operations in two North Carolina counties were suspended after threats against FEMA workers. In an urgent e-mails of federal agencies obtained by The Washington Post, some National Guard troops had come across trucks of armed militia saying they were out hunting FEMA. How concerned are you about that? LT. GENERAL RUSSEL L. HONORE (RET.), LED HURRICANE KATRINA RECOVERY EFFORTS AND U.S. ARMY (RET.):  Well, I am concerned because it disrupted FEMA's operation to serve those communities, particularly those isolated areas up in the North Carolina mountains, that's a tough place to get to. And we need the troops in there, both National Guard and active troops and the FEMA teams to be able to provide aid to the people. So, this is disruptive. It shows what happened when rhetoric get out of hand just like it did on 1/6. And people go out and do things. You know, since Katrina, Jim, we saw all the troops in Katrina carrying guns. And one of the great things we've improved since Katrina is when we go out to hurricanes now, troops don't carry guns. I've always had a philosophy. You can allow more MREs without guns than with guns. You all don't see any troops with guns. Now, we're getting back to a threatening situation. That's sad.",
