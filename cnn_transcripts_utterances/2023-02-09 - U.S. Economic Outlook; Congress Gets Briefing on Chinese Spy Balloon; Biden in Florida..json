It's also home to two of Biden's potential 2024 rivals, Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, not to mention Biden's latest foil, Republican Senator Rick Scott. It is Scott's recent proposal to sunset federal programs that Biden has been hammering all week. And, in a few minutes, he will try to keep the pressure on with remarks focused on bolstering Social Security and Medicare. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is there in Tampa ahead of the speech. So, Priscilla, I don't think many people expected that Joe Biden and Rick Scott would be the first big political matchup of the year. But the White House is very much leaning into it.",

As you mentioned, Biden is driving his message home here that he is trying to protect Social Security and Medicare. And that is one of the issues that drew the fiercest reaction during the State of the Union this week. And he's doing it in the state where Rick Scott of Florida had proposed sunsetting federal legislation, including Social Security and Medicare, in five years. It's also, of course, a state that is home to two potential GOP challengers in 2024. Now, it was abundantly clear to the audience that filled in behind me what the focus was going to be today and how aggressively the White House is leaning into this, with every one of the seats behind me had Scott's 12-point plan that included that proposal, as well as Biden's plan on this issue. Now, of course, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that this was never going to gain traction. And this morning on CNN, Scott pushed back too, claiming that he had no intention of cutting Medicare and Social Security. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL):  He's a complete failure. I mean, look at what the people -- people in my state care about. Inflation, he caused it. Gas prices, he caused it. And there is no transparency in his administration. So he's been a complete failure. And now he lies about what I want to get done. And I don't appreciate it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's trying to bait him into the race. They're like magnets for each other. And he knows that. Number two, Rick Scott's a gadfly in our party who his ideas were rejected by the voters in the last cycle. We learned that in Senate races. He was then rejected by the Senate Republican Conference. And now Joe Biden wants us all to believe that we're following Rick Scott's ideas? It's just not true, particularly when you consider that, when Biden was a senator, he introduced legislation to sunset federal programs himself. So this whole thing is really dishonest partisan politics. He cannot escape one fact. His own party doesn't want him to run again. He's trying to change the subject and talk about anything but the fact that Democrats want to get out of this, but they can't figure out how to do it.",

And I think that he embraces it because it makes Republicans look all the more fringe. Now, I really appreciate Scott's attempt to marginalize Rick Scott, to act as though he wasn't the head of the Senatorial Campaign Committee, as though he wasn't sort of putting out policy positions that he expected the rest of the Republican Caucus to adopt. That's really sweet. And it's really nice, sort of in retrospect, to try to take that position. But, in fact, no, this is the position of the Republican Party that they have wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare. They have wanted to fight these culture wars and adopt these positions that very few mainstream Americans could possibly agree with. So, it behooves Democrats to bring them out there. That said, I think that, if I were the Biden campaign, what I would want to do is spend about 70 percent of my time focused on pocketbook issues -- on pocketbook issues, and maybe 30 percent of the time getting into taking the fight to them on culture wars.",

I don't know if you caught the news. He ran for Republican leader and got beat 37 to 10. This is a backbench gadfly idea. And the beef on the police, as far as I can tell, was more mainstream in the Democratic Party. But Joe Biden, to his credit, did reject it in the State of the Union.

And so there is going to be some debate, I think, internally in our party about defense spending. Some Republicans don't want to do it. Some want caps. Some want cuts. So I think Kevin McCarthy has a real challenge on his hands. But I have been surprised, pleasantly surprised, with how he's been able to unify people so far on various issues.

This is off the coast of South Carolina. There's a lot of the contents, the payload, so to speak, that remains underwater, under dozens of feet of water. And that is work that is a little bit more complicated, especially because of the weather and because you have Navy and FBI divers who are going down there. We have some of the first pictures now that you see there on your screen from the FBI of some of the recovery efforts. We also have pictures of the contents of the balloon that have now made their way to Quantico, which is the FBI lab that is going to be doing this analysis. They're hoping to learn a lot more about the signals intelligence collection, the communications collection that this balloon was doing. We asked a question on the briefing that we had with senior FBI officials whether there was anything that has been recovered so far that indicates explosives or anything that could have harmed the public as this balloon made its way across the United States. We were told that, at this point, again, the limited amount that they have been able to recover, they see nothing that would have been of use to that. So far, they have the balloon canopy, some wires, again, limited amounts of equipment. And one of the important things that we learned was that this is the first time that the FBI has actually been able to examine one of these. Abby, you know, from the last few days, we have heard that there have been a number of these that have been tracked across the United States. This is the first time that the FBI and its lab are being able to do -- are able to do this kind of analysis on one of these. And so they expect to learn a lot more -- Abby.",

And so on this question of whether or not it should have been shot down earlier or should have been shot down when it was shot down, I certainly take a look at the idea that the intelligence community is saying that the risk of people on the ground was higher than the risk of Chinese intelligence collection. And I have to consider that. Now, I -- look, as the general said, if we looked at this assessment and we said, you know what, it makes sense to shoot this down over the Aleutian Islands, and we could still get the same information, we should have done that. But, from my perspective, in terms of the argument, what we have to do is, we have to hear more from the administration. And I do think that's important. They have to explain more.
