How long will a judge now tell James and Jennifer Crumbley they're about to spend behind bars.A direct pitch to push Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson out of his job. Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and her new attack on Johnson's leadership just this morning. And he's accused of pledging his allegiance to ISIS and making plans to attack churches in Idaho. Now, one teenager is under arrest. I'm Kate Bolduan, with John Berman. Sara is out today. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Any moment now, a first of its kind sentencing in Michigan. The first parents convicted for the mass shooting their son carried out, they well find out their fate. James and Jennifer Crumbley each face up to 15 years in prison. Defense attorneys are asking for them to be given time served. And in an unconventional move, to say the least, one is even offering to allow her client to move in with her to live under house arrest. Both were found guilty on four counts of involuntary manslaughter after their son killed four students in a mass shooting at his high school. CNN's Jean Casarez has been following all of this for us. She's back here with us now. This is a very important day for the victims and their families. How is this going to play out? We're waiting to see this right now.",

Or will they even be able to have that time served? Very important. And both sides are going to work with the facts on that. The facts of this first ever homicide in this country, charges against parents, because they didn't pull the trigger. It's their son that pulled the trigger at Oxford High School.But that moment when the parents of the four children that were killed, gun down by Ethan Crumbley at Oxford High School, go to the podium, and we have learned it will only be the parents, the close family members of those four students, because those are the four convictions, the homicide convictions. And they will be able to pour out their hearts to James and Jennifer Crumbley, even speaking directly to them, we've heard that in this courtroom before in other circumstances, of how their life has changed, how their life will never be the same because they will say that the parents, you bought that gun for your child when you knew he could do something, you knew he had emotional problems, and four days later is when that mass shooting happened, Kate.",

And what concerns me as a former prosecutor, and a homicide prosecutors is, I've seen situations where it may make sense in one case, but then starts getting used in all sorts of other areas.

The prosecution was very focused on a jailhouse phone call that James Crumbley made, which, remember, when we were covering the trial, John, we didn't know what the content of the call was. So, the prosecutors are saying that that was actually a threat to prosecutors. Now, of course, defense, they're countering that saying, this is just him with a grievance and he's allowed to not like what the prosecutors are doing. That's his right. But that's certainly something that we're going to see prosecutors focus on with respect to James Crumbley. Could that enhance his sentence?

This issue has been briefed already. And it's really the Supreme Court's job, more than any other court in the country, to sort out questions like this. And I think, you know, sort of in the news we see it as a question of, well, what does that mean for the trial? Is this just about delay?

A drone strike would be an act within the president's authority, right? It's - the president can - you know, has access to various tools of the armed services. Could he do that? And Trump's team did not have an answer to that. And I would think that, to the extent the Supreme Court is to weigh this issue on the merits, that's the kind of question they'll be asking.

So, for instance, you might ask a juror what magazines do you read? What television shows do you watch? What even might your zip code be? And all of these questions can be used to get at various forms of data about a juror and ultimately how they might rule. Now, that last question you showed, that clause about - that would get in your way of being a fair, impartial juror is a very important question. And no matter what any juror says, the judge is ultimately going to ask them, OK, you've said you belong to QAnon or whatever else. Can you put that aside and be a fair and impartial juror? And if the judge is convinced that the person can, then perhaps they can be added to the jury pool.
