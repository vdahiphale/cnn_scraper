And the Iranians have been clear, saying that they will retaliate. And it is something you would expect after such a brazen attack by the Israelis on high level commanders from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. So the question has been since then, what sort of a retaliation are we going to be seeing? What form is it going to take? What is the scale? Where, how will it be Iran directly carrying out this retaliatory strike or strikes or are we going to be seeing Iran using its proxies and allies in the region to do this? Now what we are hearing from various U.S. sources, U.S. officials, in the last 24 hours is that they're saying that this is pretty much looking imminent at this point. As you heard from President Biden, there, they are also saying that this is going to be Iran carrying out an attack inside Israel. It could also potentially be using its proxy in these attacks, that it would potentially involve drones and missiles. And one -- and a number of U.S. officials as well, telling CNN that they have intelligence that the Iranians have been moving assets, military assets and weapons inside the country, including drones, cruise missiles. According to one official, up to 100 cruise missiles being readied. It is unclear whether this is going to be used in the Iranian retaliation or if this is posturing, Kim, because Israel has made clear, if it is attacked, it is going to respond as well inside Iran. So if this is Iran posturing in anticipation of any sort of response but we also need to keep in mind we have also heard from sources, Kim, saying that the Iranians want to respond as they have made clear. But at the same time they want this to be a calculated and measured response. The big question also remains not only how will Iran respond but how will Israel respond to any sort of attack by the Iranians as well?",

Meanwhile, former president Donald Trump may get on board with more aid for Ukraine if Kyiv eventually pays it back. He spoke after meeting House Speaker Mike Johnson at Trump's resort in Florida on Friday. Johnson has been holding up about $60 billion in military aid for months. Ukraine's president warned in recent days his country will lose the war without more U.S. help. Trump, who is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Donald Trump will be the one who bears the brunt likely for letting this essentially come into law. This is a hugely winning issue, at least in Arizona. We are a swing state. The Biden administration hasn't been kind to Arizona. Interest rates for homes are 7 percent. Gas is $4 a gallon and even eggs are $3-$4 a dozen. It was -- he, the president, faced a lot of headwinds. But this issue turns -- potentially turns Arizona from a Trump state to a Biden state.

Will that make a difference? MARSON: Well, the problem is he has said many things about abortion. It depends on the day and while sure, leaving it up to the States is great and it has been a Republican ideology for decades, the problem is in Arizona. Leaving it up to the States means a near-total ban and that is not where the Arizona electorate is. There will almost certainly be a initiative, a citizen initiative, on the ballot in November. So Donald Trump will be running at the same time that there is a initiative to allow abortion up to 24 weeks, which is much more liberal than the 15-week abortion ban that we -- that is sort of current law for a few more weeks.",

Scottie Scheffler, he's ranked number one in the world right now, the overwhelming betting favorite coming into this tournament. He's looking for a second green jacket after winning two years ago. He had to play late in the afternoon yesterday and he was able to survive those crazy wind gusts. Now Homa, meanwhile, he had his best start ever to a major in his career here in Augusta this year. The 33- year-old has become a fan favorite, you know, over the past few years. He's looking to break through for the first time. Homa one of only seven golfers to shoot under par here yesterday in those brutal windy conditions. His best finish ever at a major is tied for 10th at the open championship last year. So he's certainly hoping to beat that. And let's take a look at the leaderboard where we stand right now. So this is a very important leaderboard, 36 out of the last 37 Masters winners, including the last 12, they have been in the top 10 following the second round. So history tells us one of these guys is going to win the Masters this year. Now 2020, U.S. open champ Bryson DeChambeau, he was doing everything he could to make sure he stayed on top of that leaderboard yesterday. Check him out on 13. So he went into the trees and he had the idea to try to go right. But one of those Masters iconic patron signs was in the way. So he just went over and yanked it out of the ground to give him the shot he wanted. Well, a rules official came over and said, yes, you can't do that. So he had to put it back. Bryson, though, was still able to birdie the hole and he certainly gave everyone a nice laugh. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
