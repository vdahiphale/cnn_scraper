And that's you know, of course, something that the State Department is very concerned about, and the Defense Department is as well.It's very clear that Trevor Reid did this on his own. The United States does not have troops in Ukraine. And of course, they want to keep it that way for as long as they possibly can. But the other part of this story is that when Russia and Ukraine exchanged prisoners, of course, those -- some of those prisoners -- former prisoners come back to fight on the front lines almost immediately after they've been released.

And, of course, he walked into the Taliban frontlines and basically was captured by them and held prisoner for about five years.That, you know, is the situation where he did this. But because of the situation where the judge -- the presiding military judge was actually applying for a job as an immigration judge in the Trump executive branch, that created a problem where the perception was pretty clear that it's possible that that military judge was currying favor with the Trump administration. And if we remember back in those days, President Trump when he was running for president, he very much called Bergdahl a traitor. Called him you know somebody that does not deserve fair treatment under the U.S. military justice system. And that situation could be considered undue command influence.

You're telling me that this investigation is still ongoing.The prosecution said that's right. It is ongoing. And he was saying they couldn't bring, for instance, a tax evasion federal charge. But he said that they were still investigating. It's then that the judge said. Well, what about a FARA charge? That's not registering as a foreign agent? Remember, part of this investigation was very expansive. It looked into Hunter Biden's overseas business deals. She asked the prosecutor would that be covered. He said, no, it wouldn't. And it was at that point that then they went back and forth between Biden's team and the prosecution. And both side's saying that at this point, there was no meeting of the minds about what was covered by the plea agreement and so the deal was off the table. BERMAN: All right. Kara Scannell, in Wilmington, Delaware, thank you for bringing us up to speed. Again, keep us posted. If they're -- well, actually, let me assess finally, Kara. Has ever one left?

And I haven't seen any of the parties to the case walk out of the courthouse just yet. So, we'll have to go back inside and see if there have been any additional developments.

When a defendant pleads guilty, in this case to tax charges, that's it for those tax charges. He can't be charged with those charges.Again, he's covered, immunized, wherever you want to call it. He's not in jeopardy of being prosecuted again for those tax charges. But what the judge said is, how about anything else? And Kara mentioned FARA, the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which is one of the potential crimes that we've had reporting in the past that Hunter Biden's been under investigation for, has nothing to do with taxes. Is he covered for that? Sometimes, a plea agreement will say the defendant's covered for anything we know about as DOJ right now. And sometimes the plea agreement will say he's only covered for the narrow charges that he's pleading guilty to. Now, I'm actually surprised they didn't already have that worked out. So, the judge said. If you don't have an agreement about whether Hunter Biden is covered for anything outside the scope of this paper, then you don't have a deal. And the judge is right.

And we know that a lot of things that appear to now be part of the disagreement have been at the center of this.We know that the investigators looked into money laundering charges. They looked into whether they charged Hunter Biden with violating the FARA law, which is, you know, the Foreign Agents Registration Act. All of those things were covered in depth as part of this investigation. And certainly, as part of our reporting, we understood that you know, sometime last year, the investigators and the prosecution, everybody on the Justice Department side had decided that the strongest part of this case was the tax charges, the part that is at the center of this agreement that at least we thought was going to be stamped by this judge. So, the idea that according to prosecutors, there is still some aspect of those other possible charges that are still under investigation. You know, that's certainly huge news to emerge at this court hearing. It's an -- it's an amazing thing for Hunter Biden's lawyers to have entered into this agreement without getting the Justice Department to say whether the FARA charges, whether the money laundering charges, whether anything else that they had covered as part of this five-year- old investigation, whether any of that was still possible to charge against Hunter Biden. And the idea that at this late hour at the -- at the final hour here right before this judge is where they are now saying, well, we don't really agree on this is just astonishing. Again, this is something that we know was a big part of this. And, guys, you know, going back to the politics of this, you heard from those IRS whistleblowers that is part of what they believe certainly was strong enough to bring charges on. But the prosecutors decided it wasn't strong enough. That they didn't think was quite there, and why they decided to narrow this case just to the tax charges for 2017, 2018 misdemeanor. So, again, it's a very surprising turn of events. This is a history-making case, by all accounts, and certainly something like this never -- doesn't happen every day in federal court.",

And everyone was sort of trying to read the tea leaves about what this meant. Did this just mean the investigation was ongoing in the sense that, you know, you have to wait for Hunter Biden to formally enter his plea, for the judge to approve it for the judge to sign off on the sentencing, or could there be another piece of it? And in Weiss's letters to Capitol Hill, he did kind of signal that there may be another piece of this ongoing. You know, when he was agreeing to show up for testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee led by Republicans in September and October, his letter about that, notes that there could be investigative steps, prosecutorial decisions, and judicial proceedings that are ongoing that he was not able to talk about. And again, I think a lot of people looked at that line and thought, you know, that just means let's get through the plea deal. Let's get through the sentencing.

And especially, by the way, if you believe you've worked at a deal that will likely spare you prison time, as in this case, it's ultimately up to the judge. And so, the number one question I would have if I was the defense lawyer here is he's going to -- the deal is he's going to plead guilty to these two tax misdemeanors, we're going to divert the gun charge assuming he behaves himself, but what happens with all that other stuff that's been swirling for five years? And if you don't have a straight answer on that, you don't have a deal and the judge is right to not accept it. BERMAN: Right. Stand by, Ellie, for one more minute here. Let's bring back our Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez. And, Evan, if you will just take a step back and look at all of this now, where does this leave things in your mind? Where are we now if this deal falls apart in the Hunter Biden investigation?",

I think they are looking at the statute of limitations that they are going to be bumping up against.It is the case. You heard this from one of the whistleblowers already, that as a result of how long this case has gone on how much foot- dragging they say was going on behind the scenes, they already lost one year of the statute of limitations on one possible year of a possible tax crime that could have been charged. At least again, according to the testimony from the -- from these whistleblowers. The question for prosecutors is, you know, if, if you don't have a deal, then you have to decide whether you're going to go to trial on this. And you know that you don't have a lot more time to work with. Certainly, you know, the 2017 tax here could be in jeopardy here. So, one of the things that I think for prosecutors, one of the reasons why they want to make this deal was they wanted to salvage at least some part of this Hunter Biden to agree. And you know, already in court, he's already said that he's planning or he was planning to plead guilty to not paying his taxes on time for 2017 and 2018. And so, if right, and if there is no deal, then prosecutors have to decide whether they're ready to bring charges on these -- on these cases, on this charge -- on this -- on those tax years, whether there's any other possible crimes that they can bring. And again, the time-sensitive nature of this is that this is -- this is stuff that is so old, already. We've -- we're talking about an investigation that's been going on for five years. And so, you know, for them, you know, there's going to be an incentive to try to come to terms with whether they can do this whether they have to do more investigation, how much longer can they do that. And that's part of what is also probably working behind the scenes in the minds of the prosecution here, guys.",
