This, after what we saw Saturday,the U.S. and the Royal Jordanian Air Force dropping aid along the coastlines of Gaza. Now, the U.S. said that they dropped 66 bundles, that was 38,000 meals. No water or medical supplies in this airdrop. But they say that they did consider it successful as they were monitoring the area afterwards and said that they saw civilians come out to take the aid and then distribute it. Now, Jordan and the UAE have already been doing airdrops over recent days, and we know that other countries are considering whether this is the way to try and get desperately needed aid into the some of the hardest hit areas off Gaza. But we are hearing from some humanitarian aid groups that this is not the ideal way to try and get the aid in. They say -- in fact, one called it a band aid measure to try and help those desperately in need. Of course, once the aid lands in Gaza, there is no organized distribution. There is no control over who gets this aid. And there`s no guarantee that it will get to those who desperately need it. What we`re hearing from humanitarian aid groups and the U.N. agencies, and we`ve been hearing this for months, is that Israel needs to lift restrictions on what gets into Gaza, restrictions at the crossings, and restrictions of transporting the aid around the Gaza Strip once it is inside. Now, one thing that all humanitarian aid groups agree is that a ceasefire would allow them to get humanitarian aid into where it is needed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Ten second trivia.What was the CDC or Centers for Disease Control and Preventions primary mission when it first began in 1946? Combat malaria, teach public health workers, develop good hygiene routines, or study cancer. If you said, combat malaria, boomshakalaka. The CDC`s first name was actually the Communicable Disease Center and it established its headquarters in Atlanta because malaria was most prevalent in the south. Our next story is about new COVID-19 guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We ask CNN`s Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, to explain these changes, why they were made and about the best ways for people to protect themselves from the virus. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, these are some of the biggest changes in guidance that we`ve heard from the CDC in quite some time now. And there`s people who say, look, this is a long time coming. Other people who understandably are very concerned about this especially people who are more vulnerable, have some sort of pre-existing condition for example. Let`s take a look here. Previous guidance on the left, current now guidance on the right. The top line is the most significant. In the past, they said days zero to five you should stay in isolation, now they`re saying stay home or away from others if you have symptoms. The reason that`s concerning for a lot of people is because we know you can still be contagious even if you don`t have symptoms. Day six and onward they say especially if you`re going to be around vulnerable people, you should wear a mask. You should think about ventilation. You should try and keep your distance. Now, part of the reason they`re making these changes, the CDC, few reasons. They say that 97% of the country now has some degree of immunity which is probably true between vaccination and people who`ve been previously infected. But keep in mind, a lot of people get infected over and over again, so if they have the immunity, it doesn`t seem to last very long. Also, if you look at hospitalizations and deaths, they`ve gone down consider considerably, 60% lower for hospitalizations. Deaths have gone down 83%. Let me show you this graphic as well. They implemented this in Oregon in the past back in May of 2023. And you can see what sort of happened. Cases did surge again. And then you had these sort of these absent and flows of cases, but the CDC says Oregon really behaved not much differently than the national average. So, even with the loosening of the guidelines, it didn`t seem to increase the risk they say at least to people there in Oregon. Now, one thing to keep in mind is that some people say this is sort of flu- ifying COVID. We`re treating this like flu. But I want to show you this graph that we pulled, that makes this case that COVID is still a lot more concerning than flu. Orange line is COVID. Go back to 2019, 2020, you see the difference between COVID. Flu in blue and then R is -- red is RSV. Even now, most currently you see how much more of an impact COVID has overall on hospitalizations. In the last season, flu killed -- had about 21,000 people who died. With COVID, it was closer to 245,000. COVID is not flu. People can still spread this even when they`re asymptomatic as I mentioned. They are more contagious. They are contagious for longer with COVID. They can experience symptoms for a long time after infection, long COVID, and it can cause some very serious illness in people. So, I think that`s the concern that even though it`s being treated, more and more COVID been treated more and more like flu, it is not flu. As we get more information about these guidelines, we`ll certainly bring them to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

A rare treat as these plants have a blooming cycle that can take years sometimes even longer than a decade. This one lurked underground gathering nutrients for five years, and then like a zombie rising from the dead, shot up to nearly seven feet tall. These beautiful behemoth-like blooms only last for about 24 to 48 hours. But why the term corpse flower? Well, it smells like rotting flesh apparently. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
