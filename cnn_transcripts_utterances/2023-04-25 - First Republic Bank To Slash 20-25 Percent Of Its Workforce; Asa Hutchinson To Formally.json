Even though Donald Trump lost the last election in 2020 he's still the former president, and so there's a lot of swag that goes with that. And so, that's not a surprise. But I do think there is a significant number in the Republican Party who believe that we'll have a hard time winning against Joe Biden in a repeat race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden and that we're going to have to have a change if we're going to win, and we have some great alternatives.

He said, \"The Capitol was the focus from the start.\" That \"They made it plain as day that they were there. It was not to see Donald Trump's speech, it was not protect patriots, it was certainly not to protest peacefully. They were there to threaten and, if necessary, use force to stop the certification of the election.\" So the defense has come out and said look, you may not like what these defendants have said -- because they've heard some of what the defendants have said. They've seen -- you saw Dominic Pezzola -- we just saw him. He was the one using the officer's shield to break into the Capitol -- literally, one of the first people to break through the window and then let everybody flood in.
