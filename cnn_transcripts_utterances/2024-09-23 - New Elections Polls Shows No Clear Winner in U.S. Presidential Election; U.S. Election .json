      "sentences": "Several senior officials have stepped down from Mark Robinson's campaign. He's the embattled Republican candidate for North Carolina governor. Robinson is facing fallout after CNN reported he made inflammatory comments on a pornographic website over a decade ago. He is the current lieutenant governor of North Carolina.U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris says she'll deliver a speech this week focusing on her vision for the economy, which is consistently a top issue for voters. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump will rally supporters in the coming hours in Pennsylvania. It's a battleground state that will play a key role in deciding the next president. Trump's presence in Pennsylvania comes amid new poll numbers that show him trailing Harris 49 percent to 44 percent according to the survey from NBC News. That figure reflects Trump's lowest level of support in a poll that meets CNN standards since Harris became a candidate. But this is still a very tight race, as CNN's Poll of Polls shows no clear leader between the two nominees. On Sunday, whilst Trump urged his supporters to vote early in the states of Minnesota and Virginia through tele-rallies, his Democratic challenger raised $27 million in New York. The Harris campaign says that is the largest amount raised from a single event since she moved to the top of the ticket. Donald Trump is scoring a somewhat unexpected endorsement, meanwhile, from the mayor of the first U.S. city governed entirely by Muslims. Amer Ghalib serves as the mayor of Hamtramck in the battleground state of Michigan. Trump reposted Ghalib's endorsement shortly afterwards on his Truth Social page on Sunday. Meanwhile, Trump is already raising doubts with no evidence about the integrity of the upcoming vote, and that's making things even more tense for election workers who are facing increasing threats to their own safety. CNN's Brian Todd has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hazmat teams respond, and an election office in Iowa is evacuated.

And so the contrast between the two visions of our future could not be more stark and different.I think Kamala's campaign has demonstrated, as it's already been written and talked about, a level of energy, even joy. The contrast is the Trump campaign. It's dark. It's dystopian. It's filled with, you know, attacks on different kinds of people, finger pointing and scapegoating. That's a very different view of who we are as a people and what we should aspire to. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The SPD narrowly defeated an effort by the far-right Alternative for Germany party. Projections give the Social Democrats 30.7 percent of the vote, with the AFD getting 29.4 percent. The AFD leaders told cheering supporters it is the party of the future. While it is strongly anti-immigrant and pro-Russia, its narrow loss comes just three weeks after AFD became the first far-right party to win a German state election since World War II. Voters in Sri Lanka elected a new president who calls himself a Marxist. The left-leaning politician won in a landslide with more than 42 percent of the vote. This after the incumbent led the nation through an economic meltdown by imposing austerity measures that left voters angry. At its peak, inflation in the South Asian nation was 70 percent. Turnout was strong, with some 75 percent of eligible Sri Lankans casting a ballot. Crowds took to the streets to celebrate. The new president represents the People's Liberation Front. He beat his nearest rival by more than a million votes. In the coming hours, world leaders will gather for discussions focused on our world's future and how the U.N. will help it develop. That's part of the two-day Summit of the Future, centered around a document called the Pact for the Future, which world leaders adopted on Sunday. It's seen as a blueprint on how to address critical issues in the world, like conflicts and climate change. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said this type of summit was needed given the current state of the world. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL: I called for this summit because our world is heading off the rails and we need tough decisions to get back on track. Conflicts are raging and multiplying from the Middle East to Ukraine and Sudan with no end in sight. Our collective security system is threatened by geopolitical divides, nuclear posturing and the development of new weapons and theatres of war.

That includes covering nearly 3,000 orbits of the Earth and a journey of 78 million miles, would you believe? The Soyuz is expected to parachute to the Earth in Kazakhstan less than four hours from now. The Russian spacecraft launched March 23rd and arrived at the space station March 25th. Dyson spent her fourth spaceflight aboard the station as a flight engineer. Kononenko is completing his fifth flight into space and occurring an all-time record of 100 -- no rather, 1,111 days in orbit. Chub is completing his first spaceflight. After returning to Earth, Dyson will board a NASA plane and return to Houston. Kononenko and Chub will depart for a training base in Star City, Russia. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
