Less than a day after Tehran launched its largest ever aerial attack against Israel, these are live pictures from Beirut, Lebanon, where smoke is hanging over the sky.(VIDEO PLAYING) These were the new strikes launched overnight by the IDF against Hezbollah targets in Beirut's southern suburbs after issuing evacuation orders for several neighborhoods. And Hezbollah have claimed to have hit back with a rocket attack on an Israeli military barracks along the Lebanese-Israeli border. And we'll get to that in a moment. Meanwhile, both Israel and Iran are trying to control the narrative over the impact of Tehran's unprecedented attack. The commander-in- chief of Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps says 200 missiles were fired and that 90 percent of them hit their targets. Well the Israeli prime minister claims the attack failed but is nevertheless promising to strike back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Iran made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies. We will stand by the rule we established. Whoever attacks us, we will attack him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, the U.S. President later spoke on how the attack was thwarted. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: At my direction, the United States military actively supported the defense of Israel, and we're still assessing the impact. But based on what we know now, the attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective. And this is testament to Israeli military capability and the U.S. military.

Joining us now live and you are keeping a keen eye on what is going on here hour by hour. I think it's important to discuss, given that the Prime Minister here has vowed a response, what the likely targets for further Israeli attacks on Iran and indeed Hezbollah might be. Let's start with Iran. What are Israel's options to your mind if it chooses to counter attack or retaliate, counter retaliate on Iran?MALCOLM DAVIS, MILITARY ANALYST AND SR. ANALYST FOR DEFENSE STRATEGY AND CAPABILITY, AUSTRALIAN STRATEGIC POLICY INSTITUTE: Well, look, I think there are a number of clear options in terms of Iran's military capabilities, its air bases, the locations of likely Iranian ballistic missile forces, command and control networks. All of these would be quite legitimate targets to hit. The second type of targets that could be hit would be Iranian oil fields that could potentially undermine Iran's economy. That could generate internal unrest, which could threaten the regime's grip on power. But I think the one that everyone is kind of focusing on, quite understandably, is the nuclear facilities. Those nuclear facilities where Iran's, supposedly, has built up sufficient fissile material that is probably one to two weeks away from having enough fissile material for a nuclear device, maybe longer to weaponize that into a deliverable weapon. But from Israel's perspective, it cannot allow Iran to get nuclear weapons. So there would certainly be strong pressure within Netanyahu's cabinet to attack those nuclear facilities and essentially set back the Iranian nuclear weapons program potentially by years.",

They were unorthodox and audacious and they had been carefully planned for months in advance in terms of Israel intelligence getting into the Hezbollah supply chain to intercept those pagers and implant explosives inside those pagers.It may not be so straightforward to attack the, for example, the Iranian nuclear facilities, but certainly cyber-attacks where they could against the Iranian command and control against the nuclear facilities, and they've done that before, combined with kinetic attacks, the sort of, air strikes that you could see the Israeli Air Force undertake using precision guided weapons and bunker busters, the sort of weapon they used against Nasrallah's compound, are the most likely targets, most likely way that they would attack those targets.",

Is it clear at this point whether that will be Israel's next target? We are certainly seeing, by the way, just overnight here, efforts on Hezbollah's part to counter-attack against Israeli forces who are now in, if not on a temporary basis, in southern Lebanon.",

So in any war you attack, the enemy responds, then you respond to their attack and so on and so forth. And so you could see this going back and forth on many levels where Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis and the militias in Iraq and Syria, all being led off the leash by Tehran, even as Tehran unleashes its own retaliation in the future. This is going to go on for several waves and several cycles back and forth. And obviously each time it happens, the risk of a greater escalation, a more intense response by either side increases. And so I do think that yes, you could see Hezbollah unleash that larger arsenal that they're keeping in reserve. Part of that missile capability is Iran's missile capability.

So from Tehran's vantage point it's a matter of time before Israel is also going to do the same in Tehran or try to set back or challenge Iran's support for these groups as well Iran is trying to throw down some red lines, knowing full well that it is in a defensive position, that Hezbollah is compromised, and that it doesn't have the traditional conventional capabilities to fight Israel.

But the axis of resistance certainly was never no match against Israel. Israel has always had the quantitative military edge across the Middle East. It has intelligence dominance, military dominance, and the events of the past week have certainly reaffirmed all of that. The bigger problem I see here in the balance of power is twofold. First of all the big issue is the question of Palestine. Nobody is talking about what comes next. Nobody's talking about a settlement process self-determination for the Palestinians. That is the best way for Israel to address its security crisis.

Iran has sent ballistic missiles to Russia. Obviously, Iran's role across the region is on full display.

The U.S. election appears closer than ever after the vice presidential debate on Tuesday night. Going into the debate, a majority of voters said they expected Democrat Tim Walz would win against Republican J.D. Vance. But afterwards, voters were much more evenly split about which candidate came out on top. They sparred over the economy, housing, immigration, reproductive rights and other top issues as they made their pitch to voters just five weeks until election day. They focused their attacks instead on their opponents' running mates. The first question of the night was about the conflict in the Middle East and whether the nominees would support or oppose a preemptive strike on Iran by Israel following Tuesday's missile barrage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Iran which launched this attack has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration. Where do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching it against our allies, and God forbid, potentially launching against the United States as well. Donald Trump recognize that for people to stiff here the United States you needed peace through strength, they needed to recognize that if they got out of line the United States global leadership would put stability in peace back in the world. Now you asked about a preemptive strike, Margaret, and I want to answer the question. Look, it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe, and we should support our allies wherever they are when they're fighting the bad guys. I think that's the right approach to take with the Israel question. MARGARET BRENNAN, \"FACE THE NATION\" ANCHOR AND CBS NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Thank you, Senator. Governor Walz, do you care to respond to any of the allegations? GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, look, Donald Trump was in office. We'll sometimes hear a revisionist history, but when Donald Trump was in office, it was Donald Trump who we had a coalition of nations that had boxed Iran's nuclear program in, the inability to advance it. Donald Trump pulled that program and put nothing else in its place. So Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership. And when Iran shot down an American aircraft in international airspace, Donald Trump tweeted because that's the standard diplomacy of Donald Trump. And when Iranian missiles did fall near U.S. troops and they received traumatic brain injuries, Donald Trump wrote it off as headaches. Look, our allies understand that Donald Trump is fickle. He will go to whoever has the most flattery or where it makes sense to him. Steady leadership like you witnessed today, like you witnessed in April, both Iranian attacks were repelled. Our coalition is strong and we need the steady leadership that Kamala Harris is providing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Walz's best moments, as I said, I think were the closing about democracy, but also the exchanges about abortion. I thought Vance, it was striking that on both abortion and healthcare, he largely dodged the questions. He's really been out there on healthcare, making clear that Republicans still have plans to reconfigure, restructure the Affordable Care Act to undermine its core protection for people with pre-existing conditions.

You know, in the end more sound than fury than signifying anything. Vice presidential debates have not really had a big impact on presidential races. Otherwise, we'd be talking about President Dukakis after Lloyd Benson demolished Dan Quayle in 1988. But I do think for Democrats, there are probably frustrating moments where Walz did not take the offensive. To some extent, maybe to a considerable extent, that was a race from the board by that very strong final few minutes. He really did save the best for last talking about democracy, not only looking back at January 6th and Trump's actions, but looking forward to what a Vance would do if presented with the same circumstances in which Mike Pence stood up for the Constitution.

They're more likely to attack military bases, including the missile and drone bases where attacks against Israel have been launched from the past, potentially secondary nuclear sites that are less significant and less well-defended, less further underground, and secondary economic targets. This seems like the most likely outcome at this stage, because it would inflict serious damage on Iran and allowed the Israelis to walk away, saying that they conducted a major retaliation, while at the same time permitting the Islamic Republic to do perhaps a more pro forma response from its farm, including cruise missiles and drones that are more easy to intercept. And this round could end there. A second scenario, which I think at this stage is not unlikely, is that Israel will attempt to strike major nuclear facilities, although they don't have the capability to do damage to the most deeply buried facilities at Fordow and Natanz. And it could also, as has been discussed, potentially strike major economic targets like significant oil infrastructure, including the terminal at (inaudible) and elsewhere.
