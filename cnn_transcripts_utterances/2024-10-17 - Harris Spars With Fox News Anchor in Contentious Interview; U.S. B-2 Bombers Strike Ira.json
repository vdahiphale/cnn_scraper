The Pentagon says, the strike showed the U.S. can reach its targets, quote, anytime, anywhere.Let's get right to CNN Pentagon Correspondent Oren Liebermann. Oren, what's the latest on this strike? OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: John, the Red Sea in the Gulf of Aden may not get the attention of other parts of the Middle East, but the Houthi attacks on U.S. Navy warships and on commercial vessels have continued. Just last week, for example, we saw the Houthis hit an American oil tanker with ballistic missiles, and the Houthis have successfully or claim to have downed U.S. multimillion dollar drones over Yemen. The U.S. has made it clear that if those attacks continue, then the U.S. will hit, and in this case, the U.S. hit hard, using B-2 stealth bombers to carry out attacks. You see the locations there on five different underground storage facilities for weapons, the weapons the Pentagon says are used to carry out those attacks. And that was the purpose here, to degrade, to take away from the Houthi's abilities to target shipping. You don't see the U.S. carry out strikes of this magnitude every day, but when the U.S. essentially has seen these attacks continue long enough, they do act. And that's exactly what we saw happen last night with strikes from B-2 stealth bombers against these facilities.",

      "sentences": "That's right. This is the first time we've seen the B-2 stealth bomber used to attack the Houthis over the course of the last year. So, the question, why this specific bomber? Normally, the U.S. uses fighter jets to carry out these strikes. But B-2s, obviously strategic bombers, have a much heavier payload, a much heavier bomb load they can carry, and that perhaps is the reason why they were used.The Pentagon pointed out that these were hardened bunkers, so it's possible the U.S. used these to be able to carry perhaps bunker busters or heavier bombs that are able to target armored or hardened underground facilities. And that may be the reason we're seeing this used here. The U.S. also pointing out that they were Navy assets as part of this strike. So, you see the force that the U.S. brought here. And it also sends a very clear message to the Houthis that if the attacks continue, and every sign indicates that they will, then these U.S. strikes will continue against their facilities, their radars we have seen targeted before, and other sites.",

Well, we saw it in April when we had the solar eclipse and the moon blocked out the sun. But, you know, this is more significant.Before you head outside, let's talk about what we are witnessing this morning at 7:26. That's right now. It is actually at its peak. It is 14 percent larger, appearing 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter than the moon at apogee, which I'll explain in just one moment. But you can see the beautiful celestial spectacle over my left hand shoulder just before it crosses the horizon here in Atlanta, Georgia. So, what in the world is a super moon? Well, it's all about the path of how the moon rotates around the planet. Think of it more like an egg. It's an elliptical path, so it's actually at its perigee and that is its closest approach to Earth. So, that gives us this closer feel, look that brighter component to the moon that you see directly over me. And this is significant because it's around 40 percent larger and 30 percent brighter than what it would normally be just on a regular full moon or at its apogee, which is its furthest point away from the moon. So, this is coinciding now with the full moon, so we get this spectacle that we're all witnessing this morning, and it's also called the hunter's moon. And this is -- the reason for this is that its enhanced appearance actually was a sign to hunters in several hundred years ago that they needed to prepare for the upcoming winter, so the fact that they can plan out these super moon events around the autumn equinox and around the hunting season, and also providing for the winter season. So, we need clear skies in order for it to be visible clearly here in Atlanta. We've got perfect conditions, much of the Midwest and the East Coast, looking fantastic. If you can get outside after this live shot, of course, and see it for yourself, because it is one of four super moons that we're in the third one of this series right now. It's called the hunter moon. John?",
