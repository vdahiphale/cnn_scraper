They sort of unit and link together.The problem is that, to your point, there's some serious concerns from longtime Biden allies, Biden confidants that staying in this race could tarnish what is otherwise a pretty incredible and improbable, in some ways, legacy of political life. Because if he loses face in this race and loses to Donald Trump, that could end up being the first line of his obituary. And that's what people who really love Joe Biden are still a little bit worried about.",

      "sentences": "We continue to follow a monumental Supreme Court decision on the powers of the presidency. The highest court in the land ruling today that former President Trump is entitled to some level of immunity from prosecution for the actions that he took in the final days of his presidency.This decision will likely further delay the former president's federal criminal trial on efforts to overturn the 2020 election and set a new precedent for future commanders-in-chief. We're joined now by Congressman Dan Kildee, who is a Democrat from Michigan. So thank you so much for being with us. And I do want to talk to you about the immunity decision here in just a moment. But first, we haven't spoken since the president's debate performance, and I want to see what you think about whether he can win Michigan after that. REP. DAN KILDEE (D-MI): Well, I think he still can win Michigan because the difference between the two candidates couldn't be more stark in terms of the policies that they promote and the records that they have. But look, it was not a good debate performance. It wasn't consistent with the Joe Biden that I know and that I know well. But obviously, this is something that makes the Hill a little bit taller. But the stakes couldn't be greater. And so I think, in Michigan, at the end of the day, people are going to think about which of these two people have their interest, which of these two people are honest and decent people who believe in the rule of law, who respect other human beings. And there's no question Joe Biden comes out ahead on that, no matter how well or poorly he performs in a 90-minute debate.",

But I think we've gone through the process and Joe Biden emerged as the nominee of our party, for good reason, because he's got a track record that warrants it.But I get it. No candidate is perfect. Everyone is searching for something that would guarantee that Donald Trump will not be in the White House. That's what they're looking for. And I think, for us, the question is, what's the best path forward? Is it to stick with a guy who's proven himself to have the moral standing, the ethics, the intellect, the ability to guide us and to create great policy that's positively affecting the American people? Creating 15 million jobs. Unemployment is low. Or do we want to go back to a Donald Trump presidency? Now, even more unfettered, given the other subject of our conversation, the Supreme Court saying that he's immune from prosecution for official acts. I think that's a toxic combination. To the choice between the two, I think is even greater now than it was 24 hours ago.",

So I think he probably could get better advice in terms of how to prepare and present himself to the American people. That was -- that was not a good performance. And he alone can't be held completely responsible. And the people around him -- I don't think they did a very good job of preparing them for it. But look, we've got -- we've got democracy on the line. We've got democracy at stake. And so we can't let the search for the perfect be the enemy of the good. And Joe Biden is a very good person.",

A -- let's just say we follow their logic and an administration goes rogue and attempts to prosecute a predecessor, the judicial system has to adjudicate that. A jury would have to hear the evidence and make a determination. What this court is saying, we're going to take that away. We're going to take away 200 years-plus of jurisprudence. We're going to take away the right for a person to face their accuser and have a jury of their peers make a determination. We're going to say that this is a case that can't even be brought. Even under the most egregious circumstances, we're not going to allow it to be subjected to the judicial process. And I think that's just dead wrong.",

It went right over. Beryl, there you go. But it went right over there, that island here. And so this is where we're going now into the Caribbean, away from the islands. But even Grenada had a wind gust last hour of 121 miles per hour. Officially, it's 150 miles per hour around the eye, not in the eye, around the eye, in the eyewall.
