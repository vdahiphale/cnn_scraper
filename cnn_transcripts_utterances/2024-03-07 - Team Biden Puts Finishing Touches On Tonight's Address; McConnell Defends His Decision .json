Welcome all.Isaac, let me start with you because you have a piece that it might tweak some feelings in the White House this morning kind of looking at basically what are the challenges for the president going into tonight. What are some people who want to see him win telling him that he needs to do? Tell us more. EDWARD-ISAAC DEVORE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Well look, the State of the Union is always a little bit of theatrics, or a lot of theatrics. In this case, as you said, it's important. It's the big speech that he has not only going into a reelection year but coming at this moment when people are saying is he up to it. Is he up to the job? Is he up to a second term? The -- a lot of Democrats that I've been talking to -- leading Democrats over the last couple of weeks have been saying not just with the State of the Union by overall. They want to see more of a fight out of him. They want to see enthusiasm, passion, pride. Those are the words that I hear. Governor Tim Walz from Minnesota, who is a big fan of the president and very much on board, said people need to hear it from the candidate himself and they need to feel like he's a fighter that -- the question is he tough enough, he's got to answer. And that's something that comes up when they hear these stories of oh, he's cursing about Donald Trump behind closed doors, or Benjamin Netanyahu, or he says something tough at a fundraiser. It's like let's see some of that because he needs to show it and show he's got the vitality to run and that he has the enthusiasm that he's going to drum up in Democrats across the country.",

And then when Obama came to office it was an absolute scandal that Joe Wilson leapt up and said \"You lie\" in the middle of that speech.And I've got to be honest with you. That seems almost quaint in comparison to what we have seen in the years since. This is one of the rowdiest audiences that any president will have likely faced in the State of the Union. Biden kind of turned it to his advantage last year. He kind of -- you know, he punched back when he was talking about the State of the Union. What are you expecting?

Some of those hardline conservatives. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Congressmen Jim Comer and Jim Jordan. They're leading the impeachment inquiry against him. Congresswoman Lauren Boebert and other folks who we've seen be very critical of the president.

Of course, they are going to speak out because that's how it's become with these divisive politics. And again, they are face-to-face with their political opponent, to your guy's point, at a moment where it's a very high-stakes speech. And we're going to see a lot of heckling.

There was a time in the -- in the -- during the second impeachment trial where there were a lot of questions about how McConnell was going to vote. Whether or not he was going to pressure other Republicans to vote to convict Trump in that circumstance. He ultimately didn't. He used his floor speech announcing his resignation to say that I've been accused of being wrong about a lot of things but where -- knowing where my party's politics are is not one of them.

And it's not just McConnell. You had Kim Reynolds, the governor of Iowa, who said many things about how she didn't think Donald Trump would be fit to lead, endorse him yesterday. Glenn Youngkin, the governor of Virginia, will see the -- I assume some of the last remaining holdouts in the next couple of days -- go that direction, too.

In my area, actually, crime is down pretty consistently for the last few years, which is encouraging. We've got to keep doing more work.So I've been pushing and fighting for more funding, particularly on the fentanyl and opioid epidemic. That's been really the number one public safety concern that I hear in our area. I just with a family over the weekend who lost their son to a fatal overdose from fentanyl. And so, we're pushing more resources there. We're pushing to block China from bringing in all the precursor chemicals. And, of course, I've been strongly calling consistently for more funding and more border security, which is one of the biggest things I hear in my district.

Hamas is leaving Cairo with no breakthrough in negotiations to try to reach a ceasefire as calls for that ceasefire in Gaza are growing around the world. A senior source says the delegation is going to resume negotiations next week. You'll remember that Israel did not send a delegation to participate in this round of talks when Hamas refused to provide a list of hostages that were still alive in Gaza.

So that meant the ball certainly didn't move like it's supposed to -- sometimes not rolling at all. And that helped the U.S. score their first goal right here. Now, they squeegeed the field at halftime to try to help the conditions but the U.S. Women's National Team interim head coach Twila Kilgore said it was tough out there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TWILA KILGORE, INTERIM COACH, U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM:  You know, the game is played under all sorts of conditions all over the world. And today, our conditions happened to be a ton of rain and standing water on the field. And you've got to find a way to get it done. And these things -- these things do happen in football. So I would say being able to adjust to any sort of conditions is always a part of it and it takes a certain mentality to do that. And we did that today and we're not going to shy away from celebrating that because it's not easy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
