That's putting a number on it. These are probabilities. There's not an exact sort of number here, but it's around that number. This was based on a large study of 400 million person meta analysis around the world sort of trying to answer this question. And where they landed was somewhere around 20 percent of your overall longevity is based on genetics.To put two finer points on it, there's about 20 longevity genes now that have been identified. And these represent potential targets for scientists going forward. It's why we're likely to continue to improve longevity and even get far more centenarians in the next few decades. But also, it changes a bit throughout your age, throughout your life. So, the first seven to eight decades of your life, that's going to be far more lifestyle. But then when you get into your last couple of decades of life, that's where genetics may start to take on an outsized sort of role there. And case in point, take a look at this picture, Sara. These there my own parents who are living a really healthy lifestyle. And my dad actually turned 80 this week. That's them at the gym. And they're pushing some iron. And I think resistance training in particular makes a huge difference. So, that's something they do as well. SIDNER: Oh, my God, the Guptas are so adorable.

You know, I think this is just showing another way how the two parties are shifting right now.I mean if you go back, you know, even just a decade ago, again the Republican Party was largely, you know, the college degree, largely white, largely upper class party, and the Democrats were doing quite well with blue collar voters across the spectrum, whether they were white, black, Latino, et cetera. That's changing, right? We are seeing that change before our very eyes most dramatically right now. And it's the reason you're seeing a Kennedy campaign with Trump and a Cheney campaign with Kamala Harris. And so, you know, I think, ultimately, though, I think the bigger test here is, why are they in Wisconsin? I mean if you go back a month-and- a-half ago, every Democrat was saying Wisconsin was almost off the board. Public polling was showing high single digit leads for Kamala Harris. And the fact is that both Wisconsin and Michigan have now closed in tight. They're looking at about a half point margin in the polling average for Kamala Harris. Not to mention the fact that Wisconsin, more than any other state in 2016 and 2020, had a big polling miss. It was almost six points in '16, I believe, seven to eight points in 2020. And so I think it's really telling that of all places that's where they decide to go.

You know, as having worked on presidential campaigns, as having run for office myself, sometimes, you know, it's, you know, in this case, Melania Trump probably just want to make her position known. And so that is where I think the reason she did it.If you look at the impact it has. I mean, I think it could actually, in some ways, helps Donald Trump. It makes him more relatable. I mean I can tell you, I don't agree with my wife on every issue. She agrees with me on even fewer issues. And so I think, you know, this is actually pretty common. In fact, there's been some studies coming out lately about the difference of like men and women going to vote this year, or spouses, I should say, going to vote this year, compared to 2020. 2020, there were all sitting at the kitchen table looking over each other's shoulders filling out the ballots. This year they're going into the polling place on their own. And what impact that may have. So, I think this actually helps broaden Donald Trump's appeal, potentially.",

He,\" meaning Trump, \"sought to encroach on powers specifically assigned by the Constitution to other branches to advance his own self-interest and perpetuate himself in power, contrary to the will of the people.\" This filing goes on to lay out some additional evidence that we had not seen before. It includes private conversations witnesses say Donald Trump had with - with Republican legislators with different political operatives, campaign advisers, really making the case that Donald Trump was directly involved in various efforts to try to overturn the 2020 election leading up to January 6th. And it also includes new details about Donald Trump's actions on January 6th itself, and specifically his interactions with then Vice President Mike Pence that prosecutors said they have evidence that Donald Trump himself is the one who sent that now infamous tweet on January 6th essentially saying that Mike Pence didn't have the courage to overturn the election results and they accuse him of trying to stoke anger amongst that mob that was already outside the U.S. Capitol. And it's really underscored by what one witness said when Trump was told that Mike Pence was being evacuated from the Capitol that day. Trump's alleged response was, quote, so what. So, prosecutors, again, making this case that a private citizen, Donald Trump, was acting on his own to enrich himself when he tried to overturn the 2020 election results.",

He's doing all that to try to shade everything in the light that would allow him to get around the Supreme Court ruling. So, it does make sense that he would use the music.And, you know, look, this is something, when I was involved in the case, we were, you know, constantly dealing with, was to try and figure out, there are portions of this that were under his role as president, portions of it that are under the role as candidate, and those, you know, in some cases it's clear.
