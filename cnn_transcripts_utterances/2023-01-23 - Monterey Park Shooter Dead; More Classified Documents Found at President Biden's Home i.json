It's unprecedented that we have, you know, a sitting president and a former president who are being investigated for essentially of the same thing as Charlie points out. There are differences, as you pointed out, Rosemary, over the weeks. There are differences, right? Donald Trump is being possibly investigated for espionage. He is possibly being, you know, investigated for lying to or having his attorneys lie to federal authorities. It's not the case with Biden, but it's unprecedented that they're both being investigated for the same, either sloppy or intentional mishandling of documents.

The question is how much damage will be done between now and then?In 2011, I remember the negotiation between President Obama and John Boehner that resulted in Budget Control Act of 2011, and that negotiation ended up rattling markets and actually the United States actually received a downgrade from some ratings agencies. So, really, the issue for Congress is not, you know, how they're going to pass this thing because they are going to pass it. The question is when, and they need to do it before there would be some kind of a catastrophic economic event. One shouldn't play chicken with the debt ceiling. Sometimes, you know, if you take a hostage in politics, you better be prepared to shoot it. This is one hostage you could never shoot because the consequences would be so severe. That, said, you know, we're going to be -- I suspect they're going to get to an agreement, and it maybe an ugly one, and it maybe, you know, many months before we get there.
