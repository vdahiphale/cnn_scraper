U.S. intelligence officials revealing what caused that deadly explosion at a hospital in Gaza. We have a new exclusive dispatch from our producer inside Gaza tonight. His report, one of the most disturbing yet about the situation he is living on the ground there. Also breaking tonight, Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, reportedly offering up damning testimony in exchange for immunity for special counsel Jack Smith's case. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. Welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. I'm Erin Burnett, live in Tel Aviv tonight. And we begin with breaking news. We'll have to pay a price. That's the quote, the message tonight from Israel's defense minister speaking to an elite commando unit of the Israeli army, Yoav Gallant, said, quote, prepare for the tasks to come. The war is just starting. And unfortunately, we'll have to pay a price. They have been clear that that price may involve the loss of life. And it is an ominous warning to more than 300,000 troops, alive, ready, in the prime of their life, massed on that Gaza border. Young men and women waiting for the command to go in and strike Hamas, to take that risk of death to do so. Today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, again, met with those troops because they have been waiting for that command, of course, waiting for 17 days, telling them tonight, quote, we stand before the next stage. It is coming. The next stage Netanyahu also says today will not be short. And the United States is bracing for what could be a lengthy and bloody battle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

[19:15:00] Rob, mud -- you know, you heard what Daniel was describing from his grandmother. She was held at one point in a room with she said about six others, minimal food. Daniel was describing it to me. He was saying it felt him like Holocaust food. She's in barely enough bread. She didn't move locations, though, but leaving the tunnel by walk was very difficult. So, what does this say to you about the remaining hostages? ROB D'AMICO, FORMER FBI AGENT, WORKED ON INTERNATIONAL HOSTAGE CASES: Well, one, Hamas knows that there were, that they have to keep them alive. They will they were taken for a reason and all they have to -- in order for their playbook to happen. In the tunnels is one of the worst places they can be for Israeli troops, should they ever have to go in and try to rescue them. It is so complex to get surprised, the fact that she said that each hostage at one guard. Unfortunately, it tells me that that guard is there in case of a hostage rescue to kill the hostage. Normally, you try to minimize the number of guards you have for a group of hostages, you know? Two guards guarding a room of 5 to 10 hostages, but having one on top of the other just tells me that they were preparing for the worst, that if a rescue attempt comes in there, that they're going to eliminate the hostages.",

Is that -- is that what you are getting at?D'AMICO: I think it's twofold. I think one, they want Israel to negotiate. So, they want to show them that this would be the hardest rescue operation. One, there are 200, so locating them all, and then having them down in the tunnel where you can't come through walls, you can't do a surprise, then also saying that their guards are 1 to 1 with the hostages. I think it is both word out to the Israelis, you need to negotiate for them, you're not going to be able to rescue them.

How Hamas was able to pull this off. The sources are telling CNN that a small group of Hamas operatives used hardwired phones in the tunnels beneath Gaza to communicate over a period of two years planning this attack. That's according to intelligence shared with U.S. officials speaking to me and my colleagues, Zack Cohen.So, those old-fashioned land lines allowed Hamas leaders to communicate with one another in secret underground. They avoided using computers or cell phones, in order to keep from being tracked by Israeli or U.S. intelligence according, to the sources. So instead, Erin, they held meetings in person, among a very small group. They stayed off all digital communication. I mean, they relied on old- school technology. So, this partially explains why Israel, the U.S., were so caught off guard by the attack and how 1,000, more than 1,000 Hamas fighters were able to pour across the border without being stopped, shown here, as we've been showing from the propaganda video released by Hamas. So all of this communication happened in the miles of the underground tunnel system that you've been talking so much about, Erin, that is beneath Gaza, that the IDF nicknamed the Gaza metro. And another way Hamas was able to keep this under the radar is that they kept the planning of the October 7th attack a secret, even from other members. So, only a very small group knew about the mission until just before it was carried out, Erin. And that Hamas ground unit commanders and fighters were in training for many months, and they were kept in the state of general purpose, but only found out about the specific plans a few days before the terrorist attack, Erin.",

And it comes as the IDF tonight is intensified its efforts to track the civilians being held hostage by Hamas. They are now dropping leaflets in Gaza. We are going to show you one of them here, urging Palestinians to contact them with information about the hostages, promising a financial reward, along with, quote, maximum effort in providing security for you and your home. We should note, obviously, the vast majority of the hostages, we understand, were taken by Hamas and controlled by Hamas, but that there were other people from Gaza who went into the kibbutz and took advantage of the situation, maybe took hostages with the intent of there being a financial gain from it. So, perhaps this is aimed at that very well as anyone who may know information about Hamas. Joining me now is Israeli American, Jonathan Dekel-Chen. His son, Sagui, who has dual citizenship as well, is being held captive by Hamas tonight. Taken, of course, during this horrific black Saturday. Jonathan, I know your ex-wife was also taken by Hamas, incredibly though, managed to escape, a small miracle amidst all of this. But your child for both of, your child, your son among the hostages. Do you -- do you think anyone inside Gaza is going to see this pamphlet? Does this give you any hope that someone might then cooperate and share information that could help bring your son and others home? JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN TAKEN HOSTAGE: Well, it's hard to know, Erin. It seems to me, sitting on the other side of the border, that Israel should and is supplying every means necessary to get our loved ones home. But I do have doubts that, you know, in the context of a terrorist police state that anyone with inside of Gaza would be ready to risk their lives, vis-a-vis Hamas itself, to share that kind of information.

In fact, Daniel Lifshitz, who you had on a few moments ago, grew up with Sagui. He and one other of the hostages, another hostage being held from Nir Oz were kind of three musketeers growing up on the kibbutz. So, I'm absolutely thrilled for them. There's no question. But clearly, what is going on here, and I think your reporting is showing this, that releases up to now are part of a plan. They are part of a plan of psychological manipulation. It's very cynical. It's probably pretty effective. You know, from the stockpiles of medications that they have put together, I would imagine from U.N. donations, to tend to these people, keep them alive underground, 70-year-olds, the 80 year olds.

It reminds me so vividly of the difficult negotiations that took place during the five years and four months that Gilad Shalit was in captivity. There is a possible deal on the table facilitated by the Qataris and Egyptians for a release of all the civilian hostages in exchange for an Israeli cessation of bombing of Gaza.

It's a complex issue that needs to be resolved, but we are talking about saving human lives here.

Emotionally, saying she now has deep remorse, her murder words over representing Trump. And in New York, Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, testified in his civil fraud case, the first time in five years that Cohen and Trump were in the same room together.

What ABC is reporting now is that he has met with the special counsel, at least three times, and has provided testimony, including to the grand jury. And, some of that testimony is damning to the former president, saying that he was dishonest when he claimed, right after the election, that he had one. And also, that he told the former president that -- that there was no evidence, to support his claims of fraud. Of course, Erin, we know that if indeed this is true, that Mark Meadows wasn't the only one who was telling Donald Trump, that he did not have proof for those fraud crimes.
