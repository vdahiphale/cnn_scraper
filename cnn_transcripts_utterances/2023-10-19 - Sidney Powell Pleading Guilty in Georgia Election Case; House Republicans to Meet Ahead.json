Those parts are essentially that she previously had been accused in this case as taking part of the racketeering conspiracy. So, that's very likely something that she would be testifying to.But what she's pleading guilty here in this case in Fulton County, Georgia, is related to Coffee County, that rural county outside of Atlanta, where there were voting machines and she was accused of being part of a group of people that were hacking them. So, this is a misdemeanor deal. It is not her pleading guilty to the specific felony charges that she was charged with, but she is admitting to taking part in that portion of what had happened there in Coffee County. Very likely we'll be speaking in a way where her words can be used against those other defendants accused of the hacking conspiracy in Coffee County, trying to get access to that voting system there. But also, she is part of a much bigger conspiracy case, the racketeering case against Donald Trump and others, which accuses her of being part of the top echelon of lawyers around Donald Trump that were trying to undermine the election. And even though the charges in Georgia for her previously and in this case were specifically about Coffee County, she was a person that was with the White House, in the White House, next to Rudy Giuliani, at public appearances, and part of that effort where various lawyers around the country were trying to put allegations of fraud into the court system, of voter fraud, and those allegations ultimately were false.",

She's somebody who Donald Trump has claimed he relied on her advice to proceed in his effort to try to steal the selection.This is a major breakthrough for prosecutors, potentially a devastating development for Donald Trump, because what's going to happen now is Sidney Powell is going to testify for prosecutors in Georgia and, presumably, she'll also be prepared to testify for Jack Smith in his federal case in Washington D.C. She's not indicted in that case but she's listed as a co-conspirator in that case. She's going to be able to provide insider information that could be really devastating towards Donald Trump.",

Here's what we knew.And, John, really importantly, in order to take this plea and this deal, Sidney Powell is going to have to acknowledge what we did was criminal. It was illegal. It was a crime. And so that's going to lend a lot of credibility, I think, obviously, to prosecutors' assertions, that what Donald Trump did was knowingly a crime, was an intentional crime.

      "sentences": "Well, the potential impact is potentially quite significant given that she is someone who was in the room at the White House up until mid December, and she was involved in these issues in Georgia that she's admitting to now.But one of the things about the timing is that this just shows how the system incentivizes people to avoid trial, to cooperate with prosecutors. So, she's doing this right before the trial is set to begin with jury selection at the end of this week. November 5th is the date, procedurally, where that guilty plea, that's the no-turning back date on this guilty plea, that's whenever the trial will formally kick off against her or previously would have been her and Ken Cheseboro. And so with that set up, it alleviates the need for the prosecutors to try her. But, John and Kate, just following her case, following her as a person over not just related to the 2020 election, but the whole way through the Trump administration, when she was a lawyer representing Michael Flynn on doing his case, this is quite a surprise to see Sidney Powell become the second person in this 19-person indictment in Georgia to choose to plead guilty here and cooperate. She, as a person, is incredibly set in her beliefs. It appears -- I remember in court she used to wear a blazer that said Carpe Diem on the lapel. And she is the type of lawyer who is a fighter and has branded herself as such. And even in recent hearings, in this case in Georgia, her lawyers were very much looking toward specific pieces of evidence they had identified believing they could use that and they could fight this case and they could win. That is clearly not the decision that they're going with at this time, though.",

Prosecutors know how to come back to that.The main thing that you're looking for as a prosecutor is, did this person have access.

Therein lies the problem of getting behind another candidate like Jordan. But if another candidate emerges, getting 217 votes also will be a very, very challenging task here.So, this just leaves to more questions, but more chaos, more division as this chamber remains paralyzed, as they debate whether to move forward with giving Patrick McHenry, the interim speaker, more power to just allow the legislative process to work. But Republicans too, Kate, are badly divided on that question as well. They would need Democratic support to do that. And, interestingly, Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader, just walked into the speaker's office potentially to talk about whether the Democrats could get behind it, because at the moment they've been noncommittal and whether they would support that approach of empowering Patrick McHenry.",

I think that it depends on what he worked out with our leader, Hakeem Jeffries. You have to know that Leader Jeffries has reached out many times now to the Republican conference folks, like moderates like Mr. McHenry, and said, look, let's kind of put together a bipartisan unity coalition that could sideline the extremists and make sure the House functions again.",
