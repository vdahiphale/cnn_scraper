If he doesn't plea, the government, especially in classified document cases is always concerned about the fact that at trial, classified information could be revealed in the very act of trying to prosecute this person.Now, there is something called CIPA, the Classified information Procedures Act, which is I use it in my past cases where it's the ability of the Justice Department to basically negotiate with a judge to provide information, present information into a courtroom without that being disclosed. But the bar for that is typically very high. But again, in espionage cases, that is certainly a concern that the government has. If they can plea - get a plea from this person, they don't have to worry about additional information, additional secrets making them out into the public light. So the last thing I'll say is that was also a concern here because when you have a suspect, who is facing serious jail time, that is often a consideration in whether they cooperate or whether they tried to go out in a hail of gunfire, right, we know this person was a gun enthusiast. So I think for everyone here, the operators, the FBI operators and the suspect the best possible outcome we're seeing in our screen.",

But eventually the Pentagon acknowledged and the spokesperson acknowledged that they have pared down those distribution lists as CNN has reported, so that not nearly as many people or I should say not as many people have access to this, because they won't give us a sense of how much that has been pared down. One of the other key questions, of course, was how did an airman first class, an E-3, a low-ranking member of the enlisted community in the Massachusetts Air National Guard have access to top secret documents that would eventually find their way up to, for example, the top U.S. general, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. To that, the Pentagon said that they are - there are background checks and there are positions for background checks that require access to this level of classification. And those are intended to find people who perhaps don't deserve or shouldn't have this kind of access. Obviously, in this case and they wouldn't talk about this specific example, in this case, that was problematic. It didn't flag something here, perhaps, that should have led to DOD knowing, hey, there may be an issue here. So that part of the process and reviewing how do people get access to this level of documents and how are these distribution distributed to make sure that they should only go to those people who truly need them. In terms of who else and how these spread on Discord, a chat and messaging platform, the Washington Post spoke with somebody who said he was a friend here on the server and that revealed something that could be just as damaging to U.S. National Security and that's - that the leaks didn't start over the course of the past few weeks, but months ago.

He's a White House National Security Correspondent at The New York Times and CNN Military Analyst, Colonel Cedric Leighton, back with us as well. Gentlemen, as we look at what's happening, if we pick up Col. Leighton, if we could, where Oren left off in terms of these questions about measures that are in place to flag any potential issues for people who would have access to highly classified sensitive material. Does this raise concerns for you and is there anything that you have seen in your time that would cause you to say those measures may need to be looked at again? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:   Hey, Erica. I definitely think these measures need to be looked at again, because what you're dealing with here is people's lives. And as things change in a person's situation, let's say, their financial situation or their exposure to different people, foreign people and on this discord platform, we know that he was - the suspect was contacted by Russian nationals on that platform. So there are certain things there that become critically important and leads you to believe these kinds of background checks need to be done in a much more thorough manner. That's one of the key things and they also need to be updated on a more angle (ph) basis than is currently the case. So yes, they definitely need to be re-examined and that there needs to be a full court press on that particular aspect of clearance issue.",

      "sentences": "It's a good question, Bianna and we don't really know the answer to that right now. When you go through these documents and I've been through a good number of them, but not all of them, it's pretty evident that the intercepts that they've got are - have been summarized.So there's nothing in the documents, at least that I have seen, that would tell you how the NSA or U.S. cyber command or others got access to this. That said, of course, it does alert our adversaries, and in some cases, our allies, the South Koreans, the Israelis, even the Ukrainians, that the United States is listening in to at least some of those conversations. There is nothing on human intelligence I'd seen with it. And so this point that you were just making with Cedric about limiting the - where the intelligence flows, certainly, it's a very reasonable question to ask why a 21-year-old guardsman in Massachusetts needs to see this material that is intended for the Joint Chiefs. But remember that the reason that we are spreading this intelligence or intelligence in general more broadly is because after 911, we came to the conclusion that we had kept everything too siloed and that you needed to spread information out, there was a reason that the FBI and others didn't know that there were - the Saudi hijackers were in the United States. So there's a risk here of constricting too much and then having some incident happen that leads you to suddenly try to open up again. And we've got to break out of this cycle.",

One of the things that has been criticized certainly in the years right after 911 is that much of those measures were reactive, right? This was reactive, as opposed to proactive.And so I wonder, David, based on your experience, if you see evidence that there may be a push towards more proactive moves here, where the U.S. and the intel community is constantly looking at how and where information is shared, what may have gotten out there, who may have tapped in to the U.S. who may be monitoring the U.S. and are those changes, can they happen more in a real time fashion, as opposed to when there is an emergency?",

So we now have a trusted traveler program, right, and we think hard about who's a group of people who you think you don't need to search as often and you could just do that more periodically, and you can go through a lighter search.There needs to be sort of equivalents of that in the world of classified information. But there's also got to be a much broader scale declassification. As you go through a lot of these documents, you discovered that much of the material they pick is from open source data. It's from things you've read in The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal or seen on CNN. And so we have to think a lot harder about just protecting those secrets that really need to be protected and restricting that and opening up so much more. Because otherwise, if you are protecting everything, you really don't know what it is that you want to protect the most.",

So it's really unclear how long this is going to go today. The last time he was here in August, when he asserted the Fifth Amendment, more than 400 questions and said he would not answer them, because he didn't want to - he wanted the protections against self incrimination. He left around 3:30. So now he is answering questions. His lawyer says he's not only willing, but he is eager to testify today. We could see this continue for quite some time as this afternoon continues. I mean, there - as that lawsuit you mentioned, it's more than 200 pages. There's a lot of very specific allegations and there are specific questions that they've had for him in the past about how he valued some of his assets including how he came up with the size of his penthouse apartment on Trump Tower. So this could continue if these questions are detailed as they were the last time and depending on how long his answers are.
