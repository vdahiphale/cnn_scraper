Texas is pitted against the feds. Caught in the middle, the migrants, who can now be deported en masse and at will, on a hunch. This is all happening after the Supreme Court waded directly into the heart of the immigration issue today. They scrambled how things typically work, that immigration policy for the United States is the domain of the federal government. And there are profound constitutional questions that this raises. But in the meantime, the practical impact is becoming more clear. Scores of people could be rounded up hundreds of miles from the southern border even based on suspicion and suspicion alone. Local officials, sheriffs, could all be deputized to essentially enforce U.S. border policy. The court's conservative majority brushed aside a last-ditch Biden administration push to stop this new Texas law, SB4, and it now goes into effect, at least temporarily, while litigation winds its way through the lower courts. Ultimately, this could ricochet across conservative border states. If allowed to stand, it could usher in dramatic, even draconian policies that leave immigration enforcement at the hands of legislators from Austin to Phoenix. Joining me now, the highest-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries. Congressman, thank you for staying up for us tonight. First of all, the Supreme Court delivering this win for Texas and a loss for the Biden administration, what do you think the impact of all of this is going to be? REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Good evening, great to be with you. It's a deeply troubling decision from the extreme conservatives on the Supreme Court. It's clear that we have a broken immigration system. We've acknowledged that, and that we need to address the challenges at the border. We believe that we should address those challenges in a clear-eyed, comprehensive way, in a manner consistent with our values as a nation of immigrants and a nation anchored in the rule of law. We need a strong, secure and humane border. What we are seeing from many of our Republican colleagues is that they don't want to actually address the issue. They just want to engage in political stunts or try not to solve the issue so they can weaponize the border and immigration issue in November. I think the American people are going to reject that, but what the Supreme Court has done in this particular instance is quite unfortunate.",

One of the big challenges, of course, is that many Republicans don't want to address the issue, they want to weaponize the issue politically, that's the height of their responsibility. But hope springs eternal and let's see what happens over the next few months. PHILLIP: So, not ruling it out there, notably. I want to turn to the issue of funding the government. Congressional negotiators have finally gotten to a deal to fund the government through the fall.

We know it's early. But I want to show you this New York Times/Siena College poll that found that both Black and Hispanic voters say that Donald Trump's policies have helped them more than Joe Biden's policies by pretty wide margins, especially when you look at Hispanic voters.

And, of course, lowering the high price of life-saving prescription drugs, including taking the price of insulin for millions of Americans down to $35 a month. It's going to be incredibly important that we talk about those accomplishments, but not in a manner that is designed to say to the American people reward us for what we have done but trust us, we're going to continue to build upon this progress led by President Biden and deliver real results to make life better for every single community and for everyday Americans.",

Bernie Moreno, of course, was backed by Donald Trump, has now crossed the 50 percent threshold. He has defeated Matt Dolan, who is the more moderate candidate, backed, of course, by the Republican governor there, Mike DeWine.You can look on your Senate map here. It's pretty much all Moreno cranberry. Only one little county over here, Hardin County, and there's only 27 percent of the vote in there. So, it wouldn't be surprising to me if that, in fact, turns over to cranberry and Moreno actually ends up winning it. Of course, it shouldn't be a big surprise that you would see a Republican, let's see if we can get there, there we go, oh, hold on, there you go, a Trump-backed candidate winning in a primary. Why is that? Look historically speaking, Trump primary endorsement win percentage. In 2020 in House, gov and Senate races, 96 percent. In 2022, 89 percent. So, this is well in line with what we generally see that is Trump-backed candidates winning in primaries. Of course, the real question as we head towards the general election is whether or not Bernie Moreno can win there. And this I think is a big question because if you go back to 2022, Trump-backed candidates -- Trump-backed Senate candidates lost key races in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire. So, even though Moreno won the night, there's still a bit question going in the general elections against Sherrod Brown, who I would rather Moreno be the candidate than Matt Dolan.",
