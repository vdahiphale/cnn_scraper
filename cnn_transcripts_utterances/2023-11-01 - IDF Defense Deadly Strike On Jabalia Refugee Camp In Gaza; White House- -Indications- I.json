      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and all around the world as we continue our coverage of Israel at war.I'm Paula Newton. And we begin with despair, outrage and arguments over a deadly airstrike on a densely packed refugee camp in Gaza. Now a huge cloud of smoke could be seen from across the border in Israel. The Israeli military has claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was aiming for a top Hamas commander and in fact succeeded in killing him it claims. But critics are asking at what cost? The scope of the devastation at the Jabalia camp is not yet clear. But the civilian casualty count appears to be significant. The impact of the explosions left huge craters and piles of debris that are being scoured for signs of life. One witness told CNN \"there were seven to eight huge holes in the ground full of killed people. Body parts all over the place. It felt like the end of the world.\" Now earlier I spoke with a spokesman with the Israeli Defense Forces to ask him why this type of an airstrike? Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: The precision here is to hit a target deep -- buried underground. A tunnel complex which is where the -- this terrorist was hiding, and trying to use civilians as his human shield which is the common practice of Hamas, which is a war crime. It's also a war crime not to allow civilians to evacuate from a combat area and Hamas is doing both. And what we did here was to strike with the acquired or the required amount of firepower in order to get to where he was hiding, in order to achieve a military -- achievement that supports the overall aim of the war. That is why this was struck. It is both legitimate and an important military strike to do. I understand that the pictures are difficult to understand, that our human feelings when seeing suffering we relate to that. But if we are able to look from a little bit higher position, this war is against a brutal terrorist enemy that is waiting for exactly these things to happen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: Unlike Russia, and Ukraine, and unlike what Hamas did on the 7th of October, the killing of civilians is not a warring of Israel. I'm not denying that it's happening. Of course, it is. And it's tragic. But it is not the goal of Israeli forces to go out and deliberately take innocent civilian life and they have tried to make efforts to minimize that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the American one that you played earlier is undoubtedly an outlier. You have not seen with few exceptions, the volume of outrage coming from Western leaders in response to this. And in response to Israel's tactics in general, that you are seeing from the region.Case in point, the Saudis, the Iranians, they are bitter rivals. They don't agree on very much, but they agree on their condemnation of what happened on the strike on this refugee camp. The Iranians have called it barbaric. The United Arab Emirates, a country which has spent the last few years growing its diplomatic and its economic ties with Israel. It has also condemned this attack. The Egyptians called it inhuman and said this, \"Egypt can -- Egypt consider this as a new flagrant violation by the Israeli forces against the provisions of international law and international humanitarian laws.\" You have seen the Turkish president. He has been very outspoken over the last few weeks. He's called Israel's entire war effort, a massacre. And he said this, the Israeli administration backed by the unconditional support of Europe and America has been committing crimes against humanity in front of the eyes of the whole world for exactly 25 days. We believe that Israel which seems to have completely lost its state of mind and acts like an organization must be stopped as soon as possible. You've gotten condemnation even from within Israel, the human rights group B'Tselem said, look, not everything is allowed in war, including war and Hamas targeting civilians is always prohibited. And Israel must stop these attacks now. And even outside the region you had the leaders of Chile and Colombia announcing that they had withdrawn their ambassadors are will be withdrawing their ambassadors to Israel in the wake of these strikes. Your point, Paula, about the soldiers killed, the announcement from the IDF that more soldiers had been killed inside Gaza, they said that nine more soldiers were killed in the northern Gaza Strip. They gave give the names of all nine and they didn't they -- what they did not give though is any kind of details about how or where they were killed, Paula.",

So the leader of the Iraqi military and government was worth 30 civilians.You know, as McCobb, as that may seem, that was a calculus that was made. To look at a Hamas leader no matter how important and to think that he's worth dozens, if not hundreds of civilians killed. You know, we don't know how many people were harmed in this event. It really boggles the mind. And it's hard for me to understand.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Iranian-backed Houthi fighters in Yemen with a show of force, while only hitting U.S. and Israeli flags in this exercise, the Houthi say they've also launched a massive long-distance attack on Israel using ballistic and cruise missiles as well as drones. The Yemeni Armed Forces affirm that this operation is the third and support of our oppressed brothers and Palestine, the spokesman says. Israel confirmed the attack saying its defense forces managed to thwart it using modern air defense system. But both the U.S. and Israel have long accused Iran of providing the Houthis with long-range weapons. We got a rare chance to film some of Iran's drone and missile arsenal at the military fair in Tehran in 2019. As the Israel-Hamas war continues, the Iranians are now also flexing their own military muscle. A recent large-scale exercise aiming to show Tehran's defense capabilities, but one of the commanding generals also making clear the Islamic Republic's goal is to destroy Israel. Regarding a message to the Zionist regime, he says, in fact, we announced the destruction of this regime and God willing we will witness it soon on. Iran's military is not nearly as modern as the U.S. is or Israel's. Many of its weapons are U.S. made from before the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Like these Vietnam War era, Cobra attack helicopters. But Iran influences or controls scores of militias around the entire Middle East which Tehran says it can mobilize to not only attack Israel, but U.S. assets throughout the region. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Iran's President threatening escalation. The events we're seeing in Gaza are all red lines that are being breached by the Zionist entity, he says. The killing of women and children, the killing of more than 3000 children is not something that any human being can reasonably or by conscience except.

Specifically on the Jewish community, though, of course, because of the threats that you're seeing online, those are targeted against synagogues and others is, is perceiving maybe not specific threats, but an overall concern for their community.

A family of nine people, including two children, both under the age of 10, were found dead inside their home in Volnovakha, which is in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine. It was taken by Russia early on in its full-scale invasion. Images released by Ukraine show that multiple people had been shot in their beds. Some still cuddled up to each other. We're only showing one of the photos. This is the least gruesome of the pictures released.Exactly what happened is far from clear, but according to Ukrainian prosecutors, soldiers arrived and demanded that the family leave so that their home could instead house Russian troops. The owner said no, but gunmen showed up days later and shot all nine while they were asleep. Local officials on the Russian side say that two Russian soldiers were arrested and said that the initial assessment showed that the murder motive was a domestic conflict. Both Ukraine and Russia are now investigating. Scott McClain, CNN, London. (END VIDEO TAPE)",
