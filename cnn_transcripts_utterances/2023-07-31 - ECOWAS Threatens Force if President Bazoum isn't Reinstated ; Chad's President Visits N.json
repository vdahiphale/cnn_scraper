Well missiles slam into a central Ukrainian city hitting two civilian buildings and killing at least four people over 70 others including eight kids are found wounded in amid rescue operations. Well, the Pakistani officials are still trying to figure out who was responsible for a blast that ripped through a political rally in the north of that country. At least 54 people are dead more than 100 are wounded after suicide bomber detonated an explosive vest there at least 12 of the dead are said to be children. Well, the leaders of the military coup in Niger are accusing France of planning strikes to restore the country's captive president to power our sing the military presence of Niger's former colonial power has been a potent cause for the coup and its supporters as protesters gathered outside the French Embassy on Sunday and these are images of that scene. France says it only seeks to protect its citizens in the country also underlying that it recognizes Sony President Mohamed Bazoum as Niger's legitimate leader. Well meanwhile, the President of Chad visited with both Bazoum and General leading the coup against him on Monday, as a block of Niger's West African neighbors ECOWAS sanctioned the country and threatened to use force if Bazoum's authority is not restored.

And the Military Junta now claims that France plans to strike inside the Presidential Palace to free President Mohammed Bazoum. Apparently France has been meeting with both the ousted foreign minister and the head of the National Guard who both signed documents are purporting to authorize France to carry out these military strikes. France is now denying that I want to read for you a statement from a spokesperson of the French Foreign Ministry who said France recalls that it recognizes President Mohamed Bazoum and the democratically elected institutions as the only legitimate authorities in Niger. Our priority is to save the safety of our nationals and our holdings which must not be the object of violence in accordance with international law. So this will not go down well with many of the people who marched Sunday against France a freak against the influence of France of the country against the international meddling because so many who support this military see the opposite president as a puppet of France.

Thousands of people outraged at the country's Former Colonial Power, a day after its suspended aid and financial support for Niger with immediate effect. Down with France, some said condemning French support for Ousted President Mohammed Bazoum. Unable to get into the heavily protected compound, a window is set on fire, and a French flag trashed a common sight since Wednesday's military coup. Security forces eventually deployed tear gas to disperse the protesters. France warned it would retaliate immediately and in a strict manner, in case of any attacks against its embassy, national army or diplomats. The Elysee Palace, saying on Sunday, adding the President Emmanuel Macron will not tolerate any attack against France and its interests.

So the threat of military intervention by the region by ECOWAS is a very real one. And this is something that previous coups that have happened in recent years in West Africa haven't seen.

But the images that emerged from Moscow city and upscale class towered financial district, a sign really of the opulence that Russia has tried to maintain on the global stage over the past decade that being hit by Ukrainian drones. That frankly, a year ago you wouldn't even though could possibly get through Russian air defenses. That is indeed a deep psychological blow. And one I'm sure that the Kremlin feels they have to respond to in some way despite the fact strangely -- today, their spokesperson Dmitry Peskov calling those drones attacks an act of desperation. But we are here in the south Zaporizhzhia where Ukraine continues to push forward in its counter offensive, some slow and at times reverse progress, particularly to the east of these front lines. But the tempo of this war certainly rising at this moment as Russia feels itself potentially, it is motherland more under attack.

The French coast guard say the boat is undetectable on shipping radar, but estimate it will shortly cross into British waters. Now CNN has found that at the time of the incident, the UK government had expensive AI technology designed to spot these boats and knowing that the vessel was soon entering their territory, and that there were people freezing in the water including children. They could have sent this. A Tekever AR5 drone designed to detect small boats and capable of deploying a life raft. It's licensed by the UK government, even the British Prime Minister proud to show it off. CNN has established it flew over the same area where the distress call was made on multiple previous journeys. It even flew the day before and after the incident, but not in the hours the vessel was sinking. Instead it took more than an hour for the first UK lifeboat to arrive in which time a fishing crew rescued the majority on board. This tech forms part of a campaign of deterrence and hostility by the government towards those attempting to reach British shores. Millions of pounds have been spent on AI cameras trained to find rubber dinghies, some able to see beyond UK waters, drones with automatic identification abilities. And while the company's tout their life saving capabilities, footage from these drones has also been used to identify those driving the boats and prosecute them for human trafficking. A new bill will take it even further criminalizing anyone who seeks asylum in the UK this way.",

He's accused of being part of this plot, of course to, to tryand delete this security camera footage, which at the Mar-a-Lago club where Donald Trump resides. But that security camera footage had video of the boxes of documents, many of which were high level top security and classified documents they later found out. So he is now charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice, also making false statements to the FBI as well as two counts of destroying or concealing an object. So he had his first court appearance this morning. He did not enter a plea. But he did show up in a navy suit and tie along with his lawyer John Irving, who's based in Washington, DC. He stood before the judge, he stated his name, he said he understood the charges against him. He also said he understood that he had the right to remain silent. And then the judge continued to read the charges against him. Then he did set a bond of $100,000. So he is not being held in jail or behind bars. He is out of jail and out of the courtroom. I can tell you that Carlos De Oliveira was asked about a passport. He says that he does have a passport, but it's expired, the judge ordered him to turn it over even though it's expired within 48 hours, travel is restricted. He can only leave South Florida with permission. And he cannot have any communication with any of the witnesses listed by the government. No communication at all with anybody except through his lawyers. And now a plea hearing has been set for August 10. That is really important, of course, Becky, because he needs to enter a plea but he needs a Florida based attorney to do that somebody who actually practices law here in the state of Florida. So he couldn't do that with his attorney today. And he will, he is expected to do that come August 10, Becky.",
