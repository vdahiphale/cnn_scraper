And a grand jury consists of 23 members, a simple majority of which that is 12, are needed to vote out an indictment. Now, in that process, it's not about proving a case beyond a reasonable doubt as if you were at trial, it's about whether there's reasonable cause to believe that a crime was committed. And the subject of that investigation, that is Mr. Trump would have been the commissioner of those crimes, the one who committed the crimes.And so, I say that because you're going to have evidence oftentimes that I've never really tried a case in over 20 years where there haven't been conflicts, and one person says A and another says B. So, there's going to be credibility assessments. But in the context of a grand jury investigation, the issue simply is not whether Donald Trump did this, but as the reasonable cause to believe that he did. And that's the essence of it. And so, while it could be damning that is the contrary evidence that was given in terms of Michael Cohen, it does not mean that the grand jury would not indict just by virtue of that conflict. So potentially a trial jury, if it gets that far, could sort it out.",

It means that a grand jury having indicted you, and again, it's not convicting you, it's just an accusation that you did it, which makes the case available to then be sent to a trial jury for an assessment as to your guilt. And so, when that generally happens, there is an arrest, but generally, also, the courtesy is extended, particularly, it'll be extended here to a former president to surrender yourself.And so, the issue is how that is done, whether it's done safely, of course. Securely, of course, people have a First Amendment right to protest. There'll be people who find that this is purely political, should not have happened and is nonsense and there'll be protesting. There are others who will say that it's about time the President was found accountable for something, and therefore they'll be counter protesting. So, I think that's important. My hope is that they're peaceful, that people express their views as they should in any democracy.

But the implicit threat of violence that is kind of the backbeat to Trump's communication and that from his lawyers, it's just important to recognize how different in the era of American politics we are in and we are really ever been in before where there is the leader of a national political movement who is constantly willing to court if not incite the threat of violence as a way of advancing his goals.I think the impact of this politically, is likely to be cross cutting for Trump and a Republican primary. There are a lot of his allies who say that there will be an immediate rallying around him by conservative voters and, you know, that they will be responsive to his argument that he is being targeted by the deep state or by Marxist prosecutors. And then in fact, he's being targeted. They are targeting him as a way to silence them, the voters. And there's a piece of the Republican electorate that will respond to that. But that is not the whole story at all, Rosemary. And as you see, both is kind of the leadership level of the Republican Party with strategist, elected officials and donors. But even also among the voters. There is a significant segment. A slice of the party that is deeply concerned that Trump simply cannot win again in 2024. And as Chris Christie said the other day, the former governor of New Jersey, former presidential candidate, an indictment doesn't really help anybody and for the -- for the portion of the party that is dubious that he can win.

U.S. Bank first republic is fighting for its life despite a $30.00 billion lifeline from 11 of the world's largest banks and a $70.00 billion loan from J.P. Morgan. Its shares sank more than 45 percent to another record low on Monday and S&amp;P Global downgraded it for a second time within a week. The Wall Street Journal is reporting rival banks led by J.P. Morgan are trying to work on yet another rescue plan for First Republic. And CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us live now from London. Good morning to you Clare. So, how secure is the U.S. banking system? Can we expect more turmoil ahead? CLARE SEBASTIAN CNN CORRESPONDENTThis is despite the U.S. official -- by the way, telling CNN that they believe that the deposit outflows that we saw from those regional banks last week have stabilized. And in some cases, recovered and repeated reverse people are adding deposits to these banks, and that the share prices are in no way correlated to the situation with deposits. But look, as I said, the banking system is more secure than 2008. The regulations have made that very certain, certainly when it comes to the biggest banks, but this has been a crisis of confidence. And it has infected the entire sector. Take a look at the March losses, for some of the U.S. biggest banks. You can see are all pretty much down double digits, even J.P. Morgan, perhaps the most secure of all down 11.3 percent down to Wells Fargo which has lost almost 20 percent of its value over the course of March. This is about confidence but it's also about a bit of a repricing of this sector. This has really brought home to investors that banks are now having to jack up the returns that they're offering to savers, and depositors that eats into profitability. This crisis of confidence could also increase the amount of the banks having to pay to borrow and things like that. So, this is sort of caused a bit of a wobble in the entire sector. And now, of course, Rosemary, all eyes will be on the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Whether or not the turmoil in the banking sector will cause them to pause when it comes to fighting inflation.",
