And he caught himself in that very statement, you know, we're going to rest. I mean, I'm not going to rest. I never rest. This is a guy clearly stunk by all the reporting that maybe he's fallen asleep from time to time in the courtroom, doesn't want to give the impression that he's resting. You know, today we see Don Trump Jr. show up at court for the first time when people noted on T.V. that his family wasn't coming, the very next day Eric Trump or Eric, I hope he didn't have anything on his schedule for the last few weeks is Eric come every day. Don Junior only had to come today to courthouse. Now, but he seems to react to every little thing that's happening in the atmosphere.",

Robert Costello is back on the witness stand. He's entered the courtroom. He's walking there without looking at the defense table. That's not atypical. The defense tables on your left. You'd really have to look over to check it out.The judge said, good morning, Mr. Costello, welcome back. I remind you that you're still under oath. It is a new day. We are going to see where the prosecution starts with their cross examination of Robert Costello. We also have joining us here this morning criminal defense attorney David Markus, who was approached to defend Donald Trump in his classified documents case, as we reported at the time. And David, just looking at what happened yesterday, I wonder what you make of the entire Costello saga. And as a defense attorney, what you would have told your client if they were trying to put Bob Costello on the witness stand?",

And now it was just an awful day for the defense. I look at cross examination like a boxing match, right? The jury doesn't know the two boxers. They have to figure out which one they're going to root for. And when a witness tells a prosecutor something like speak into the mic, all the jurors, and you saw two of them are going to side with the examiner, with the prosecution there, and not side with the witness.So it's just terrible the way it went down. And the weird thing is Costello knows better, right? He's a lawyer. He's been in that courtroom, in that courthouse. He knows better. So just an awful, awful day.

It's not clear that was an apology or what that looked like. We'll see what our reporters who were in the room, if they could hear anything and discern anything, it will likely potentially be in the court transcript if we see what that looks like today, because those court reporters are seated right in front of the judge's benchmarking in the witness stand.But it was remarkable because you never -- the judge has never lost it or gotten that furious inside the courtroom. He often is trying to be very diplomatic. You know, even when he scolded Trump for being audible during Stormy Daniels' testimony, he did so to the attorneys out of earshot of the jury and said that he was trying to be fair to the client. With Robert Costello, though, I mean, it happened. He had sent the jury out of the room, but were all there to witness just his pure frustration with how this witness was handling his time on the stand.",

But, you know, from the defense point of view, he let lots of stuff in with Stormy Daniels that the defense complained about. And he's really limited, the defense limited, the expert witness limited, Costello to what he could talk to.So, you know, I can see why the defense is frustrated. You can't show that to the judge or the jury, though, or it's going to be really bad. But I get why they're frustrated. They've been limited in what they can do.

We had a trial within a trial when Stormy Daniels testified about what happened in that room, the judge expressed frustration after the fact. But the defense raised that issue before she testified. So, you know, this is the kind of thing where the defense is understandably upset.Listen, the judges, the public, the media typically are always against the defense. The defense just can't show it. They have to stand strong, just like the prosecutor stood strong yesterday when the witness told her to speak into the mic. You cannot let it affect you in court. You cannot show any problems. And they're showing, and the jury sees that and you saw them look at each other. That is really, really bad. Anybody is going to tell you that, although you don't know what a jury's going to do when you see things like that, you cannot feel good as a defense lawyer.

I will say one thing for the defense, you know, a lot -- they've been getting a lot of criticism, of course, for calling Costello. You have to take risks as a defense lawyer in a trial like this or you're going to lose.Now this risk didn't pan out, but if you don't take risks as a defense lawyer in court, you will lose 100 out of 100 times. So, you know, they must have believed they were losing at the point that they called Costello because otherwise you wouldn't call him, right? If you believed you were winning the case, you rest at that point. But they must have believed or thought there was a chance they would lose the trial.

Welcome back to CNN special live coverage. I'm Jake Tapper.

All the more reason for Cohen to hire me because of my connection to Giuliani, which I mentioned to him in our meeting. That was your e-mail, correct? Hoffinger your asks. Correct, Costello says. Hoffinger asked Costello if he was pushing Cohen to retain him because he could provide a back channel to Trump, he meaning Costello, Costello again denies it. That was your e-mail to Michael Cohen? She asks. Yes, Costello says. The e-mail speaks for itself, right, sir? Hoffinger says. Not quite, there are circumstances about that email which I would be delighted to tell you, Costello says. Hoffinger retorts, that's all right. Let's move on. This is about the original e-mail from April 19th, 2018, where Costello tells Cohen, I'm sure you saw the news that Rudy is joining the Trump legal team. I told you my relationship with Rudy, which could be very, very useful for you. So here, Laura Coates, Hoffinger is trying to portray Bob Costello as somebody who himself has sour grapes because Cohen didn't hire him.",

One that says, confirms that he has friends in high places as opposed to the Garth Brooks friends in low places. It was a reference that definitely refers to President Trump as well. And of course, this is all part of their attempt to say, excuse me, you were trying to dangle something. You were trying to keep him very close to you.Now, remember the behavior of this witness, if yesterday he was belligerent and he was disrespectful, the fact that there has been a change may alert the jurors that he was wrong or that somehow he has been scolded in a way that says he knows he needs to change to now make his credibility known.

And the number of defense lawyers said to me yesterday, you need to know when to quit while you're ahead.

We all know that he is very familiar with the bombastic Bob Costello on \"Fox\" and the House committee last week. So clearly, that is what happened here.
