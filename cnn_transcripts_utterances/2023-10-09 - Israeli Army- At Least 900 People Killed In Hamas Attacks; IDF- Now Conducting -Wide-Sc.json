We've seen high-rise buildings being brought down.We're also seeing reinforcements of ground troops, tanks and other military vehicles along the border with Gaza. It doesn't necessarily mean that the ground incursion is coming, but it does seem as though there's preparation for that. Because also they've called up more man 300,000 reservists. The IDF says that is the fastest, biggest call up of Israeli reservists in Israeli history. Something else we're just learning now is a warning from Hamas on those hostages. And they have just put out a statement or this is a broadcast statement where they are saying that if Israel strikes Gaza without warning -- for some context often when Israel strikes Gaza, they will do warning knocks or call ahead of time to the buildings warning residents to get out of the buildings, giving them time to leave, and then they destroy the buildings. Hamas is saying if Israel doesn't do those warning knocks before attacking, they will start executing Israeli hostages and they will broadcast them. So once again, Hamas is now threatening to execute Israeli hostages and broadcasting that on air. That is a really stunning development. And the Israeli military has been saying, you know, these people are like ISIS. This is really -- I asked the Israeli military, are you stopping these warning knocks? Are you no longer doing the warning knocks? Asking them directly. They said no comment. Earlier, when we asked the Israeli military about that, they didn't give a direct answer about whether or not they are still doing the warning knocks. Instead, they said Hamas didn't give us warning knocks when they entered civilian houses and started shooting and killing them.",

They are fraught, even more so in the middle of a war zone.And we understand the demand for action from the public, saying, you know, do something. But authorities have to act rationally. You know, I heard calls over the weekend from some politicians saying that the Biden administration should send in Special Operations Command forces, should even send in the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team. The logical response to that is a question: And that is send them where? Now, the Israelis are more than equipped to handle hostage rescues on their own, but they need to know where they're going. In order to affect a hostage rescue, you have to know the location of the hostage, ideally, the number of captors, the circumstances of that captivity. So that sometimes takes time. You also -- it's nice to know, good to know what the motivation is of the captors themselves. You know, I've worked overseas kidnappings where the motivation was financial. I've worked kidnappings where it was a terrorist group taking someone captive. And that, obviously, the motivation political. In a situation like this with Hamas where these extremists may not care to die in the process, that's very important because the last thing authorities want to do is stage a rescue operation that could put those hostages in even more harm than is their current captivity. We all can certainly understand the family members, the friends of those who are held in captivity and, you know, the pain that they're going through. I can tell you, working overseas on these cases, it was soul crushing to talk to family members demanding action. You can certainly understand their concerns. But for the rest of us, and certainly for politicians, now's the time for authorities to gather information. It's not as simple as saying go.",
