And this, of course, follows what we were witnessing last night, our teams on the border, including Robertson we're witnessing last night, which is a vastly expanded air campaign that includes airstrikes from -- from war planes, as well as artillery fire and other strikes on targets. They're in advance of this ground operation.So a bigger ground operation. And we'd seen previously since October 7, the open questions remain Victor and Amara, how big exactly, and the duration of this ground operation? And what the objective is. We've heard the objective described as eliminating Hamas, but -- but how to define victory or the accomplishment of the objective. And that that remains like -- like the other questions, an open question. WALKER: And obviously the other open question is, you know, could this expand into a wider conflict? I wanted to ask you more about what's happening along the Israeli-Lebanese border because the IDF and Hezbollah continue to exchange fire.

And Israeli forces firing back. And in the last 24 hours, at least twice, Israel has carried out strikes on Lebanese territory against Hezbollah targets, that has maintained a relatively controlled pace. It hasn't reached a fever pitch in recent days. But the concern, of course, is that it will expand that Hezbollah will show its power against Israel, particularly the concern has been in response to an expanded ground operation in Gaza.But we haven't yet seen an enormous escalation in Hezbollah activity. Or Nic Robertson, of course, he is down on the border with Gaza, in Ashkelon, and has been there really since the beginning. And Nic, I wonder, and again, we should always acknowledge that our vision into Gaza is limited and our sense of the degree and scope of Israeli operations is largely limited to what the IDF is telling us.

General, good to see you this morning.Let's start with the IDF of ground forces that are inside Gaza right now. We understand that they entered overnight from the north and the forces are in the field right now fighting that is according to an IDF spokesperson. It was first described as to targeted raids general. Is this the beginning or part of Israel's major ground invasion that they've been promising? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, good morning Amara. First of all, I'd like to comment on but what what both Jim and Nic said, because they're being hesitant. Yes, there is an increase in operational tempo of the Israeli ground forces. This does not mean that this is the ground assault the ground incursion. I would agree that there's potential for different kinds of actions. What I see in the films and the folks I've talked to, who are -- who are involved in this, they're saying not yet. This is -- this is the initial limited incursion to gain more intelligence. We're seeing a lot of tanks and infantry carriers and bulldozers. But that's not all we're seeing. For those of us experienced with this, there's a lot more going on. There's intelligence analysis of what is happening on the other side of the border. There are special operators more than likely, with this force going in. They are preparing for additional assaults. They have joint tactical air controllers on the ground that can they can direct it, the air platforms. There will eventually be helicopters. So this is a combined arms fight. But I would suggest we're still in the opening phases where Israel is gathering intelligence and in fact, probably sending a message to Hamas, saying this is about what you're going to get and you're going to get a lot more of it unless you release the hostages and do some other things that we've been asking you to do.",

I understand that Reuters and John's Franz press reached out to the IDF this week to get some kind of assurance, you know that journalists on the ground would not -- not be targeted, or they would make efforts to -- to limit casualties of journalists. The IDF told the organizations that they cannot guarantee the safety of journalists who are reporting in Gaza.

So it was my job to perfect them. But if you put a journalist in a situation where they're going to be part of a force, and there is the potential for striking that force by the opposing force, in this case, Israel than it is on the current, the commander on the scene. So Israel certainly will always attempt to use the law of land warfare. They also have a doctrine they call proportionality and necessity.If they have a target that they think is necessary to strike, they will consider what's around it and then determine the proportionality of the strike. So if there's a journalist on the scene that Israel does not know about, and it is a scene where there's a terror cell or a terror target, that journalist is, unfortunately, putting themselves in harm's way. So it is a horrific thing. This is the challenge with having civilians and journalists in the middle of a fight, and they are going to get hurt and oftentimes killed which is just the horror of warfare. But -- but Israel has a responsibility to check out the targets they are striking, but at the same time, understanding that journalists can't put themselves in the middle of a fight, because they're going to be harmed is combat.",

And then minutes later, the next shooting happened at a bar and restaurant about a 10-minute drive between the two. 15-minute drive over to here in Lisbon, which is where police found his abandoned vehicle at a boat launch. And then about a 15- minute walk, there's there's essentially a Riverwalk trail from that boat launch. We believe that is where the body was found, though we don't know the exact location at this point. We're expecting a press conference in the next hour and a half, where law enforcement told us specifically that is where they are going to answer a lot of our questions. Since last night, they said they really were just going to give notification of what happened and short on the Q and A. That said, that's one plane of investigations. On the other hand, investigators are trying to figure out why this happened. So they are combing through a note that was found also on social media.

We see that we should not be squeezed between two pains. We realize the pain that that is there. But if we continue to operate within this space, we're just going to cause more pain for more people.How many lives are going to have to die before we say this is not the path that we need to do. Those that are lost on both sides are lost. There's nothing we can do to bring them back. But we can save lives. We can stop others being killed. And this is really what our message, every life matters, Muslim life, Jewish life, Christian life, that is where we stand, and we just don't see that this war is going to bring security to anybody. It's not going -- it's not going to, as I said, bring back those who were gone. Our focus should be we should allow sanity back and say, how do we all work together to stop this tragedy from happening ever again, to save Palestinian lives, Israeli lives. And again, if I may invoke what His Majesty said on the Cairo Peace Summit last week, our Muslim values 1,000 years before Geneva soldiers were told, do not kill a child, do not kill a woman, do not kill the elderly, do not eat and cut a tree. That is our call to everybody. And we believe that going in that direction, recognizing the humanity of the other, refusing this perpetual hell that's being brought on Gaza. That is the path we want, so that we all come back and say, how do we make sure that this never happens again? How do we make sure that no Palestinians no Israelis suffer again?",

We believe that this is a sad as tragic what we're seeing now, again, we cannot continue down this path.

But we have to get to that minute and once we get there the U.S. leadership is key to all our efforts to bring about a peaceful solution whose only path is the two-state solution, as His Majesty the King said, peace and blue states between the river Jordan and the sea.",
