When you have somebody loaded up like that who did bomb threats a year before and is now wandering around with guns and ammo, I do think this was a red flag law missed and we're going to have to have increased security.

And it looks like late into the next couple of days, we could see a Santa Ana (ph) event. All right, I talked about kind of gathering some strength across the South Central U.S. as the weather system kind of gets its act together and lots of cold air on the backside of this. Well, that area of low pressure with this accompanying frontal system is going to produce some icy mix across the panhandle of Texas, also extending over to places in eastern sections of New Mexico. So, Amarillo, midland, Odessa, also into Roswell, this is where we could see the messy weather.
