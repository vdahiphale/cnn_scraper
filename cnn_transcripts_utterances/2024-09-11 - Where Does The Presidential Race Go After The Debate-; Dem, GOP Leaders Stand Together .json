This hour, as we mark 23 years since the horrific terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, families of the victims are still fighting for justice. I'm going to be joined live by an activist who lost his dad that day about his quest for answers and questions for Saudi Arabia.Plus, the very first ballots are now in the mail, meaning voting in the 2024 election has officially begun, but Republicans in one key battleground state are pushing forward with a rather controversial rule change fueled by Trump's disproved, debunked election lies about the 2020 election. And leading this hour, Vice President Kamala Harris may have won the debate, but she could still lose the election. Today, the Harris campaign says despite any momentum from last night's performance, they still consider this a 50-50 race, a coin flip, and with just 55 days to go, the Harris campaign says they're not taking their feet off the gas. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump is claiming he had the best debate of his life. Let's bring in CNN's Kristen Holmes, who covers the Trump campaign, and Priscilla Alvarez, who covers the Harris campaign. Kristen, to you first, on this day after the debate, Trump is claiming victory, although many in the Republican Party have a much more realistic assessment of what happened last night.",

They blamed the moderators, the setting, pretty much anything but the former president. But when you talk to some of his own allies within the Republican Party, many of them are disappointed in his performance. A lot of the people that I had spoke to leading up to the debate, who were talking to Donald Trump on a regular basis, had told me that they were encouraging him to stay on the issues, that multiple people had warned him that Kamala Harris was going to try to get under his skin, was going to try to goad him, and to stay away from getting angry or from using personal attacks. And obviously, as we saw that advice really went unheeded by the former president who did take the bait from Kamala Harris on multiple occasions, particularly on things that seemed obvious, like his crowd size. So we're talking to these various Republicans. They do say they don't think this is going to move the needle in any significant way, but they were disappointed in the fact that he, one, took the bait, two, seemed to get angry, and three, couldn't stick to those core issues that they believe are going to help him win in November, namely, immigration, the economy and crime.

And we might start to get a glimpse of that tomorrow, the Vice President heading to North Carolina, crucial state for the campaign, and one where they have been trying to capitalize on reproductive rights. So, that message is one that we expect to hear from her directly tomorrow, and then she'll follow on to Pennsylvania. But certainly the campaign's messaging over the course of the last several weeks has been that they are the underdogs. And even if they are pleased with the Vice President's performance last night, that is the message and narrative that they're going to continue on the campaign trail, noting that this is going to be a very close race.Now, of course, the Harris campaign did get welcome news at the end of last night, one, that aides tell me they certainly didn't expect, and that was the endorsement of Taylor Swift. So that gives them a boost going into the next several weeks. But every aide and ally have talked to is well aware that it's going to be close and that they need to keep momentum going on some of the issues where they think that former President Donald Trump just couldn't articulate a vision on last night. And again, the two that come to mind for many is going to be on abortion and health care, and even, Jake, on Ukraine.",

We all know that independents and undecideds are going to basically decide this election, so that was a mistake, in my mind. But for Kamala Harris, look, there was a lot of talk about whether or not she would command the stage, whether or not she would have leadership skills, even about her height, and as a short one myself, I can relate to being underestimated from time to time. She came out on that stage, she reached for his hand, she wanted to shake it, and she introduced herself to him, and at that moment, that is when the power shifted to her. She was exquisitely prepared for this debate.And I think that this is a bigger message for a victory for women. We take politics away from this for a moment. We're not talking today about whether or not Kamala Harris commanded that stage or whether or not she exhibited leadership skills. We're saying she won that debate, and we're now maybe closer to having a woman actually be the president of the United States. So we need to stop talking about women's height, whether or not they can lead, and whether or not a woman can be president. We need to just go back to this debate and see how she performed.",

Well, first of all, the Ukrainians really are trying to lay low, as far as this election campaign is concerned, not to try to look as though they're taking one or the other side. But one of the things is definitely clear is that remarks like the ones that we just heard from former President Trump are definitely something that have been for a very long time concerning to the Ukrainians. They obviously fear that if President Trump does try to negotiate some sort of settlement to all this, essentially that it would amount to a surrender by Ukraine, and they obviously fear that they would have to give up in the end some of their territory, which is definitely the opposite of what the Ukrainians want. The Ukrainians are still saying they want to gain back all of their territory, and that they want to win the war that Russia has imposed on them through the invasion.One of the interesting things today was Secretary of State Blinken, obviously, here on the ground together with the British Foreign Secretary also saying the Biden administration wants Ukraine to win. But one of the things that the Ukrainians are looking for is for the U.S. to ease restrictions, and so those longer distance weapons to allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory, and there really wasn't very much in the way of commitment from the Secretary of State on that point.

This is something that they believe is the domain of the U.S. public, and they'll deal with whichever leadership there is.Although I don't think there's any doubt here that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would rather see Donald Trump in the White House come next year. That said, Yair Lapid, leading opposition figure did comment, did say that he was heartened to hear both parties in the debate speaking strongly about Israel when he was reminded in a radio interview that Kamala Harris had spoken about the two state solution. His answer to that was, well, that's not anywhere near, I don't see that in the next couple of years. But most commentators here have really -- or leaders at least, have stayed out of it. And Kamala Harris's assertion that there would be a two-state solution, that she would support Israel, that she would give all the weapons to Israel, that it needs to protect itself.

In my view, and I hope she speaks to these things, very popular ideas, you have to increase, expand Social Security benefits by lifting the cap on taxable income. Widely popular. Strong majority Republicans, Democrats support it. We can raise benefits of Social Security beneficiaries by $2,400 a year. Medicare expansion all over the country, elderly people can't afford dental, hearing, vision. You expand that, we can get great support. And it's good policy. We have got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. I would say 17 bucks an hour. It's not acceptable. So many of our people working for 12, 14 bucks an hour.

Workers were not going to work. We had a major public health crisis. I think that Biden and Harris did an excellent job, by the way, in getting our economy back on track in a way that economists did not even think possible. So I think they did a good job.But her point is well taken in the sense that the economy today is an economy where working class people are struggling. That is absolutely true. And what we have got to do is not just demonize undocumented people, which is Trump's mantra, but have the guts to talk about the greed of the people on top, people who fight workers when they try to organize unions, people prepared to shut down factories in this country and move them to Mexico or China. People who want massive tax rates, want to cut Social Security and Medicare. Do we have a political system today? Were members of Congress are prepared to stand up to these big money interests? And I think if we do that, she will understand that it's not Trump who's going to deliver for her or Kamala Harris.",

It is completely empty at this point, except for the law enforcement that we're seeing move through the area. As Francine gets closer, we're seeing those winds really start to pick up, shaking the trees.Also, if we look down Decatur Street, you can see some of the signs that were left up really just blowing in the wind at this point as we bring it back over, you can see a lot of the shops along the street have been closed. Officials throughout the last few days really urging people, especially it get closer to that landfall, to really hunker down some of the signs up talking about how for the safety of their employees, they have shut down because they want them, obviously, to be at home, not out on the roadways. So conditions really getting worse at this point, of course, as this storm appears to be shifting, I expect it to get worse over the next few hours here in New Orleans. Jake?",
