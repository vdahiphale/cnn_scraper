I mean, if that is the deciding point in terms of the next steps going forward, the killing or the capture of the individual that's been named, that individual makes it incredibly difficult for Israel to do anything other than chase after him.Let's assume they have good intelligence. Let's assume that they may be able to do that. But that should -- that should not be a precondition for what needs to look -- what this -- what Gaza needs to look like, and what a ceasefire needs to entail going forward. This is -- this is an incredibly difficult task. You shouldn't hinge your entire operational success on that one very specific target outcome.",

MARKSSo the leverage is Saudi Arabia steps up and says, look, we'll -- we'll embrace you. You've got to stop this madness. And then we can figure out what Gaza looks like going forward. We get our arms around that. But that makes, to your point, the horizon for some type of a conclusion -- not a conclusion -- a resolution of some of some sort that might even be an interim solution that much longer to achieve. I mean, that's a really messy discussion, with a bunch of preconditions as you've described, that would be essential to reach that point.",

That's a fulsome conversation.I can tell you that collateral damage assessments are done very, very thoroughly. And the application of precise munitions -- they are precise munitions. They hit where they are directed to hit. There's no slippage. So it's the understanding in terms of what underlies that, what is the intelligence that supports that particular strike? And what this really shows you is the incredible brutality of this type of warfare. Although we describe it as precise, but also the messiness, the intelligence challenges to surround all of these targeting requirements. So I -- I mean, the short answer to your question is, I think the IDF -- the IDF has imbedded in a targeting process, legal steps that are essential and must be met. So that's the intent. That's the training. That's the delivery. What happens on the business end always gets messy.",

He has agreed to liquidate his assets in order to meet his billion-dollar obligations to the families of the Sandy Hook tragedy.Courts ordered Jones to pay damages after he lost two defamation cases filed by loved ones and first responders of the mass shooting. They have yet to see a dime from Jones. For years, he peddled the lie that the 2012 massacre was staged. CNN's Oliver Darcy is here with details on this. All right, Oliver, this liquidation means that Jones will be giving up his stake in the online platform, Infowars, which he has held for so many years. Does this also mean that these families will actually get paid or is Jones going to try to weasel out of this again?",

      "sentences": "Well, the hope is that they'll get paid. Like you said, they haven't seen a dime since juries in Connecticut and Texas awarded them $1.5 billion in damages.And let's remember why they awarded those damages. They awarded those damages because Jones, for years, tormented these families. It wasn't only that these families couldn't feel like they could protect the legacy of their loved ones who died during the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. But afterward, for years, they were tormented by -- by hate messages. They were on the receiving end of harassment. One of the family members even testified during one of the trials that they had their house shot at as a result of all this harassment led by Jones, whipped up by Jones. And so the hope is that they will start to see some money. I think it's pretty difficult to imagine a scenario where they get that 1.5 billion. But they'd like to see some of that money, I think. And the hope is that by him liquidating his personal assets, that will happen. I think Jones also starting to realize that he's actually going to have to pay for his really reprehensible actions. Over the weekend, he spoke in really candid terms about what was happening. And he even started to cry on the broadcast. I think we have a tape of that.
