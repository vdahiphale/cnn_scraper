Tropical Storm Alberto is already thrashing the Texas coast with heavy rains and strong winds.The National Hurricane Center predicts this will continue through Thursday. And there's a possibility of tornadoes in some areas. Meantime, western U.S. states are dealing with fast moving wildfires that are burning large areas of land.

Now the wind is from an opposite direction that could put firefighters in some danger, but also could push the fires back onto areas that have already burned.But you never like to see 20 to 30 mile per hour winds over a fire zone. I'd like to see some wind here in the East maybe blowing this heat away for a change or at least giving you a windchill factor which certainly won't be the case. Again, we're talking about heat index, about 260 million people or more going to see temperatures above 90 over the next few days. Maybe not every day. But certainly, you will. There's where the heat will be for today. A little bit farther towards the west tomorrow and really just expanding toward even D.C. by the weekend where temperatures will be almost 100 degrees. And that's not heat index, that's thermometer. We still have these excessive heat warnings and watches all the way across the U.S. where we're just now seeing just long duration days where it's day after day over 90 degrees, over 95 degrees in some spots. Even New York City today all the way to 92 and if you are not in the wind or if you are in the sunshine or between buildings with the concrete, it will feel warmer than that without a doubt. Today's heat index in Syracuse, a lovely 99 this afternoon. And 99 not with heat index but with the air temperature for D.C. Saturday and for Sunday.

Vladimir Putin is in Vietnam for a two-day visit fresh off his landmark trip to North Korea. The Russian President attending a formal welcoming ceremony outside the presidential palace just a short time ago. Mr. Putin is looking to boost economic ties with friendly countries in a bid to show that Western isolation is not having an impact on Moscow. Now before he arrived there, Vietnam's Communist Party newspaper published an op ed from Mr. Putin thanking the government for its balanced position on the conflict in Ukraine. Here's North Korea trip ended with the signing of a trade and mutual defense treaty, which some experts say may be an attempt to justify the reported use of North Korean munitions in the war in Ukraine. And I do want to bring in CNN's Beijing Bureau Chief Steven Jiang now. Good to see you, Steven. So, what's been China's reaction to this strengthening of bilateral relations between Russia and North Korea and of course, the signing of this trade and mutual defense agreement between the two nations and what concerns might China have about all of this?",

And of course, he's also trying very much to expand Russian's relationship and grow in the countries he visited not only in Pyongyang, but also in Hanoi, his latest stop.Russia remains Vietnam's largest arms supplier. He very much wants to keep that and they still have a very strong -- a very strong ties in the oil and gas field with their joint venture of really generating millions of dollars for both countries. So, that kind of practical purposes of this trip is also very much what Putin wants to do. And other countries, including Vietnam is definitely accommodating him because for Vietnam, for example, they are very much -- very adept in playing the Strato game trying to -- trying to have this relationship with all the major powers not only Moscow, but also of course, Beijing and Washington as well.

He goes on to say there are practically no more rules and the silence from the U.N. is deafening.As we've mentioned, the deal signed in Pyongyang includes a mutual defense provision.

And that has turned off a lot of Asian American voters away from the Republican Party. But this vote is still very much up for grabs. We have a lot of -- we have hundreds of thousands of Asian Americans entering the electorate both through naturalization, people gaining citizenship, but also a lot of younger Asian Americans that are aging into the electorate.
