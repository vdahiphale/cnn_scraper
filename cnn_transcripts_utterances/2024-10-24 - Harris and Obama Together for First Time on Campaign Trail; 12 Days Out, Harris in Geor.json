But I want you to think about this, because I watched like you did yesterday and something hit me pretty hard.

He made the decision, and he did actually ask her, and we've now learned this, is she the right person to drive this home? He questioned that. He could have said, we need to run a process in order for me to make this move, but they decided not to. I don't know who they is. Was it Obama? Was it Pelosi? I don't care who it was.

Almost all of her policies got majority support, only about half of Trump's did.And actually, they had done a version of this with YouGov a few months ago where Trump's policies fared even worse. The reason why he's finally above water on about half of his policies is that he's kind of had this recent Panda Peluso where he is giving away tax breaks to everyone and, you know, no tax breaks on social -- no taxes on Social Security benefits or to our tips or what have you.
