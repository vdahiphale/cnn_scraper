The Kremlin spokesperson told reporters, quote, we are well aware that decisions on such actions and terrorist attacks are not made in Kyiv but in Washington.

It actually could have come from somewhere inside of Russia, Russia dissidents, if that's a possibility, they could have it. But I think, in all likelihood, the fact that this drone had to travel 280 miles, get through multiple air defense platforms and systems that they had set up already in Russia, it's just not likely it came anywhere from within the boundary of Ukraine.

Mortgage rates a year ago when the Fed started raising interest rates, just 4 percent. [10Now, they're 6.43 percent. In real world terms, that means the house payment last year that was $2,600 a month is now $3,100 a month. That is $563 difference in the house payment on the same mortgage. So, that is more money. For auto loans, same deal. Last year, 4.5 percent was the typical auto loan. Today, it's just about 7 percent. That is about $63 more for the typical auto payment every single month. That is real money. And credit cards, this is where it is really the most dangerous, and I've been sort of sounding this alarm. Credit card debt is so much more expensive today than it was a year ago. Rates on credit cards last year were about 14 percent. Now, they're record highs above 20 percent. It's 30 percent if you're using a store card, which is incredibly dangerous if you're carrying a balance. An example, a credit card -- $2,000 balance on a credit card, you're going to add 11 more months to pay it off if you're paying that minimum payment, if you're paying the minimum on that credit card. So, that's just really, really dumb debt and so be very, very careful of that. That's what Fed interest rate hikes mean. It means you're borrowing is more expensive.",

And according to the mother, he became agitated after he was denied an anti-anxiety prescription for Ativan.According to police, Patterson came here yesterday to this north side midtown medical facility because he was unhappy with the treatment that he was being given at the V.A. He opened fire killing a 38-year- old woman and injuring four others. All the victims are women, three of them in critical condition, one of them in stable condition. And according to police, Patterson then took off running. He stole an unattended car at a nearby gas station. And according to police, technology really played a part in helping capture this suspect about 20 minutes after he stole that vehicle, a license plate tag was caught on camera alerting police that he was in a northwest suburb in nearby Cobb County, just about ten miles away. Ultimately, it was a plain-clothed police officer that found Patterson hiding in a pool area inside an apartment complex after neighbors had alerted police to some suspicious activity ending what was a terrifying nearly eight hours-long manhunt here in the city of Atlanta and beyond. Later this morning, Patterson is expected to make his first court appearance at 11:00 A.M. local time, charged with four counts of aggravated assault, one count of felony murder. His mother is reportedly still cooperating with police as is the Coast Guard.

I think we need to expand the court because they stacked it by withholding a nominee from one president to a Democratic president and then jamming down a Republican nominee. We have two justices on the court that have changed the balance for a generation, if it is left the way it is, but it begins with ethics.And, clearly, now with multiple justices having serious questions raised about their ethics, there needs to be an enforceable code of ethics towards the Supreme Court.",
