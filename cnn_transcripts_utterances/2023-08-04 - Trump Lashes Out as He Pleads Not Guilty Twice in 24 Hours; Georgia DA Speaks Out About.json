This as he pleads not guilty to charges in two separate DOJ cases, all in the span of 24 hours.Plus, all eyes on Georgia. Security being heightened even further. Witnesses told, be ready to testify as early as Monday. Is D.A. Fani Willis about to make her case against Trump? And explosive new reporting from CNN's KFILE. A Ron DeSantis appointee teaching a seminar, claiming that White people were slaves in America. And we have the audio. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening, I'm Brianna Keilar, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, former President Trump issues a major threat after pleading not guilty again today, that is right, twice in 24 hours. The former president pleaded not guilty to federal criminal charges. And writing on his social media, in all caps, quote: If you go after me, I'm coming after you. And that post was soon followed by a new Trump campaign ads naming and showing the prosecutors that Trump claims are trying to, quote, get him. All of this coming shortly after we learned about Trump's latest not guilty plea. Today's plea was in response to new charges in the superseding indictment that special counsel Jack Smith brought against Trump last week in the classified documents case. Trump had originally been charged with 37 counts in that case. Three more counts were added, for allegedly attempting to delete security footage in Mar-a- Lago after receiving a grand jury subpoena for these videos. According to the indictment, one of Trump's codefendants told another employee at Mar-a-Lago, quote, the boss wanted the video deleted. Right now, former President Trump about to speak in Alabama, headlining a GOP dinner there tonight. He is likely hoping his supporters are not moved by the now 78 charges he is facing across three criminal indictments, despite a new poll show it more voters think the election related charges are indeed very serious, compared to his previous two indictments. Earlier today, Trump demanding the Supreme Court intervene on his behalf. Posting on social media, quote: Crazy! My political opponent has hit me with a barrage of lawsuits including D.A., A.G. and others which require massive amounts of my time and money to adjudicate. It is election interference and the Supreme Court must intercede. Katelyn Polantz is OUTFRONT in Washington tonight. So, Katelyn, two not guilty pleas from the former president just 24 hours. What more are you learning?",

POLANTZ:  Yeah, Brianna, this is Bernie Kerik. He's a close associate of Rudy Giuliani. They were both working together for Donald Trump after the 2020 election to spread disinformation about election fraud. It just wasn't there, trying to say that they had evidence of it and they didn't. And Bernie Kerik, he spoke up in a lawsuit recently, telling some lawyers that have been suing him on behalf of Georgia election workers, that he's not willing to give over about 300 documents still to them. Because he says they still fall under attorney-client privilege, meaning that the Trump campaign very likely is the people who are saying these can't go to anyone, specifically these Georgia election workers in this lawsuit. We don't know how that's going to affect special counsel criminal investigation. But we do know that Bernie Kerik is set to sit down with special counsel investigators in the coming days, they very likely have asked for the same sets of documents. He very lovely could be withholding them from the special counsel prosecutors as well, still. And they are still investigating, clearly, many of the aspects of what happened after the 2020 election by continuing to do interviews. And Rudy Giuliani being one of those people who was a coconspirator in the indictment against Donald Trump the other day. And so, a lot happening there, and we will have to wait and see if Bernie Kerik does become willing to turn over these documents or if a judge surprised him open, somehow, and if the special counsel's office does get their hands on them as well -- Brianna.",

The court could step in actually right away to at least warn the former president that if he persists in these kinds of statements, that it will get him into even greater legal jeopardy.And I think there are at least to trigger points and a certain sense for him. One is, he could be subject to a gag order by one or more of the judges, in which they say you may no longer speak publicly about the case, and about the attorney -- about the prosecutors, and the like at all, full stop, because you have violated the guardrails that we've set up for you. And then second, there are criminal penalties. And indeed, at the arraignment, yesterday, the judge said the specifically to former President Trump, there are criminal laws that you should not violate, including intimidating witnesses. There is another law that says you also shall do nothing to corruptly influenced or intimidate, through the use of force or not through the use of force, U.S. attorneys. So this is a very specific, criminal statute that would apply torque to somebody like him. And admittedly, I think today's statement by him is ambiguous. But at the same time, I don't think it is ambiguous to some of his more violent supporters and I think you can only imagine that some of these prosecutors will have to increase their security detail because this kind of rhetoric leads to death threats, increase death threats against them. And that's part of a legal test as well. Does it put an individual and reasonable fear of their safety? Anybody can't imagine being one of the prosecutors. I think to be worried, to a great degree, about your safety after statements like these.",
