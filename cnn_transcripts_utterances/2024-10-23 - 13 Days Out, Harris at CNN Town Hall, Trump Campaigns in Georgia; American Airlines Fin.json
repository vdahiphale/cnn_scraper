So, we suspect to hear more of that argument from him and then also leaning into celebrity here. He'll be joined by Bruce Springsteen and Tyler Perry in Georgia as well. But, listen, I think that tonight, if we think about this town, CNN's town hall, it takes away a talking point that we have heard from Republicans that Vice President Harris is not addressing the press, that she is sort of hiding here.
