The former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen is expected to testify against his former boss. Actor Steve Buscemi is OK after being randomly attacked in New York City. Police say he was treated for swelling and bleeding in his left eye. The NYPD released a photo of the person they believe is the suspect and asked for the public's help in identifying that individual. The world's first living recipient of a kidney transplanted from a pig has died. Rick Slayman underwent the four-hour surgery in March after he was diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease. The hospital says there's no indication his death was a result of the transplant. As college commencement ceremonies continue, so do the protests. On Sunday, comedian Jerry Seinfeld was interrupted at Duke University's graduation ceremony. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We saw students at Duke University walking out right as the commencement speaker was introduced. That was Jerry Seinfeld.He was able to give his address as planned with no apparent interruptions. And this weekend at different universities, we saw students at UC Berkeley chanting and protesting and briefly pausing the commencement ceremony. They then walked out of that event. And also at Virginia Commonwealth University, at least a dozen students also walking out when the governor was beginning to give his commencement address. So, again, that's what a lot of universities are trying to avoid this weekend and others who have events later on. And, of course, this has also caused just a lot of frustration among students who had to deal with graduating from high school in the middle of a pandemic and now, again, having to deal with commencement under difficult circumstances or under something that they do not consider a normal commencement ceremony.

We spoke with the U.S. Coast Guard just to try and get an understanding of just how complicated this operation is and why every environmental factor matters. NICK AMEEN, PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER, U.S. COAST GUARD: There was some inclement weather in the area today. There were a few lightning strikes. Whenever there's a lightning strike in the area, that pushes the clock back. And so that clock just kept getting pushed back and pushed back. And so ultimately, we arrived at the decision to postpone until tomorrow. A very dynamic situation that we're dealing with here with the Key Bridge response.

It gives you an idea of just exactly how this is going to work. They will put the chargers in. The chargers will be wired. When they explode, that will move the pieces off the ship and into the water. Salvage operation can come in, and that can begin the process of removing the bridge so that eventually the Dali can be moved off the channel. While all of that is taking place, the community here in Baltimore is still very much remembering the victims that were lost and looking ahead to recovery, right? The Key Bridge was such a major part of the economy here, a part of the community. And as you can see from this memorial that has been taking shape here behind me over the last several days, people are still honoring the memory of those who were lost. We have been watching throughout the day as people come in to pay their respects, lay flowers, take pictures, and just take in, as I said, the loss of those who were killed during this incident. So if the weather and all the other environmental factors cooperate, this operation now expected to happen Monday afternoon. Reporting in Baltimore, I'm Gloria           Pazmino, CNN.

They're taking venom and turning it into anti-venom by extracting deadly fluid from the fish's venom glands. They then send off what's been captured to another lab where they inject the venom into an animal with a strong immune system such as a horse, which then produces antibodies which are extracted, purified and reduced for humans. Now what was once deadly creates something lifesaving. Seymour says the need for anti-venom may increase as ocean temperatures rise due to climate change. Warmer waters are pushing the marine life further south and can also change the toxicity of the venom. This could then make pre-existing anti-venoms ineffective.",

Going into the French Open later this month, he still hasn't played a final yet in 2024. But he says his performance might have been impacted by a freak accident on Friday when he was cracked on the head by a water bottle. Djokovic had just played very well in his opening match of the tournament, and he was signing autographs when that bottle slid out of a fan's backpack and landed right on top of his head.Tournament organizers at the time said that he'd suffered a bump on the head, but he'd been checked out, there was no cause for concern, and he was certainly making light of it when he arrived for a practice hit on Saturday wearing a cyclist's helmet. But on Sunday, Djokovic was struggling against the unheralded Chilean Alejandro Tabilo, he was just blown away. In a tournament that he's won six times before, he was bounced out in the third round, losing 6-2, 6-3 in only 67 minutes. Tabilo, to be fair, played superbly, but afterwards Djokovic indicated that he wasn't feeling quite right.

After that I got medical care, and I've been through a, you know, half an hour, an hour of nausea and dizziness and blood, and, you know, a lot of different things. But I managed to sleep OK. You know, I had headaches, but, you know, the next day or yesterday was pretty fine, so I thought, you know, it's OK. But maybe it is OK, maybe it's not.
