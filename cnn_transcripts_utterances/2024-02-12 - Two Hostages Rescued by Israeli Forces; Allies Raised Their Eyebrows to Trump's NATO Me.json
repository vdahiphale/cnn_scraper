And we'll also hold this up as further justification of saying, look, this is where Hamas is. This is where the hostages are. We have to go in.And Prime Minister Netanyahu over the weekend saying, if you're telling us not to go into Rafah on this planned ground operation, then you're effectively telling us lose the war, leave Hamas there. So this will be seen in that context in Israel. And let's not forget that this is only the second successful rescue of hostages by Israel in four months. The only other was a female Israeli soldier. They haven't rescued any other hostages. So this will be seen as a great relief in Israel and also as a symbolic victory, as you said. On the other hand, of course, the Palestine Red Crescent saying more than 100 people killed. We don't know how many of those are militants or Hamas connected, but as Nic says, women and children among those. And I suppose the concern will be just a foretaste of what is to come. Now, this isn't the first time there have been strikes on Rafah. The war came to Rafah in the wake of the Hamas terrorist attack since October the 7th. There have been strikes on and off. But what there will be concerns is there are more than a million Palestinians there, many displaced multiple times from other parts in the Gaza Strip. Israel says it's planning to evacuate all of them to other areas to give them safe passage and to enable a ground operation to take place. So where are they going to go? How on earth are you going to move that many people? And there are grave concerns expressed over the weekend from the Emiratis, the Saudis, the European Union, talking about the potential for an unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe. And the head of the U.N.'s humanitarian affairs division talking about there being nowhere to go for these Palestinians. So still very large concerns about a ground operation, when it will happen, how it will take place. Israel says it won't, we understand from Israeli official saying they want it done and finished in time for March the 10th in less than a month's time in time for Ramadan, but a lot of unanswered questions still.",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, I mean we can tell what President Trump thinks of alliances and NATO because he has been very clear about it when he was president. So now he had threatened in the past to pull the United States away from NATO. He had been complaining that he believed that other member nations were not paying their fair share. They were not paying the recommended 2 percent of GDP towards NATO.Now it is true that a majority of those countries do not go to that 2 percent guideline, but it's not a binding contract. Other countries pay even more than that. But this is not what Donald Trump was wanting. He wanted all these countries to be paying more, believing that the United States was having to share too much of the load at this point. So we know his feelings about NATO. We know his feelings about certain alliances as well. He never really saw the need for these alliances around the world and many of those relationships have had to be rebuilt since U.S. President Joe Biden took power. In fact, we have seen NATO being more powerful. There's more unity within NATO, certainly since Russia invaded Ukraine since the U.S. President Joe Biden was in power as well. So, what we're seeing here really is a sense of what could happen if Donald Trump does win the U.S. presidency again. And as you say, there is concern around the world. We've heard from the NATO Secretary General, for example, Jens Stoltenberg, who said, quote, \"any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the U.S. and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Now, this is really at the core of NATO. It is Article 5, which is a promise of collective defense that if one member nation is attacked, then all member nations are attacked. It is really the basis of NATO that all member nations would come to the defense of that one particular country. And this is really what President Trump has undermined at this point and it does raise concerns that if he does win the U.S. presidency what would that mean for NATO itself? The European Council President Charles Michel, for example, saying that these comments were reckless, adding that they only serve Putin's interest. Max?",

So, there is that, and that's quite an appealing part of this.But when we consider Russia, China, if he goes through with this promise to effectively weaken the power of NATO without America behind it in the same way, it does open up an opportunity for Russia and China to fill that vacuum on the world stage and does change the world order.",

And we have seen consistent movement forward. In 2014, there were only three members hitting that target. Now there are over 10. There's a long ways to go. But again, if you look at who's spending on defense, the top defense spender in NATO is Poland. It's not the United States. Europeans have stepped up a lot, especially since Russia invaded Ukraine. So, I think the commitment is serious. The direction of travel is correct. I think Europeans know that they need to do more. But there is a question of how do you motivate and creating chaos and fear and signaling support in effect to Russia is not a sound way to do it. Not only not sound for Europeans, it's not good for the United States.",

They're saying, does he remember the names of foreign leaders on television? And we know this is a problem for President Biden. It's been a problem for President Biden when he was a young president. We also know that it's a problem for President Trump. So, I think there is a sort of a question of how do you communicate, how will this president and his team come up with a strategy to communicate this effectively, to own the age, to talk about wisdom and judgment and the policies. But right now, they are fighting an uphill battle because quite frankly, even the media that generally is more fair when it comes to the president are not helping him out.",

Two hostages held by Hamas in Gaza since the October 7th attack are now back in Israel after being rescued in a special operation overnight. That word comes from the Israeli military, which said the two men are now at a medical facility in Tel Aviv, are in good condition as well. The operation took place in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where the IDF also says they conducted a series of strikes. The Palestine Red Crescent Society says more than 100 people were killed in those strikes. Joining us now from Tel Aviv is Noa Landau, Deputy Editor-in-Chief at the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Thank you so much for joining us today. I'm just wondering what the Israeli public will be making of this, because it's pretty clear that the government sees it as a great triumph, of course, getting those much-missed hostages back home moment for the families as well. Does that give the government more momentum to push into Rafah, do you think? NOA LANDAU, DEPUTY EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, HAARETZ: Well, Max, this rescue operation is definitely a positive, heartwarming moment, not only for Louis and Fernando's loved ones, but for every Israeli who's been anxiously waiting for hostages' safe return home. But at the same time, it is important to remember this was a tactical victory and a much larger tragic catastrophe. There are still 134 Israeli hostages in Gaza as we speak. So, in order to bring them all home, a difficult deal with Hamas is still very much needed because this means Israel has to pay a price for their release, including the release of more Hamas prisoners and the ceasefire. This has become a highly contentious political issue here in Israel.",
