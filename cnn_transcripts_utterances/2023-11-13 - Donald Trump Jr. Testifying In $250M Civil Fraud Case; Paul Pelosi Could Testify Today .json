One, this is more of a political defense and kind of putting on a P.R. campaign about how great this organization is that the consequence of this case could be to shut it down. So, I think there is a P.R. aspect to this.But then as to the legal aspect, I think they're going to look to build on this. The defense is going to look to make the argument that when these banks were doing business with the Trump Organization, the Trump Organization is special. And so, the nitty-gritty details of these financials are less important than a personal -- you know, private wealth management group looking to build a relationship with the Trump family business.",

And this morning, we're learning House Speaker Mike Johnson does not have the support he needs from his Republican colleagues to pass his funding bill. At least six House Republicans are opposed to the two-part proposal that would keep some government programs funded through mid-January, and others funded until early February. And this could force Johnson to turn to Democrats for help.CNN's Lauren Fox is on Capitol Hill this morning. Lauren, is there a chance that Democrats can, you know, help keep the speaker's bill from sinking completely?",

But what is becoming very clear is that Johnson is going to need Democrats if he is going to be able to get this across the finish line.Now, the expectation is that despite the fact that this two-step proposal is not exactly what Democrats were envisioning, it is a bill and a plan that does not cut the current government funding, it keeps government funding levels where they are, and that was a red line for Democrats. So, at this point, it seems like Democrats could be open to this proposal. They're signaling that they may open the door, may be able to back it. But obviously, it's a big test for Johnson because this is the first fiscal crisis that he's coming to terms with as a newly minted speaker, and how he handles the next couple of days. Even if he can get some Democratic support, obviously, it's going to say a lot about his tenure and his ability moving forward to both govern his own conference and make sure that the basic work of governing gets done up here on Capitol Hill.",

That then brought in the federal government to launch this investigation involving multiple agencies.So, right now again, it's the FBI testifying. Some other potential witnesses we could hear from today include Paul Pelosi himself recounting that terrifying day last year when the suspect, David DePape was accused of going to his home, holding him captive, and then assaulting him with a hammer. We're also expecting to hear from members of the Capitol Police who of course, protect the Pelosi family. Now, DePape obviously faces very serious charges. Those include assault on the immediate family member of a federal official, as well as attempted kidnapping of a federal official. Again, we're waiting to see whether Paul Pelosi himself will take the stand today. That obviously could be gripping testimony about what he endured that day, John.",

The issue, as far as their strategy goes, comes down to what his lawyer says is the why.Of course, these very serious federal charges pertain to Nancy Pelosi's association here. Again, a threat to a family member of a federal official. The suspect also allegedly told Paul Pelosi that he was waiting for Nancy Pelosi to come home so that he could kidnap her. Now, his attorney -- David DePape's attorney, of course, he's pleaded not guilty to these charges. She laid out last week in court what that strategy is. I'll read you part of what she told the judge. She says that this case is about whether David acted because of, on account of, Nancy Pelosi's duties as a member of Congress. He didn't. And he only struck Paul Pelosi in a quick moment of despair because the police arrived, and his larger plan was thwarted. Now, as far as what that plan was, again, this seems like a very troubled individual. But at least according to his interview with authorities after his arrest, he said that in his view, Nancy Pelosi was involved in some plot to take votes from Donald Trump. Of course, that follows along the lines of a lot of the conspiracy theories that we've heard. He seems to have bought into some of those, at least, according to his confession. But again, his attorney not disputing that he assaulted Paul Pelosi but saying it was not because of Paul Pelosi's association with the House speaker at the time. Of course, if he is convicted of these charges -- very serious charges, he could face up to 30 years in prison for one set. 20 years for another, John.",

So, everybody takes it to the conventional wisdom that, you know, if you have obesity or you're in the overweight category, that losing weight should protect your heart, but it's ever -- never actually been borne out in the sort of gold standard clinical trial. So, now we are seeing that with a major clinical trial.More than 17,000 patients followed for an average of more than three years, folks that already had some kind of heart event like a heart attack or stroke or had clogged arteries and their arms or legs, and so this was to try to prevent another one. And so, what they found was that not only did this lead to weight loss of almost 10 percent, but it also lowered blood sugar, blood pressure, inflammation, and triglycerides, and then had a 20 percent reduction in the risk of heart attacks and strokes or heart-related deaths. And so, this was presented at a massive meeting of heart doctors in Philadelphia. A lot of folks in that room now are going to come back and start prescribing this for their patients.",
