I'm Julia Chatterley in New York.And tonight, no fuel and not enough lifesaving food and water, that's what we're hearing is the Egyptian Red Crescent confirms more aid trucks and now in Gaza. The aid may be arriving but the U.N. says the convoy has not provided desperately needed fuel. And aid workers see the relief supplies aren't nearly enough for the besieged enclave. We're also hearing tonight from a senior Israeli official who says there will be no ceasefire in Gaza. This comes as Israeli troops clashed with Hamas fighters inside the Palestinian territory earlier in the day. Meanwhile, the Netanyahu government says it's preparing for what it calls the next stage of its war with Hamas. The Israeli Prime Minister spent the day meeting with his war cabinet as the military ramps up air strikes on Gaza. For his part, Israel's defense minister took a moment to discuss the expected incursion. Just take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): This needs to be the last maneuvering inside Gaza due to the simple reason that Hamas will cease to exist. It might take a month or two. But eventually there will be no Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we're talking about as many as 1 million Palestinians that move to the south.

Now this was a very limited ground incursion. It is not the big ground incursion that we are expecting to happen at any moment now. But it appears that they're going specifically against the pockets of resistance of militants with Hamas there, perhaps with the hope of finding some of those hostages, as many as 200 that are still there, and were taken captive more than two weeks ago by Hamas. So the situation here in Tel Aviv, where we are, it's been eerily quiet over the last few hours. Julia, we had heard air raid sirens on a daily basis, but that was not the case today. Julia?",

What we know is that these people have lived in incredibly horrible situation.I mean, 50 percent of them without food, 90 without adequate food, 90 percent of them without clean water. That was before the terrorist attacks, that was before the siege of Gaza two weeks ago. Now, I mean, are Palestinians seeing what happened in Israel and seeing that civilian hostages have been taken, seeing that defenseless children, defenseless older people, whole families were murdered by Hamas? I would think that a lot of them if they're getting that news, they're getting that information, they believe it would be sickened by what Hamas, their government has actually been responsible for. But how many of them are getting that information? How many of them believe it in this environment, in today's environment? The answer is probably very, very few.

And this is where this confrontation is very different from the Russian invasion in Ukraine, and much more dangerous. Remember, in the days, the weeks, the months after the Russians invaded Ukraine, the U.S. was, together with all of its allies, doing everything possible to support Ukraine, but also everything possible to draw a red line, there would be no, no fly zone, there would be no American troops on the ground, because the United States did not want to risk a direct fight with Russia. This is exactly the opposite. This is the Americans telling the Iranians very directly, and the Europeans aren't saying this, the Americans are saying it by themselves. If this war opens up to a broader front, the United States will get directly involved. They're not trying to avoid that. They're using deterrence in the strongest possible way to warn off against opening a new front in this war, the likelihood that the United States is directly involved in military fighting in the Middle East, assuming a ground war starts is pretty high.

In addition to that, their satellite imagery and they also spoke with several explosives and other military experts who analyze these very images. And CNN's analysis effectively suggests that this blast at this hospital inside the Gaza Strip was caused by a rocket launched from Gaza. A rocket that appears to have broken up mid-air and then at least part of that rocket fell down on that parking lot outside the hospital, causing the explosion that has killed hundreds of people over there. Now these weapons and explosives experts who CNN spoke with, they all agree that this is the most likely scenario.Now at the same time, a definitive conclusion on this simply can't be reached without recovering physical evidence from the site, which is very difficult given the limited access that journalists have to the Gaza Strip. And also the fact that that territory is indeed controlled by Hamas. Now, I want to take you through two key moments here, because one of them is from this live broadcast that was being broadcast on Al Jazeera, where you can see the rockets that were being fired around the same time as this blast occurred. One of those rockets appears to burn out in the sky before crashing into the area where the hospital is. The second piece of evidence is the crater. And this is a key piece of evidence that the Israeli Defense Forces have also pointed to, as they tried to make the initial claim that this was not them that this was caused by a rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The crater that was caused by this explosion was three by three feet wide, about one foot deep. And all of the experts that CNN spoke to, agreed, that this is not consistent with the kind of crater that you would see from a bomb that would be dropped from an aircraft. And they also said that it is not consistent with any kind of artillery fire on that kind of a position. Now, all of this doesn't change the fact that Palestinian officials continue to insist that Israel is responsible for the strike. Israel, of course, denies that and has pointed to this very same rocket scenario. What it also doesn't change is the anger, the eruption of anger that this hospital blast has caused in the Arab world in the Middle East. We have watched these protests over the last couple of days at U.S. embassies at Israeli embassies in the region. And ultimately, you know, the majority of this hospital blasts has really become quite a touch point. And I don't think that that is going to change despite this latest analysis.",

It is when -- so before the -- this escalation, there were 100 trucks per day, every day going into Gaza, to deal with the humanitarian that people in humanitarian need, then, can you imagine what that need is now, and we're talking here about sort of some 35 to 40 trucks haven't gone in over the course of two days.So it is literally, you know, it's better than nothing. But clearly, much, much more needs to be done. Water, medicine, food, you know, hospital supplies, as well as things like diapers, hygiene kits, for families as well.",

So we are desperately waiting for the further opportunity to get trucks in from whoever, whoever. It's hard. I mean, it's hard to get the data. I mean, at the moment, there's so little coming in, that you know that that is not our biggest concern. Our biggest plea is for a ceasefire. We understand it is incredibly complicated. You know, we are humanitarians. We focus on the situation for children, and no child is safe until the violence stops. So the ceasefire is not possible within the short term. And certainly, humanitarian polls that ought to be possible to open up more access to get more trucks in with life-saving supplies, because any hour any day that is missed more children will die.",

They did put out a little bit of a statement over the course of Sunday with the police chief saying that while the investigation to the death of Mr. Samantha Woll remains ongoing, there is no evidence they have seen so far that suggests this crime was motivated by antisemitism. But they did not include that they had ruled out antisemitism.They really stressed this was an early part of the investigation here. What we do know is where I am near downtown Detroit, just behind me on this block where detectives were coming in and out over the course of Sunday. That is where police found the body of 40-year-old Samantha Woll. She was -- they followed a trail of blood to her home and that's where they believe the killing actually occurred. Again, no suspect has been arrested or made known to the public up to this point. That said, while police have been working through how it happened, it happened and so community members are trying to process how to move forward. We've been seeing memorial services over the course of Sunday where community members all the way up to state elected leaders shared their experiences with will take a listen to Michigan's Attorney General Dana Nessel.
