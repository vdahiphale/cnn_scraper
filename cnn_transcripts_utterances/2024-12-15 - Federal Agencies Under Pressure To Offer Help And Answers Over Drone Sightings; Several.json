There are still a lot of unanswered questions, but Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is looking to assure the public that there is no known public safety threat and that his team is closely monitoring any developments. He also says the agency is in close coordination with state and local authorities.During his most recent comments about the drone sightings during an interview with ABC that aired earlier today, he said that the federal government has deployed additional personnel, resources and technology to help New Jersey state police address the drone sightings. Now, while Mayorkas has said that there's no question people are seeing drones, he has also said that the technology has confirmed that at least some of those drone sightings are actually small manned aircraft. He is calling on Congress to act to help them address future situations, asking them to extend and expand the government's authority when it comes to drones. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If anything, they could create a structural problem for future nominees if they overreach. But I don't believe that it's coming directly out of Mar-a-Lago. I think it's coming out of groups.

And so the National Guard would have a difficult responsibility, one, if they are nationalized, take it away from the governors of the states. And then secondly, going out there, assigning to arrest citizens, because either they have intelligence.Now, if they're supporting ICE, that needs more support for people who have already gone through the process and has an order of deportation, then that would make some sense. But it's fraught with challenges. And we all want to have better enforcement. We all want to recognize that you have people who have overstayed their visas, that came here legally and overstayed their visas, that are part of the illegal population that's here now. And so all of that has to be addressed, but it has to be addressed, one, humanely. But secondly, consistent with our law, and this is where Donald Trump is going to have some challenges. Going after the criminal element there's nothing new about that.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): From the belly of a hulking Russian cargo plane, crate after crate of exotic animals from the Moscow Zoo, a gift from Russian President Vladimir Putin to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, arriving in his capital Pyongyang. The flight from Moscow nearly nine hours. Russian state media says the animals include an African lion, two brown bears, two domestic yaks, five white cockatoos, 25 assorted pheasants and 40 mandarin ducks. Their new home, Pyongyang's Central Zoo. You think he wants to be petted? (Voice-over): I took this video at the zoo in 2016, when Putin gave Kim a pair of Siberian tigers. They've been exchanging a lot of animals lately, symbols of their alliance against the U.S.-led world order. In June, Kim sent Putin a pair of North Korean hunting dogs. In August, Putin reciprocated with nearly 450 goats and 24 Orlov Trotters, Kim's favorite horse breed. Both strongmen famously use horses in state propaganda, projecting alpha male energy in turbulent times. In the years since Kim took his armored train to Russia, he's gotten plenty of other gifts from Putin, from a set of drones and a bulletproof vest to this Russian-made armored limousine. The two leaders drove it around town during Putin's rare visit to Pyongyang. And then there's Russian oil, believed to be more than a million barrels since March. In exchange, North Korea is reportedly expanding its weapons production for Russia's war in Ukraine.

James has been the indisputable king of the court for the last 20 years, but he is just 15 days out now from his 40th birthday, an almost unthinkable age to be playing in the NBA.Let's talk more about this with Rachel Nichols, host of Showtime's \"Headliners with Rachel Nichols.\" Rachel, great to have you here with us. One of the more famous sayings in sports is Father Time is undefeated. And it seems that perhaps time is catching up to LeBron James, kind of like all of us. RACHEL NICHOLS, HOST, SHOWTIME'S \"HEADLINERS WITH RACHEL NICHOLS\": Well, I mean, it's so jarring because LeBron ran so deeply against that trend. He actually did a Nike campaign a couple of years ago, which was him versus a character dressed as Father Time, who he kept beating. And it seemed totally reasonable for Nike to do this advertising campaign because that's what he was doing. Even the beginning of this season, he was scoring triple doubles at this outrageous clip. He looked incredible out there, but he has hit a skid, as have the Lakers. And it's brought up a lot of questions about how much longer he wants to keep doing this, how much longer can he keep doing this, and does he want to hang on on a team that doesn't seem to really have a chance of winning anything?",

I have covered LeBron since he was a senior in high school, and I got to tell you, he has been a global international superstar since then, and someone who has identified himself as a basketball player, that's who he is, to walk away from that.
