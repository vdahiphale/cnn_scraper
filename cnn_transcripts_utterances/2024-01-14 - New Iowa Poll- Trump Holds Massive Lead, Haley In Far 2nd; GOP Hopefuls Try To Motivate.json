Good morning and welcome to the INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Manu Raju. Well, it is finally here. After months of rallies, handshakes, and photo ops, the presidential candidates will face off tomorrow in the first contest of 2024. The stage has been set in the Hawkeye state and now the political world is reacting to a major new poll from the Des Moines Register and NBC News showing Donald Trump with a commanding lead, 28 points ahead of his closest rival. Nikki Haley is narrowly pulling ahead of Ron DeSantis for second place, but both far behind Trump who still has more support than both of them combined. And Trump supporters are, by far, the most enthusiastic. Forty-nine percent are extremely enthusiastic compared to 23 percent of DeSantis supporters and just 9 percent for Haley. The pollster called those Haley numbers, quote, on the edge of jaw dropping and not in a good way. But this year's extreme weather could have an unpredictable impact on turnout and already did some damage to the candidate's plans for their final weekend on the trail. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is in Des Moines indoors. Very happy to be indoors, I'm sure. Jeff, how worried are the campaigns at this moment about turnout ahead of this-- ahead of tomorrow with this extreme weather that you're all enduring?",

      "sentences": "Hey, Manu. Good morning. I mean, it is the central concern of every one of the campaigns.First and foremost, it is something that is outside of their control for all of the planning, for all of the precise strategy. This is something that is not in their hands and it is going to dramatically impact who turns out to the Iowa caucuses tomorrow evening. Already this morning, Governor Ron DeSantis is canceling an event tonight in Sioux City. Nikki Haley is canceling an event this morning in a Dubuque. They don't want their supporters out on the roads today, but tomorrow night they do. So what is happening behind the scenes is really a furious scramble to ensure that all of their supporters get out to the polls, but some very interesting numbers that you were just talking about inside the Des Moines Register poll. The intensity is something that certainly is a worry for Nikki Haley supporters. She certainly has some movement here in Iowa as well as in New Hampshire. But are her supporters as intense? Yesterday, we went out with one of her hot advocates who is going door to door in this bone chilling cold. Drew Klein is the veteran of Iowa Republican caucuses. He acknowledged that weather is a concern. DREW KLEIN, REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT, AFP ACTION: There are folks that are going to decide to stay home, for sure. We're trying to overcome that as much as possible by, you know, just kind of laying out to them that the gravity of their votes and their participation, what that means. When you're deciding between the couch at 70 degrees or negative five degrees outside of your front door, it's tough to get people to go. So there's no question that Trump supporters are the most committed, so they are perhaps the most likely to turn out. But some of them have to drive the farthest as well. His supporters in rural areas. Nikki Haley is looking for the suburbs right here around Des Moines. So for all of the spitting that normally happens, weather now is part of it. But no one has more on the line than Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who knows he needs a second place finish here. He's campaigning aggressively here today, Manu.",

And so when you think about where we are, this first step in the process for Republican voters, after the last three years since Donald Trump left office, January 6th and all that followed after that, to have a moment now to weigh in with their votes, to say whether or not Donald Trump is the person they want to be, their standard bearer in a potential rematch against Joe Biden. Tomorrow night is the first time voters get to actually weigh in on that question. And according to the poll that we saw from the Des Moines Register, they're going to potentially say so rather robustly in Iowa. Yes is the answer to that. They do want him to be his standard bearer. So his dominance is one thing. The other thing I would note here is that while we look at that race for second place, Manu, and Jeff encapsulated sort of the different strategies from the Haley and the DeSantis campaigns, there's no doubt that is all on display. You said, you know, you can add DeSantis and Haley support together and still not get to Trump. You can throw in the Vivek Ramaswamy's eight percent and still not get to Trump. So it's -- that is the kind -- we haven't seen this kind of lead from a candidate heading into the caucus like this, a non-incumbent candidate. And so if that is what the results look like Monday night, Donald Trump's going to be well on his way to quashing the competition and moving towards this nomination.",

Who is undecided here in this -- in this state? Mind is made up. Sixty-eight percent of voters in Iowa say that -- Republican voters say that a mind is made up. There's still about a quarter of the vote who are -- say they could be sort of persuaded, but it is different per candidate here. As David was talking about the dominance of Trump, perhaps it's because of this. Eight-two percent of Trump -- the supporters say that their mind is made up. That is much different for DeSantis and Haley. That is in the 60 percent range. It just shows you the steep climb they are facing at this moment.",

It's an alternative to Trump, but that's where a lot of the commonalities end.For Haley, though, one of the other big, I think, challenges or cuts of the poll to look at is not just the lower intensity of enthusiasm for her, but the fact that so much of her support is coming from independents or even some Democrats who've decided to caucus as, you know, Republicans. It just made me wonder if somehow Nikki Haley could defy all expectations and really make a run for it and end up at the convention. Would Trump still grab it back at a convention? I mean, I'm just thinking, whatever, 50 states ahead, right? Like the type of support. It's not just the intensity of support inside the Republican base, but who the support is coming from.",

Forty-nine percent of Republican voters are supporting Haley. This is the first choice, but that is 50 percent of independents and Democrats. But, you know, as David was just saying there.

That was a record. Nobody anticipates breaking that record this time around. I've spoken to people as recently as Friday, who's telling me maybe around 150,000 is going to be total turnout. But if that goes lower, if you have the most committed supports that go out, you get a higher share of it.

KAY HENDERSON, NEWS DIRECTOR, RADIO IOWA: Well, as most everyone in politics knows, Ron DeSantis has visited each one of Iowa's 99 counties. He particularly paid attention to the counties which Cruz won, Ted Cruz, that is, in 2016, earlier this year, over the summer. I'm also watching what happens in Dubuque County. Both Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are campaigning there today. That was a very narrow victory for Donald Trump in that particular county, less than one percent ahead of Cruz in 2016. And then Nikki Haley has spent a lot of time in the Cedar Rapids Metro. And in that particular county, which is Lynn County, Donald Trump finished third in 2016. So those are the counties that I'm watching. And going back to 2022, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds racked up an enormous victory in Iowa. And she did so by really sweeping rural areas as did Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. So the real question is, will Donald Trump's margins in rural areas sort of equate to his general election performance here? Will his campaign in 2024 that he's assembled for the caucuses be demonstrably different from the campaign that he had in 2016? Those of us who've been out on the campaign trail see that it is different. It's organized in a way that is very similar to the DeSantis campaign in terms of precinct level organizing.",

How much does DeSantis need to narrow that margin in order to have some semblance of victory on tomorrow night? GRUBER-MILLER: Well, that's why he's done the 99-county tour. That's why he's been hitting Trump on the campaign trail for not showing up in Iowa more frequently, not showing up to debate, not really putting in the time, shaking hands in every corner of the state. And he's hoping that'll give him an advantage. And he's hoping that his organization with Never Back Down will also give him a turnout advantage. Actually, what we found in the Des Moines Register poll is that DeSantis's supporters are more likely to say that they will definitely show up to caucus than Donald Trump's or Nikki Haley supporters.

Many members want conservative deals. We've seen them be able to do that early on last year, but it is impossible.
