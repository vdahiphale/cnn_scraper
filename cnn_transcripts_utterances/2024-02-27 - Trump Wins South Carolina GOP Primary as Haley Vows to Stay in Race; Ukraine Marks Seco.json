Haley says she`s committed until Super Tuesday, that`s March 5th. It`s a hugely important presidential primary election day with more states voting than any other date. 15 states, one territory in all. Haley says she doesn`t believe Trump can beat president Joe Biden in the November general election.

      "sentences": "I`ve been talking to a lot of Trump`s campaign advisors this morning and they say it is time to move onto the general election, regardless of whether or not Nikki Haley is still in the race. Four resounding primary wins. Every contest on the horizon, Trump is favored. And they believe that they need to have a campaign reset ahead of November to start looking towards that general election. Now, to be very clear, this is not a Donald Trump pivot. He`s not going to stop his messaging. He`s not going to stop being who he is. And his campaign is very aware of the candidate that they have. This is about campaign infrastructure and about strategy. They want to build out their operations in critical battleground states. We`re talking about Michigan, Arizona, Georgia. They also want to shift their messaging away from primary messaging and towards President Joe Biden. Now, you saw some of that shift in messaging from the former president himself in his speech when he didn`t mention Nikki Haley once. But I am going to put forward a very important caveat, which was talking to Trump`s senior advisors. They know that they cannot control if he does that again. They are trying to keep him on message. They are telling him it`s important to focus on President Joe Biden. But again, they can`t control what he says, and he`s going to say what he feels and what he thinks. Now, in addition to all of that, we did see in the election last night, there were some warning signs for Donald Trump in a 2024 general election rematch with President Biden, particularly among independent voters. His team knows that. His team knows that he is a very polarizing figure, and that is part of the reason why they believe it is important for them to start shifting towards that general election. To start going through that data, to start coming up with a game plan to take on Joe Biden before November. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Roosevelt, Grover Cleveland, or George H.W. Bush. If you said Grover Cleveland, put your hands up. He served as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States after losing his first reelection campaign to Benjamin Harrison, he returned to defeat him in a rematch four years later. Next up, Saturday mark two years since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine serving as the impetus to this ongoing war. And now the Ukrainian military says it does not have enough ammunition or money and it`s calling on the United States to help them further. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told CNN that millions of people could die if U.S. lawmakers don`t approve more aid. President Joe Biden says continuing to support Ukraine is important and it`s a matter of national security, both abroad. And in the U.S. He will host a meeting with the top four congressional leaders. Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to discuss. Johnson has been resistant to sending further aid without addressing U.S. border security more thoroughly. The Biden administration and U.S. Congress have already directed approximately 75 billion worth of humanitarian, financial, and military aid to Ukraine. Our Christiane Amanpour shows us now what life looks like in three Ukrainian cities as this war drags on. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice-over): This bookstore is called Sens or \"The Meaning\" and opening in Kyiv just days before the Russian war enters a third year sends a clear message. And Ukraine`s greatest living novelist, Andrey Kurkov tells us there is much to say about Ukraine`s culture, identity and resistance. He wrote the foreword for this tome full of 12th century artifacts.",

      "sentences": "So when Putin says this is all greater Russia, what`s your answer?ANDREY KURKOV, AUTHOR, \"THE SILVER BONE\": Well, he`s silly. And he`s not a historian. Kyiv is 1,540 years old. Moscow is only 870 years old. AMANPOUR (voice-over): Ukrainian identity helps them fight and resist, says Kurkov, reminding us that Russians have looted and destroyed libraries, theaters and museums in parts they now occupy. Kurkov, like most Ukrainians, see themselves, their land, as the front line between the authoritarian and the democratic world. Kyiv is further away from the fighting, but over in the northeast, Kharkiv, the second largest city, the danger is real and ever present. Some 40 miles from the Russia border, their massive S-300 missiles reached the city in less than 40 seconds, no time to hide. Memorials to the recent dead spring up all over. This Kharkiv radio station is called \"Boiling Over.\" It started up 10 years ago after Russia`s first invasion as an alternate voice. Natalka, the radio host, tells us it`s also become a sounding board for the terrified and depressed Kharkiv listeners. \"Feedback can be varied,\" she tells us. \"Sometimes they just thank me for the show, and for the fact that they got out of bed thanks to the program. And I consider this a victory, because it could be someone in a state of absolute despair. Lychakiv Cemetery in the western city of Lviv is like cemeteries all over Ukraine today. Two years ago, this was a grass field. Today, it`s a field of flags and the graves of those who`ve fallen defending this country. A woman seems to be talking to her fallen loved one. And this widow, Nataliya, moves in for a kiss. Her husband, who had volunteered for the eastern front, was killed just shy of his 30th birthday. \"I`m proud of my husband because his sacrifice is worth a lot,\" says Nataliya. (On camera): On this two-year anniversary, families are asking whether Ukraine can continue leaving it up to their volunteers or whether there needs to be a call-up to mobilize for the Front. (Voice-over): Nataliya agrees. \"Yes, definitely,\" she says, \"because, if we don`t defend ourselves, what kind of fate awaits us next? And if we don`t defend our lands, Russia will be here soon.\" And that`s the point. Starting a third year of full-scale war against the Russian invasion, they are heavily outmanned and vital weapons and ammunition for their fight are tangled up in Washington`s political gridlock.
