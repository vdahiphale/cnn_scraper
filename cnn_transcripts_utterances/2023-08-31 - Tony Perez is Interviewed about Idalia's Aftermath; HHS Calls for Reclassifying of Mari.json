Idalia hitting the Carolinas overnight leaving hundreds of thousands of residents in the dark across the region. The powerful category three hurricane hit Florida and left historic storm surges up and down Florida's west coast. In Pasco County, officials say 6,000 people were inundated with water. And some homes burned, including this one, in flames amidst the floodwaters. Pasco Fire Rescue carried out 85 rescues, saving at least 150 people ranging in age from just nine days old all the way to 90 years old. And joining us now is the chief of the Pasco County Fire Rescue, Chief Tony Perez. Chief, thanks so much for taking the time. I assume you are quite busy right now still as the recovery continues. What's the situation on the ground right now? What have you guys seen now that the storm has moved away?",

Yesterday afternoon, roughly about 3:00, we demobilized all of our assets and we handed the operation over to the sheriff's department and they worked in conjunction with the local electric company to start getting the power back on. And they were doing their routine exterior inspections of the homes that were damaged to ensure that it was going to be off safe to be able to, you know, be able to turn the power back on. So, right now we would do our second phase this morning and we'll have a much better understanding of where we need to go as far as from the fire and rescue aspect of it.",

A Health and Human Services official sent a letter to the DEA asking the agency to reclassify the drug as a lower risk substance, according to a person familiar with the matter. Right now marijuana is considered a schedule one controlled substance, a classification used only for the most dangerous substances.CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta joining us again this morning. Sanjay, what else do you know about this request to the DEA? Well, so, first of all, you know, any drug that has a potential for abuse can be scheduled and it's into one of five categories. So, schedule one, all the way through schedule five. And let me just show you here what schedule one means. This is where cannabis is placed. Basically no current accepted medicinal use and high potential for abuse. Other examples would be heroin, LSD and ecstasy. What we know is that in October of last year the White House basically asked HHS to review cannabis and see, look, where does this fit in? Are there accepted medical uses? Should it be rescheduled? HHS has now basically sent a letter to the DEA, as you pointed out, Rachel Levine, who's the assistant secretary at HHS sent a letter to Anne Milgram at the DEA saying, hey, look into rescheduling this to specifically schedule three. Now, let me just show you what that means. Schedule three basically saying, there is currently accepted medical use and there is less potential for abuse in substances in schedules one or two. The examples, they want it to be more scheduled along the lines of Tylenol with Codeine, buprenorphine, ketamine and anabolic steroids. That is the -- that's basically what the letter says. This is has been something that's gone back and forth for a long time. A lot of people say, hey, look, how do you place cannabis, something that has, you know, increased evidence of medicinal use into the same category as LSD. And I think that's - that's kind of what's driving this.",

As a schedule one substance it is - that's not a legal thing necessarily, but it does make it very difficult for people who are trying to use cannabis for medicine -- as a medicine to get a hold of it. There is still this very uneven legal evolution. Several states have allowed it medicinally, but it's still schedule one at the federal level so it's very confusing.I think one of the biggest things, frankly, is that you want more evidence of its medicinal benefit, but at the same time, because it is schedule one, it is tough to get the cannabis and actually study it in a way that that's beneficial and provides that evidence. One of the only farms for a long time in the United States was actually in the middle of Ole Miss, the college campus. It was the federally funded sort of source of cannabis for all research for a long time in this country. It's challenging to get the data you want if you only have one source. There's more sources now, but that's - that's the biggest thing, I think, medically. You want to be able to do the research to provide the evidence. You need the evidence to reschedule. You can see the challenges there.",

I mean I don't - I think most people would agree who study this that it shouldn't be a schedule one, but the idea that it has no potential for abuse is probably a pretty high bar.You know, one thing I find very interesting is that if you look at alcohol and tobacco, and you - and, again, go back to schedule one, no accepted medicinal benefit, high potential for abuse, those are substances you could see being on there even more so than cannabis.",
