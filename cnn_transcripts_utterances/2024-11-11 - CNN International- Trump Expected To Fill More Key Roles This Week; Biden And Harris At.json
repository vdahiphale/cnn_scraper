CNN reporting allies like Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have essentially moved into the beachfront resort while nominees are being finalized. And Trump, meantime, is calling on Senate leadership to allow for recess appointments, which would allow him to fill positions without lengthy confirmation hearings. On Wednesday, Trump will travel to the White House for a transition meeting with President Biden.Let's get through all these latest lines. Joining me now from Washington, D.C. is CNN Senior Political Analyst. Mark Preston. And Mark, I mean, let's start with the Trump transition. We've got border czar announcement.

When she goes to be the spokesperson for the United States at the United Nations, world leaders will know that she is speaking for Donald Trump.

We also saw, just in the last few minutes, Vice President Kamala Harris there. It's the first time we are seeing the Vice President, of course, since she spoke in session speech just last week. Earlier, we know that President Biden, alongside the First Lady Jill Biden, were also hosting veterans and members of the military at the White House.Later this week, as we were telling at the top of the show, we said that President Biden is expected to meet with Donald Trump there to discuss the transition of power, which is our top story this hour, and of course, important context here, no such meeting has happened after Trump lost the 2020 election, and of course, refused to accept the results. But, it's been an incredibly busy day in Mar-a-Lago. Let's put some context on what has been announced, some of these key positions. Matt Mowers is a former senior Trump campaign official and was part of the Trump transition team in 2016. Matt, great to see you. Welcome to the show. Let me start then with some of the names that we were talking just at the top of the hour that are being discussed now and being announced by the Trump administration. What do you make of the first few appointments that we've had, Tom Homan, of course, Elise Stefanik, and the last number announced name being floated, which is Stephen Miller? What do you make of those?",

And so, that is going to be the first priority.What you are going to see, and I think it was really telling that Tom Homan was nominated, or not even nominated, but has been announced that he is going to be the border czar, what it means is he is not necessarily going to be just the Secretary of Homeland Security, right? He is going to have an across multi-agency role, and part of the reason for that is because the Trump transition and the soon to be Trump administration believes that this is going to be a whole of government effort. This is not going to be just something that Homeland Security does to focus on the border through Border Patrol and CBP, Customs and Border Patrol. What this is, is also going to be DoD, using the Department of Defense dollars to implement this. There is going to be a health and human services component. We are talking about benefits. There is going to be a whole host of different government agencies engaged in this. And now you have Tom Homan and likely Stephen Miller, who are going to be overseeing this multi-agency plan to not just get tough on the border, stop new crossings across the southern border, but also implement President Trump's deportation plan. And I'll say I think this is also a window into the overall approach that the Trump administration is going to be taking, which is focusing on those key priorities that he talked about in the campaign trail. I mean, he did not make any mistake and hide what his plans were around immigration. Similarly, you should see the same thing around taxes, when the tax bill comes up in the next six months, as well as then some of his foreign policy goals, where he is trying to mediate an ultimate conclusion to what happens in Ukraine, as well as lower the temperature in the Mideast.",

I think he is going to be an outside advisor to go inside a government, would involve a lot of divestment from private sector businesses, as well as possibly walling off from some of those businesses, which I assume he is not prepared or interested in doing right now. But, but what it shows is that Donald Trump is going to do something he did quite a bit of in his first term as well, which is lean on outside advisors, whether they're business people he has known for his entire life, or whether it's individuals he has just gone to no better in the last year, like Elon Musk. He is not going to be afraid to engage outside advisors in the private sector to address some of these challenges.I mean, obviously, the role that Elon Musk is playing in Ukraine right now, given the dominance and use of Starlink in order to provide communication ability to Ukraine, is so instrumental in what's going on. He has done the similar thing in the response to some of the hurricanes that we've seen in the United States. He is so involved in so many different sectors now that I expect him to be called on quite a bit to try to engage in different policy areas, both domestically and around the world, in order to try to solve some of these problems.

President Trump, incoming President Trump, has said that he could resolve, like Ukraine, that he could resolve that crisis very easily. And we know that Trump has been speaking regularly to the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. So, it will be of interest to see how President Biden deals with that particular issue in the Oval Office, or whether he decides Trump has his own perspectives on this, and he doesn't think that he will be able to exert all that much influence on him.The other question that I have is whether they will discuss this broad scale issue of democracy that President Biden had been so intent for the last four years of talking about and discussing and warning about the risks that Trump could pose to democracy if he is returned to the Oval Office. Does President Biden use this moment as an opportunity to try and impress on Trump the importance of maintaining certain institutions and certain guardrails that protect that? And I remember covering Trump's visit with President Obama back in 2016, and that was a topic of discussion between the two men, President Obama trying to impart the importance and gravity of the office that Trump was about to assume. Of course, Trump had no experience in the office at that point. But, I do wonder if Biden will try and use this opportunity to make similar warnings. Of course, he knows that Trump knows the levers of power much better this time around than he did back in 2016. So, it is a very different meeting in a lot of respects, but certainly, President Biden feels very deeply about those institutions, and it will be interesting to see just how much he conveys those to Trump when they sit down.",

Last year, it was the Emirates, another petro-state. But, at least then, a year ago, the world came to the conclusion that the end of fossil fuel era has begun. It's time to transition away.Now, there is so much sort of skepticism already built in.

And he is tying it directly to Trump's victory, saying that he sees an important opportunity for Israel in the wake of Donald Trump being elected, and that he believes that Trump will ultimately support and recognize Israel's annexation of these settlements in the West Bank. Now, he has cause to believe that, because Donald Trump's peace plan back in 2020 did indeed envision supporting Israel's annexation of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, recognizing them if Israel abided by a four-year pause in any expansion of settlement activity.

So, to take their mind off things, they may do a little retail therapy, that hit of dopamine to make them feel good when they're not feeling good in other aspects of their lives.But, the problem is, is experts are warning that if you are doing this regularly, if you're doom spending regularly, you could be putting a lot of this on credit cards. And 50 percent of Americans report that they are carrying some kind of credit card debt, and debt right now in the U.S. on credit cards is over a trillion dollars. That is a new record. So, it's OK if you doom o spend if it fits in your budget, but if you're doing it on the regular, it's really something to look out for to make sure you're not completely destroying your budget.",

Another thing is stop doom scrolling. Stop reading all of this stuff about the economy, all of the stuff about the election. If you really need to be on your phone, pick up the phone and call a friend, talk about something else. And then there is also other ways to get that hit of dopamine, go for a walk, join an exercise class, hug a pet, hug a dog, go volunteer at an animal shelter, things that may take your mind off what you may be feeling bad about, but also might give you that chemical dopamine surge that you're looking for when you're making those purchases, when you're shopping.
