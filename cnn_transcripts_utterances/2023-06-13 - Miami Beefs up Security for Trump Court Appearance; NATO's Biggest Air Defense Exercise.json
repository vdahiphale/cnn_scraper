It's only got one reactor which is in a warm shutdown. All the others have been shut down. There isn't at the moment, a concern that there is a clear and present danger to the nuclear power station in terms of access to the cooling waters from that dam above the now defunct or now burst Nova Kakhovka dam. Because they have a cooling pond that is lasting -- capable of lasting several months, but they will have to refill it the water costs below it is dropping rapidly. And there are concerns that it won't be possible to refill it. That is the sort of effect of the dam but at the same time, this is a frontline position Becky. I think he'll be receiving reassurances too from the Ukrainians, and no doubt from the Russians, that they're not going to get into a fight inside a nuclear power station. Now the Russians fought their way in to that nuclear power station, which was abandoned by the Ukrainian forces, rather than have a serious battle over a nuclear installation that was running at a much higher capacity back in March last year. There are having been assurances given by both sides that they would demilitarize this area ultimately, perhaps, but it is still a Russian base. It is still used by the Russians to attack civilian targets in particular, but military too on the other side of the Dnieper River. And as the Ukrainians push south if they're capable of doing that from Zaporizhzhia City, and there's every indication that that's what they would like to do. Clearly, the presence of a nuclear power station basically on the front line is going to be absolutely top of the IAEA agenda. Becky?",

Let's channel that energy into getting the outcome we want. Dr. Sultan has been on a great listening tour. I was with him in Brussels last week; we met with the senior leadership of the EU President Ursula von der Leyen, President Shawn Michelle, Joseph Burrell. The message was clear the joint communique out of Brussels is clear. People have high expectations of the UAE being able to play this bridge building role between the global north and the global south. The world is facing a global food crisis that the UAE is at the forefront of trying to help alleviate. The Sultan is saying what our president himself Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan has said many times, the UAE will celebrate when the last barrel of oil is drawn out of our territory, because that will mean we are looking at the future of a global economy that is dependent on a clean energy mix. But phase up means phase up Becky, and we've got to do the two simultaneously. And that's what we're trying to corral energy around a COP28. In addition to the really important piece, which is adaptation, finance for the countries that also need to develop. It's not fair to put the burden on them when other countries have already industrialized. And this is the big injustice to the climate debated. How do we get other countries on board and explain to them that, you know, the 100 billion will be met. The finance for loss and damage will be met, that financing for adaptation and mitigation will be available and affordable and accessible. These are the messages that our COP28 presidency team across the board are relaying as we meet with world leaders on this issue. And this is what we're going to be saying here in New York at the Security Council where we brought this topic to the agenda today.",

We renewed the UN operational Mission inSudan on the ground unit times that is providing essential coordination for all the humanitarian aid agencies that are helping the millions of people that need that aid on the ground today in Sudan. So the Security Council has really coalesced under the UAE presidency around this issue. We've had both closed door and open discussions on Sudan. We had a closed door briefing with the Secretary General where he really clearly laid out to us the stark challenges not only for Sudan, but the destabilizing effect on already fragile situations in neighboring countries, from Chad to Libya to elsewhere. There is no military solution to this conflict. We've been saying that from the outset. And we're doing all we can both in the region but also here in New York in the Security Council, to try and keep a consensus in the council around that and to keep focused on the will of the Sudanese people and their right to peace and stability to live the way we all do normally.",
