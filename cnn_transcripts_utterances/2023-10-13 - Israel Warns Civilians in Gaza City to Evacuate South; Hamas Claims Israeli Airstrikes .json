That meeting happened in Jordan. CNN Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman starts us off with this coverage live this morning in Lebanon. Ben, for our viewers who know you, they know how extensively you have reported throughout Gaza for years. Your assessment is so much better than almost anyone else. Is that possible for a million-plus people to immediately leave the north and go south? The U.N. says it is not without catastrophic consequences.",

You're talking about 1.1 million people going from the northern part, the area around Gaza City, which is quite large, to the south.There is an active bombardment of Gaza going on. The fuel has essentially run out. There's no way to move those people from the south, from the north to the south. And then when they go to the south, where do they stay? Already, more than 420,000 people in Gaza have been displaced. That's 20 percent of the population. Many of them have gone to Gaza City from the outlying areas. There is like Beit Hanun and Beit Lahia, the northern edge of the Gaza Strip, very near the main crossing into Israel, the Erez Crossing. And that's where a lot of the fighting has been going on. And so, therefore, it's just logistically almost mission impossible. Now, the Israelis aren't giving a timeline for when this should happen, but under these circumstances, it's almost mission impossible. Poppy?",

Many of the young men in this area have not been allowed into the Al-Aqsa Mosque today to pray at midday prayers.They normally go in if there wasn't a selective process, but, clearly, today, the Israelis have selected them by age, men and women by age. So, many of the youngsters here haven't had an opportunity to get to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, so they have been praying on these streets here. Look, if I describe this as a sort of tense calm today, I think that's how that would be fair. I've been in this area before and it's been very chaotic and very violent. So, I've spoken to some of the older ladies and gentlemen who did get an opportunity today to get into the Al-Aqsa Mosque and they described it as really concerning and very worrying. They prayed, they came back and they're now back in their homes. But what's happening here now is the Israeli Security Forces just pushing people back. They're trying to avoid something kicking off here. Apologies for the cameras, as they move us back. I don't know if you saw in the shot earlier on a very big black truck. That is what's known as a skunk truck. And it's used by the Israeli forces to sort of clear demonstrators. It's a bit like perhaps our viewers will have seen in the past water cannons shot from big trucks. You can smell the acrid nature of what is chemical having been dispersed from that truck. We've heard stun grenades going off this morning, not a lot. Again, you know, there is a-- as I say, there's a sort of, you know, uneasy sense of calm on what is this day of protest that has been called by Hamas today. The stun grenades are-- this is the back end of one that I found on the street here. So, yes, very much a sense of what happens next, what happens next for the next series of Friday prayers, which come, of course, in a couple of hours from now, who will be on the streets and how will the Israeli security deal with those on the streets is really the next question.

But that wasn't an explicit call for violence, as much as he was calling on global demonstrations. He called for violence from Palestinians in the region.So, this is a thing where people have to have a heightened awareness. Law enforcement has to have a heightened presence.
