Officials say they began in a town about 10 kilometers from the airport and have come dangerously close to the facility due to hot, dry winds. The airport will be closed for the next few hours and flights will be delayed or cancelled. And wildfires are spreading across several regions in Algeria. They have killed at least 34 people so far. Ten of the victims are soldiers who died while evacuating other army personnel and civilians to safety. Right now, some 8,000 firefighters are working to control the flames. Algeria and other North African nations have been suffering through a major heat wave, making conditions more dangerous for rescue workers and firefighters. And wildfires are burning in Greece and multiple areas, also fueled by a major heat wave. The country's prime minister is saying we are at war as they try to put out the flames and look to rebuild what's lost. Some of the strongest fires and heaviest damage is on the island of Rhodes.

I think that in general, and I don't think this has to do only with Greece. I think that the pattern of rising heat in Europe and around the world will probably move the type of vacation that we take away from going and basking in the sun on beaches and go towards different types of trends as far as how we spend our vacation. And I was I was thinking that, you know, just some -- a little bit more than 100 years ago, it was really unusual for us to go and spend time on the beach. So, I'm wondering if this is going to be in a few decades, something that we slowly stopped doing.
