Buildings have been flattened, food and water cut off. More bodies pulled from the rubble today. This is after Israel fired at least 200 rockets overnight into the densely populated area in retaliation for the atrocities committed by Hamas over the weekend. As CNN's Ben Wedeman reports, top Israeli military leaders say it's nearly impossible to determine if they are striking Hamas or innocent civilians as Hamas embeds itself within the Palestinian population. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Gaza City neighborhood once known as El Raml (ph), the sands, reduced to ashes. Its residents retrieve what they can, which isn't much. Israel continues to pound this strip, targeting it says Hamas infrastructure. Residents in shock are asking why? I got married this year, says Yahya Al-Ahwal. What did I do? What have we done? You destroyed an entire neighborhood. He says he never fired a rocket. And this is one of the most densely populated patches of land on earth, bombs crashing into crowded neighborhoods, rarely differentiate between fighter and civilian. The death toll rises by the hour, while Gaza's hospitals are overwhelmed with the wounded, including infants. Around 40 percent of the population of Gaza is under the age of 15, according to the CIA. The information ministry in Gaza reports that nearly 170 buildings have been destroyed and more than 12,000 residences damaged, and tens of thousands have fled their homes seeking shelters in the U.N. schools converted into shelters. And an oven in this bakery in Gaza City is shut down, many of the shelves empty. Life here was already difficult and now the future looks bleaker than ever. Gaza will take five years to raise its head after this, says Wahiba Sirsawi. And after five years, there will be two or three more wars. It's a catastrophe. And amidst all this, somewhere in Gaza, Hamas knows there, are more than 100 Israeli captives with fates unknown. Tuesday afternoon, Israel struck Gaza's the only port used principally by fishermen. At the same time, Hamas unleashed a massive volley of rockets toward Ashkelon. The abyss approaches. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Lots of people, we saw a fifth of the Israeli population had beef with the Israeli government but it should be easy, especially with the details coming out to condemn terrorism and terrorists and Hamas is a terrorist organization, they do not represent all Palestinians. We shouldn't connect those two. So, I -- to me, I think that was the hardest part, not just about that statement but a number of statements that have come out from organizations and individuals. I don't -- I don't question whether someone has the right to be angry at the Israeli government, I question their inability to condemn grievous, grievous violence and that's what I think has been difficult.",

There is no safe zone as this was an open space. We were basically in the desert with some eucalyptus trees. We lied on the ground and tried to find shelter, but we realized there is no way to find shelter in such a great open area. While the security personnel on the festival started to aim us to leave the space and to start to escape, me and my friends were probably the first group of people who realized we need to go into our vehicles to start the engines and to flee out. Now, this was a festival attended by thousands of people, 3,500 people were there, not just Israelis. This festival was also inviting a lot of global guests in collaboration with a Brazilian festival, so there were a lot of foreign people attending. Many of them didn't know even what to do. They didn't understand what is happening, as us Israelis, we are kind of used to rocket attacks in Israel. So we know what we should do. Anyways, me and three of my friends, we met by our camping site, and we started to run towards our car, actually my car is quite a new vehicle. I'm a tour guide. It's a four-wheel drive that I'm using to drive my tourists from place to place, and this vehicle failed to start, which later on possibly saved me from something else. So we were basically escaping from the rocket attack and we made our way out, so we had to drive a bit on the -- not on the paved roads, and we found a way out towards the roads in the Gaza envelope area, while my friends asked me where I'm aiming towards, I told them I'm aiming away so if rockets are coming from southwest, which is the location of Gaza on the map of Israel, I'm driving to northeast towards the rising sun. And over there we found after maybe 10 or 15 minutes' drive, while trying to call to our friends, which were on their way, they told us that they are in a shelter but there are shootings. Now, we didn't realize yet that those shootings were not rockets. They were meaning gun shootings.",

We didn't even realize what just happened to this car. I imagined that this car was hit by a rocket. Later in time after realizing what really happened at the festival, we understood that most likely one of those pickup trucks that possibly you have videos of that were carrying terrorists from the Gaza Strip into Israel, they were driving on that road possibly a minute or two before we took this road, and they shot down the vehicle and all the people that were there. Possibly they even manage kidnap some of the people. We saw only one body, and it was not the driver. It was by -- the driver's passenger.",
