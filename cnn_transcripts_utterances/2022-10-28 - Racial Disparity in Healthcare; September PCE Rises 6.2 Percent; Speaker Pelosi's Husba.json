Dr. Narula, this is so alarming. You're a cardiologist. Tell us what this study found. DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Brianna, we know that there are definitely racial and ethnic disparities in this country when it comes to health care outcomes and even treatment. And so, in fact, we also know that for black and Hispanic Americans the survival for out of hospital arrest is much lower. But the question is, why. And so researchers looked at, could it have to do with how often they received bystander CPR. So they looked at over 100,000 out of hospital cardiac arrests that were witnessed from 2013 to 2019. And, in fact, they found, if you were black or Hispanic, your rate of getting CPR that was done by a bystander was about 26 percent lower if the arrest occurred at home and 37 percent lower if it occurred in a public location, which really surprised them. They actually thought if it was in a public location, those numbers might be lower because there's so many people around. It also had nothing to do really based on the neighborhood, whether it was a black and Hispanic neighborhood, a white neighborhood, the income or what type of public location, public transportation or a workplace. So, really alarming and definitely, obviously, something we need to work on improving.",

      "sentences": "Well, there's certainly a question of implicit conscious or unconscious bias and whether people make assumptions when they see a white person collapsed on the ground versus somebody who may be black or Hispanic. There's also issues around CPR training and education in black and Hispanic communities, which may be much less also -- less available CPR that's done by dispatcher assisted CPR.And then, what about the mannequins and the videos that we use to teach CPR. Most of them are white males. So, we really need to work on getting this to people where they are in their communities, whether that's churches, schools, in sort of a culturally, language appropriate way. And, finally, I'll say, there may also be issues with fear and distrust and even calling 911, you know, because of distrust of what might happen with that approach as well.",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, there's over 350,000 out of hospital cardiac arrests a year. We know that the chances of survival in general are about 10 percent. And every minute that goes by that you are not performing CPR, someone's chance of survival drops by about 7 to 10 percent. Three quarters of these arrests occur at home. So, imagine you're at home and somebody goes down in front of you. So, you really have a great chance of improving someone's chance of survival and functional neurological outcome if you know how to perform bystander CPR.And it's very easy. The American Heart Association has great education videos about hands only CPR. So a lot of people think, I have to do mouth to mouth. That's not the case. Actually, the outcomes with hands only are just as good. So, people can think about, you know, doing hands only CPR to the tune of \"Staying Alive,\" which is about 100 to 120 beats a minute in the center of the chest. You Put your hands, you push down pretty strongly for about two -- two inches deep. But it's really important because, in general, only about 46 percent of Americans get bystander CPR if they have an out of hospital arrest.",

But what we haven't been able to prove definitively is, if we lower it with antihypertensive medications, can we reduce the risk of dementia? And so this research study basically took five trials, grouped them all together. They looked at about 28,000 people, followed them for four years. These were people average age of about 69 in multiple countries. And they found that, yes, in fact, if you're able to lower the blood pressure with blood pressure medications, even by 10 points, the top number, and four points the bottom number in that first year, you're able to lower the risk of dementia by about 13 percent.So, you know, this is really a great lesson for people about the value of lowering blood pressure, not only for heart attack and stroke, but potentially for lowering dementia risk. Now, we don't know if there's certain antihypertensive drugs that are better, if there's certain ages where this should be started or even if somebody has a normal blood pressure if we were to lower it could we reduce the risk. So, still lots of questions that we need to answer with research, butt his is definitely a big step forward.",

I think this number will pretty much bolster the Fed in its decision to raise interest rates. You've got the September PCE, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, up 0.3 percent from August to September. That matches the prior month's growth. And year over year up 6.2 percent. So you can see that again is exactly what it was the month before. So, 6.2 percent for consumer inflation. Those are still numbers that are running pretty hot and uncomfortable. The Fed is trying to, you know, get this inflation so it's not entrenched in the overall economy. So the final reading of consumer inflation really before the Fed's next meeting. And when you look at the core rate, the year over year core rate, a little bit hotter than the prior months. So, again, that shows you the six-months now of Fed interest rate hikes have not been able to dislodge this inflation.

The assailant is in custody and the motivation for the attack is under investigation. Mr. Pelosi was taken to the hospital where he is receiving excellent medical care and is expected to make a full recovery, which is great news. The speaker was not in San Francisco at the time and they are saying that they are grateful to the medical professionals and asking for privacy at this time. I mean, absolutely horrifying, terrifying. We have been talking about experiencing sort of the violence across the board. And whether or not -- this is very clear the motivation for the attack is under investigation -- whether or not it is politically motivated, we do not know yet. Regardless, if someone like Paul Pelosi, who clearly lives in a place where I would imagine they have a pretty darn good security system, can be the victim of such a crime, it's pretty eye opening and, again, horrific.
