We have claimed Russian land. And guess what? That big beast of Putin has yet to be so angry as for these threats to materialize. So let's keep pushing Russia. Let's keep pushing on those red lines.

Moscow's troops launching hundreds of drones and missiles on Monday. Ukraine using U.S.-made F-16 jets to help repel the attack. Now, Kyiv acknowledging one of the F-16s crashed, killing one of Ukraine's top fighter aces, Oleksiy Mes, known by his call sign Moonfish. Ukraine's general command saying, quote: During the approach to the next target, communication with one of the aircraft was lost. As it turned out later, the plane crashed. The pilot died. OLEKSIY MES \"MOONFISH\": UKRAINIAN AIR FORCE PILOT: This war does not appear to end soon. If West will provide us with some additional jets, with some additional SAMs and we're really looking forward to it. I think we will be able to control our sky for a while.
