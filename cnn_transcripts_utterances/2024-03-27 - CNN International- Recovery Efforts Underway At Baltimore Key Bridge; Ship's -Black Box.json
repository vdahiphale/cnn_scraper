This is CNN NEWSROOM.Just ahead, U.S. officials say the black box from the cargo ship that struck a Baltimore bridge has been found. We'll have the very latest on the investigation what we know about those who are still missing. Plus, when the desperate rush for aid turns deadly. Palestinians have drowned in a quest to reach air drop food that fell into the sea. A full report is coming up. And a massacre that shocked the world. Hundreds of victims found in connection with Kenya's doomsday cult. Now the bodies are being released to the families. We've just learned that crash investigators have been onboard that ship that smashed into Baltimore's Key Bridge on Tuesday causing it to collapse. They managed to go on board overnight and have taken the data recorder, the so-called black box to investigate what happened to cause the ship to lose control. The U.S. Coast Guard said it is still looking for the bodies of six construction workers who were on that bridge, and they are presumed dead after falling into the water. The pilot of the ship and the police are being praised for acting quickly to stop traffic and prevent even -- an even greater loss of life. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A Russian court has charged an eighth suspect with terrorism for his alleged role in the deadly attack on a concert hall near Moscow last Friday.

And that's obviously something that they are now trying to prove. And that's why he's being remanded in detention. So, so far, what we have is we have several suspects who are in custody from Tajikistan, one from Russia, and now from Kyrgyzstan as well. We don't have so far as anybody in custody from Ukraine, which hasn't stopped the Russians, specifically, the Russian president, from continuing his narrative saying that he believes that there is some sort of link to Ukraine, even though he has now acknowledged that it was radical Islamist, as he put it, who the Russians believe were behind this plot, even though the Russians are not using the term ISIS yet. It's been quite interesting to see over the sort of past 24 hours. Where on the one hand, you had an ally of Vladimir Putin, Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko come out and say that he believed or seemed to believe that the attackers were trying to head towards Belarus, but the border was closed, and only then did they decide to try and go to Ukraine. Whereas, you have some hardliners who are very close to Vladimir Putin, specifically, the chief of his intelligence service, the FSB, Alexander Bortnikov, who came out and he said he strongly believes that there is a link to Ukraine and even implicates Western intelligence services. So far, there is no evidence of any of that. We, of course, know that ISIS is claiming responsibility, has done so on several occasions and in several ways.

Already, comparisons being made to pass deadly disasters involving America's bridges. I-40 Bridge, Webbers Falls, Oklahoma, May 2002. Fourteen people killed, nearly a dozen hurt after freight barge is being transported on the Arkansas River struck a pier supporting the bridge. A 580-foot section of road collapsed sending vehicles careening into the water. Queen Isabella Causeway, Port Isabel, Texas, September 2001. Eight people lost their lives when a tugboat and barge struck the causeway. Eleven people drove into the opening below, only three survived. Big Bayou Canot, Near Mobile, Alabama, September 1993. Forty-seven people died and more than 100 injured in what was seen at the time is one of the worst disasters of its kind in the United States.

We need to assess our infrastructure.CARROLL (voice-over): Collusions, not the only cause of tragic bridge collapses. Take what happened at the FIU Footbridge, Miami, Florida, March 2018. Six people were killed after a pedestrian bridge near the campus of Florida International University suddenly collapsed. The 170-foot long newly installed bridge had been under construction. I-35 W Bridge, Minneapolis, Minnesota, August 2007. Thirteen killed, 145 injured, a major interstate at a standstill after the 35 West Bridge collapsed during rush hour. Federal regulators blame the accident partly on support plates, which they said were half as thick as they should have been. Hyatt Regency Skywalks, Kansas City, Missouri, July 1981. 114 were killed when the walkways on the second and fourth floor of a Hyatt Regency Hotel collapse due to a design flaw. It was known as one of the most devastating structural failures in U.S. history. Jason Carroll, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It is the primary drug used for medication abortions. And while a ruling isn't expected for months until June or July, a major of justices already appear skeptical of a nationwide ban or new limits on the pill.CNN's Paula Reid has more from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hundreds of protesters gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court as the justices considered the most significant abortion case simply overturn Roe v Wade. This case focuses on expanded access to mifepristone, one of two drugs typically used in the process known as medication abortion, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of abortions in the U.S. But during Tuesday's arguments, a majority of the justices appeared likely to maintain the expanded access to the drug, which was first approved by the FDA in 2000. NEIL GORSUCH, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT: We've had, one might call it a rash, of universal injunctions or vacatures. And this case seems like a prime example of turning what could be a small lawsuit into a nationwide legislative assembly on an FDA rule or any other federal government action. REID (voice-over): Shortly after Roe was overturned, a conservative group of anti-abortion doctors and advocates sued the FDA over its approval of mifepristone, and the case now focuses on FDA approval of expanded access to the drug.",

Combs' lawyers call the raids a gross overuse of military level force.CNN Entertainment Correspondent Elizabeth Wagmeister is standing by for us in Los Angeles.

      "sentences": "Good morning, Amara. So Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is facing five lawsuits with very serious allegations. Now, these are all civil lawsuits. Nothing has risen to a criminal level yet. But, of course, this investigation launched by the Department of Homeland Security and the department that specifically looks into human trafficking leads us to believe that there is something that they are looking into that was triggered by these five lawsuits.Now the first lawsuit came from the singer Cassie, back in November of 2023. Cassie and Diddy were in a long-term relationship. But when she came out with this lawsuit, she said that she suffered a decade of abuse by Diddy she has accused him of rape, sex trafficking, human trafficking. Now that lawsuit was quickly settled about overnight, but soon after, two more women came forward to accuse Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. And now again, there are five lawsuits that he is facing, including one from a woman who alleges that when she was 17 years old in 2003, that she was drugged by Diddy in gang rape. So Diddy is maintaining his innocence. His attorney is fighting back with these raids at his homes in Los Angeles and in Miami. But again, these are very serious allegations that he is facing.",

But yesterday, we were first to hear from his attorney and this is what they tell us, Amara.I want to read you some of the quote. They say, quote, \"Yesterday, there was a gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs' residences. There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated.\" [08:55:06] Now they say that despite media speculation, neither Mr. Combs nor any of his family members have been arrested, nor has their ability to travel been restricted in any way. Now this is a lengthy statement, but they ended by saying, \"Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.\" They also call this a witch hunt. And I have spoken to sources close to Diddy, who say they believe that the media was tipped off in Los Angeles that his home was going to be raided. They say that there was a local news chopper hovering over his mansion in the air before there was a breach on his home. So they are calling this a witch hunt and they believe it was a coordinated media effort. And I hear that Diddy's team was shocked by the scope of this raid. His two sons were taken out in handcuffs. And as we said Diddy was traveling with his two teenage daughters out of Miami on a spring break vacation. That is what I hear from a source and that is when he was briefly stopped by authorities at an airport in Miami and I hear that he cooperated with them and then was released.",
