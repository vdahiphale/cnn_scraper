The Dow is holding its own, but it's the bigger boys and girls that are really the -- those other markets, the events that you and I will talk about. Twin tragedies in Japan. A plane responding to a deadly earthquake is then hit by a landing large passenger jet. The fiery ball you can see is the result. Hamas says Israel killed a senior commander when it struck in Lebanon's capital in Beirut. And the president of Harvard University has resigned. Claudine Gay's embattled tenure, it's the shortest in Harvard's history. Live from New York, you and me together, Tuesday, January the 2nd. We're on our way. I'm Richard Quest. In the New Year, I mean business. Good evening. We begin with aviation authorities in Japan investigating the fiery airplane collision that which killed five people in Tokyo's Haneda Airport. The video, just there you go. That's when the 350 hit the Dash 8, and it's the 350 that continues down the runway, on fire. But as you can see the larger blaze, in a sense, is coming the Dash 8, which is just about destroyed from where it was hit. Five crewmembers on the smaller plane, the Dash 8, it was a Coast Guard plane. It was about to take off. The captain on that second plane is reportedly in critical condition. All 379 passengers and crew were evacuated from the Japan Airlines jet, the A350. Japan Airline says four passengers have been taken to a hospital. The Coast Guard plane was taking part in the earthquake relief efforts on the Japan's west coast. CNN's Will Ripley reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A Japan Airlines jet touches down in Tokyo, the cabin calm until passengers look out the windows. (SATOSHI YAMAKE speaking in foreign language.) RIPLEY (voice over): \"We saw fire coming out of the engine. And I found it's strange,\" Satoshi Yamake tells CNN. Within seconds, black smoke billowing throughout the aircraft. The Airbus A35-900 packed with nearly 400 passengers and crew, including parents with young children. He says some passengers were scared, especially the kids and women. The scene outside, even scarier. People on other planes captured the chaos.",

Haneda Airport in the heart of Tokyo, handling extra holiday traffic, and a Japan Coast Guard plane with six crewmembers, carrying badly needed relief to parts of Japan jolted by a massive 7.5 magnitude earthquake. The quake, causing widespread destruction, dozens of deaths just hours into the New Year. Japan's transportation minister says the two planes collided on the runway. The Coast Guard captain, badly hurt; five other crewmembers killed. A very different outcome for the Japan Airlines jet. With just seconds to spare, 12 crewmembers safely evacuated all 367 passengers, including eight children under the age of two. Only a handful had to go to the hospital. Everyone walked away as flames fully engulfed the plane. For a nation obsessed with transportation safety, one question, how could the New Year begin like this? (END VIDEOTAPE)",

MINAYA (PH) (through translator): I feel like even now the building is shaking. Whenever an aftershock happens, I think of the main quake, and my body trembles. MONTGOMERY (voice over): But it's not just the tremors people here have to worry about. Other than a roof, there's little else. MONTGOMERY (on camera): There is no eating right now, so people are sleeping on mats. They're using thick blankets to stay warm. There's also no running water. So the Japanese self-defense forces are just outside of this building, handing out water to locals. MONTGOMERY (voice over): This water, a lifeline for dozens here and thousands across the region. Left without supply or simply without homes after Monday's powerful quake, the devastation difficult to comprehend at night, but clearly visible from the sky. In Wajima, the shock flipping multistory buildings on their side and raising entire blocks to the ground. Tsunami waves forcing large vessels on to the shore and fires adding to the destruction.

As you say, the first time that the Supreme Court hasever struck down a basic law or an amendment to run these quasi- constitutional laws are the closest thing that Israel has to a constitution. I think what is the most stupefying aspect of this whole ruling on New Year's Day is that up until October the 7th, this was all we were talking about in Israel. This was the most important item coming out of Israel. It was tearing the country apart -- these government's plans for this judicial overhaul. Then the Hamas terrorist attacks of October the 7th took place. And with Israel at war now for the best part of three months with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, this judicial overhaul issue has really taken a backseat. But on New Year's Day, it did move back to the front. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (ISRAEL SUPREME COURT JUSTICES speaking in foreign language.) GOTKINE (voice over): It was a bombshell. In an eight to seven ruling, Israel Supreme Court struck down legislation that removed its powers to throw out government decisions on the grounds of reasonableness. It rejected the amendment because of the severe and unprecedented blow it represented to the core characteristic of Israel as a democratic state. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had argued the change was required to restore the balance of power between the executive and court. The law was the first of a multipronged government plan to weaken the judiciary to be passed by the Knesset last year. The Supreme Court's decision could now reopen the deep divisions in Israeli society that saw the country convulsed by months of protests and even fears of civil war. With Israel now almost three months into an actual war after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October the 7th, those divisions had felt a lifetime away. Indeed, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, the architect of the government's judicial overhaul plans, assailed the timing of the court's decision, saying it was the opposite of the unity the country now demanded. Strange as the timing of the Supreme Court's decision may appear, it had no choice. Two of its justices officially retired three months ago that had until this month to submit their final ruling. When the reform was introduced last year, massive crowds regularly took to the streets to decry Prime Minister Netanyahu's plans, which they saw as a serious threat to the country's democracy. In Israel, which has no written constitution, the Supreme Court serves as one of the only checks on the executive and legislative branches of government. In an interview with CNN in July, Netanyahu rejected the notion the overhaul posed a threat to democracy, but declined to say whether he would abide by Supreme Court ruling that went against him.",

The company will instead send somevessels around the Cape of Good Hope, going around southern Africa. One of the company's ships was attacked in the Red Sea over the weekend. That has caused U.S. helicopters to sink three (INAUDIBLE) boats, killing those on board. Iran is leaning in, amidst its true intentions, sending a military destroyer to the Red Sea on Monday. Anna Stewart is in London. Just when we need more boats going in there. But Anna, let's look at this. Maersk was the first to state it was stopping going there, one of the first. Then it said that it would go back in because the operation whatever it's called was going to be put into place. That would make it all nice and safe. Now they have pulled back again.

A U.S. Navy helicopter came to the defense of a Maersk ship on Sunday. It shot at four boats with Houthi militants on board, sinking three of them. But clearly for a shipping giant like Maersk, it's a risk too far. They're going to wait and see.

We've been talking about deliveries by drones and, yes, it hasn't happened as fast as we all thought it was going to. It never does. But we all know that's where it is going to be. So this idea is you send your Zipline up to deliver medicines and it drops a parachute or something. Tell me. KELLER RINAUDO CLIFFTON, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, ZIPLINE: Yes, Richard, it's a good point. It's always easy to get excited about new technology. It usually takes about a decade for the technology to do what it promised. Interestingly, luckily, Zipline has been working with national scale health care systems in eight other countries throughout the world over the last seven years. We're really excited to be partnering with the National Health Service starting this year, in order to deliver medical products throughout the U.K. in a way that can both save lives and money.",
