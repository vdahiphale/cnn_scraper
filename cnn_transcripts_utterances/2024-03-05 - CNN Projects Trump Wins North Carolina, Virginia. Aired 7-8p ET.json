We are just moments away from the first major poll closings on this Super Tuesday, where voting ends -- when voting ends in Virginia and Vermont and just seven seconds with a combined 65 Republican delegates on the line.So, let us get now a key race alert. It is right now in the states of Virginia and Vermont too early to call in the Republican presidential nomination. CNN does not have enough information right now to call the Virginia Republican primary or the Vermont Republican primary. And both of them, it is too early to call. We can make this early projection based on exit polls that CNN and other news organizations conducted with voters in the Virginia Republican primary in the second. But first, we're going to talk about the Virginia Democratic primary. The winner is Joe Biden. CNN can project that Joe Biden will win the Democratic primary in Virginia. Now, let's talk about those exit polls because we are now, given the information, now that the polls are closed about what we know in the exit polls -- David.",

Now, this is only a third of the electorate, 32 percent say yes, in Virginia. But Donald Trump wins them overwhelmingly as you would expect. It's his movement, 94 percent. Haley only wins 3 percent of this third of the electorate that identifies as part of the MAGA movement.Let's see what else Donald Trump runs up the score here. Among very conservative voters, 28 percent of the electorate, Donald Trump, 86 percent to Nikki Haley's 12 percent. If we take a look at the non- college educated voters who were just talking about, it's roughly half the electorate, 48 percent of voters are non-college educated, Donald Trump wins three quarters of them, 73 percent to Nikki Haley's 24 percent. And then if you look at immigration voters, which by the way, 37 percent of the electorate, nearly four in ten states, the most important issue to their vote. Donald Trump wins immigration voters nearly 3-1, 72 percent for Trump, Nikki Haley gets 26 percent -- Erin, of those voters who say immigration is their top issue.",

It's way too early to say anything from this, 48 delegates at stake in Virginia. And he's up 854 votes to 306 votes.The interesting thing is they're coming in from all over the place, which means different places are starting to report in different parts of the state. Only down here in Norfolk, this is the only semi-major population center where we have any votes and we have 200 votes. So again, let's not rush. Let's not rush anywhere at this. But this is seventh of 133 counties, so semi-significant population center, most of the other places where you're seeing votes are really tiny communities. This is right along the southern border with North Carolina. 92nd population-wise of the 133 counties. So it's down there. But that's why it's 16 percent of the vote, right? You're not going to get a ton of votes here in Brunswick County. But this is -- this just a test for Donald Trump. Are your people coming out when that is one of your challenges? If you look at all the prior contests and you're Republican voter, you're Trump voter, you think he's marched into the nomination. If you're having a busy day, do I -- do I go -- do I vote? So Trump voters do tend to come out. I do think for all we focused on, can Haley turned out in the suburbs? You know, what about the uncommitted vote against Biden in a couple of states tonight. Trump voters are motivated even when he's won six, seven in a row, and he's on a march, they're coming out. And that's a testament to him like it or not, that his people come out and they're committed. Buckingham County. Again, these are tiny pieces of the vote. But it does tell you, where we started to move some votes up here. You move up to Loudon County. This is -- this is a much bigger test up here. One of the fastest-growing counties in America, not just in the commonwealth of Virginia. Fourth largest of the counties, Joe Biden won this county by 25 points. Last time you were here, I think I said it was ten years. I misspoke, it was 20 years ago. The last time a Republican won Virginia for president was 20 years ago in 2004. So is it a competitive state again? Yes, it has a Republican governor. The legislature has gone back and forth. It's Democratic right now. For president, this commonwealth has told us for 20 years now since 2008, Barack Obama's first win, we vote Democrat. So one of the things as we watch tonight, how strong is Trump? What does Haley do in the Commonwealth of Virginia? Is there any signs -- any signs that because of Biden's early weaknesses in the race, because of inflation, his approval rating, the Republicans somehow could stretch the map. Most campaigns would tell you, don't waste your resources, focused on the five or six days we think you're going to settle it, but a bigger map, if you have the fundraising is a strategic advantage, if you can contest the places. As we were standing here, you see more votes coming and you see some tiny votes coming in for Haley. Let's just come down here. It's the city of Fredericksburg, again, it's, you know, 0.3 percent of the state population. So, but, you know, if you're Nikki Haley, you're trying it's a suburban area. You're trying to see there and you see some others, Roanoke, which is a city area here. This is Roanoke City in the city of Roanoke, 177- 163, very, very early returns, but if you're -- if you're, if you're at home and you're thinking is Trump just going to march or is Nikki Haley going to find at least one or two, three more places, five more places to put up a fight, this is one of the potentials. We'll watch as the results come in. Trump has weaknesses in the suburbs. Trump has giant strengths in the so many rural counties here in Virginia. So, if you're sitting at home saying is to Republican race over tonight? Vermont and Virginia will give us very early clues on the East Coast.",

Now, when you're looking at North Carolina, one of the things that this could pose a problem for Donald Trump in is with educated voters. I want to read you this statistic here because we know that that's a problem for Donald Trump already, the percentage of the population with an undergraduate degree or higher is growing faster in North Carolina than in any other state. So that could be a problem for him. The other piece that they're watching is how do those suburban voters, particularly the suburbs of Charlotte and Raleigh, how do they turn out, how do they vote? Where are they headed? Where their heads out? Because that is what they're going to try to see if that area, those areas are where they should be pouring more resources into.

Robinson has made disparaging remarks about LGBTQ+ people. Also, he has a streak of antisemitic remarks, even dabbling in Holocaust denialism.

Obviously, if he can do that, that helps him tremendously in a state like North Carolina, which is a more diverse electorate.

So, you know, if the Biden campaign, you know, even on the back of a Republican gubernatorial candidate who's very off-putting, can force the Trump campaign to play in North Carolina when they otherwise might not have.
