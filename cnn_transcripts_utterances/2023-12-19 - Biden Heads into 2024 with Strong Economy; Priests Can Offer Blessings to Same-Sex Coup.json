      "sentences": "Really the strongest card that they have and they absolutely should play it.However, the real question of the 2024 election is going to be the economy. Barring anything, you know, catastrophic, like another pandemic or something like that. But the problem is that the Biden campaign really can't take credit for the economy right now. So, let me explain how that works. The economy, by all accounts, the market is saying that the economy is coming back, it's stronger, it's looking better than ever, but the reality is that the people are not making the connection between the market doing well and how they are experiencing the market in their day to day lives. So, inflation is still hitting the audiences that Biden really needs to come together, the coalitions that he needs to support him in order to win this race. Battleground states, Latinos, black voters, Asian voters all report that they are deeply unhappy with the state of the economy. This in despite - this despite what the actual numbers look like. So, I think part of what the Biden campaign has to do is figure out how to, yes, run with the strongest thing that they have, but how do they begin to tell a story that says, we are responsible for this economy but also you should be feeling something, and these are the things that you should be feeling positively in your pockets, otherwise they are going to be dealing with really a defeated coalition and a coalition that is really still feeling the hurt of these kind of lingering questions of inequality and inflation and high rents.",

      "sentences": "Errol, can we dig more into that because, to Leah's great point, you look at the top line numbers, inflation is at 3.1 percent, down from 9.1 percent, unemployment rate, 3.7 percent. When the Fed started raising rates, it said it would have to go to 4.5, 5, something along those lines. The Fed probably done hiking interest rates. Talking about three cuts next year. Financial markets at or near all-time highs. I'm old enough to remember when a recession was a certainty in 2023 and we've got, what, 11, 12 days left. Don't think it's going to happen. And yet, to Leah's point, what are they missing? What's not connecting right now. ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATORlook, what -- what's not connecting is the people's perception, their everyday life. I mean we've talked about this a lot when it comes to inflation. Yes, it's not getting higher, but the prices haven't come down per se. So, the rate comes down but the prices stay high. And so people are still sort of feeling that pinch. People still have a lot of questions as we're going through this enormous transition. I mean, look, the pandemic and the transformation of the economy to sort of work from home for a lot of different professions that went away and some new ones that came online. The other big transition, of course, is we're trying to move toward renewables. And so there are a lot of new jobs there but there were a lot of old jobs that went away. So, there's a lot of uncertainty. There's a lot of turmoil. I think that's what people are expressing when they're talking to the pollsters. The Biden team, of course, has to try and take credit for what's good and also ask people to be patient with what's bad. And that's the part I think that they're missing. I mean, listen, we saw Bill Clinton do this. You know, he convinced people to give him a second term, among other things, by saying, I will fight until the last dog dies. I'm on your side. We're going in the right direction. It's not fast enough, but stick with me, we're going to get there. I don't hear that messaging coming from this campaign.",

But the other issue, in addition to abortion and the economy, is, I think, democracy. This was the argument that Biden made in the midterms in 2022. A lot of people dismissed it, said there was a red wave, it was a bad idea. It wasn't. And I think especially campaigning against Donald Trump, that could have resonance as well. So, it's not one issue. And I agree they've got to get better about messaging and the reality of the economy for middle class folks in particular.

Quote, \"the request for a blessing expresses and nurtures openness to the transcendents, mercy and closeness to God and a thousand concrete circumstances of light, which is no small thing in the world in which we live. It is a seed of the Holy Spirit that must be nurtured, not hindered.\" Those words mean so much for so many people in this country and around the world. KATEI MCGRADY, HOST ON SIRUSXM'S \"THE CATHOLIC CHANNEL\": Yes. Yes, I agree. Good morning. I think what the holy father is doing, and as he has done for the past ten years of his pontificate, is remind us that the church is a home and that we are invited to be in this home. And I think yesterday a lot of interpretation was done around, well, this is a massive shift. It's not a doctrinal change. We need to make that perfectly clear. It is an invitation to individuals to recognize the church wants to welcome you to God's love and mercy. And the clarifications within the document should be read, should be looked at very closely.",

But in some places, yes, that needed to be reminded. And so I think what the - the DDR, this is the document from the decastry (ph) that makes these declarations concerning our faith, wants to ensure that people remember. That's the progression here. People remember the church is not a place where only the holy and the prized can sit, but that it is a place where all are welcome to come and understand God's love for them.
