CNN's exclusive Kamala Harris, Tim Waltz interview set to air in three hours' time. It's their first sit down interview since Harris announced her run for the U.S. presidency. We'll have a preview and reaction from both sides of the aisle. A gun battle at a mosque in the West Bank, and the death of an Islamic jihad commander will have the unfolding story with a live report. Typhoon Shanshan makes landfall in Japan, but weakens to a tropical storm. Four million people are urged to evacuate as train and air travel are disrupted. We're tracking its path. And robots usually wipe the floor when it comes to competing with humans and now, they're wiping windows too. The latest tech company promising to make easy work of a dangerous job. That conversation coming up. But first, a little earlier, Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview along with her running mate, Tim Walz. It's Harris' first major interview since winning the Democratic nomination, and we have a preview of that interview airing in just a few hours. Our colleague Dana Bash pressed Harris on why she had changed some of her positions on issues such as immigration. The vice president argues she's a reliable candidate. Take a listen.

And should they feel comfortable and confident that what you're saying now is going to be your policy moving forward? KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  Dana, I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed. You mentioned the Green New Deal. I have always believed, and I have worked on it, that the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time. We did that with the Inflation Reduction Act. We have set goals for the United States of America, and by extension, the globe, around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as an example, that value has not changed. My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed. I spent two terms as the attorney general of California prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, violations of American laws, regarding the passage, illegal passage, of guns, drugs, and human beings across our border.

They have thrown everything at her and nothing has stuck. And the reason why nothing has stuck, Lynda, is because the first time that she came out as the nominee, she came out swinging. She came out authentically. She came out with joy. She came out with strength. She came out talking to voters about what it is that she would do in a Kamala Harris administration to fight for them every single day. To build upon the massive accomplishments that she helped President Biden bring to voters in the last three and a half years. Sixty million new jobs, economic growth, inflation is down, jobs are up, the GDP is up, the stock market is through the roof. But she also understands that a lot of families are still hurting because of the everyday cost of living. So, she has made that one of her key priorities. She is connecting with voters, Lynda, and that scares Republicans to death. They are desperate.

It happened on the second day of Israel's largest assault on the West Bank in years. The Israeli foreign minister is calling for a Gaza style operation against terrorists there. But there are growing concerns over the violence, with the U.N. General Secretary -- General -- Secretary General condemning the loss of civilian's life, including that of children. Well, Jeremy Diamond has been following the developments and joins us now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (VOICE-OVER):  For the second day in a row, bursts of gunfire cut through the City of Jenin in the occupied West Bank. Israeli soldiers and border police are raiding the northern West Bank in one of the largest operations in years, triggering clashes with Palestinian militants who are deeply embedded here. Israeli forces have killed at least 16 people in 48 hours, according to health officials. Israel says 16 were militants, Palestinian militant groups said just eight of their fighters had been killed. In Jenin, Israeli forces have surrounded several hospitals. Ambulances must stop and be inspected before taking patients in for treatment.

DIAMOND (voice-over):  Suzanne Jalad (ph) and her grandchildren were woken by the sound of bulldozers and gunfire at 7:00 in the morning. It was loud, very loud. Everybody was terrified. She says this Israeli operation is different from the regular raids this city has grown used to. They want to take revenge, she says. From who, I ask? From the resistance. We stand with the resistance and hopefully we will stay standing and steadfast. Israel says it is targeting militant groups who have mounted dozens of attacks against its soldiers and civilians. The Palestinian city of Tulkarm, Israel killed one man, it says, was behind those attacks. Mohammed Jabber, an Islamic Jihad commander. But at Al-Razi Hospital in Jenin, the victims of Israel's raids are also children, like 15-year-old Osama (ph) who tried to leave his home to buy bread.

And first and foremost, we have a tremendous amount of respect for the men and women that do -- that arewindow cleaners completing this very tough task in variable weather conditions. We do hope that we can promote safety and new and innovative ways with our technology, but at the end of the day, we still have human window cleaners on site. They're just rather than being on the scaffolding, they're standing on the rooftop safely, monitoring the system and we're training them and upscaling the current labor force to be able to handle this new way of completing the same task.",

Again, all we're doing is introducing a new way to complete the task. And the existing labor force, if you look at the statistics across the United States, you have 75 percent of window cleaners above the age of 40, only 9 percent between the ages of 20 and 30. And when you consider about -- you know, just how this job is performed today at heights, variable weather conditions, manual labor, you can understand why maybe that next generation isn't showing up at the same rate. So, we do one day hope that we can actually turn that, you know, valve back on, create much more interest in this job function and really make sure that these underlying assets that we're cleaning remain pristine and, you know, are cleaned at a high level forever.",

Michael O'Leary told TheDaily Telegraph that passengers should be limited to two drinks per person while at the airport. O'Leary says this will help reduce the amount of unruly passengers and violent outbursts. He says his Ryanair crew members have seen a, quote, notable rise in bad behavior, which he attributes to alcohol consumption. Well, now to a mountaineer who wants to make history at just 18 years of age. Nima Rinji Sherpa has already climbed 13 of the world's highest peaks. And on his next trek, he could become the youngest person to summit all 14 mountains that are 8,000 meters or higher. That's almost five miles above sea level. But he says it's not just about breaking records, it's about inspiring young people and showing them what's possible in the world of mountaineering. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KINKADE (voice-over):  Step-by-step this teenager is on his way to making history. 18-year-old Nima Rinji Sherpa is setting his sights on the highest peaks in the world. After reaching 13, he's aiming to become the youngest person to climb all the 14 mountains above 8,000 meters. Even though he comes from a community of mountaineers, this is still a big deal.",

You know, like --because before this, you cannot -- you can't imagine a teenager doing the 14 peaks, you know. KINKADE (voice-over):  Sherpas are an ethnic group native to the valleys around Mount Everest. And they're often guides for mountaineers in the Himalayas. They carry large loads like equipment and food, fixing ladders and ropes along the way, always a dangerous feat. And climbing such incredible heights also brings great risks. Avalanches, exposure and high-altitude sickness can easily take over and can be the difference between a successful summit and never reaching the peak. But Nima Rinji Sherpa says his mental state is what keeps him focused and calm. N. SHERPA:  I've kind of convinced myself, you know, like to be normally in the mountain. Like for example, when I see avalanche or bad weather or when there is an accident in the mountain, I'm not in a hurry. I don't get like nervous or something like that. KINKADE (voice-over):  Despite growing up in a family of mountaineers, Sherpa never wanted to follow in their footsteps, until just two years ago. His father, owner of Nepal's largest mountain expedition company says, for years, he's been preparing his son for a moment like this.",
