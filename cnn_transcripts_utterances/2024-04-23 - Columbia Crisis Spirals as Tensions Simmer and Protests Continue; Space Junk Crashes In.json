      "sentences": "All weekend long we have seen demonstrations supporting the Palestinian people both on and off theColumbia University campus here in Manhattan. Behind me, the one that`s actually off campus, you see students able to only make their way up to the fence as the campus itself remains restricted with access only allowed for students and staff because of these ongoing demonstrations. On campus, there is still what`s referred to as the Gaza Solidarity Encampment that continues to grow. A collection of people that have been gathering on the campus south lawn with that unified message, with those protesters on the outside of the campus calling on Columbia University to divest from companies with Israeli connections. The question now though is exactly how long those protesters will be allowed to remain on the Columbia University given that it was just a few days ago. The university officials called on the NYPD to make their way onto campus to clear out that encampment which resulted in well over 100 arrests and some student suspensions. The question is, are we bound to see that yet again? Now, over the weekend, I had an opportunity to visit that encampment and things were peaceful as security looked on and really university officials not really intervening at this point. But also over the weekend, a separate vein in which there are now growing concerns among Jewish students, some Jewish students attending Columbia University, many of them saying that they feel unsafe coming to school because of these ongoing pro-Palestinian protests. So much so that Rabbi Elie Buechler with Columbia University`s Orthodox Union Jewish Learning Initiative reached out on Sunday morning to well over 300 Jewish students saying that it is best that they simply stay home until Columbia University and the YPD do more to make sure that they feel safe. Now the university for its part released a statement over the weekend saying that they are acting on these concerns. And they also added that students do have the right to protest on campus so long as those demonstrations do not interfere with campus operations. And also that they do not intimidate any of their fellow students. Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

If you chose working satellites, you are cosmically correct. Space waste is any debris left behind by humans like an inactive satellite or tools dropped by astronauts. A working satellite, not considered debris. There are thousands of pieces of space junk floating above our heads right now up in outer space. We are talking rocket parts, broken down satellites, pieces of satellites that may have collided and much, much more. In 2021, NASA threw out 5,800 pounds of garbage from the space station and the belief was that it would burn up as it entered the Earth`s atmosphere. But as CNN`s Alex Marquardt explains, things have not gone as exactly as planned. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "When it comes to Earth`s orbit, scientists are saying that cosmic clutter, as it`s known, isgetting worse. Space trash, broken satellites or leftovers from rocket boosters as well as junk from the space station. That`s all a growing problem, they say. NASA estimates about 100 million pieces of space junk are hovering over our heads as we speak. On Monday, NASA confirmed that this piece of space junk, which reentered the Earth`s atmosphere and came crashing into a home in Florida last month, was trash from the International Space Station. Joining me now is Terry Virts, former NASA astronaut and a retired U.S. Air Force colonel. Colonel, thanks so much for joining us. Isn`t the expectation that this trash is just going to burn up upon reentry so that it doesn`t hurt anyone? COL. TERRY VIRTS (RET.), FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT: Well, that`s the hope and NASA had done analysis on this piece that they thought it would burn out. But if you look at it, I remember seeing it. It`s basically the size of an SUV. So I remember thinking, wow, that`s a pretty big thing. I bet you parts of it will -- will make it through. And a lot of space debris does make it down to earth. Usually it ends up in the mountains or usually it`s in the ocean. And so this one was just so big and unfortunately it landed at a house in Naples, Florida.",

And because the schedule got reworked, it was like the odd man out, so they didn`t have anything to do with it. So they released it after analyzing, hoping that it would not make it back to earth. And you know what, luckily, knock on wood, it didn`t hurt anybody, but it did unfortunately go through the roof of that house.",

These pieces are going many miles per second.They`re all going in different directions. It`s a tough problem. What we`re doing is we`re just trying to avoid it. So when I was on the space station as commander in 2015, we actually had to maneuver to avoid some debris that the Chinese had created. They did a military demonstration. They exploded a satellite, and that debris still causes a space station to maneuver usually once or twice a year. So military explosions and space are really, really bad idea because that debris will last for years, or sometimes centuries if that`s high enough. And the only thing you can really do is track it and maneuver to avoid it. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
