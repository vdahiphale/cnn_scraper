How it came to be at long last and how it almost didn't.Also tonight, more breaking news as the Biden administration prepares to impose new sanctions on Russia over the death of Alexei Navalny and the former president is still not criticizing Putin. My conversation with Trump's former top Russia expert, Fiona Hill. And later, Trump wanted another month to pay that massive civil penalty for the business fraud he committed. Now the judge has ruled, the answer is no. We begin tonight with breaking news that has not happened since Richard Nixon was president. For the first time since Apollo 17, back in December of 1972, an American lunar lander has touched down on the surface of the moon. We're expecting any minute, we're told, the first images coming in from the Odysseus lander, from a spot just north of the moon's south pole. Odysseus lifted off seven days ago. It is the first privately built vehicle to make the mission. And like the Apollo 11, its descent to the lunar surface included some last minute technical difficulties to overcome. But just like Apollo 11's Eagle, Odysseus has landed. Here's what it looked and sounded like in Houston. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The big question now is what condition is this lunar lander in and can it send back pictures? We're still waiting on those first images. One taken by the lander itself and then another one - there's a little camera that popped off - called the EagleCam - it popped off of the lander shortly before landing and so we should be getting images from that as well. That's what we're waiting for. But the fact that this spacecraft has even touched down on the surface of the moon and did transmit that signal is a pretty tremendous accomplishment in and of itself. The first time a private company has ever done this. The first time an American-made spacecraft has done this since 1972. And Anderson, it's the first time that any spacecraft has touched down on the south pole of the moon, a critical spot. They think that's where ice is, water. It's where NASA wants to build a lunar base for Artemis astronauts, the first astronauts to return to the moon since the Apollo program and it's where China wants to build a base as well.

How difficult is it for a team on the ground to affect what's actually happening in space?MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Yes, that's kind of the frustrating, challenging thing and this is why engineers get in this racket. What's interesting about a team like this is the approach is to just work the problem, just keep working the problem. Something comes up, you work it. You don't sit on your hands and wait for things to happen. You come up with alternatives. And when you think about Apollo, what are you - everybody remembers Apollo 11, the first moon landing. What's the next one they remember? Apollo 13. That was, by all intents and purposes, you could call that a failure. You could call it NASA's greatest triumph, which is what I would ascribe to, and that was because of this very fact, you had an engineering team, the best of the brightest, coping with the situation in real time. And to the extent that this vehicle is on the surface, we're going to give it a victory. Maybe it's not - we're not going to give this landing a 10 from the Romanian judge, they didn't quite stick it. But they're on the surface of the moon and we've got to give them all credit for that.

And so he was actually able to take control of the lander and move it to a safe spot.On these robotic spacecrafts, you can't do that. And so 21st century modern lunar landers are using things like cameras and sensors to figure out where to land. And so this LIDAR was using lasers to ping the laser beams off the surface of the moon to try to figure out some of the best spots, safest spots to land. And so that - we don't know what the problem was, but that was the instrument that had a problem. And like I said, Anderson, it just so happened that NASA had this other experimental LIDAR payload that was already on board the lunar lander, and they were able to use that to help figure out exactly where this spacecraft should land.",

Anderson, I should note that the company that designed that EagleCam, they say that the EagleCam is intact and working.

Now, the Treasury Department is saying that they'll target what they call Russia, its enablers and its war machine. They follow the arrest in Russia, a Russian-American dual national, the murder of a Russian defector in Spain and, of course, the death of Alexei Navalny.Late today, we learned that Russian authorities put yet more conditions on Navalny's mother in exchange for releasing his body to her. Navalny's widow and daughter, meantime, met today in San Francisco with President Biden. According to the White House, he expressed his condolences as well as admiration for Navalny and characterized tomorrow's new sanctions as major. Gentler words than the president used at a fundraiser last night, quoting him now, \"We have a crazy S.O.B.,\" the President said, \"that guy Putin and others - and we always have to be worried about nuclear conflict. He added that the existential threat to humanity is climate. Responding today, the Kremlin spokesman said, quote, \"Clearly, Mr. Biden is demonstrating behavior in the style of a Hollywood cowboy to cater to domestic political interests,\" which is really kind of the thing anyone familiar with the Cold War will recognize, that sort of language. What is unrecognizable, however, in Cold War terms is an American presidential candidate, a Republican, no less, refusing to criticize a Russian leader.

I mean, this is a guy who could rally 10s of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people on the streets of Russian towns and cities when he was alive. And the concern, I think, for the authorities who don't like dissent and have tried to crack down on it is that his funeral, a public funeral, could be a focal point for anti-government protests.

I think everybody has agreed on one thing, which is the body is going to come back to this area, to Moscow, to be buried. And so, look, we're expecting that decision to be made very shortly. The authorities said a couple of days ago they needed two weeks to conduct medical tests, autopsies, post mortems on Navalny's corpse to find out the cause of death. But it seems that that situation has now been resolved, at least officially. And so it could be any day now that the body is handed over to the family and that funeral takes place. And it could be a private secret funeral that we won't hear about until it's actually finished. I mean, that was the situation, you'll remember last year with Yevgeny Prigozhin, when he was sort of secretly buried in the city of St. Petersburg.

That's what an alliance is supposed to be about.And frankly, President Trump has been threatening the integrity of Article 5 going right back to the beginning of his presidency, where he didn't actually want to invoke that commitment in his very first address at the NATO headquarters.

And this week, Russia raised their flag over the tiny Ukrainian foothold of Krynky. Kyiv denied they'd taken it and said drone footage showed the Russians fleeing.

The man whose house you saw blown up by what seemed to be a mortar strike essentially is a pensioner. He has nothing to fund a departure or can dream of starting a new life somewhere else. I'm standing in a building where two years ago, almost to the day, we learned of the Russian invasion across the bridge over there, and the people who run this building, they've barely left. Remember, it's not just the invasion, the occupation, the liberation, there were intense floods that ran through Kherson, too, in the height of summer, after a dam upstream in the river burst. So much damage done to this city. And I think what's remarkable standing here to think about over these two years is quite what the Russian goal is. They're really thinning out the population here through this persistent shelling. I mean, it's remarkable just how nonstop the blasts really are. It is essentially a war zone, a city that was huge, vibrant and bustling two years ago. Really reduced to a ghost at this point. You've got to wonder what Putin's end goal is. To occupy areas with nobody left in them, without basic services, without any of the real buildings standing here. They celebrated replacing the 10th, 1000th window here in the last few weeks or so, some repair workers told me. It is literally barely a piece of glass remaining. And from a basic civilian level, that's the spoils of Putin's war, it seems, even if he did manage to get back into Kherson. So much damage done to so many of these cities and towns across Ukraine because of this invasion of choice by the Kremlin. Anderson?",
