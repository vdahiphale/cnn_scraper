People might think they're swing voters or like to pretend that they are, but this polarized environment forces voters to pick a side.And I think this is about persuasion though. This campaign is about persuasion, it's not about persuading voters to pick one candidate or the other. It's about persuading them to show up to the polls. What really stands between one candidate or the other winning truly is a couple of voters and a handful of states coming down with the sniffles and staying home to cling to their Kleenex rather than voting, that will seal America's fate. That's how close this is. And so, these campaigns need to find folks who are already with them, the low propensity voters who don't always show up, who are inclined to go to the ballot box, get them to vote early, get them to vote absentee, seal in, lock it up, that's how you win.",

That's what he wants. He feeds off of that type of rhetoric, and those types of conspiracy theories, and she is going to just keep giving him the red meat that he wants, and she'll remain in that inner circle, which is a problem.

And this look that you see here is pretty much what it looks like, most of the vegetation is down, wire, the power lines, those are burnt down to as far as like the poles that are holding them up. All of this here, as well as homes that were lost in this area is just indicative of what we're seeing throughout the region. As you mentioned, there are three fires that are burning. This one is in L.A. and San Bernardino County. You also have the Line Fire that's in San Bernardino County, and you have the Airport Fire that's in Riverside and Orange Counties that is burning. These are really taxing the system as far as how they are attacking these blazes in southern California so much so, normally, they would fight from the sky and they would assign aircraft to these blazes. They can't do that. They're using them and flying them to different incidents as they need to, to drop fire retardant, to drop water. But overall, Kate, when you look at what's happening over 100,000 acres are burned right now and continue to burn as they are battling these major blazes.",

One is no one has ever used this space suit out in space before. So, it opens up a whole new capability. We haven't had a new space suit in over 40 years. So, all the latest technology since then integrated into new tech suit. The other is the SpaceX capsule has never gone down to the zero pressure vacuum of space before testing the hatches and all the equipment inside that everything worked.

So, it's sort of like being on the bench press machine, the whole time you're in a suit, in order to get anything done.
