I'm Becky Anderson live from Doha in Qatar for you.A four-day truce between Israel and Hamas does appear to be taking effect with plans for the first hostages to be released by the militant group later on today. A CNN crew near the border with Gaza reports what sounded like artillery fire in the early moments of this truce, but that has since subsided. Also the IDF reports air raid sirens in southern Israel warning of potential rocket attacks, it's not clear if there were any impacts or interceptions. Well, these are live pictures for you from that border looking across the Gaza. Meanwhile, Qatar where I am, which helped broker the deal, says the first 13 hostages are expected to be released at 4:00 p.m. local time, about eight hours from now. And Israel has agreed to free 39 Palestinians held in Israeli jails today and dozens more over the next four days. Well, first aid shipments under the agreement hundreds of thousands of, sorry, let me put that (INAUDIBLE). Hundreds of trucks packed with food, fuel and medical supplies are expected to cross into Gaza today as part of this deal. It starts with CNN's Jeremy Diamond who is live this hour in Sderot in Israel. And you and I spoke at the top of the last hour the official start of this truce. And at the time, you reported hearing explosions behind you the sounds of warfare. What are you witnessing and hearing now?",

You can still see some of the smoke in the distance from some of those previous strikes that appear to have taken place. But for now, at least calm appears to have been restored. For the first time since the beginning of this conflict really, this has been, you know, 47 days of war between Israel and Hamas. And now we are seeing perhaps a new calm being installed inside of Gaza. And if it holds, Becky, that presents enormous promise, enormous opportunity for the families of those hostages, who are still being held inside of Gaza if everything goes according to plan at 4:00 pm. Today, local time, we could see some of the first Israeli hostages who have been held since the beginning of this war enter Israel. That is the hope 13 hostages could be released at around 4:00 p.m. local time. Women and children expected to be among that group. And if this continues, of course, we could see four days of releases perhaps more after that if Hamas decides to release more hostages. Israel will exchange an additional day of ceasefire for another 10 hostages as well as of course, that three to one ratio of Palestinian prisoners being released for every one Israeli hostage.",

So, we would expect there for that an hour in we are seeing some movement dozens of trucks were lined up on the Egyptian side of the border as you can see here, at Rafah on Thursday. Ahead of that expected truce. The UN sending food, water fuel, everyday items that are needed prior to this outbreak about of the war -- about 455 trucks like these entered Gaza daily with aid supplies. Remember, many, many people in Gaza, the majority of people in Gaza need aid, use aid on a regular basis outside of a conflict. Things have got so much worse described as almost catastrophic, on the verge of catastrophe by so many agency groups. Since October the 21st, aid deliveries have averaged just 45 trucks per day, 10 percent of what is needed. Residents in Gaza say the news of a truce was a much needed relief.

They have mixed feelings, lots of issues that they want to look at to at least resume their sort of normal life. Again, we even if it's for four days is very important. As you have mentioned, the striking was constant sense 47 days. It's constantly happening. They are expecting some of them, they said my colleagues, I'm giving you testimonies from my colleagues, some of them said finally, I might be able to sleep for one night in the coming four days. Some of them were very hopeful to go back to their houses, all of them, they evacuated to the south, they were hopeful to go back to the north. But of course, this is not possible. To check on their houses to check on their on to get more stuff for their -- for daily usage, people left their homes with minimal stuff with them, because they did not expect that it's going to be for that long. But of course, this is not possible. They want also to contribute to two things, first of all secured what is missing for themselves, like my colleagues, for their families. You know, it was very difficult over the last tensely, last days to get food, to get bread, to secure cooking gas. They are so hopeful that these basic requirements will be secured. This is one thing. And secondly, to contribute to the distribution of aid that we are entering into Gaza or we are bringing from within Gaza. Of course for us as an organization, we don't know if our office is still existing or -- and we will not be able to check on it. It's in the north. We don't know about our warehouses if they are still existing, if -- or if they were affected. But what at least these days are looked at as a very hopeful moment for people to secure their needs to contribute to helping other for some it's very harsh moment because as you know, there are thousands of people who are missing, thousands of people who are under the rubble. They were hoping to go to the north they will not be able to do that to at least look for those who are missing. But for those who are in the south, for instance, they can go back to Khan Younis dig for the unfortunately bodies under the rubble, decently bury them, secured maybe as an access to hospital medical services, priority was given to saving lives and for the wounds. Now one of my colleagues, he was waiting for the moment where he can take his kids who has skin disease because of lack of water just to see by to get him checked by the doctors and this is how important it is for the people in Gaza.",

Produced in homes on kitchen tables, they can be used for reconnaissance or assault missions. Drones have become a critical component of this war, and absolutely essential to every single Ukrainian unit on the front line. And while civilians are working with private companies and the military to produce as many drones as possible, these soldiers say they are not nearly enough. As Russia's full-scale invasion approaches a second year, there is now a critical shortage of drones. China's decision to shut down exports of parts citing national security concerns is part of the problem. However, the biggest issue is Russian electronic warfare. A Ukrainian official tells CNN the military uses roughly 30,000 to 40,000 drones per month. They are cheap and expendable, but soldiers on the ground say they need at least ten times more. A grassroots army of civilians are heeding the call including Vera (ph) and Oleksandr (ph) encouraging others to do the same. Their operation has taken over their one-bedroom apartment.
