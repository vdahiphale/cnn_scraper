A new CNN KFILE report tracked down the internet history of current Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson and found he wrote inflammatory posts on a porn site message board more than a decade ago. Some of the messages include Robinson calling himself, quote, a black Nazi, end quote. Other posts praised slavery or ridiculed Martin Luther King Jr. as a, quote, commie bastard. Robinson denied the story, even when CNN laid out the details leading to this discovery.

Democrats are certainly hoping that would happen when Biden was atop the ticket in some of those key battleground states where the senators were doing well.

And then loosening the body from the wire so it can go down.We also see a second body on the roof that'll be coming up a soldier picking up the persons hands and other its feet and you'll see them toss it over the edge there and finally, there is another one where they kick a third body off the side of the building. So lots of witnesses to this, lots of videos from different angles. We're pretty sure this obviously happened.
