It is not o'clock at night at the Rafah Border Crossing where,for the first time since the war began in early October, some injured Palestinians and foreign nationals have been able to leave Gaza for Egypt. This is CNN's continuing coverage of Israel's war on Hamas. Good evening. Tonight, the IDF has confirmed that a second blast at the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza was, indeed, an Israeli airstrike. It is the second strike to hit this exact camp in as many days. On Tuesday, a doctor at the scene told CNN the first blast left hundreds wounded and dead. Israel is saying it targeted and killed a Hamas commander who was hiding there. It comes as foreign nationals and some wounded Palestinians have started crossing the border into Egypt from Gaza. Dozens of hurt and injured civilians, including young children, were taken by ambulance to Egyptian hospitals. The deal between Israel, Egypt, and Hamas to open the Rafah crossing was broken by Qatar. It is the first time civilians have been allowed to leave the Gaza Strip since the war began on October 7th. An Egyptian government official says that more than 360 foreign nationals have entered Egypt. I want to bring in our Becky Anderson joining us live now from Doha. Becky, just walk us through what we know in terms of the numbers, the numbers of people who have been allowed to leave so far .",

I was just speaking with my cousin who is in Gaza City, along with dozens of other members of my father's side of the family. They're all in the city. They were in that area that was told to leave to self-displace, but they refused. They had flyers dropped over their house, telling them if they don't leave they will be considered accomplices to terror. But they told me over WhatsApp that they choose to die in the dignity of their own homes rather than risk another Nakba or Palestinian displacement. So I was just speaking with one of my cousins there. And she was telling me that there is continuous, around the clock, Israeli artillery fire from the east coming westwards and Israeli Navy gunship fire from the west coming eastwards. And they were literally stuck in the middle between that, not to mention the constant shelling all around them. She was telling me that water is very scarce.

There is an effort to try and get a resolution passed which would echo, to a certain extent, what was passed at the UN General Assembly, albeit, a nonbinding resolution on Friday calling for an immediate humanitarian pause. This is diplomacy. Language is important at this point as countries negotiate on what that resolution might look like, what the text might look like. Clearly, there is an enormous call at present for, at least in the first instance, an immediate humanitarian pause possibly followed by more pauses. It was a UAE-led effort at the UN to call the Security Council meeting -- emergency meeting on Monday and to try to get a text tabled for a vote.

This is the second time that this happened in as many days. Israel said it killed a Hamas commander in Tuesday's strike. Salma Abdelaziz has more on the aftermath. We want to warn you though some viewers may find some of the images in this report disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Dust and debris fill the air after an Israeli airstrike. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) ABDELAZIZ (voice over): \"Ambulance, ambulance,\" calls the man carrying a child. These are the moments after the Israeli military's attack on the Jabalya camp in Gaza. Everyone is disoriented and terrified. And this is the result. Several city blocks leveled in an instant. The scene is apocalyptic. Survivors desperately dig for their loved ones with bare hands. Israel says it was targeting a Hamas commander hiding in this densely populated residential area. An IDF spokesperson called the death of innocent civilians \"a tragedy of war.\" That tragedy tearing apart this community, no one yet knows how many still lie under the ruins. Shortly after the bombs fell, columns in the enclave were mostly severed. But one Palestinian cameraman was among those able to post on social media. The anguish is heart wrenching. The victims small and afraid. Moms and dads will bury their children. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) ABDELAZIZ (voice over): \"All three of my children are dead,\" this father screams, \"all three!\" Entire families are wiped out. This man holds up the names of 15 relatives killed in the airstrike. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) ABDELAZIZ (voice over): \"My whole family -- innocent people -- are dead,\" he says. \"Total destruction. Our whole building is gone, 20 stories. This is a massacre.\" At a nearby hospital the carnage is on display. The bodies keep piling up. With her dead children at her feet, this mother prays for strength.

About 400 U.S. citizens and family members, a total of 1,000 people have been trapped in Gaza according to the secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Natasha Bertrand joins me now. What are the details here? As we understood it, we knew that there were 400 foreign nationals or U.S. citizens. About 1,000, including family members. They were not expected to be in the first phase of these evacuations. As we understand it, some Americans have gone through today. What do we know?",

President Biden has reiterated multiple times that the Israelis have been told by his administration that they need to respect civilians and international humanitarian law. It remains to be seen whether President Biden has new red lines on this, whether support for Israel is going to be waning in terms of support by the United States. The international community, as we have seen, the outrage is growing. So while some of these civilians have been able to exit Gaza, so many are still trapped there. We do expect, however, according to the U.S., to see up to 5,000 people who want to leave Gaza, who should be able to get out. Anything may change at a moment's notice, Becky.",

Thank you.In Washington, U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken, meeting with Saudi Arabia's defense minister, Khalid bin Salman, brother of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. That is due at any moment. Salman also met with Pentagon chief, Lloyd Austin. These meetings come as Israel intensifies military operations inside Gaza. Both the United States and Saudi Arabia have expressed concern that the war between Israel and Hamas could widen into a regional war. The difference between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia is the kingdom has been calling, almost from the outset of this, for an immediate cease-fire. Joining me now, Robert Jordan, former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Let's be absolutely clear, Ambassador, the kingdom has condemned, in the strongest terms, the Israeli ground operation in Gaza, its strike on the Jabalya camp and, you know, it's made its position absolutely clear when it comes to a cease-fire or, in watered down language, in diplomatic terms, a humanitarian pause. Have you in any way been surprised by how increasingly vocal the Saudis have been? ROBERT JORDAN, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO SAUDI ARABIA: No, it is not a surprise at all because the Saudis consider themselves the custodians of the holiest places in Sunni Islam. They have a broader responsibility because of that. And I think they would find it almost untenable to waffle and encourage a massive Israeli incursion (INAUDIBLE) under the circumstances. I will tell you privately that I think they are aghast at what Hamas has done. They are no friends of Hamas. And I think if you look at it, Hamas is actually making an attempt to undermine a number of the Gulf era regimes by what they have done. So I think, privately, we will see the Saudis being more cooperative. But their public statements are something else.",

Or has that, somewhat, taken a step back in light of the concerns about the potential Iranian involvement in an escalation in this region? And, on the flip side, these normalization talks that were ongoing, many people say those are now dead in the water.

What it does do is it opens a channel of communication between adversaries. I think it is useful to have those channels. To your second point, I think it is a very distinct possibility that the Saudis can play a role in offering carrots and sticks to the Palestinians. Part of the problem right now is there's really no Palestinian leadership to deal with. They have maximalist designs in the West Bank. Mahmoud Abbas is essentially a bankrupt leader with no credibility. Of course, Hamas has vowed to destroy Israel. So until there are potential partners for peace -- and I think it's going to be very difficult for the Saudis, have contacts throughout much of Palestinian technocrats, many of the members of the society. And so they may be able to help cobble together some kind of representative group that could exercise some kind of leadership down the line. I think it's premature to expect that anytime soon. I'm afraid this is going to be a long slog and very unpleasant, really terribly violent.

Not What's at stake is a huge amount of money that could be owed back to the state as the state fights for that, money, saying it is owed to them because of the fraudulent activity. They also could lose their business license, doing business here in the state of New York, their home state. So that is a pretty hefty fine, so to speak, if you are a Trump -- have Trump in your name as, of course, it's where so much of their business has been done. It's where it was started. I do want to get back to these testimony, Zain. We have to point, out Donald Trump Jr. is not the only one expected to testify. His brother, Eric, is also expected to take the stand. He is a defendant in this case. And Ivanka Trump, next week. But it's possible Ivanka might not testify. We will have to see. She just filed an appeal to sort of get out of that testimony. We will have to see where the courts land on that issue.",
