That means now that the appeals court has says no, we're not going to give you any emergency help here, Donald Trump. We now know that that means the Justice Department could try and get some of these top advisers into a grand jury asking them questions and forcing them to answer about their conversations directly with Donald Trump during the presidency.

Good to see you, sir. What do you make of it all? Your former boss, President Trump, former President Trump heading to the Manhattan criminal courthouse today to be arraigned. MICK MULVANEY, FORMER ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF TO PRES. TRUMP: Yes. Jake, I think the fines and focused is probably consistent with what I would expect. My guess is there was a short period of anger and frustration and shock after the indictment was originally handled down -- handed down and then the team led by Mr. Trump himself immediately switched into PR control, which is OK. If we're going to go to New York, we're going to make it look good for us. We're going to turn this into a PR event for Donald Trump. It doesn't surprise me that he's proposing to speak at a national address tonight. He's really good at this. He's really good -- he's a great showman. So my guess is he's tried to take this what can only be perceived as a negative and I'm sure he perceives it as a negative as well. He doesn't like being charged with a crime.

But I guess you could sort of theorize a circumstance where the trial on this particular charge is a month or so before November 2024. And if he's found not guilty, being able to turn that -- him being able to turn that into something positive politically, to make himself out to be a victim of a political Vendetta.

I would say if you had broken the law, and you had gone to jail for this, you would -- and somebody else had broken that same law, and you had carried it out breaking that law at their request, you would want that person to be held accountable.

He spent the day I'm told up in his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower huddled with, again, his political and legal advisers. But I'm also told the former president has been thinking about the other cases that are pending potentially before him, not just the one here in Manhattan, that Georgia case, a couple of cases in Washington. And how all of it will sort of play into his 2024 presidential campaign from scheduling purposes, from scheduling rallies to, you know, just simply appearing at this case here and if there are others in the future. But one adviser told me that these cases will be a constant rallying cry for him. So Jake, that underscores the point here that his court cases, his legal cases, will be a soundtrack of his presidential campaign. As we turn here, again, he'll be -- he's expected to be coming out of those doors shortly, his aides say. He's been working on two speeches. One, he is going to essentially give a one line speech.

The former president is going to need all the help he can get. Also some questions about what this addition meant for Joe Tacopina, who has been the most forward facing member of the defense team. Joe tells me he is still on the team. He expects to be the lead counsel at today's hearing, which could make sense because Todd has only been on the case for about 24 hours. But amid all these questions about who is the lead, I will note that it's the other lawyer, Susan Necheles, who has been the one who has been filing motions to the judge in this case. So look, there's plenty of work for everyone on this team. The former president has historically had lawyers who defend him in court, and then also lawyers who defend them on TV. Joe Tacopina is as someone who can do both. Todd Blanche, Susan Necheles are fantastic attorneys who can help the former president as he moves through this case, possibly even successfully.
