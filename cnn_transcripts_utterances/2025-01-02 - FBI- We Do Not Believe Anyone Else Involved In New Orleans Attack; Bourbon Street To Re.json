We certainly can minimize the harm.And I think one of the things that we should expect from the Las Vegas police is instead of them telling us, well, he could have gone down the street and killed a bunch of people, or we didn't think he'd go on the sidewalk. The -- it's sort of treating us like -- like were children. We understand you can't make the risk zero. We understand the pressures on police departments. But knowing what they knew, was the positioning of the safety and security on New Years Eve adequate? Did they believe it was adequate? And was it inadequate by 3:00 a.m.? Clearly, yes. And what happened? And I think that's -- I think that those are fair questions. I don't think we should feel defensive about it, because every city is going to have to learn from this. This is a horror for New Orleans, but it is a, you know, teaching moment, learning moment for every other city that is going to face events like this.",

It could have been nine blocks. It could have been all the way down the stretch. It is because of New Orleans police officers, who literally engaged this terrorist in a gun battle, that more lives, I know, were spared and saved.

The Army did not specifically say that Livelsberger died in the Vegas explosion. But the Army special -- he was an Army Special Forces Operations sergeant holding the rank of master sergeant, a senior enlisted rank, according to four U.S. officials. And again, we had previously reported that these officials said he was active duty, serving in Germany and on leave at the time that this explosion happened yesterday morning. I did speak with a couple of guests who were staying in the hotel across the street from us when the explosion happened. They said they were higher up above the 40th floor, and they felt the windows shaking and heard that explosion noise. They said that shortly after 9:00 a.m., they saw smoke billowing from the stairwells and the elevator doors. Elevator service was shut down for a while, and they had to stay up there. So very terrifying moment for a lot of people who were around the area. And again, as a reminder, the driver of the truck did die on scene here, and there were seven others with injuries.
