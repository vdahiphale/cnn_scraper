Speaking today in Jerusalem, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said, \"It is clear the Israelis are making a decision to act.\" What that might look like, we do not know.We will, of course, continue to monitor late developments here and bring them to you as they happen. Back home, the former president's New York criminal trial picks up again tomorrow morning. But today there was a new filing from the prosecution, laying out their intention to use his past legal run-ins to discredit him if he chooses to testify. Jury selection continues tomorrow with seven members already seated and the defendant apparently in the dark about the rules for keeping prospective members off the jury, striking them, as it's called. He posted to a social network this morning, writing, \"I thought STRIKES were supposed to be 'unlimited' when we were picking our jury? I was then told we only had 10, not nearly enough when we were purposely given the 2nd Worst Venue in the Country.\" Now, keeping them honest, here is the state law pertaining to the type of felonies he's charged with and I'm quoting now: \"Each party must be allowed the following number of peremptory challenges, 10 for the regular jurors in all other cases and two for each alternate juror to be selected.\" Now, that's something his legal team is certainly aware of. Their client, apparently not so much. Regardless, the jury selection process has been going quickly enough. We could see opening statements by Monday. More now from CNN's Kara Scannell, who joins us. So Kara - so we're going to get to the Trump complaints about jury selection in a moment. But first, talk a little bit about the information that prosecutors want to now introduce.",

One found Trump liable for sexual abuse.And among the other legal run-ins Trump has had, they also want to focus on a judge sanctioning him for filing a frivolous lawsuit against Hillary Clinton. They also want to be able to ask him about a settlement that the Trump Foundation had with the New York Attorney General's Office in which Trump agreed to dissolve his foundation. And lastly, they want to ask him about the criminal convictions of two Trump entities for tax fraud in 2022. Trump's side has signaled that they're going to challenge this. The judge said he will hold a hearing over this issue before he rules whether any of this will come in. He said that could be as soon as Friday afternoon if they wrap up jury selection in time.

I mean, it was simply not permissible. And I think prosecutors who have already asked to have him found in contempt for other violations where he's talked about witnesses, this in many respects is much more serious because judge take the jury and the integrity of the jury as almost sacrosanct.

But it's important to point out here that the politics were really driving so much of what we saw. Republicans really want some ammunition heading into November, where they're planning to make the border a top-tier campaign issue.

Rushdie went into hiding with around the clock police protection for ten years, eventually moved to the U.S. and thought he was safe.But in August 2022, as he was about to speak at a literary festival in Chautauqua, New York, Salman Rushdie was attacked by a Muslim man with a knife.
