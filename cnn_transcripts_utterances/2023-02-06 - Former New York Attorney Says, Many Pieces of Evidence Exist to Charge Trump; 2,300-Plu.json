And as we reported a year ago, some of those career prosecutors working in the D.A.'s office with Pomerantz disagreeing with him, they did not thing that they had enough evidence to prove that Trump had criminal intent in connection the accuracy of these financial statements. There were many questions about that. Now, Bragg in a statement, anticipating this interview, said that he agreed with those prosecutors, reached the same conclusion that more work was needed. A lawyer for the former president had said that Pomerantz is making these statements as a desperate attempt to sell a book, and he said that he is very much in the minority in his position that the former president committed a crime. And then one thing that Bragg, who is still investigating the former president in connection with an alleged hush money payment, one thing that he and the former president have in common is that they did not want Pomerantz's book published.

These are really vulnerable, very vulnerable population there of displaced people, and then you have got also hundreds also confirmed killed in government-controlled areas of Syria. I mean, we have heard from Turkish officials, Jim, that they have recorded more than 130 aftershocks, and as you mentioned, one of them so powerful, 7.5, pretty much an earthquake in itself, really terrifying situation for the people who are dealing with the trauma of this massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake, the situation right now really, really dire. Turkish officials are saying thousands of buildings have been damage, destroyed. We've seen many buildings also flattened. This happened pretty much in the middle of the night, at 4:00 in the morning. So, people were in bed. They were sleeping when this happened. So, you can imagine that the expectation here is that there is very large number of people expected to be under the rubble. And we have heard from President Erdogan here saying they don't really know how many people are trapped under the rubble. Of course, now, it is getting dark here, it is going to be very challenging for this very frantic and really delicate search and rescue operation that is ongoing. And then, of course, there's the weather situation. The temperatures are going to dip below freezing tonight. You have got this winter storm that is impacting Turkey especially in those parts Southern Turkey. Ice, snow making it very hard for the rescue crews, but also for the millions of people in this impacted zone who are now without shelter, because they have been told to stay outdoors, they cannot go into buildings, fears of the collapse of buildings as these aftershocks continue to strike. And, you know, Turkish officials are scrambling right now to set up the shelters for everyone.
