And he would interpret the Constitution with regard to what it says. We're looking at the 14th Amendment there.And so, the issue and the argument as it related to Section 3 is it doesn't specifically say the President of the United States. It says any federal office. And so the argument is that if those who constructed the Constitution wanted it to apply to the President of the United States as opposed to putting any office, they would have put the President of the United States. So it's a rather technical, legal argument. But, you know, it's -- look, if you wanted it to apply to the U.S. president you could have said so. Of course, the opposite view of that is any office is any office. It does reference federal offices. And to the extent that it says that, the presidency is most certainly included within that. So, yes, technical, indeed, but if you are a strict constructionist of the Constitution then you have to give that some weight. HUNT:  Interesting. All right. On another subject, late last night the first batch of these Jeffrey Epstein documents were unsealed. They are expected to include nearly 200 names in relation to this case around him. I mean, we want to clarify these names don't necessarily -- they do not indicate that there is wrongdoing here. Can you explain, I mean, why they were sealed, why they're being unsealed now, and what we should take away from this?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, sure, Kasie.So what happens is that the court has an interest, right, that is -- well, not now at the U.S. Supreme Court. We're at a district federal court. A federal court entertaining a case has an interest in protecting, particularly, victims -- protecting privacy, protecting identities of people who may have been embroiled in this. And so out of respect for them, there was a sealing of it. That means that it's outside of public view, right? Court filings, Kasie, are generally public in nature -- the court having a right to seal it. The court, however, indicating that now is the time to unseal it. And primarily, because a lot of people -- as we look at Jeffrey Epstein there we know he committed suicide in 2019 as he, himself, was facing federal charges with respect to -- you know, as we know, these underage victims and a number of things that he did that were horrific -- alleged to have done. But the reality is that a court has an interest in such protection. At this point, to the extent that a lot of these names have been out there on their own volition, a lot of this information has been made public. The court said OK, now is the time. Obviously, you have a list like this that comes out. No one wants to be associated with the list. To your very important point, it does not indicate because you would be on a list of names that you did anything wrong. But just think about the personal damage, the reputational damage, the professional potential damage, and whether or not there could be other civil litigation applying to what your involvement was. Could there be a criminal look and investigation into it? So any such list that you may potentially be on that involves Jeffrey Epstein -- that just certainly is not a good look and that's the essence of why people were waiting with bated breath to see what these lists are about. The last point, we know that just a bit of the information -- about 40 such documents, 250 have been released. I think everyone's waiting for the next, right, batch of documents and the next batch of documents in the coming days and weeks to see who exactly is on the list and what specifically was their engagement interaction with Mr. Epstein.",

CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment on this issue. All right. House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to turn up the heat on President Biden over the crisis at the southern border after the highest monthly surge in migrant crossings since 2000. Johnson saying this yesterday after visiting the border in Eagle Pass, Texas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  It is an unmitigated disaster -- a catastrophe. And what's more tragic is that it's a disaster of the president's own design. We can seal the border. We could do it overnight. The president has the existing authority under existing federal law to do that and refuses to do it. And what we see here is absolute mayhem. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's the big question, Kasie, right now.And what you heard from Speaker Johnson and the conservative members who were with him at the border yesterday was that they're really itching to tie this to the broader government funding fight. Of course, the first of two government funding deadlines is coming up on January 19. You have conservatives now saying that they would be fine with shutting down the government if the border isn't shut down. So these are some really dramatic threats we're hearing. And at the same time, Speaker Johnson is reiterating that his position is that he won't accept anything but HR2, which is the House Republican border security bill which, yes, Republicans love but Democrats hate. And when you're trying to get something to President Biden's desk that he could actually sign into law to address the problems at the border -- the myriad of problems at the border -- HR2 is not a serious proposal because it doesn't get any Democrats votes. And obviously, Democrats control the Senate. He needs 60 votes to get anything out of -- out of the Senate. And, of course, the president himself is a Democrat. And so, what Speaker Johnson is doing is consistently throwing shade at these Senate negotiations even though the Senate negotiations are really the only path right now to actually addressing the problems at the border.",

But it's also just really overwhelming some of these large cities, as you mentioned, and states that you wouldn't expect to be impacted by a crisis at the border -- states that are more interior in the country -- just because of the unprecedented flow of migrants.

They have their plan A. They say they don't have a plan B. Because they say if they stop fighting -- if they go into anything else, then it will essentially mean the end of their country. One of the other things that Dmytro Kuleba also said -- Dmytro Kuleba also said in that really interesting interview with our own Christiane Amanpour, is he believes that Vladimir Putin essentially does not want to negotiate a just peace with the Ukrainians. They don't believe in that. Also because a lot of the missile strikes by the Russians that they've seen over the past couple of days -- of course, the massive barrages that were launched here at Kyiv and other cities over the past couple of days -- some causing damage but also a lot of them really intercepted by those Western anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems. So the Ukrainians are saying that they have to continue fighting. I think one of the interesting things that I picked out of that interview is that he also said that he believes -- still believes that all of this is essentially a domestic U.S. political issue. That there really aren't any questions about the merit of continuing to provide Ukraine with weapons. One of the reasons, of course, he also mentioned in that sound bite is he said look, essentially, he believes that this is not charity but this is also an investment in the U.S.'s security and, of course, the security of the eastern flank of NATO as well, Kasie.",

Donald Trump is running on his issues, Nikki Haley is running on her donors' issues, and I'm running on your issues. And that's sort of the energy that he has been bringing where his attacks on Nikki Haley are more personal. She's funded by Wall Street. She's just listening to her donors. Whereas, with Trump, it's more trying to make these distinctions and get him to -- like, sort of egg him on to come onto the debate stage and explaining why did you do X, Y, Z with COVID and why didn't the border wall get done. And I think we're seeing this similar energy from Nikki Haley. She sort of says Trump was the right president for the right time. But at the end of the day, both of them said in recent days that they would pardon Trump if he was convicted on any of these -- any of his cases -- or criminal indictments, and that they have criticized these rulings made in Colorado to take him off the ballot there.",
