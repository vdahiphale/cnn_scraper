And it's because Trump's lawyers have asked again for the judge to dismiss this case and also to put all of this on hold because of the legal issues here, the unprecedented nature of trumping the President-elect and also facing this judgment. So it's in the judge's court now, once he gets the prosecution's thoughts to decide what he is going to do. If he will move forward and rule on this question of immunity or if things will be shelved until potentially four years from now when Trump is out of office. Dana?",

We're awaiting a decision from the appeals court on that. There's also the verdicts involving E. Jean Carroll and the sexual abuse and defamation case is a total of $88.3 million.

But the other side is maybe more difficult conversation for Democrats to have is why was there such a gap there between Senate Democrats and the nominee of their party? And we are just at the beginning of a big internal conversation. I actually think it happens faster than four years. I think it happened in two years because if Kamala Harris pulls a Richard Nixon, decides to run for governor of California, that's a two-year conversation. And who could she meet there?

BASH: Well, I'm so glad you said outside and inside game because having covered the Senate for a few years, yes, there is sort of the person who the leadership likes or the president likes, but then there's somebody who can actually do the job, which is hard and it takes talent. And it takes an understanding of legislative process and to play three dimensional chess. And a lot of the senators who are going to be voting are new and might not know that.
