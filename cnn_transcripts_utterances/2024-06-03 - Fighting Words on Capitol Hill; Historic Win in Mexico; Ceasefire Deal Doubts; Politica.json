Fauci spent a considerable amount of time denying Republican claims of a COVID cover-up and defending pandemic guidelines, and at one point, he got emotional when he was asked about the death threats that he and his family faced.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR.

Doctor, thanks so much for being with us. How do you see the lab leak theory now, and how are people seeing it sort of as a prevailing theory compared to how they did before?DR. MEGAN RANNEY, DEAN, YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: You know, we're honestly no closer to no pandemic than we were a year ago or three years ago. Might it have been a lab leak? It's possible. Might it have come from natural causes? Quite likely. Is further investigation at this point going to help us figure out? It is unlikely that spending more time and money trying to litigate the past when we know that many of those early records of the earliest cases of COVID-19 were destroyed or unavailable, it's unlikely that we're going to make forward progress. What I'm really concerned about is that possibility of a future pandemic. We have H5N1, which is already here, and we just reported the third human case. We have the ability to create pandemics in the lab, not talking about the COVID, but about nefarious actors, terrorists who can manufacture harmful viruses using tabletop DNA manufacturing technology. Those are the things that we should be talking about, how to prepare ourselves for the future and help prevent the next one, not trying to go back to something that we're never going to get the answer for.",

Should we be shutting down all research on pandemics and on possible infectious pathogens? Absolutely not. So I think this is a bit of folks seeing this for the first time because they'd never thought about it. I also think there's a political side. Unfortunately, this pandemic got politicized very early on. There was a group of people that are trying to take this origin story and turn it into an indictment of one party and particularly this one person, Dr. Fauci, and thereby are distracting again from the real question, which is what can we do better the next time?

I agree with you. So much of this has been more about the search, not for truth, but sort of for political gain, for deflection of blame when it comes to the handling of the pandemic. But even while you have some people, Republicans, who have operated not in good faith when it comes to trying to talk about what the origin story was, who have pushed conspiracy theories, there's also been this question when it comes to the lab leak, if you do get into it, that does bear some questioning without going, obviously, to those steps of conspiracy theories and deflection of blame.

The pool of 250 Delaware citizens has now been whittled down to about 25 potential jurors, and they're close to moving to the strike phase. That's when each side would be able to eliminate prospective jurors for various reasons. The president's son has pleaded not guilty to three felony charges, accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a firearm while abusing or being addicted to drugs. Questions so far for potential jurors have heavily focused on substance abuse, addiction, and gun rights. CNN's Evan Perez is outside the court and is joining us now. And Evan, we understand one potential juror remains in the jury pool despite prosecutors' objections that he's talking about his own daughter, who was a recovering addict. What more do you know about this?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Jessica. This is a retired maintenance worker who was part of this jury pool. And in questioning, during the voir dire process, he described his own daughter, who was struggling with drug addiction. And he said in response to questions, everyone deserves a second chance. That prompted prosecutors to object, trying to figure out whether to remove him from the jury pool. The judge decided to keep him inside potentially the pool. We have now, reached at least 34 people who are in the pool. After lunch, after the lunch break, we expect to get at least a couple more. And then the process will begin to whittle this down to potentially 12 jurors, four alternates. Now as you pointed out, today has been dominated not only by the issue of addiction and people who are in recovery, but also gun rights. We had one juror who, a potential juror, who said that he believed that people had a God- given right to possess guns under the Second Amendment. Another potential juror who said that she was a Trump critic who supported banning all guns, said that after Donald Trump was elected in 2016, she joined what she called a resistance group. And, of course, there's also the specter of politics that hovers over all of this. Yes, we've heard at least one juror who was removed was dismissed after saying he didn't really think he could be fair.He said he watched a lot of Fox News, a lot of Newsmax, and the judge thanked him for being honest about his biases and excused him from serving. Again, this process is going a lot more quickly, perhaps, than people anticipated. We could very well have a jury today, which means that the opening arguments of this trial could happen, as early as perhaps this afternoon or early tomorrow. Again, this is a trial that centers on the issue of gun rights, because Hunter Biden bought a gun during a time that he has said publicly he was addicted to drugs. And so that's what prosecutors are homing in on, using his infamous laptop, text messages from that, his own personal statements, his own statements about his drug addiction. And so the odds, obviously, for Hunter are against him because of all of the public evidence. And so the odds are against him because of all of the public evidence that is already out there about him discussing his struggles with drugs during the time that he owned this gun for 11 days in 2018.

Last week, you may recall President Biden framed the three-phase plan as a way to end the war in Gaza and to return all of the hostages over time. Hamas said it views the proposal, quote, positively. But then today, Netanyahu told an Israeli government committee that claims Israel agreed to a permanent ceasefire deal without Israeli conditions being met are, quote, not true. And Netanyahu is facing intense pressure from the far right of his coalition. This weekend, two ministers threatened that if Netanyahu implements this deal, they will dissolve the party that helps keep the prime minister in power. We have CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Jerusalem.

They're saying it does not appear that Israel has launched its major operation there. But politically, the White House kind of needs for Israel to have not launched a major operation there.Yeah, I mean, look, two things are happening here. On the one hand, you know, President Biden, when he laid out his red line, he talked about Israel going into the population centers of Rafah. Well, Israeli troops are very much operating in central Rafah in one of the areas that was the most densely populated of that city. Although by this point, about a million people have already been forced to flee that city as a result of Israeli military operations. Now, it is also true that the kinds of military operations that we're seeing from Israel in central Rafah are much more limited in scale than the kinds of the kind of massive ground offensive that had been telegraphed for so long by the Israeli government. We're seeing the Israeli military using a lot of special forces in Rafah, sending them in for targeted raids and then pulling back to the perimeters where they've encircled certain parts of that city. So this is not the kind of all out ground offensive that we saw the Israeli military carry out in northern Gaza or in Khan Yunis. But that doesn't mean that it's not having enormous humanitarian implications. I mentioned the roughly one million people who have been displaced from that city. Combine that with the fact that much less aid is getting into Gaza these days than was, say, a month ago. And you are witnessing enormous humanitarian consequences. In addition to all that, of course, the Israeli military continuing to conduct airstrikes throughout the Gaza Strip in northern, central and southern Gaza, which is obviously resulting in casualties, including civilian deaths.

David, great to have you here in studio with us. We just heard Jeremy really laying out the situation as it pertains to this potential ceasefire and hostage deal.

Do you think that is essentially how this is shaping up right now?DAVID SANGER, WHITE HOUSE &amp; NATL. SECURITY CORESSPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Not only is it how it's shaping up, I think it's how President Biden designed his statement. Most of the time, Jessica, U.S. government officials, when you ask them about another government's position, say, oh, that's not for us to describe. Let that government describe its own position. In this case, the president went out and gave a speech describing what he said was an Israeli proposal that the Israelis had not themselves announced. Well, there was a reason for that. And the reason was to jam the prime minister in, and he now has to publicly say either, yes, this is what the war cabinet agreed to, or no, I'm not going to do this.
