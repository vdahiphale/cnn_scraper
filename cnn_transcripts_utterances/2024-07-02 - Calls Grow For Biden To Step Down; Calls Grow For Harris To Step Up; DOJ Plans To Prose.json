Tonight, on \"Laura Coates Live.\"So, President Biden has spent, what, 54 years in politics? But he has never faced the kind of political pressure and crisis that he is facing tonight. And how he handles it, it won't just dictate his own future, but also the nation's. Members of his own party are now openly calling for him to quit the race against Donald Trump. And some sources tell CNN that they want him out not later, but this week. Now, the choice may be his alone and entirely, but there will be a lot of voices in his ear. There already are. Tomorrow, he'll be with governors and top congressional Democrats, and they want to see and they want to hear for themselves that the president is capable and has a plan to course-correct and turn things around. Now, many of them are trying to stand by the president, even as others publicly begin to break ranks and tell him to say uncle. The first sitting Democrat in Congress to do so was none other than Lloyd Doggett of Texas. He blamed it on Biden's consistently bad poll numbers and what he called the great disappointment of Thursday's debate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LLOYD DOGGETT (D-TX): I salute President Biden. I just feel that it's time for him to step aside if we were to be able to protect what he allowed us to gain in 2020, which was a victory for democracy. But he could -- he delivered us from Trump then. He could be delivering us to Trump this year if we had more of what happened last Thursday. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Donald Trump is out there, he's a threat, why so much focus on the president's age? They've also taken a lot of steps to, you know, avoid more of a focus on this.

That has now been delayed until September 18th. His legal team is actually trying to get the whole conviction tossed out. They're arguing that some of the evidence against Trump stemmed from his so-called official acts and, therefore, should never have been presented.

He just has a lot of work to do to go through each one of these convictions to determine whether or not they're related to any kind of official act, whatever that means.And I think generally it means anything that Trump did when he was president is an official act, even if it was writing a check or checks out to reimburse Michael Cohen for a cover up using hush money.
