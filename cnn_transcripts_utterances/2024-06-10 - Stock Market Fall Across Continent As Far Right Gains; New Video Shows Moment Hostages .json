Well, I think it is sort of -- firm. I think we call that a firm gavel, but a small gain on a market, a bifurcated session, if you will. Those are the markets, and these are the main events we are following today. Investors in Europe ARE nervous for good reason. The far right candidates have swept to victory, creating uncertainty in EU elections. UN Security Council has passed a US resolution calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. And Apple has just revealed its biggest push into artificial intelligence yet. Investors, it would seem are not impressed. Good morning to you live from Melbourne, Australia on Monday, June the 10th for you, Tuesday, June the 11th here. 6:00 AM. I am Richard Quest, and in Melbourne, as elsewhere I mean, business. A very literally good day to you. Good evening in Europe and parts of Asia. Good morning from Australia. It is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS tonight, live from Melbourne and we are at The Langham Melbourne here and delighted that they have given us their lobby this morning for this morning. It is just 6:00 AM in Melbourne. Now, we had hoped to be on The Langham Melbourne's delightful forecourt overlooking the skyline, but it is winter here as these pictures show. The weather was wet and windy. This was the scene just a few moments ago. In fact, it was pretty awful. For us to come indoors has to be bad. Now, we are in Australia's second city. I am here for \"Quest World of Wonder\" and that was the perfect opportunity to see why everybody is talking about Melbourne these days. Because if you look on almost any list of the world's best and most livable cities, you will see Melbourne is somewhere near the top. Over the course of the next hour, we will explore why and we will certainly enjoy Melbourne. I have my Melbournian coffee. We will get to all of that in a moment. We must turn our attention though, to the European elections. A resurgent far right has roiled markets on their first day of trading since the election results over the weekend. All the major averages across the major bosses in Europe fell as a response and as a result to Sunday's vote. The sharpest drop was on the CAC 40 in Paris, in France, and for good reason, because that is where President Emmanuel Macron has dissolved the French Parliament and is looking to form a new government in response to the drubbing that his party took at the polls. The far-right took twice as many votes. The euro is sharply down against the dollar as the centrist parties in Germany and Italy also lost ground, and exit poll shows, the far right is set to win roughly a fifth of the seats in the European Parliament. Now the EPP's center that will still have the most seats, but it means there is a different shaping of EU policy for the next five years. The far-right often serve as de facto referendum, these results shows a referendum on incumbent national governments. Anna Stewart is covering the market reaction in London, Melissa Bell is watching the political fallout in Paris. Going to start with you, Melissa, if I may. Why does a bad result in the European elections mean Macron goes to the polls when arguably he would run the other way and wait as long as possible.",

So we've seen a lot of reaction in France, a little bit of reaction in Europe, the Euro falling about half percent against the dollar earlier today, but of course, much less in terms of a real impact versus France.",

And of course, what could now happen is that you're going to have not just President Macron presiding over this opening ceremony, but a far-right prime minister, and that really would be an extraordinary symbolic change with who is leading Paris, with all the effects that we will have on the next three years and politically, economically for this country.

So they sort of get the best of both worlds, they get this very personalized digital assistant that's powered by Apple Intelligence. But they can also ask these big questions that require more computing power from ChatGPT as well. And I want to pick up on just one other really important piece of this announcement today. And that's that Apple has really prioritized privacy as part of this announcement. The company said that the majority of user queries will happen on device which means that their personal information, the questions that they're asking them, their data won't be going to be stored on Apple servers, won't be used to train Apple's A.I. models, which is something that a lot of people have concerns about in terms of how these A.I. models are trained and how their data is used. So that's a really important piece of this as well.",

Australia's GDP grew by just 0.1 percent in Q1. The weakest outside of the pandemic since '92. The Reserve Bank has kept rates at a 12-year high. Even so inflation has remained stubbornly up there.
