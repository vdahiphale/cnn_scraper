If my mom had told me that we lived in a racist country, I would have grown up never thinking I could be governor, never thinking I could be ambassador, never thinking I could run for president. But my mom always said, your job is not to show them how you're different. Your job is to show them how you're similar.And it's amazing how that lesson on the playground played throughout my life, whether it was the corporate world, as governor, as ambassador, that once I was ever presented with a challenge, if I first talked about the things we had in common, people would let their guard down, and then we could go towards a solution.",

That means that we need you even more than ever, so we can stomp it out wherever we see it. KING: Okay, I really don't want to split hairs, but the exact quote that you said was America has never been a racist country. I think that's the problem that people objected to. We're not disputing that, what you're saying about America is not a racist country.

I do think that if you look in the definition, an embryo is considered an unborn baby. And so, yes, I believe from my stance that that is.The difference is, and this is what I say about abortion as well, we need to treat these issues with the utmost respect. I had trouble having both of my children. I am very aware of what it means to go through artificial insemination, all of those things related to in vitro, I know what that is. And I also know the importance between a doctor and the parents is very important to have those conversations. This case was based on, and should be based on, the rights of those parents for their embryos, and to make sure that they have the responsibility with the doctors on how those are handled, nothing more than that. And I will continue to say, these issues keep coming up. And everybody wants to divide people on these issues. This is not the time where you divide people, you bring people together. Our goal is to always do what the parents want with their embryo, it is theirs. So, any physician that is in control of those embryos, they owe it to those people to make sure they protect that embryo. And that they do with that embryo what those parents want done with that embryo. That is the way we should look at that situation.",

      "sentences": "You know, there is a solution and that's the issue. When I was governor of South Carolina, we passed the toughest illegal immigration law in the country. We need to take what we did in South Carolina and go national with it.We need a national e-Verify program that requires businesses to prove that the people they hire are in this country legally. We need to defund sanctuary cities once and for all. We can't have safe havens. That's the incentive that makes them want to come here. We need to go and put 25,000 border patrol and ICE agents on the ground and let them do their job. We need to go back to the Remain of Mexico policy and instead of catch and release, we need to go to catch and deport. But, Charles, look at what happened last week. Here you had Congress had a bill on the border. Now, the part of the bill that was good was that it strengthened asylum laws. We need those strengthened because under the Trump administration, 3 million illegal immigrants came because we didn't have strong enough asylum laws. The part of the bill that was weak was it didn't have the Remain in Mexico policy. We don't want anyone stepping foot on U.S. soil. We have to have that policy. And they had a 5,000-person threshold. We don't even want a one-person threshold. We've got to make sure every person is vetted before they are allowed to come here. So, Congress should have gotten in a room and figured it out and not left until they got us a strong border bill. But instead they went home for vacation for two weeks, which is unacceptable. But the other side of that is Donald Trump went and told them not to pass anything until after the general election in November because it would hurt him. We can't wait one more day to secure the border. Congress needs to get in there and do their job and Donald Trump needs to stay out of it because Americans need to be protected and we have got to secure that border.

And in Iowa, they didn't give us much of a chance and we came in and we're 1 percent away from second place. Then in New Hampshire, on Election Day, they said we were 30 points down and we got 43 percent of the vote. The problem is that night, Donald Trump was upset about it and all he did was talk about revenge, and my dress, by the way. And then the next day he goes and says, anybody that supports her is barred permanently from MAGA. If you're running for president, your job is to bring as many people in, not push people out. And then you see his court cases where he claims he's a victim. The problem I have is during none of that, did he ever talk about the American people? He never talked about the fact that we were $34 trillion in debt. He never talked about the fact that only 31 percent of eighth graders in our country are proficient in reading.

Now, in our reporting, some of that is because of the indictment. Some Republicans say, oh, because he's under threat, I've rallied around him. And some of this is just because of pure viability. Republicans tell us, well, no one else has emerged. So, I guess I'm going back with Donald Trump. And so that 40 percent number that was his hardcore base at the beginning of last year, we've somewhat seen that creep up to become a little bigger now to the point where in South Carolina, we're looking at more 65 percent, right? And so, he's growing the share of Republican voters who are rallying around him, even though we know that from the beginning of this primary, there was a bunch of Republicans who were open to other options.
