You just see it falling out of the sky that way. And it's circling around. It's also kind of falling very much like a leaf as if there is nothing happening except the falling motion. One of the possibilities here that I think they're going to have to look at is what happened a year ago in Nepal. In Nepal there was an accident of a similar aircraft same make. This is a French Italian aircraft that came along in the 1980s. Similar make plane had a crash in Nepal. And what they determined afterward is that the control for the flaps which you must use to land is right next to the control that would feather the blades on a turboprop like this. When we say feather the blades you know you can see the blades sometimes are angled very much toward you. But at some configurations of flight they want them very flat like this. That's what they want to do. But you don't want that at this moment because that gives you very little forward thrust. In Nepal what they found is that somebody reached for they believe the flap control and pulled the wrong one. And it feathered the blades and they lost thrust. Now does that explain it? We don't know. You mentioned that minute and a half time there in that time. What flight control is showing is that this plane lost -- it was about 17,000 feet. The landing area here is about a half mile up. So put it 2,500 feet something like that. It lost altitude for about 10 seconds pretty rapidly. Then it went back up for about eight seconds. It stayed there for about eight seconds and then came all the way down. Is that is that consistent with what one would expect in a situation like this? If there were the feathering of the blades. I don't know. You need an aviation expert for that. But certainly it's one thing they have to look at here because this plane was seemingly doing fine up until the moment it was not. BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: All right. Tom Foreman thank you for taking us through that. We do appreciate it. So sad -- Jessica",

If you're lucky enough to own a 401k and you are brave enough I think quite frankly to hold my hang on in there this week then you've been rewarded.What's remarkable about the volatility that we've seen. We're actually going to end the week very close to where we began before that payrolls report hit on Friday. In fact for the S&amp;P 500 this week we're going to end up more than three and a half percent. It's actually mind boggling. If I look at the markets now I just want to say, shh, don't disturb anything because I do feel like we're snoozing into the weekend. It doesn't surprise me to see a pause after a day like yesterday where we had a best day for the stock market since 2022. Remember Monday was the worst day since 2022. Just take a look at tech stocks because I've been reminding people to watch these AI names. I can show you the performance that they're going to have on the weekend for some of these. It's absolutely enormous. I think we'll be able to show you that. That was what I was just mentioning about the full circle. But the tech stocks have had an absolutely blinding week a positive week. That makes me vaguely nervous that there's still volatility here to come. A case of perhaps keep calm and strap in as well as carry on -- Jessica.",

I saw that he had leadership abilities. He had just the ability to work well above his rank. And I tapped into that. Like I needed him to do a job. And I called upon him to do a job and he did it well. So and we have remained friends all through these years because of that camaraderie that we, you know, we established in the Marine Corps. I've been able to, you know, meet his family meet his wife. And so it's just that's so important to me because I've also seen other people speaking negatively. And it's just he is one of my Marines.

And that would carry so much weight for the veteran community. It's something small in words but big in communication. Right. So and again, I don't know him. I know what his record has reported to be. I can speak more confidently on J.D.'s. And I've also seen the criticism. Just going to point out that I saw yesterday where you talked about combat correspondent and that's important to me as well. And that's not just about J.D. Vance. That's about all of my Marines but not just Marines, all combat correspondents, public affairs Marines, combat camera Marines, graphic artists, all of those Marines and other service members whose job it is to go where the action is wherever that is and to tell the story. And those people there's a hall in our public affairs school called Defense Information School of 130 heroes that served in that capacity who did not make it out of a combat zone. So that's important to me as well. That's why I'm here today to represent my Marine J.D. Vance, represent his service. Probably try to send a message to all veterans, stand on your record. It's enough. But also defend those of us whose job it is to tell that Marine Corps story and to go wherever that story is.",

And I don't think that's the case at all.One of the things that I'm sure that Jack Smith is considering, given the Supreme Court decision on immunity, is whether to move to dismiss various portions of the indictment. Because the Supreme Court made it clear that there are certain parts that are clearly covered by immunity and out of bounds. And that's a threshold matter that is going to take some time. So to sort through that in and of itself, that's going to take time. The second is, what do you want Judge Chutkan to do? Do you want her to rule on the immunity claims on the briefs or do you want her to have an evidentiary hearing? And they're going to have to puzzle through that as well.",
