Carlson has been receiving celebrity treatment during his trip to Russia with state media following his every move.This of course is Mr. Putin's first interview with a Western media figure since he invaded Ukraine. But Carlson has a track record of praising autocratic leaders and it remains to be seen whether he will ask tough questions or give Mr. Putin a stage to promote his spin. To delve into this subject, Nada Bashir joins us on set. Nada, if his teaser interview, Tucker Carlson's, that he posted on Twitter is anything to go by, I mean there were quite a lot of falsehoods in that and it seemed like he was gearing up to give Vladimir Putin a platform, a sympathetic platform to make his case for this invasion.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, I mean that has been the suggestion from that teaser and in fact we have seen that really reflected in Tucker Carlson's previous interviews with other figures. As you mentioned he has shown favor in the past to autocratic figures.He has been quite open and public about his right-wing often extremist views and there are concerns that perhaps this interview will give President Putin not only a platform but we'll see him given that platform without any challenges. And of course, we've heard from Tucker Carlson with regards to this interview specifically. He has been very critical of English-speaking media outlets, how they have covered the war in Ukraine, in particular how they have approached President Putin. He has accused Western media outlets of favoring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, not giving enough airtime to President Putin. Take a listen to what he said in that teaser.

They have not been interviews. This is the first interview he has given to a Western figure, not for lack of trying of course. Many media outlets including CNN have repeatedly put in requests for interviews with President Putin as well as other senior members of the Kremlin.In fact, that was something that the Kremlin admitted to itself in response to that from Tucker Carlson. We heard from Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, who said this is simply false. Take a listen to his statement to journalists. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN SPOKESMAN (through translator): We receive many requests for interviews with the president. There is no desire to communicate with such media outlets and there is hardly any point in it. There is hardly any benefit from it. He has a position that differs from the others. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Peskov went on to say that he doesn't view Carlson as being necessarily pro-Ukrainian or anti-Russian or pro-Russian but rather just pro-American.But clearly there is a reason as to why he has been granted that permission and not other media outlets.",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianca, this is a very firm and robust response from the Pope to the critics of his move to allow blessings for same-sex couples.Now, what Francis is doing in these remarks with the Italian magazine, Credere, is basically calling out a double standard amongst some Catholics who are scandalized by the blessing of same-sex couples, but say nothing if the Pope were to bless, he says, an entrepreneur who exploits his workers. So, the point is that Francis is saying that sins of the wallet are just as serious, if not more serious, than sins of the flesh. So, I think it's interesting because the Pope has had a significant pushback to his ruling. Now, many people have welcomed it, but there have been bishops in Africa who said they will not be blessing same-sex couples. The Pope has said he understands that due to the cultural taboo around homosexuality. But I think his remarks in this magazine are really aimed at what he says are small groups of ideological critics, quite a few in the United States, who have really been very vocal against the Pope and saying that he's undermining church teaching and doctrine. What the Pope is saying is, no, I'm simply blessing people or two people who love each other. He's not blessing same-sex marriage. He's not changing the teaching on marriage. But he wants a church that's open and welcoming. Now, I think this row is going to continue to rumble on, but Francis is showing he's not going to back down.",

It's a very interesting discussion to have, especially around these notions of perceived hierarchies of sin and where cultural context comes into the discussion as well.

Global warming has surpassed the critical limit that climate scientists have warned us about for years. The EU's climate and weather monitoring service, Copernicus, says the world just experienced the warmest 12-month period in recorded history, with temperatures surpassing the dreaded threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average.
