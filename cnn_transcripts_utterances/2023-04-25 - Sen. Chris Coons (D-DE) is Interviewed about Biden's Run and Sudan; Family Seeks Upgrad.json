His advisors moving quickly to finalize staffing and operational details for his re-election campaign. Today begins a 19- month effort to convince the public of his accomplishments and his ability to serve well into his 80s.So, let's bring in not only Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, but also a very close friend and ally of President Biden. He's also a member of the Foreign Relations and Judiciary Committees, so we're going to talk about Sudan in a moment, but good morning. You're smiling. You're happy. You liked the video. But what about the skeptics? What about the polling over the weekend that shows that 51 percent of Democrats don't think he should run and half of them are worried about how old he is. What do you say to him? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Poppy, great to be on with you. This is a great morning. And I am optimistic about the 2024 election. President Biden himself often says, don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And I'll just briefly compare him to the alternative. President Trump talked about rebuilding our infrastructure. President Biden has actually gotten it done. Passed a record bill to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure, a bipartisan bill. President Trump talked about cutting prescription drug prices. President Biden has actually gotten it done, signing into law a bill that will reduce prescription drug prices for millions of Americans. Across a dozen different topics, strengthening manufacturing, dealing with gun background checks, strengthening our position in the world, investing in community mental health, things that his predecessor merely talked about, President Biden, working with bipartisan groups in the Congress, has gotten done. We have the lowest unemployment in 50 years. The private sector has created a record 12 million jobs in his first two years as president. I think when folks look at President Biden and his strong record, compared to the alternative, they will vote for him and the polls show that and show that strongly.",

You're very concerned that what we see now could become a full-blown civil war in Sudan. I re-read this op-ed you wrote, Senator, last year on foreign policy. And at that time you said, sanctions on the coup leaders and their networks will disrupt the military's revenue streams and their grip on power, creating an opening for the nation's nascent democracy to grow. Just yesterday on this show we asked John Kirby at the White House about sanctions, and he said we have a lot of tools at our disposal we're working our way through right now.

I hope that the current ceasefire will hold and that along with our development partners, our security partners, other countries from Europe and the region, we will be able to finish evacuating those who want to leave the country.But, frankly, more importantly, it's my hope that the determined work of our diplomats and some regional leaders will produce an enduring ceasefire and then allow a negotiated renewal of the movement towards a civilian government.
