President of the American Institute for Boys and Men Richard Reeves tells Hari Sreenivasan why hethinks that demographic was a blind spot for Democrats. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. It's in full swing, world leaders game planning for a Trump 2.0 new world order. In Europe, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, has called for high level meetings with fellow leaders to discuss Ukraine, NATO, and trade, calling the new political landscape a serious challenge. In Saudi Arabia, Middle East leaders are gathering to discuss their region and a potentially much more favorable tilt towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right allies, like under Trump 1.0. And in Azerbaijan today, global delegates trying to mitigate climate change at the annual COP summit remember with dread Former President Trump's pulling out of the landmark Paris climate accords, and he spent this campaign promising to drill baby drill. Even in his victory speech, he enthused over how much oil or liquid gold would be produced under his leadership. It's recently been announced that yes, 2024 has been the hottest year on record. Like last year was. And probably, like next year, will be, too. Just look at these pictures from Pakistan and India today. So, much toxic smog that it's even visible from space. So, we are joined by the Democratic governor of Washington State, Jay Inslee. He is dubbed the greenest governor of the United States, and he's dedicated much of his political career to mitigating the climate crisis. And he's joining me now. Governor Inslee, welcome to the program. GOV. JAY INSLEE (D-WA):  Thanks for talking about this most important topic. We appreciate your leadership.",

But the point I want to share with people, even in 2016, it did not slow me down in the State of Washington. We continued reducing our climate emissions and building clean energy economies unabated, and we did it because of our own policies, our own investment of state dollars and our own entrepreneurial zeal. So, we are going to continue making progress on fighting climate change, Donald Trump or no. Now, is it unfortunate that he will not have the continued investment, increased investment that we might otherwise add? Yes. But we have as much climate change fighting that we are capable of advancing on the state level as the federal level, and that's going to continue because as these tragedies unfold today, both coasts in the United States are on fire, Valencia, Spain is under six feet of mud, Nashville, North Carolina was flooded. So, as these continued to mount, there will be increasing support as there has been for climate action, just as indicated by the 62 48 38 landslide we had last week in my state. So, all is not lost. That's my message. I think it was John Paul Jones said, don't give up the ship. We continue this battle, and I hope this -- the rest of the world will join us.",

In May, The Washington Post reported that Trump told oil executives that if they raisea billion dollars for his campaign, his administration would give them carte blanche to shape his environmental agenda. So, on a federal level, what guardrails are in place to protect climate policy and prevent it being sold to the highest bidder? People are already panicked at the EPA. I mean, basically, they're saying it's the end of the EPA. And you remember what happened last time, so much deregulation in the climate sphere nationally in the United States.",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, there were some historical trends working against the Democratic nominee this year that I don't believe are going to berepeated. One is the significant inflation that took place that, as you know, was a worldwide phenomenon. Fortunately, it's coming down. And unfortunately, Donald Trump's policies could accelerate it. These massive terrorists he's talking about, mass deportation. A failure to enforce antitrust laws, giving this away to the gist of the billionaires, all of those would have inflationary tendencies. So, unfortunately, it could come back because of his policies. Unfortunately, most, I believe, or many of the policies aren't going to be enacted because of the reasons I talked about. We had an immigration situation that was very troublesome to Americans. Unfortunately, he was successful torpedoing the bipartisan solution to the border crisis, and that political gambit, which means self-interest hurt the country, but helped him politically. So, we have two things going on that surmounted some of these actions that otherwise would be important. But going forward, I really do believe you're seeing an unstoppable transition to cleaner energy. The investment in renewable energy in the last year almost doubled the investment worldwide of fossil fuel industries. Solar panel farms are going crazy. Wind farms are still increasing. We have fusion energy on the horizon. This is an unstoppable force, but we need to accelerate it. And that's why I'm glad that our state can do that with our state-led investment, like in my state, this law we just protected creates $3.5 billion of investment in clean energy. Just in my state alone. So, this revolution is going to continue. We need to accelerate it every chance we get.",

So, one very important Democrat who bucked the trend was in your state, the Washington representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, also in Michigan, Elissa Slotkin. And I think she was in a very red area. And they basically said that, A, the story of the -- you know, what the administration had done was not told right. And, B, you know, they managed to win by telling and keeping them on message in the local -- you know, their local races, and it was very hard fought. What do you think -- you know, because others have said, you know, the Biden administration or Harris or whoever was too condescending, you know, too elite focused?

And that furthermore, the Democrats have lost their traditional working class voters. And even some, you know, black voters, Latino voters, basically their traditional constituents. So, why do you think that this won't happen again? And do you think you are still the party of the working class?",

Number one, when you said solidified, nothing is solid in politics. This -- the tide goes in and the tide goes out. I lived through a drubbing Democrats took in 1994 when everybody thought Newt Gingrich was going to be the permanent emperor of the United States. 1998, I went back to Congress, I was thrown out of Congress in '94, and now I've been a three-term, 12-year, Governor of the state of Washington, which is becoming bluer over time because of the policies we've embraced. So, we will be back. That's the nature of history that it -- there are -- there's nebs and flows. But this issue about somehow losing the working class, I do not buy that. And I'll tell you why. Look, we did have losses last night, but there wasn't just the working class, it was up and down the income level. It was suburban and rural. And my assessment is that was largely because the inflation that we suffered. Now, that's interesting because, as you know, incumbent parties both from the left and the right have lost internationally because of inflation that was caused by the COVID epidemic largely. That was a one off. We hope we'll not see another COVID. But our message of job creation around clean energy, our message of increased health care for people, our message of respecting the rights of women, our message of opportunity for all, I believe will, will rise again. I believe that's going to happen. I've seen it during my lifetime and I look forward to it.",

It's a measure on the state ballot that would have canceled the tax law, that proposal was defeated by an overwhelming margin. How do you account for that? I mean, I know you've conditioned your state to understand that actual, you know, mitigating the climate is not just good for their health, but good for their pocketbooks as well.

It takes that money and then recycles itback to Washingtonians for ways to help them prevent carbon emissions and deal with climate change. With EVs and heat pumps and free bus rides and issues to try to protect their health. That's what it is. And Washingtonians rejected it, by the way, in a tidal wave, a tsunami, an avalanche of 62 48 drubbing, these people who tried to take it away, largely because it would have taken away the benefits Washingtonians are enjoying. Washingtonians were not happy that it would remove the ability to get heat pumps for lower income people. Washingtonians were not happy that it would have canceled free bus rides for everybody under the age of 18. They were not happy that it would have canceled the ability for schools to buy air filtration systems so our kids can breathe when we have this forest fire smoke. And so, this took away benefits that we have found we can help Washingtonians on both to reduce and fight climate change and help people deal with it -- with the inevitable results that are occurring. And so, it was rejected out of hand. And I'm proud of my state. Now, the other thing, my state's a very scientifically literate state. It's not a climate denier state. And we've suffered horrendous forest fires. I've seen two whole towns burn down while I've been governor of the State of Washington. We've had massive floods. We're losing 40 percent of all the glacial ice on Mount Rainier. We get it in Washington because we understand science.",

And so, what was -- what we all assumed was pleasure was in fact an act of violence. And that -- I think there's -- what I was really, really confronted by and found difficult to live with was the overwhelming dampening that that silence can do to the person who has lived through an abuse or trauma. And that, in fact, if one is not believed, that that can be as harrowing as the initial trauma when you're not believed by someone who you have finally tried to confide in.",

What we didn't expect was that actually the young women would also move away from their levels of support. And so, the gender gap actually didn't change very much. But the reason for that is because while young men moved to the right, so did young women. Now, of course, the gender gap remained. But any story about this election has to take into account the fact that the move wasn't just among men. The real danger here is that -- particularly because we had a female candidate on the Democrat side and such a sort of performative masculinity on the Republican side, that the move of men and especially young men will be falsely attributed to sexism or a backlash or misogyny. And I think this is much more a story of neglect than of sexism for the problems that many men feel they have in employment and education just really weren't being talked about reflected on the Democrat side. And whilst I don't want to overstate the policy substance that was on the Republican side, it's certainly true that many young men felt more welcomed, more seen, more heard on the Republican side, and sometimes politics boils down to who likes me, who likes the stuff I like, that cultural element of the election. I think just -- you know, the Republicans put out a welcome mat for men, especially young men. They also met young men where they were. I mean, literally, in the case of the Joe Rogan podcast and other podcasts, but also just met them in terms of saying to them, reflecting that we get it, the you're struggling right now.

We are never --we're never going to lecture you about toxic masculinity. We are never going to say that you are mansplaining. We're simply going to say, we like you and we like the things you like. We're also going to approach with a bit of a sense of humor around some of this stuff. We're going to go to a UFC fight, et cetera. And none of that amounts to policy substance. That is not a policy to tackle the fact that the suicide rate among men under 30 has risen by more than 40 percent since 2010. That is not the policy strategy for dealing with the fact that we have bigger gaps, gender gaps on college campuses today than we did in the '70s, but the other way around. That doesn't affect the fact that working class men haven't essentially had a pay rise for decades. And so, the substance is not there on the Republican side. The irony is that there's more policy substance already on the Democrat side, the infrastructure bill, for example, mostly help working class men, Hispanic, black, and white working class men, but you couldn't find a single Democrat who would have said that because they falsely assumed that talking about the things they were doing to help boys and men, acknowledging the very fact that there were problems for boys and men would undermine their appeal to women. That was a big mistake. It was zero-sum thinking, and as a result, they not only lost ground among men but among women. And so, the message to Democrats, I think, coming out of this election has to be don't move too quickly to the explanation of sexism. Instead, consider hard that this is the effect of a long run neglect on a policy front of the issues of boys and men.",

But what's really fascinating when you start breaking down the support among men by race is what happened with both black male voters as well as Latino male voters.

I like the idea of a job. I like the idea of manufacturing coming back. And so, it is perfectly possible that many of these men voted for Donald Trump, not because of some of the issues you just raised, but to some extent, despite them. And I think that's a very, very difficult thing for people to get their head around, which is that people are able to hold in their thought contradictory ideas about a candidate, which is like, I don't like certain aspects of this guy. But I think I'm going to be better off. And I think he's -- he sees me a little bit more than some of the other candidates do. But I do think that there's a vacuum here, particularly on the center left around a willingness to just accept that there is a positive version of masculinity and the role of men. At some level, a lot of these young men, especially, they're not sure what the message is to them about whether we like them, whether we need them and what their role in society is going to be. And whatever you think of the way in which the Republicans talk about the importance of men and the role of men and the signals that they had about being friendly to men, this -- that's going -- the danger is that will be silence. And so, I worry a little bit that people say, well, how could men be attracted to that role model of masculinity when there wasn't really an alternative being put in front of them? And so, that -- again, it's that sense -- you even saw in the final stages of the campaign where young men in particular being urged to vote for the Democrats if they love the women in their lives, and that's not good enough. It's not to say that, of course, we don't care about the other people in our lives but if you're essentially asking men to vote for Democrats because the Democrats stand for women, that's a pretty flawed political strategy again.",

Tim Walz was the first career public school teacher to run for such high office. But not only that, a coach. And you had his own students coming out talking about this of service-oriented kind of masculinity that he had demonstrated. And if there was any candidate who could have plausibly set out a positive vision for the role of men in society for a campaign to increase the share of male teachers, to really tackle this mental health crisis we see playing out among young men, then it's hard to think of a better CV, at least, than the one of Tim Walz. It was easy to imagine him giving powerful speeches, running really strong advertising campaigns directly targeted at young men with an empathetic, respectful policy-based message to those young men. None of that happened. So, I think among the many missed opportunities that we saw on the Democrat side of the campaign, the failure to send Tim Walz out backed by a strong policy agenda to win over the votes of young men will be one of them.",

And we are going to tackle the growing male suicide crisis and the struggles of boys in our education system and the difficulties that young men are having entering the labor market. If we can get past the or and towards an and, then there's a, we have to rise together message. And again, the irony is that actually a female headed ticket may have more permission to do that than a male headed ticket. Like if Kamala Harris had come out very strongly saying, I have an agenda for men. Here's my policy platform for men, including more vocational learning, including paternity leave for men, paid leave for men, including a push to get more male teachers, a coach for America program to reduce the decline in the share of boys in school, and here's my agenda to help women too, that would have spoken to the mom who is terrified about, for example, her access to reproductive health care, but also really worried about her son in school, worried about our brother's mental health. Because actually in the real world right now mothers, fathers are as worried about the men and the women and the boys and the girls in their lives just for different reasons. And so, we haven't had it yet from either side, but there is space here for a politics and a policy platform that manages to do two things at once. And that manages to advocate for changes that would help boys and men without doing less for women and girls. Right now, it feels as if the choices between a Republican Party that in this messaging sometimes feels like it wants to turn back the clock on women and a Democrat Party that has turned its back on men. And somewhere between those two extremes, there is a constructive non zero-sum politics, which says, we rise together, and that means that we care as much about the young men who are falling behind as the young women who are struggling to rise.",
