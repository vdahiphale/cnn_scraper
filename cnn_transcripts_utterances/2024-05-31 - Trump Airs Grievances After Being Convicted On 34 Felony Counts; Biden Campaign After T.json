But we don't know what those ideas were. At least it's very unclear. And this is significant because the indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have been on pause for the last three weeks. This, of course, being a key priority for the U.S. And then not to mention too, Rafah, where the president has said he has a red line. But the White House has said it hasn't been breached yet.

Of course, Donald Trump in a 35-minute long rambling speech that was billed as a news conference referred to, at one point, the United States as a fascist state. Moments later, JD Vance, a senator who is among the contenders for the vice presidential role on the Trump ticket, came on set and sat down with Wolf Blitzer. And Wolf asked him whether he thinks America is a fascist state. Let me play part of the exchange for you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The idea that somehow there is this grand conspiracy in which Democrats control all, they control the states, they control all the judges up and down, from federal court all the way down to state and local court, is nonsense.
