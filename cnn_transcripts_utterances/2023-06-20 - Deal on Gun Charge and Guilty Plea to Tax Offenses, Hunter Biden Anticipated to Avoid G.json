A race against time, very clearly, as the oxygen supply on board dwindles. Officials say that the sub, which is about the size of a minivan, it went missing about an hour and 45 minutes into its descent, after it had launched on Sunday.It was on course to see the remains of the Titanic at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, all part of the eight-day journey conducted and led by OceanGate expeditions. Several agencies are involved in the search, that includes the U.S. Coast Guard, the Royal Canadian Air Force. The search covers a remote, vast area of 900 miles east of Cape Cod. Now, one of the most challenging parts of this search operation is the depth, of course. The world record for scuba diving is only to a depth of about 1,000 feet. Once you hit 3,200 feet, light is no longer visible. 2,000 feet further, at 5,200 feet, most animals can't survive. Now, sperm whales can dive deeper than any other mammal, they can only get down to 10,000 feet. 12,000 feet is about the average depth of the ocean floor, the Titanic is still below that. The wreckage settled at 12,450 feet which is 2.4 miles below the surface. You can truly get a sense of just how challenging this is. Now, CNN's Jason Carroll is back with me following this search operation from Boston. You were talking about this with me last time, the depth is the problem, the clock is what is against them. What is the search operation look like then today, Jason?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, good question. And just a short while ago, we got an update from the U.S. Coast Guard here in Boston who is helping, in terms of heading up this operation. They say that the Canadian aircraft P-3 Aurora arrived on the scene out there. Again, we're talking about 900 miles due east of where we are right now. That particular aircraft is going to be able to conduct sonar searches.The ships, the Polar Prince and the RV (ph) Deep Energy, they say are continuing their searched on the surface. The search area now that they've conducted so far, if you can imagine this, Kate, they now say is 10,000 square miles. A massive area, a remote area. At this point, again, the concern is about the amount of oxygen that is left for the people who are onboard. We're told at this point it could be anywhere from about 54 to 80 hours of oxygen left. A massive search effort underway, as you said, the U.S. Coast Guard involved, the U.S. Navy involved as well. Canadian Coast Guard and Canadian Armed Forces also lending a hand. Earlier this morning on \"CNN This Morning\", the head of the U.S. Coast Guard here in Boston talked about what they're doing in terms of searching and how it's now -- not just on the surface, but has now moved below the surface as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. JOHN MAUGER, OVERSEEING SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION:  A lot of the search to date has been primarily focused on the surface of the water. And our aircraft flew patterns in combination with the Canadian Aircraft and New York International Guard aircraft flew patterns, that roughly about the size of the state of Connecticut. But today, we now have underwater search capability on scene. And so, we're going to be using that to see if we can locate the submersible in the water. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, Kate, I did several stories on OceanGate during my time in Seattle. In 2018, I did the story about Titan, the submersible that's now missing. We went to OceanGate, we talked to the crew, and we actually sat inside the vessel.And you ask, you know, what it felt like. I was really struck during that time with how -- one, how simple the technology seemed. It's this tiny vessel, it is very cramped, it can fit five people, which we understand is the number of people currently lost as part of this expedition. It's operated by a gaming controller, actually driven with what looks like PlayStation controller. And yet the company, OceanGate, told me that they were extremely confident that they could safely make this remarkable journey to the Titanic. That they could dive 13,000 feet and handle 150 million pounds of pressure at the ocean floor. And the company's CEO, Stockton Rush, he told me that the pressure vessel and its carbon fiber structure of Titan, that sub, that it could handle the pressure, no problem, that they had not cut corners or cost when it came to safety. And frankly, in all my interview, everyone of the OceanGate crew members, team members that we spoke with talked about safety and how confident they were in that technology. Now, having said that, Kate, we understand that Titan has had some communication issues in the past, that the vessel was lost for more than two hours during an expedition last year because they couldn't receive messages from their support crew on the surface. You know, they use -- they rely on text messages when they're underwater. There's no GPS down there. So, again, we don't know what exactly went wrong, but we do know that they got their final contact -- made their final contact less than two hours into this expedition.",

The judge did put on the schedule for mid-August, so that is the date we have now. However, John, that date is very unlikely to hold. She did write in the possibility that both sides could ask for delays based on how complex the case is, as well as the fact that it relates to classified records.

Yes, well certainly it was another sleepless night for the folks who live here in Kyiv as there were alarms going off, air raid sirens going off for several hours during the night. And it was indeed a large-scale drone attack by those Shahed drones, as the Ukrainians call them, those are Iranian-manufactured drones that the Russians are using and they attack in swarms.And the Ukrainians are saying that is exactly what happened once again tonight. There were several waves of these drone attacks, that they tried to come from several directions. And the numbers are pretty staggering. The Ukrainians are saying that they detected 35 of these Shahed drones, mostly coming towards the capital area of Kyiv, and they were able to take down 32 of them. So, certainly a pretty good rate of destruction there for the Ukrainian air defenses. But at the same time, it goes to show that at the -- while the fighting is picking up, especially on the southeastern front here in this country, you still have these aerial attacks. It's certainly are a big problem, not just for the capital city, for the population centers, but also for critical infrastructure as well. That's one of the things that the Ukrainians are saying was hit in Lviv. And then you look at the Zaporizhzhia that you were mentioning, that's also really important because Zaporizhzhia was hit by several Russian missiles, but that's very close to that front line where a lot of that fighting is currently going on. The Ukrainians are saying that on every part of the front line, which is very long, they are the ones that currently have the initiative. They say that they're moving forward in many sectors of that front line. They're making gains that are very tough to come by, but the Russians, importantly, are not moving forward. The Russians, right now, they say, are on the defensive. Nevertheless, what we're hearing and seeing and, yes, we're on the front lines just a couple days ago, it's very difficult for the Ukrainians, but they do say that they are in good spirits, and they believe that they can make the counteroffensive work. While at the same time, you know, the issues here in the capital city, especially, with these drone and missile attacks, they just continue. Kate.",
