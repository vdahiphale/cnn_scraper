      "sentences": "Today, President Biden looking to carry some Beltway momentum into battleground states.Next hour, he will be in Pennsylvania after delivering the type of feisty State of the Union address that Democrats were hoping for last night, aggressively defending his record and his second-term plans. Throughout the speech, he knocked former President Trump, though not by name. It was clear who he was speaking about, though, and he contrasted his vision on key issues like the economy and immigration against Republicans' more pessimistic view. The official GOP rebuttal detailed a so-called American nightmare. CNN's M.J. Lee is on the trail ahead of Biden's arrival there in Pennsylvania. M.J., another focus last night was, of course, the Israel-Hamas war. And I know you have some new reporting about a recent conversation between Biden and Netanyahu. What can you tell us? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Brianna, if I could just quickly take you back to a phone call between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu on January 19. As you can imagine, the two leaders had a lot of heavy issues to discuss related to the war. And what sources tell CNN is that, at one point in this phone call, Prime Minister Netanyahu bristled at President Biden over some media reporting that had quoted some U.S. officials anonymously saying that the U.S. government was reportedly planning for a post- Netanyahu government. And what we are told by our sources is that President Biden, for his part, basically swatted away that idea, saying that it was kind of farcical and essentially saying, look, why are we even talking about this? You are the current leader of Israel and the U.S. government, my administration is going to work with whoever the leader of the Israeli government is. Both men apparently agreed and made clear in this brief exchange that these kinds of anonymous sourcing and quotes from U.S. officials were irritating. This was an exchange -- again, told to us that it was a brief exchange in this phone call -- just says a lot about this tenuous relationship that we have seen between the president and the prime minister that has become increasingly strained throughout the course of the war. And what we know is that, of course, the war has had serious political implications for both of the leaders. And, increasingly, we are also seeing that, when it comes to the end of the war, their political interests are not entirely aligned. And when we go back to last night and the State of the Union speech, there was just this incredible moment that was caught after the president had given his remarks where, on a hot mic, the president basically suggested that his relationship with the prime minister was at a crossroads. Take a listen to this moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He obviously was trying to get into the spotlight.It's a little bit hard to do when you're not the president of the United States. He issued a prebuttal. Then he was trying to live- respond on his social media page through social, but there were a number of glitches. It was clear while he was responding that he was growing somewhat aggravated at some of the things that Biden was saying about policies. He was saying Biden should not be taking credit for this. This is me. But, unsurprisingly, today he has heard from allies and advisers, all of them telling him what you would expect to hear from loyalists to Donald Trump, that the speech wasn't good, that Biden sounded angry, that he was yelling, all things that are good to placate the former president. Now, I will remind you he had set up a war room with his team, small team, here at Mar-a-Lago. They had gone through, watched the speech, responding in real time. We saw a series of personal attacks by Donald Trump, really fixating on Biden, talking about his hair, his demeanor, at one point really going after the fact that he was coughing, not that surprising, given that we know Donald Trump is a germaphobe. He also attacked members of Congress and senators who have been critical him of him in the past, including Senator Joe Manchin, Mitt Romney. But one person that he heaped praise on was Katie Britt, the Republican GOP junior senator who delivered that rebuttal to Joe Biden, and probably because of some of the language she used very emphatically. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KATIE BRITT (R-AL):  Right now, our commander in chief is not in command. The free world deserves better than a dithering and diminished leader.

This is a thankless role. Almost nobody who does this gets high praise afterwards. And Donald Trump did give it to Katie Britt. I will let you know that they have spoken recently. They talked a lot about that Alabama ruling. She is in favor of IVF, something that he said changed his mind or at least informed him on the topic.

And we have asked the team, what is this going to look like?They are calling it -- or at least one senior adviser is calling it a social meeting. And by that, they say it is a friendly sit-down between two people with no agenda. Obviously, it is hard to imagine a friendly sit-down between Donald Trump and Viktor Orban with no agenda. But the reason why this carries so much significance is twofold. One, the White House did not issue any sort of formal invitation to Orban. Orban did not reach out to the White House for any sort of specific meeting with anyone from the Biden administration or the president himself, even though he is a NATO leader. Donald Trump is not just the former president, but he is also the presumptive Republican nominee, and he could be president again. And what this does is, with a meeting with an authoritarian like Viktor Orban, gives us some insight into how Donald Trump might align himself with world leaders if he is in fact reelected to the White House in November. [13:10:00] He has often been a fan of the strongman. In fact, one of the things that he said about Orban was that not a lot of people like him because he is so strong, but it's nice to have a strong man that is in control of the country. That praise has been mutual between the two of them, and they are also aligned in policy. Now, the one really interesting factor here is that Donald Trump is technically a civilian. Yes, he is a former president, but the meeting between the two of them doesn't have to be released. There doesn't have to be any kind of official record, because he's not currently a world leader. His team has told us that they will give us some sort of readout on what happened, maybe provide some pictures. But, of course, we will be asking our sources to try to figure out what exactly the two men are talking about, and if, in fact, there is no agenda, Boris.",

Thank you both for being with us. Mark, first to you. The Joe Biden that we saw last night vastly different than I think some of the appearances that he's made in the recent few months, I'd say. Do you think that version of Joe Biden has a much better chance of beating Donald Trump than the one that we have seen perhaps not as polished in recent weeks? MARK MCKINNON, FORMER MEDIA ADVISER TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Well, it's the only version. And I don't think it's overstating the case, or even being overly dramatic to say that, if Joe Biden wins a reelection, that we can trace it back to this speech as being largely responsible. Of course, a hundred other things have to happen between now and then. But this had to happen. I mean, the narrative was really being said that Joe Biden didn't have the energy, didn't have the fight, didn't have the acuity to take on Donald Trump. And I think what we saw -- I mean, the criticism from Republicans, ironically, is that it was angry. Well, angry is a lot better than being asleep. And so I think that what a lot of people wanted to know is, does Joe Biden have the fight to take on Donald Trump? And I think, unequivocally, that's what came across last night.",

He was not diminished. He's -- they set the bar so low. They criticized him so fiercely that, in a way, all Joe Biden really had to do was step to the podium and not drool on himself and speak in coherent sentences. He did all of that and much, much more. And so I think, for those who might truly be on the fence, they really, I think, did themselves a disservice by pretending that the president is weaker than he actually is. There are only a couple of really big events between now and Election Day. There's the State of the Union. There's whatever debates might happen, and there's the convention speeches.

She was one of the negotiators who put the package together. So, look, you're going to have maybe something that has faint echoes of the Harry Truman 1948 campaign, when he accused a do-nothing Congress of not taking the steps that they needed to take.
