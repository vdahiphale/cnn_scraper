We have learned through an Israeli security official that that channel was actually Russia, that Russia made the request to Israel to assist the Syrians.Now a Syrian government source speaking to a pro government outlet there denied that Syria had asked for requests from Israel. Saying that instead Netanyahu was trying to exploit the situation. But I spoke to Israeli officials who do say that there will be aid sent to Syria. Those will be things like bedding, warm clothing, and medical supplies. But I have not yet confirmed exactly how that will be brought to Syria. Meanwhile independent groups and charities here, I just spoke to United Hatzalah, an EMT group, as well as a group called IsraAid, have chartered a joint flight that taking off in the coming hours, a special chartered El Al flight that will be landing as close as they can to the disaster zone. On that flight will also be about ten search and rescue experts and dozens of EMTs. And also interestingly they will be bringing with them water filtration experts as well as people who are experts in psycho trauma, people who can help talk to people and hopefully help them especially children sort of process what they have been through. I also know that there are other groups and the military here is also working to try and send as many planeloads with as just many tons of supply and equipment and people who can help as much as possible. Importantly though this is all being done in coordination both for the Israelis and Palestinian Authority in coordination with the Turkish authorities who can really help and determine where the help is most needed -- guys.",

BACHIR TAJALDIN, DIRECTOR SYRIAN-AMERICAN MEDICAL SOCIETIES, GAZIANTEP, TURKEY (via phone): Yes, it is as you mentioned in your introduction, it is a desperate situation both in Turkey and Syria. But also, although in Syria it's more disastrous as you know. More than one decade of the conflict in northern Syria that health facilities have been targeted many times, between medical staff, lack of medical staff, medications, the lack of shelter, the lack of water and hygiene, sanitation. So the poor economic health situation, all of those. And along with last earthquake and this disastrous earthquake, has a huge impact on the population there. Hereto we are trying to coordinate as an NGO with others, and including other NGOs, UN agencies, in our response. But still we are struggling in saving as much as we can from the people's lives.",

So there's no central government who can take care of the sector. And so as NGO and civil society organizations, we are taking this responsibility. And as you know, we are depending on available resources and also on the available infrastructure given the previous 12 years of this crisis in Syria. All the focus is about the emergency aid. There has been no big adjustment in humanitarian or infrastructure as in health or other services. So, this is the main differences. And also you can imagine that many of the others have been (INAUDIBLE) as the quake rubble, yesterday we evacuated two maternity hospitals because of the physical impact of the earthquake on the infrastructure. Dr. Tajaldin, thank you very much indeed for giving us your insight and your very important work. One of the big issues is that the aid will have to come through Turkey to get to Syria. But there is only one crossing at the moment. So they are looking at the U.N. to try to open up more crossings, but so sensitive.",

There have been reports that it may have been sort of ongoing in a covert way.The information that we're getting today is coming from the Ukrainian defense intelligence military intelligence. They say that not only are they expecting another mobilization wave, but it will be bigger than the first one. They expect it to be up to half a million men. They expect it to take two months, which is twice the official length of the first one. And they expect this to be a way of fueling the expected spring offensive. I think that it is clear that manpower has certainly been an advantage for Russia since that first mobilization. We know that part of the tactics at least in the Eastern front, is to send in wave after wave of infantry. They've suffered heavy losses at least according to the Ukrainian side. They don't often admit this themselves. So certainly there does need to be it seems a way to replenish that and certainly to increase those numbers if they want to mount a spring offensive.
