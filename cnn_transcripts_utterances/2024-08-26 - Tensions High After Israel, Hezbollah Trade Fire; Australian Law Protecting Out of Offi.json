Former President Donald Trump will visit Michigan later today before hitting Wisconsin and Pennsylvania later this week. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris is set to start a bus tour in Georgia on Wednesday. All of those are battleground states. Kim Jong-un oversaw a drone performance test over the weekend with state media saying the drones destroyed all of their targets. North Korea's leader says -- was said to be satisfied with the results and stressed the importance of more tests so his country's army can be equipped with drones, quote, as early as possible. And tensions remain high in the Middle East following this weekend's heavy exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Israel and Hamas held another round of hostage and ceasefire talks and a U.S. official says negotiations will continue in the coming days and describe the process as constructive.",

It's a terror military that you mentioned before, the North Korean suicide drones that were presented on Saturday, the same kind of equipment that North Korea sends out to the world. The Islamic regime of Iran supplies to Hezbollah. So it isn't, they're certainly connected, but it isn't, finish the war against Hamas, another terror organization in the Gaza Strip, and everything is calm with Hezbollah. Hezbollah is a terror entity. It is attacking Israel every single day since October 7th. And it can't just be held up to unaccountability as if what they're doing is to help the Palestinians.

All of us want to calm the area.I live in Israel. I live a thousand meters from the place that Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, stated yesterday that that's where they wanted to attack in the greater area of Tel Aviv. They put it into their own films. That's where I live. Nothing happened here yesterday because the state of Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces, preempted and stopped that attack from happening. But the ones who are destabilizing are the Islamic regime of Iran, are Hezbollah. And I really don't think that they should get out of this with everybody saying, oh, it's about the Palestinians and the Gaza Strip. I care about the Palestinians and the Gaza Strip.

I mean that as an Israeli, I want the closure there. I want the Israeli Prime Minister and the government to do what can be done.But I'm also somebody who looks at things through Hamas eyes and Hamas is a terror entity. And if I don't represent what Hamas thinks, then I'm not doing my job. And I think that Yahya Sinwar, the one who at the end holds the hostages, holds the Gaza Strip, has been the leader in the Gaza Strip, the terror leader, not the political leader, the terror leader in the Gaza Strip for the last four years, that he has no interest in arriving at a resolution. And when we put out the positive signs, I think that the United States and the Egyptians and the Qataris, I even think that perhaps the Hamas leaders who are also terror leaders who sit in Qatar would be willing to arrive at a resolution.

I'll go out and protest every Saturday night, but I'm not willing for that comparison between the state of Israel, the government of Israel, the government that I don't support, and a terror entity that is declared as such by the U.K., by the EU, by the United States, by all of the world. We're putting them as if they're the same legitimate partners. They're not just like Hezbollah is not. And we need to do that differentiation. So yes, I think that he has a political agenda. I am not happy with his decisions. And yet I don't think it's different from the polarization inside the United States between Republicans and Democrats, or even the polarization that I see in the U.K. Terrible things happened in France.
