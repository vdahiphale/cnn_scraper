A year ago this was so shocking that these rates were up, and so that was keeping people off the market. Now people are getting a little more used to it. They've figured out what they can afford to buy. You can afford to buy a little bit less this year than last year because of those higher rates.

It's a neighborhood -- that's where the Tree of Life synagogue was and, of course, where that horrific shooting happened about 4 1/2 years ago.We're expecting jury selection to begin today, really within the next hour or so. And as you said, it's been a long, contentious road to the start of this death penalty case. But I want to bring viewers up to speed as to who we got to this point. Remember, this started on October 28, 2018. It was a Saturday morning. Prosecutors say Robert Bowers arrived at the Tree of Life synagogue armed with multiple guns. And there were members of three Jewish congregations actually worshipping that morning at the synagogue at the time. At that point, prosecutors say that Bowers opened fire on the synagogue and then entered the synagogue and started shooting. And prosecutors also say that Bowers said he wanted to kill Jews during the attack. And also then, prosecutors found more antisemitic posts online attributed to his name. Well, 11 people were ultimately killed; others were injured. And Bowers was charged with murder and other -- or I should say multiple hate crimes in addition. And because of that, this is a death penalty case. Now, Kaitlan, Bowers has retained defense attorney Judy Clarke in this case. If that name sounds familiar, Judy Clarke has represented other high-profile federal death penalty defendants in the past. That includes the Unabomber. That also includes Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from the Boston Marathon bombing. Well, his defense team -- they said that they would take a deal with life in prison if it took the death penalty off the table, but federal prosecutors have not budged on that issue. Again, jury selection begins today. This trial could go as long as July -- Kaitlan.",
