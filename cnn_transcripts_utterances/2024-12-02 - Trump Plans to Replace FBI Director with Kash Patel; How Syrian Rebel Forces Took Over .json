I'll be speaking to Georgia's President about what the future holds for the country wanting to join the EU. Plus, President Biden shocking U-turn as he issues a full and unconditional pardon of his son, Hunter. But we begin this evening with a dramatic shift on the frontlines in Syria.

The economy is beleaguered, they have paid a huge price as well in terms of how many people have been killed? Nearly 4,000.

There is nothing radical, it's a very peaceful, familiar almost demonstrations as long as the police or these black forces do not start moving on -- moving in.

Typically, the way that,that works is that people who are convicted of crimes will file paperwork with the Justice Department explaining why they think they deserve a pardon, and then it will be vetted, it will be scrutinized and the Justice Department will then make recommendations to the White House, to the President on who deserves a pardon. That's one way to do it. But it's not the only way to do it. And if you're well connected, if you are close with the President or the family member of the President, you can just go outside of those channels and get a pardon. It has happened before, it happened a lot like this in the Trump administration, and it appears that this is how it happened. Obviously, no surprise there because Hunter Biden is the son of President Biden. But Isa, this decision yesterday landed with a thud here in Washington because you just played that clip over and over and over throughout the year. President Biden said that he would not pardon his son. He would not commute the sentence. But after the Thanksgiving holiday and after some soul-searching and wrestling with this decision, he concluded that a pardon was   appropriate. And I got to point out, Isa, that this is a very broad pardon. It covers any potential crimes that Hunter Biden may have committed during a ten-year span. Let me read for you a little bit of what the President said last night in a statement announcing the pardon. President Biden said this, quote, \"I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively and unfairly prosecuted.\" Two points there that I got to make, yes, it is true that he kept his word and he did not shut down this investigation, he did not fire the prosecutor even though he could have done that theoretically as President. But when it comes to whether this was a selective prosecution, whether he was unfairly targeted, multiple judges were asked to weigh in on that question, Hunter Biden raised that question with the judges. They both said, no. They both refused to throw out the case on the theory that this was a selective, unfair prosecution. And we just got in a few moments ago, Isa, the first comments from the prosecutors who brought the cases against Hunter Biden, and they said there was none and never has been any evidence of a vindictive or selective prosecution in the case. They conceded that with the pardon, the case is over, but they are not going down without pointing out that there was never in their view, any evidence of any unfair prosecution, which of course is the entire justification that President Biden offered for why he pardoned his son.",

Now, let's turn our attention to political vibration, of course, from the pardon that -- being felt in Washington, I should say and beyond. President-elect Donald Trump called the pardon an abuse, as well as miscarriage of justice. In an online post, he also teased the possibility of mass pardons for those convicted in the January 6th Capitol attack. Hunter Biden's pardon may also help rally Republican support behind Kash Patel, Trump's controversial pick to become the new FBI director. And there are questions today surrounding the President-elect's incoming Press Secretary. CNN's KFILE has uncovered deleted social media posts from Karen Leavitt from 2021. She retweeted a post praising then-Vice President Mike Pence for certifying the election. But she then ran for Congress as an election denier, falsely claiming Trump won the 2020 election. Our Steve Contorno is following the Trump transition developments from Florida.

He has accused them of being full of, quote, \"deep state agents,\" of being used to weaponize and attack Republicans. And he has said that he would like to see that agency completely cleared out on to an unknown effect than the FBI and the agents and who serve within it. And so, he would be a very unconventional choice to lead the department, given his past criticism of it. Of course, that is one of the reasons why Donald Trump is potentially leaning on him in the first place. He is someone who also believed that Department of Justice has been used against him. And so, he wants to see a reckoning within the FBI and he would use Kash Patel to that end. I should point out though, that Kash Patel would only be able to step into that role and be nominated as FBI director in the case that Trump either fires Christopher Wray, the current FBI director, or that individual steps down. And so far, he has not given any indication that he intends to do so. So, we might also see a potential power struggle ahead as well.",

That shows you how desperate they are. And the Iranians have just come off of months of a shellacking at the hands of the Israelis. They have their hands full in Gaza, in Lebanon, and really trying to protect their own regime from falling. And so, with both those countries distracted, this was really the opportune time for such an offensive. Not only that, but if you look at the transition in the United States from a lame duck Biden administration to Trump, many actors, both state and non-state actors, see this as a critical window of opportunity to make and solidify gains on the ground.",

You've got all of the big players in the region, global players as well, and everybody's trying to jockey for position to back their own proxy group or to prepare for what comes next, many with Trump coming into office, see this right now and the next six to eight weeks as the time to solidify gains, strengthen their own bargaining position and use these gains as leverage for whatever negotiations are to come.",

And while it remains unlikely, stranger things have happened, especiallyover the past several years, I think what I'm mostly concerned about is the new life that would breathe into a group like the Islamic State, which has been biding its time, slowly regrouping. It would be then unleashed in Syria amongst a group of other organizations. You still got the Kurdish question in Northeastern Syria. They're in charge of ISIS prison camps, like El Roge and Al-Hawl. You basically have a jailbreak of ISIS fighters. It would be a disaster on so many levels, not to mention all of the different players trying to scramble.

And it's larger than other recent ones from the United States. Trump has said he would pause aid to Ukraine once in office. As we mentioned earlier on the show, Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved a record setting defense budget of about $126 billion. The spending will account for almost a third of Moscow's 2025 budget. But Ukrainian soldiers on the frontlines in the Kursk region are crucial battleground underway. Nick Paton Walsh reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voice-over):  They have a three-second window, rushing out with a U.S. supplied Stinger and an aging anti-aircraft gun to shoot down Russian attack drones in the fleeting moment they fly overhead in range.

One video shows fansclimbing a wall to try to get out of the packed stadium, you can see there. A local news report said fighting had started when fans grew angry over refereeing decisions in clash with security officers. CNN has not been able to verify those reports. And disturbing news coming out of Northwest Pakistan, where at least 130 people have been killed in sectarian violence. The violence flared 10 days ago when gunmen ambushed a convoy killing dozens of Shiite Muslims. There has been no claim of responsibility for the assault, which triggered days of attacks by rival groups. Last week, government officials brokered a ceasefire between Shiite and Sunni Muslims, but it did not hold. Still to come on the show tonight, Oxford's word of the year is out. If you try and figure it out on social media, the grey matter in your mind may decay. We'll explain, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
