Believe it or not, I'm standing on a road, a major road going in and out of the Palm Springs area here.This is what is going on. They are starting to clean it up now that the sun has come out. But, look, there are two cars over here that have been stuck since we were have in darkness. And now you can see how high that mud is up on their wheels. And then over to the right, there is this little Volkswagen. Some very respectful, thoughtful individual just went flying through the mud on the wrong side of the road to get on to this side and completely splashed our Photojournalist Mike Love, who is now completely covered in mud. But that is how far she got. That's what she's ended up here. These are the reasons why they're saying schools are closed. These are the reasons why they're saying people will not be able to get in and around into Palm Springs, because out in the distance there, I just walked all the way up there, that would be towards Interstate 10. There are Mac trucks, there are cars twisted off to the side off the road up there. It is completely blocked right now with the vehicles and mud and running water that is still finding its way off the road and down off into the wash. All of their washes are full. When you looking at this now that the sun has come up, it is almost unbelievable how much of a mess is out here. And when you put your foot into some of these mud, they just came through and plowed here, so it is not as sticky, but, you know, a couple of times, I thought I was going to lose my boot because it is so sticky. And that what is trapping the cars out here. And think about it, they were doing this in the darkness. You can see it up there what mess it has been left behind.

So, if you're elderly or you're a young person, it's really hard to get through that. And so that's our main focus right now, is to clear the roads. Right now, we have the I-10 freeway, which is the main thoroughfare through both Palm Springs and Cathedral City. Our off ramps are on both theirs and ours are limited because of the mud.

We now have a bit of insight on Donald Trump's timing. A senior law enforcement source tells CNN he expects the former president to show up Thursday or Friday.

There are 19 of them. There's already been 30 people who are not related to this case who've been booked in the jail just this morning so far.

      "sentences": "All right. With us now, former U .S. Attorney Michael Moore. Counselor, great to see you. One of Donald Trump's co-defendants, Mark Meadows, has filed a motion to have his case outright dismissed. First of all, he's asked to have it removed from state to federal court, a separate motion to have it dismissed. And the theory, his theory of the case, is it's because he was working as a federal employee when he did the actions he is accused with and he says he can't be charged under state law for actions as a federal employee. How much water does that argument hold?You may have to hold up signs, Michael. We can't hear your voice. We're going to see if Michael -- oh, it's great. It's so much better. We can hear you. You don't need to use sock puppets. Tell me that how -- tell me about the theory of the case for Mark Meadows. MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY:  Yes. I was saying, I think these motions really go hand in hand with each other. They are not. No big surprise that they were filed. The motion to dismiss follows the motion to transfer the case. And, basically, both of the motions deal with whether or not he was a federal employee doing his federal job. The motion to dismiss that he's most recently filed is based upon a supremacy clause of the Constitution. And what that basically says is that a state cannot prosecute a federal employee for doing their job that's outlined by federal law. And he's arguing that because I was the chief of staff for the president of the United States, there were things that I was tasked to do, like make calls, set appointments, do those types of administrative, ministerial tasks and functions that some of which are included in the indictment as overt acts in furthest with the conspiracy.  So, the court is going to look at that and weigh out whether or not that's the case. I really think that probably he will not see the indictment dismissed at this point. But he may give sort of an added nudge to the judge to move it on to and allow the motion to transfer because that burden of proof, that argument is simply that did he have a plausible claim that he was operating as a federal employee. And I don't think there's anybody that can say he was not operating as the chief of staff at the direction of Trump. So, that motion probably has a little bit better chance of surviving at this point. But the motion to dismiss may rear its head again a little bit further into the litigation.",

But the argument he's making is that the president is the president 100 percent of every hour of every day. The chief of staff is the chief of staff of the president 100 percent of every hour of every day. You're on call. You've got to respond. You've got to be available. And that the president is entitled to have advice without fear of that advice suddenly being called criminal attempts to commit a RICO violation or something like that.So, that's going to be something the judge has to weigh. He may say, look, we're going to hear this a little bit longer. I'm going to hear what evidence the government wants to put on to decide whether or not I think you fit into this niche. There's not a lot of Supreme Court law, frankly. I mean, it's a centuries-old proposition, as you can gather, is a constitutional provision. But it will be something that's going to wind its way, I'm certain, to the Supreme Court at some time because of these unique circumstances. You've got a president and chief of staff, and the argument will be that I was simply trying to inquire about the validity of the election. And as a chief of staff of the highest federal ranking federal official in the nation, I'm entitled to do that, especially when I'm directed to do it by my boss. And so that's going to be the argument he makes in support of his motion.",

Joining us now is Sarah Matthews, former deputy press secretary for Donald Trump. Thank you so much for being here. We're looking at all of the candidates who are going to be -- well, actually, not all of them will be on the debate stage. Some of them have not qualified, but there's a few of them there who have qualified, the most recent, Asa Hutchinson. I want to ask you what your thoughts are on this poll that has come out. It is from Iowa. We just had the big state fair where everyone came and they tried to argue their case to the Iowa voters. And taking a look at this poll, Donald Trump is far and away. He's double digits away from every single other candidate there. It seems clear that the indictments just keep fueling people's support for Donald Trump. Why do you think that is?",

Obviously, I think that the first indictment coming down, which was the case in New York with Alvin Bragg, was the least strong of the cases and seemed to be a little bit politically motivated.And so then when these other indictments dropped, people just assumed that they were politically motivated, even though they're not. You look at the facts of these cases, specifically the documents case, I think, is one of the ones that is the most strong. And it's very cut and dry that Donald Trump broke the law. Obviously, he's going to have his day in court, but it's hard to get past it when you hear him on an audiotape showing off a classified document to people when he knew it was not classified. But at the end of the day, this doesn't really seem to make a difference to Republican primary voters, and he continues to be dominant in the polls, as demonstrated by this Iowa Poll. All right, I want to ask you about what we heard on State of the Union this weekend, where Republican Bill Cassidy said, look, in his opinion, Donald Trump should get out of the race. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA):  I think the charge that seems most likely, I mean, seems almost a slam dunk, is the one related to mishandling of classified documents.
