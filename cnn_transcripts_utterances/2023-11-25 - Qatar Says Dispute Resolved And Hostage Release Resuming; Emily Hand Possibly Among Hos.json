I'm Fredricka Whitfield in Atlanta, alongside my colleague Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv.And we're watching breaking news unfolding in the Middle East. Right now we're told a convoy of Egyptian ambulances and a bus are moving toward the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing. They're expected to transport 20 hostages currently held by Hamas, which include 13 Israelis and seven foreign nationals. The exchange could happen at any moment now. We're also standing by for word from the Red Cross that the transfer has indeed happened. And this latest movement follows a tense hours long delay in the hostage exchange. Hamas says it disputed the amount of aid being delivered to Gaza and the selection of the 39 Palestinian prisoners set to be released by Israel as part of this brief four-day truce. Wolf Blitzer is joining us now from Tel Aviv -- Wolf.",

They've got a Telegram channel, social media channel, and they just posted just before I came and sat down here that they have handed over 13 Israeli hostages to the ICRC, the International Committee of the Red Cross.But, again, we haven't got that confirmed yet by the Israelis. I mean, they won't have that confirmed until such times as they take receipt of them. If you like, just across the border on the Egyptian side of the Rafah Crossing. Also the ICRC itself hasn't confirmed it. But, you know, if it's true, it does indicate strongly that this latest stage in this hostage deal, which is very complicated, is going ahead as we expected, which is good given that there's been some logistical obstacles over the course of this evening. For a moment, it was in doubt that this second group of hostages would be handed over because of the fact that there had been a delay in the hand over by Hamas because they complained of a lack of relief aid into Gaza and a complaint about how the prisoners were released or how many prisoners or type of prisoners released from Israeli jails. Those obstacles, though, have now been overcome, we're told, and so we are expecting to see these hostages, this latest second group, come shortly into Israeli hands.",

The IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari just put something out on Twitter, saying that according to information provided by the Red Cross, the abductees, the hostages are on their way to the Rafah crossing in the Gaza Strip. So that indicates to us that these hostages will be heading here very shortly.So they are on their way to the Rafah crossing. We saw how this choreography played out yesterday. They went to the Rafah crossing. They crossed into Egypt, and then they drove a fairly short drive, less than two miles to the Kerem Shalom Crossing, which is right behind me over here. At the end of this road, you turn right and that is the Kerem Shalom Crossing. And we expect, Wolf, that once they cross into Israel, they will drive down this road on their way to hospitals across the country who are prepared and ready to receive them. Wolf, this information comes after a day during which we have watched how tenuous and how fragile this deal between Israel and Hamas to secure the release of the hostages, to release Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons, and to continue this pause in the fighting, how fragile this entire deal has been. There have been hours long negotiations throughout the day during which it has been -- during which, you know, it was clear that there were multiple obstacles to this potential deal moving forward once again today. There were indications from Hamas that they felt like Israel was not holding up their end of the bargain as it related to the entry of aid into Gaza and particularly into northern Gaza. There were also complaints from Hamas about the types of Palestinian prisoners that Israel was releasing, claiming that Israel was also not upholding its end of the bargain on that end. The Israelis have made very clear that they feel like Hamas was playing games, trying to delay this process effectively, but the end result, Wolf, is that even though it is later, much later than it was yesterday when we saw those hostages newly freed, finally cross into Israel on their way to meet their families, even though it is later, Wolf, it does appear like everything is moving according to plan, moving in the same way that it was yesterday.",

Two young girls, sisters that were kidnapped from their homes. Two fathers, their families are expecting them. One elderly woman, a beloved grandmother, and I'm still thinking about them and their families. So it's a very, very strange situation.

And this is all going to unfold right behind us, Wolf. This is the road we saw yesterday, we watched live as that convoy of vehicles, many of them ambulances, drove from the point where you seat flashing lights in the background, that is the turnoff from the Kerem Shalom crossing. And they will come onto the main road, which has been blocked off from all civilian traffic by the Israeli military. They're going to make their way all the way down the road. They'll be heading to hospitals across Israel where we expect many of them will have their first reunions with their loved ones. There's also an understanding that for children under the age of 12 that they will be meeting their family members closer to this crossing. We don't know whether it's at the Kerem Shalom crossing where that point will be but we were told initially, children under 12, if they're not with a family member who's being held hostage, they will meet their family closer to the crossing point, rather than waiting at the hospital. We'll see how that unfolds. This culminates an incredible day. It seemed at times as if perhaps everything would unravel.

We want to take nothing for granted. This was supposed to happen many hours ago. These families have been tortured, waiting in hospital wards. They thought tonight maybe they weren't going to get their family members back, and this was just another element. We're not surprised. This is the way Hamas operates. It's the psychological terror, any opportunity to really take advantage of a weakness. They know Israel, they know the world is looking at this.

They were the first ones to come into contact with the terrorists when they came over the border. These people were harvesting and literally mowed down, cut down. There was a blood bath. Many of them fled the country. And we're so happy that they are going to be able to, hopefully, reunite with their families. And it just shows, Wolf, this is not an Israeli problem alone. Hamas doesn't just look for Israelis and Jews, though that's the majority. They're willing to kill anyone or anything in their way. If we don't stop them in Israel, this is a global issue.

But the journey, Wolf, for these people, for many of them, this is a stage on a journey that will take years.

Noar Orr, 17 years old. Alma Orr, 13 years old. And Emily Hand, 9 years old, who Clarissa reported on earlier. I actually know the Avigdori family. I met Noam's uncle at the march to Jerusalem last week, that five-day march that was intended to pressure the Israeli government to reach a deal like we are seeing now to free these hostages. And he talked to me about some of the excruciating weight that it has been for his family. What's also notable, Wolf, is these are not his only two family members who have been kidnapped. He has several other family members who still remain in Gaza held by Hamas. But I want to tell you about a conversation I had just a couple of days ago with Han, Noam's father, Sharon's husband. He told me a few days ago, Wolf, that it was a matter of faith and destiny that I have a wife and daughter there and they are supposed to be on the first wave of release. Effectively saying that because it is his wife and daughter, woman and child, who are in Gaza, that they were more likely to get out during these first four days of 50 hostages being released. So amid everything, amid the flood of emotions that he has been feeling this week, he recognized the fact that there is some destiny in the fact that the loved ones of his who are missing, the dearest to him, are a woman and child, who would be part of this release. And tonight, he will likely be able to embrace his wife and child for the first time in 49 days. It's been a nerve racking 49 days. I have been checking in with him and his family. There was so much uncertainty after that first release happened, and he was told that his family was not on that initial list. And today, it appears, or last night, he found out that his wife and his daughter, Noam, were, indeed, on the list of hostages to be released today. And shortly, Wolf, he will finally be able to embrace them. But has been a nerve-wracking process over the last days, but especially, Wolf, over the last weeks.",

These are live pictures from the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing. They have been moved into the Egyptian side. They've left Gaza, the hostages. They're going to be getting into these vehicles and heading toward Israel momentarily. It's a two mile or so drive to the Kerem Shalom border crossing from where they are right now. This should be, momentarily, we'll see this activity begin. Jeremy Diamond, on the scene for us, thank you very much. In the meantime, I want to go back to Fred.

Perhaps a bit more or less.All of the hospitals designated for the receipt and the taking in of the hostages have a specific role. For example, Wolfson Medical Center, where we were yesterday, focused on the elderly. Schneider Children's Medical Center focused on the children. Here, the foreign nationals. It was 10 Thai citizens and a Filipino citizen. We are expecting four foreign nationals to come to the hospital, an hour or hour and a half away. It is the same sort of treatment, welcome and care that the foreign nationals will get here as the other hospitals that intake the citizens. Israel well aware of the foreign nationals that have nothing to do with the conflict have been through and have tried to make sure they will get the welcome they can. For example, the Filipino citizen who was brought here last night, he was welcomed or met here shortly thereafter by the family for whom he worked. That's the sort of welcome they can hope to expect with the families they work for, the families they work with. Many of those foreign nationals in Israel working on farms or working to help families. This is the hospital where they will be taken. The staff here ready, as they are at the other hospitals across the area in and around Tel Aviv, to intake the patients here, to intake the hostages. Give them not only the evaluation and the check-up on their physical health but also on their mental health. Make sure they have a team of professionals here, including a psychologist to make sure they get the help they need given what they have been through over the course of the last nearly 50 days -- Fredricka?",

The other two hospitals are not that far from us. That's the time frame. Somewhere in the hour and a half range. I would imagine they could move quickly. The police made clear they are ready for this, and they may well have a police escort to get here as quickly as possible. The goal, once they enter Israel, is to make sure they are with their loved ones or those they know as quickly as possible, are able to talk to their families back home, and can begin what may be a long and potentially very difficult recovery process.",

But I'll say, having been at Wolfson Medical Center, they are effectively prepared for anything they need to be prepared for.It's worth noting in statements, both Wolfson Medical Center and Schneider Medical Center, where the children were taken, both issued statements saying that everybody was in good physical condition when they came out of Gaza. There was no major physical injuries that we heard of. There were no major physical trauma. The focus then shifts to the mental health part of this. And that's the part that may be more difficult. Could that be different with this new group? Certainly. Israel has to be ready for the idea that it was only the first 13 that were in good physical condition and perhaps not the next 13 or the group after that. Still, the focus is on making sure they get a complete look and a complete evaluation. That includes physical health, mental health, and any other trauma they might have been through after nearly seven weeks in captivity.",

President Biden, as you mentioned, has been walking through downtown Nantucket with his family popping into shops.He answered a question from a reporter asking about when the hostages will be released. He told reporters, hopefully, we will see something soon. And that is, in fact, something we're seeing playing out at this moment as there is this new round of hostages who have been released by Hamas. While there are a number of Israelis and foreign nationals included in this, it was not expected that any American citizens would be part of today's release. That is something a U.S. official told me early this morning. But the White House remains hopeful that they will be able to get the American hostages home. Specifically, they believe there are three Americans who could be part of the larger group of 50 women and children to be released. That includes two women and also that young 4-year-old girl, Abigail, whose parents were killed on October 7th in the Hamas attack. The White House has been working around the clock trying to ensure the release of not just Americans but hostages at large. And something they have been focused on is the implementation of the deal. President Biden himself spent a few hours this morning focusing in on the possible delay to the deal. He made phone calls to officials to talk about ways to work through it. And about three and a half hours ago, they got word that the deal was moving forward, and the Red Cross was moving to recover these hostages. We'll wait to see if President Biden might have more to say on this matter later today.",
