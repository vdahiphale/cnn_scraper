      "sentences": "Well, Boris, I think things stand in a much better place than the market would have had you believe just a week ago. Remember, investors were freaking out about cracks in the jobs market. All these fears that maybe the Fed is waiting too long to cut interest rates.Totally different story this week. We see the Dow up more than 300 points, around 1 percent. Even sharper gains for the NASDAQ of around 2 percent. And the latest inflation readings are a big part of the story. And we're talking about the Producer Price Index. This is measuring wholesale inflation. It's pricing pressure before it gets to all of us as consumers. And it was better-than-expected. Prices we're up by 0.1 percent between June and July, 2.2 percent year over year. Both of those are improvements. If you look at the trend, you can see that this metric has gotten much better in recent months. At 1.2 years ago, it was almost at 12 percent. We are miles away from that. And this is really exactly what the Fed wants to see. Prices, of course, they're not going down, but they're going up at a more gradual pace. And this is another piece of evidence that could help make the case for the Fed to start cutting interest rates at the next meeting in September, which by the way, is the last let's meaning before the election. [14:35:03] Of course, Boris, we're getting another potentially key piece of evidence tomorrow in the Consumer Price Index. So we'll have to wait and see what that says as well.",

This company cutting its outlook, warning that sales will drop more than expected.And what's really key here is why they see this weakness. The Home -- Home Depot CEO said that, quote, \"Higher interest rates and greater macroeconomic uncertainty pressured consumer demand more broadly, resulting in weaker spend across home improvement projects.\" Specifically, they're saying that Americans are cutting back on a number of categories, including kitchen, bath, lighting, and flooring. And they say it's really for two reasons. It's concerns about rising unemployment. And that people are delaying certain projects where they'd have to borrow money because they're expecting the Fed will start to cut interest rates soon. So, Boris, it's just another reminder of some of the pressures that consumers are facing from prices and from borrowing costs, and how all of this is interconnected.",

Officials say the situation is improving, but firefighters are still working to put a number -- put out a number of hotspots.The threat has forced thousands of people to evacuate since Sunday. And now some of them are returning to see what's left at their homes. CNN's Eleni Giokos is in Greece near Athens. Eleni, how are residents describing this damage to you? ELENI GIOKOS, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I mean, it's been one of the most difficult days, frankly, for so many of the people that we met with today. They were relaying pain and trauma and just sheer shock in terms of what transpired over the last couple of days. And this is because of multiple things. Firstly, a fire that started very far away from where we are right now, around 40 kilometers away. It spread very quickly and was completely unpredictable, destroying everything in its path. In fact, it was just incredibly -- incredible to see some of the buildings that had engulfed, specifically the businesses and the homes that we came across. Some of the residents were describing a furnace that was playing out in over 24 hours. We just got off the phone with the fire department. They say that things have calmed down. You can tell that the wind has really subsided. That's after gale- force winds really assisted the fire to move rapidly across the city. It's been hard to breathe today. I have to say it feels like I'm in some kind of fireplace. It is just filled with soot. And I think the air quality has been dramatically impacted as well. Experts say that because so much forest area, 100,000 hectares have been burned just in this fire season, in this area in southeast Athens. And that is going to have a long-term effect. We're going to see prolonged heat waves in the city of Athens and it's changing its climates, where it's not only a global climate change issue, but also that the city of Athens and Greece as well. As more forest burns, that's going to have an adverse effect.",

And I mean, it's pretty shocking to think that the fires encroached to the basic point where we're seeing commercial activity, there's major concern.But we must also not underestimate that the suburbs, again, were major hubs. It came so close so that I think everyone was very worried about what that would mean down the line. They had helicopters and planes to try and douse out the fires. We also spoke to so many firefighters on the ground. Assistance came from the European Union as well. It was herculean efforts. I have to say, Jessica, in terms of what the people we saw today and the efforts on the ground. DEAN: No doubt about it. Our hearts are with so many of those who are both fighting the fires and those who've lost already so much. Eleni, thank you so much for that reporting. Boris?",
