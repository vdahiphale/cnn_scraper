And here's today's need to know. Pardon me. President Biden provoking a bipartisan backlash as he pardons his son, Hunter. Ceasefire strain, Israel strikes, quote, \"terror targets\" in Lebanon after Hezbollah launches projectiles into Israeli controlled territory. Tbilisi turmoil. Georgia's president says a crackdown on pro-European protesters violates their basic human rights. And Miami magic. Calling all artists, collectors, curators, and dealers to the final art flurry of the year. The Art Basel CEO will tell all plus what can possibly beat Sotheby's $6 million banana. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, a stunning reversal. President Biden pardoning his son, Hunter Biden, something he'd said he would never do. The younger Biden was due to be sentenced this month in the tax and gun cases against him. Now, with a sweeping pardon, he cannot be prosecuted for any possible federal crimes that may have been committed in the past 10 years. President Biden says, quote, \"In trying to break Hunter, they tried to break me.\" He also says, I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision. President-Elect Donald Trump calling it an abuse and miscarriage of justice. Michael Moore joins us now. Michael, good to have you with us. Just to be clear, this pardon is broadly crafted to cover both the tax and the gun offenses against Hunter Biden. Plus, it covers the decade of his tenure on the board of Burisma, which was the Ukrainian gas company and any work for China that was done in that interim period. This is broad.",

It is broad, but it's not, I don't think, unexpected for anybody who has listenedover the last, especially, couple of months to what Trump's plans are with his Justice Department and his FBI. And so, we watched as the Republicans in Congress sort of held these hearings. They held impeachment hearings and inquiries and everything else about Hunter Biden and Joe Biden came up with nothing. And so, it's became clear as well in recent days, and especially with some of the public comments that have been made by his nominees, that the Trump administration would continue to pursue Hunter Biden and everybody who had been a friend of Joe Biden and had worked in any way on the cases involving Trump. And so, I just don't think it's completely unexpected. You know, Biden had promised not to do it, but at the same time, there have been circumstances that changed, which I think probably justified his own decision to change his mind. He -- Trump won the election. These folks were nominated -- or are going to be nominated, they've been named, at least, to positions that could really be an abuse of power. So, I don't -- I'm just not that surprised to see this. He was completely within his prerogative as president to do it. The pardoning process is nothing that should be foreign to the Trump administration, Donald Trump, or anyone else associated with this.",

But again, I mean, when you think about pardons like to Mr. Kushner, that's a situation where, at this point now, if he's named to be ambassador in France, the Senate could consider that as well. So, we watched as the Trump administration pardoned people and granted clemency to individuals with like Mr. Manafort, Mr. Stone and we could go down the list, Mr. Kushner. So, again these are unique powers that a president has, and I would hate to see us deny people who may be certainly deserving of pardon consideration simply because we want to make some kind of reaction to the present circumstances, at least the present-day strife that we see in the quite partisan system that we're observing during this transition period.",

They've taken the whole of the City of Aleppo. This is Syria's second largest city. It is its industrial hub. It's a city that they never managed to fully take even back in 2012 when it was sort of the height of the Syrian opposition. Bashar al-Assad has been able to quash the rebellion. He's done that through his backers in the form of Iran, in the form of Hezbollah, in the form, most crucially, of Russia and its air force, which launched a blistering campaign from 2015 that effectively ended the Syrian uprising. Now, clearly, the tables have turned. Assad's proxies and supporters have been otherwise engaged or distracted with their own issues. But as to the question of what happens next, we simply don't know. The offensive continues, lots of speculation that the City of Hama could be next, that's Syria's fourth largest city in the center of the country, home to approximately 1 million people. Rebels tonight were putting out messages, basically telling ordinary citizens of Hama that they should avoid any contact with regime figures or regime forces. So, all eyes on that city next. But we are definitely seeing sort of the Russian forces, at least Russian airstrikes continuing and growing more intense, dozens of people killed in Idlib and in Aleppo Province today.

So, there's not a lot of love for Bashar al-Assad among a huge swath of Syria's population. At the same time, I think there is a lot of uneasiness as well about the makeup of these various different rebel factions. Some of them have ties -- or, you know, one of them was literally in allegiance with Al Qaeda. It has since disavowed that connection, but still, strong militant Islamist contingencies. And so, a lot of people, I think, feeling slightly queasy about this moment.

The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P hittingfresh records on the first trading day of this new month. All this after a November to remember. With stocks posting their best monthly gains of the year, Tesla, of course, a big winner Monday rising almost 3.5 percent, but a setback for Elon Musk after the closing bell, a judge in the U.S. State of Delaware once again rejecting Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay package awarded by company shareholders earlier this year.

Chinese stocks rallying as factory activity there hit its highest levels since April. Australian stocks also finishing at record highs too. And in other business news, two troubled companies, two sudden CEO departures, the heads of chip giant Intel and car colossus Stellantis, both announcing they're stepping down with immediate effect. Shares of both firms losing roughly half of their value this year. Take a look at that performance. Intel head Pat Gelsinger criticized for his slow response to the A.I. boom. Stellantis boss, Carlos Tavares, reportedly clashed with the board of directors over his cost cutting strategy. Paul La Monica joins us now. He's senior markets analyst, writer -- analysis writer at Barron's. One day I'll get it right. Paul, great to have you on the show. Let's start with Pat Gelsinger. I do like Pat and I feel sorry for him. It's really tough when NVIDIA is your competition and you're constantly being badgered about how you're going to recapture market share and catch up or narrow the gap with a giant like that. And obviously, manufacturing chips was his way forward and he took money from the Chips Act. What do we make of this decision, because it was a tough, tough industry and a tough fight back? PAUL R. LA MONICA, SENIOR MARKETS ANALYSIS WRITER, BARRON'S:  Yes. I mean, let's be honest here, Julia. Intel was once the, you know, unavowed, you know, the undisputed leader, the king of the semiconductor industry, but that was back in a time where a lot of the most high-end chips were being used for PCs and servers. And that's maybe not a bygone era, but A.I. is what really matters at this point. And as you alluded to NVIDIA is the leader there, but even within PCs and servers, Intel has lost ground to AMD to ARM. So, there are rivals that have really caught up to Intel from a technological standpoint, and that has hurt the company. And I think Pat Gelsinger is the fall guy as a result of that. And, you know, don't forget also Intel tried to become more of a player in selling -- you know, making chips for other companies like Taiwan Semiconductor, but they lagged in that business on the fabrication side as well. So, really, it's been a tough go for Intel for a long time. And I think, you know, the chip company is deciding, yet again, they need to go with another executive because, you know, it's been a rotating, revolving door until for the past couple of years, really, where, you know, going back to when Paul Ottolini was the CEO. Since then, there's really not been a lot of stability.",

It's sort of reminiscent of what we saw back in 2014 with Ukraine in some respects. Where does this lead? Because the government kind of has two choices. It can sort of follow in that path, and it can confirm what the voters are asking for and want, or we can continue to see more violent crackdowns, and they risk them being compared to, I guess, the government in Belarus.",

Over the last two years, it's passed a slew of Russian style legislation, branding western-backed NGOs and media outlets as foreign agents and in a move that's really reminiscent of what the Kremlin's done to silence domestic dissent there. They've basically introduced some of the most swinging restrictions on the LGBTQ plus community, insisting that, you know, same sex relationships be censored out of content, because they supposedly fly in the face of Georgian values. We -- you have some of the Georgian Dream leaders, you know, using very, very similar language to that we hear coming from the Kremlin. So, I think that decision about where the government wants to go and it's signaling it's going to go has already been made. But I think the reason that things are kicking off now is because at the same time, they've always said, well, we'll be joining the E.U. by 2030, which as you point out, something that the vast majority of Georgians support, you know, it's a country that fought a war with Russia when Moscow invaded in 2008. There is no love lost between your average Georgian and Moscow. So, people really have started to feel like now is the time that they have to make their voice heard. And I think it's very clear the governing Georgian Dream Party doesn't want to step down, is going to refuse to call new elections, has rejected the insistence from, for example, the European Parliament in Brussels that it holds a new vote under international supervision because of alleged irregularities and that they're going to continue on with their course of action. And I think that basically puts the government and the people on a collision course.",

And what they're getting is kind of thoughts and prayers from Brussels, you know, condemnation, but not much else. The U.S. has actually gone much further and introduced sanctions on Georgian Dream politicians, on police officers that it says are responsible for a crackdown on -- and breaches of human rights. So, I think what a lot of Georgians want to see is the E.U. actually follows suit and put its kind of money where its mouth is. We have seen a small number of European countries, particularly Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, introduce specific targeted restrictions on Georgian Dream politicians. So, there is some momentum building in the bloc, but NATO ministers are -- defense ministers from across NATO member states are due to meet here in Brussels tomorrow, and it's expected that that's an issue that's going to be discussed on the sidelines. But I think at the same time, you know, there is an awareness that a Trump presidency probably does mean less interest in human rights breaches or, you know, protection for democracy and the rule of law in places like Georgia. It -- there's just not a sense that the White House will be interested in the region, let alone have a strong opinion on it. And actually, I think now the message that policymakers are hearing in Brussels is that Europe needs to step up, and Georgia is the right place to start doing that, I think.",

They're in the midst of an absolute crisis, which I think many football fans around the country, and perhaps around Europe, will be enjoying with a sense of schadenfreude because Man City have just had the run of the place for so long now. But they're in a real rut, and Liverpool are just going from strength to strength. And you talk about how well they're doing in the Premier League, Julia. They're doing absolutely brilliantly in the Champions League, too. They're the only team in who's won every game in the tournament so far this year. So, they're bossing it in the Premier League, they're bossing it in Europe as well. And this just was an absolute delight for the Liverpool fans at Anfield on Sunday. Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah combining for a 2-nil win against the team that has won six league titles out of the last seven years. The Liverpool fans just couldn't resist taunting. The City manager Pep Guardiola there, they were saying you're going to be sacked in the morning, which of course he won't be, and he just reminded them that he has won half a dozen league titles in the last few years. All good fun. But it is just looking so rosy for Liverpool at the moment. And Man City do really seem to be out of it, which is quite a bold thing to say given that we're just in the first few days of December, but they have so many issues, so many injury concerns, and they really are just struggling for any kind of form right now. It's hard to see that City will be mounting a challenge. Liverpool perhaps need to worry about Arsenal, who are, I was going to say they're hot on their heels, they're not really, they're nine points back, but Arsenal are a very, very strong team. They've come very close to winning the title themselves in the last couple of years. So, Liverpool need to look out for them. But it's certainly a great time to be a Red.",
