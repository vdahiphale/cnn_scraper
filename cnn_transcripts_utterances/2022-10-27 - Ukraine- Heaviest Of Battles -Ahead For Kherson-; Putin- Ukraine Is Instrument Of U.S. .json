Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM.With Ukrainian forces closing in, poorly-trained Russian troops are preparing for the battle over the occupied city of Kherson. Plus, ISIS now says it's responsible for the Wednesday attack on a Shia holy site in Iran. The latest on the blast just ahead. And later, how Uganda is working to slow the deadly Ebola outbreak throughout the country. We'll have a live report from Africa. Ukrainian forces are gearing up for a crucial fight against Russian troops eight months into Vladimir Putin's war of choice. Well, first Ukraine reports a number of Russian strikes in the Kyiv region early Thursday but so far, no casualties. Meanwhile, an advisor to Ukraine's president says the heaviest of battles lie ahead in the southern port city of Kherson. A Ukrainian counter offensive has forced Russia into a defensive posture there. It's sending in its newest recruits, which Kyiv's military intelligence describes as cannon fodder. Kherson was the first Ukrainian city to falter Putin's troops and it's the largest still under Russian control. More now from CNN's Fred Pleitgen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Ukrainian forces trying to hit the Russians on all fronts. This motor unit firing in the north of the country. While in the south, Kyiv is continuing a counteroffensive trying to capture the Russian occupied city of Harrison. We met up with an artillery unit on the battlefield. PLEITGEN (on camera): The soldiers tell us there's firing going on here pretty much every day several times a day. The frontline is not very far from where we are at all. It's a couple of kilometers in that direction. And right now, there's not very much movement on that front line. But still, the situation is very dangerous. PLEITGEN (voice over): Ukraine's defense minister says Kyiv's counter offensive here is complicated by wet weather in the area. But the commander says he believes in the end they will oust the Russians. BANDERAS, UKRAINIAN ARTILLERY COMMANDER (through translator): I know one thing for sure. We will never step back from here. We have no other choice only forward. Ukraine has to get back all its territory and borders.",

On September 20, Nika was a high-profile figure at the protests and known personality on social media. She stood on bins chanting for the crowds. Official say that within 24 hours, she would be dead. Nika, joined a growing list of young women who have lost their lives in recent weeks, as protests have swept Iran.And authorities have waged a violent crackdown in response. The Iranian government has made a series of shifting claims first saying that her death had \"no connection to the protests, but that she was thrown from a roof. And then on Wednesday, a new claim from the judiciary that it was suicide. On the basis of our investigation using over 50 videos from that night. And speaking to those with her that evening, CNN can reveal that some of Nika's final hours was spent at the protests including evidence that suggests she was chased and detained by security just a few hours before the state says she died. The first videos we found of Nika on the 20th are here at 7:00 p.m. As protest heats up, Nika can be seen right at the front, throwing rocks at a formation of uniformed officers easily recognized she was brave, not even frightened eyewitnesses said. At this stage in the evening Nika is here by Laleh Park. Then as more officers arrive, witnesses say Nika starts to move away from them. First along Keshavarz Boulevard and then down Vesal Shirazi Street, where she's seen making a phone call just before 8:00 p.m. As it gets dark the police crackdown intensifies. Moving into Nika's new location. Evidence of injuries start emerging and protesters are seen being detained apparently by plainclothes officers. One person told CNN they saw security forces hitting women and putting them in police vans. In the midst of this heightened violence scene and found a video of Nika still at the center of the protests. It's 8:37 p.m. and the last known video of her. Don't move, don't move. She shouts as she crouches between cars to hide from authorities. The person filming from the car told CNN that shortly afterwards Nika was taken by several large-bodied security forces and bundled into a van. POLGLASE (on camera): By this point in the evening, police were everywhere. Videos we've geo located to the scene show police to the south and also to the north of Nika. It means when she was crouching in traffic, she was completely surrounded. POLGLASE (voice over): By the next morning she would be dead according to this death certificate, first obtained by BBC Persian and verified by CNN, which shows she died from multiple injuries caused by being hit with a hard object and as dated September 21st. But Nika's family would not learn of her death for another 10 days. Meanwhile, both Nika's mother and aunt have said in interviews that credible sources told them that for days during that window, Nika was in state custody. The Iranian authorities released this CCTV footage, claiming Nika died after being thrown from this building later the same night. In an incident they say was unconnected to the protests. They made no claim about who allegedly threw her. And CNN cannot verify the person is Nika, nor the day it was filmed. Nika's mother has publicly disputed this footage saying it's not her daughter. And it's hard to square this calm walk with the evidence we have of Nika being chased by police and detained just a few hours earlier. Iranian officials have not responded to CNN's inquiry as to whether she was ever in custody in the hours leading up to her death. What is certain though is that Nika was a prominent activist at the center of a police crackdown on the protests that night. Katie Polglase, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Starmer didn't waste too much time on celebration and pleasantries though before he started asking hard questions. To begin with, revolving around Sunak's reappointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary. So far his most controversial appointment since becoming prime minister. That's because Braverman was fired as home secretary six days before her reappointment. She was sacked by Liz Truss for a security breach. So there have been questions raised and eyebrows by the Labor Party and other opposition parties as to whether or not there was some kind of deal made behind the scenes between Sunak and Braverman. But in terms of giving his party more confidence and more enthusiasm for the prime minister and the direction of the party, Sunak seems to have delivered. It was interesting to see him go up against Keir Starmer as both politicians have some similarities in terms of their communication style, known for being serious, having a good grasp of the brief and detail watching them go toe to toe. It seems that Sunak may be able to get his wish which he said at the beginning of this prime minister's questions which was to have serious grown up exchanges with the leader of the opposition.

Given Europe is the middle of an energy crisis, that may seem surprising. In some senses, it just shows how hard Europe has worked to bolster its gas supplies before winter, secured more LNG to make up for the shortfall from Russia, who it used to rely on for around 40 percent of its natural gas.Demand is also lower than years passed right now due to milder temperatures. But there's no doubt that the E.U. has smashed its target for gas storage. It wanted facilities to be 80 percent full by November 1st, they're well 90 percent full now. Unfortunately, this may be where the good news ends. This chart shows you how prices have a fallen, but in many ways, it also reflects Europe's limitations. Europe simply has more gas right now than it knows what to do with. Limited LNG terminals and infrastructure, and storage facilities, which means, it's actually struggling to accept more LNG right now. And according to data firm, Dotexa (ph), as many as 35 LNG vessels are either floating or slowly sailing towards parts in northwestern Europe and Iberian Peninsula because there's simply nowhere for them to off- load in Europe. And while slower prices and high levels of shortage are a reason to celebrate right now, we're looking towards the start of next year, prices start to rise again. Anna Stewart, CNN, London.",

The only thing I can say about that is that sometimes when they do hire these interim coaches, the head coach has the option to have an assistant head coach, and sometimes that assistant, again, which is the head coach's decision, it's his decision to hire that assistant head coach to come in and sometimes it is.
