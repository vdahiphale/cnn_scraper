Netanyahu says victory over Hamas will not be possible without that long plant offensive on the last of Hamas leadership and infrastructure.

But it would in essence, be the same kind of thing where you don't bring as much firepower to the battle, but you bring what you need, you have very precise intelligence, and you do the kinds of things you need to do to in essence, cut off the leadership of Hamas and eliminate it. That would be the preferred American alternative.

She's already started recruiting from the 700,000-strong settler community of Israel. We're just arrived having now at a settlement in the Occupied West Bank and we're heading to a talk that Daniella Weiss is giving to a group of people who are potentially interested in resettling Gaza. \"We are for the land of Israel and Ben-Gvir,\" she says. About 20 people gather in the living room of a family's home. Weiss knows that for many in this community, there is deep nostalgia for Gush Katif, a bloc of 21 Israeli settlements that there were forcibly evacuated by the IDF in 2005 when Israel left the Gaza Strip. \"This is the vision of Gaza,\" she says. \"You see all the nucleus groups.\" A map has already been drawn up. Six groups laying claim to different parts of the enclave. So they've just been handing out these little booklets that say people of Israel return home, and then underneath, a call to return to the settlements of Gaza. One of the organizers tells the group they have a representative flying to Florida to raise money. Nachala gets support from a number of groups in the U.S. including AFSI, Americans For a Safe Israel, which co-sponsored a recent webinar on the return to Gush Katif, even as the Biden administration has cracked down on settlements in the West Bank.",
