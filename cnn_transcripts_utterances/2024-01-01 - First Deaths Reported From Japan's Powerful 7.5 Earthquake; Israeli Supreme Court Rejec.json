In fact, food was delivered on board. But there is this bigger question about this rescue effort. The sun is starting to rise in Japan. Perhaps we'll get a better idea as to what the day ahead will hold. But infrastructure is going to be a very big challenge. We have roads that were cracked, as we saw in Brian's report. We have highways that are damaged. Moving people, moving rescue supplies, moving the basics like food and water from point A to point B is going to be complicated. Right now, Japan's army has 1,000 soldiers helping out on this effort. An additional 8,500 have also been put on standby. In addition we heard from the U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, who says American troops, because of the sizable American military presence in Japan, will be able to help. And then, Brianna, there is this other question about people who may be stranded, who may be stuck, who may be homeless. This happened in the middle of the day.

These are the equivalent of the closest thing that Israel has to a constitution. It is significant because it's a blow to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, which made this judicial overhaul almost like a flagship project of its coalition government. This is the one part of this judicial overhaul it managed to pass and now this has been struck down by the Supreme Court. I suppose the third big implication is, before this war with Hamas, which began with the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7th, it seems like a life take away now, but before then, the only thing that seemed to matter that was on everybody's mind was this judicial overhaul. There were tens of thousands, sometimes more than 100,000 protesters out on the streets every week protesting the government's plans for this judicial overhaul because of their concerns that it would do irreparable damage to Israel's democracy. On one occasion, and I was on the streets at the time, the defense minister resigned -- or was fired, excuse me, as a result of his encouragement with Netanyahu to scale back these plans. That sacking was quietly forgotten. So quite a few implications that could reopen these major divisions in Israeli society while it's fighting a war. We have yet to hear from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as to what his response will be. Will he abide by this ruling -- Brianna?",

They can go back to their families, their work, their communities.The government is saying this is to allow them to rest and recuperate and retrain and give a bit of a boost to the economy, which is really suffering with so many key workers and managers being involved in the war. What this could also mean is that we may see low-intensity fighting in parts of the Gaza Strip, maybe in the northern part where it's almost job done from Israel's perspective in terms of destroying Hamas' infrastructure. But I think any hopes for a lower intensification in other parts may be dashed. Certainly, if we listen to what Netanyahu and his government say, which is that this war will continue until they reach the objective of destroying Hamas and getting the hostages home -- Brianna?",

He already said that the Supreme Court decision today has to be respected. Yair Lapid, a former coalition member, has said the same thing. Two, I don't think he has the credibility and support of the Israeli public to split the country even further by ignoring or going against the Supreme Court decision.

And so I think psychologically, all have this really vicious cycle of retaliation is even more devastating. So beginning with Ukraine, it was hit across the country, once again, in at least four different cities, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia. And that wave of attacks by the Russians was apparently in retaliation for an attack that Ukraine carried out on the Russian city of Belgorod, in which they killed some 24 people.So it is really at this point, I think you'd have to say, and judging by what President Putin said, this is not going to end soon at all. Putin is intent on using everything that they've been saving up all of the missiles, drones, et cetera, for an all out attack that he says is going to continue for a long time.",

Specifically, he did talk about the training that Ukrainian pilots are getting on the F-16s. That won't take effect for a while though.He talked about the steps for joining the European Union. And interestingly, he did not talk about the big issue of getting that $60 billion that the U.S. Congress still has not appropriated. And then President Putin I would say, very militaristic, we are united. We will never back down. It was really kind of, I'd say a full steam ahead, trying to get his people united for what he feels, I think will be a long battle too. And don't forget, you know, in March, Brianna, there's an election in Russia. And so he will be up for reelection. There's no question that he will win it. But he wants to give the impression to his people that he is a strong leader. And that's why he had this really tough guy type of speech.",

Right now, if anything, though, has taught us in politics in the last several years is that we should expect the unexpected, so who knows.But if Donald Trump wins in Iowa by a healthy margin, if he wins in New Hampshire by a healthy margin, I think the question is going to be, does Nikki Haley drop out before being incredibly embarrassed in her home state of South Carolina? Because Scott just said it, right now, Trump is crushing in South Carolina. And I still think that Nikki Haley's flub on the Civil War is going to be deeply hurtful for her in the Live Free or Die state because of the history there that I don't think she may be thought of when she flubbed that answer. I mean, let's remember that in New Hampshire during the time of the Civil War, a 10th of New Hampshire men were fighting in the Union Army, and a lot of them died for the exact cause of the civil war that Nikki Haley pretended not to know anything about. So I think that's going to hurt her more than people think. And so again, the question for her is going to be that she dropped out. If she does, it's done. Donald Trump has it in hand.",

Those people, she needs them. She's been asking for them to come in. If they have concerns because of the episode that Maria reference, that could be a situation.They're also in Iowa, don't forget, you can actually go in and caucus, whichever party you want and what the Democrats not doing a caucus in Iowa. Was she hoping to possibly get a few non-Republicans to caucus for her in Iowa and pop up a little bit? Maybe that gave them some pause. I don't know how you'd measure it at this point exactly.

I mean, the reason the remarks about the Civil War are potentially a problem for Haley for exactly the reason that Scott and Maria said. It's not so much driving away Republicans is preventing independence from crossing over is because it does feed a, you know, the biggest wrap on her as a candidate, that she tries to be all things to all people that she won't take a clear stand on key issues in the party, including whether she believes Trump is fit to be president.So Sununu is right, in one sense that if Christie got out waters are probably going to go to Haley overwhelmingly, but Christie is certainly right that if he got out, there might not be anybody making a strong case against Donald Trump, as he's been doing.",
