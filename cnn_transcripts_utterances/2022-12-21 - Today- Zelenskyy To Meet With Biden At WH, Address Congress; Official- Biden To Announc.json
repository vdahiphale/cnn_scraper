      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm Pamela Brown in for John King. A historic day as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy heads to Washington D.C. on tap a meeting with President Biden and an address to Congress. His message, Ukraine needs more support to fend off Russia.Also happening today, the January 6 committee is expected to release its final report. In just moments from now Chairman Bennie Thompson will take to the House floor. And of course, we will bring that to you live. And this is happening as the committee is accusing a former Trump ethics lawyer, at telling star witness Cassidy Hutchinson to give misleading testimony. And the Biden administration telling the Supreme Court let Title 42 end, but there's a caveat. They want more time to prepare for an influx of migrants. Up first, a dramatic surprise visit for the first time since Russia attacked Ukraine 300 days ago, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is making a trip outside of his war-torn country. The leader is on his way to the United States to meet with President Joe Biden, who tweeted this morning, I hope you're having a good flight Volodymyr. I'm thrilled to have you here much to discuss. And part of that discussion, Biden will announce nearly $2 billion in additional security assistance to Ukraine. Zelenskyy will also deliver a primetime address to Congress as lawmakers consider an additional $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine. All of this, while Russian attacks intensify against the Ukrainian people heading into the winter. So, let's go straight to MJ Lee at the White House. MJ, tell us more about this historic visit?",

      "sentences": "Well, Pam, we certainly expect this visit to be very heavy on symbolism. Here is a Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a wartime president who is coming to the United States. It's the first time he has left the country since the invasion began back in February to try to rally the American public and really the rest of the world to try to continue supporting the war and Ukrainian efforts to fight the Russian aggression.And I should point out that is a shared goal by President Biden. He too has been trying to rally international partners to continue supporting Ukrainian efforts. And to that end, we know that he is going to be unveiling a new aid package that amounts to some $1.8 billion. That of course, is going to include that Patriot missile system that is incredibly sophisticated, and that Ukrainians have been asking for so long. And I think we can't overstate just what a pivotal moment in the war this visit is coming on. U.S. officials have said and have made clear around this visit, that they are entering a new phase in this war that the kinds of weapons that are being used on the ground, that they have changed the ways in which Russia is attacking Ukraine that they have changed as well. And the question of just exactly how this war is finally going to come to an end. That is expected to be a topic of discussion, of course, for these two leaders. U.S. officials have made very clear in recent days that they simply do not see Vladimir Putin as somebody who is interested in engaging in diplomacy, who is interested in ending this war anytime soon. Now, I will just note in terms of the schedule, Zelenskyy is only going to be on U.S. soil for just a number of hours. He will be at the White House this afternoon, and then heads to Capitol Hill, where he will be delivering remarks in the evening, Pam?",

I mean, this is going to be an important symbol as lawmakers are considering passing that huge spending bill at the end of the year that includes additional assistance for Ukraine. Some of the members in this audience tonight are going to be people who are going to vote against that legislation. A lot of conservatives were being asked by their leadership not to support the huge spending bill that would fund the government through next year.So that is an important element of all of this. Also underscoring this is this House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is probably last time inviting a foreign dignitary to address the House of Representatives and lawmakers in this joint meeting. It's significant also because Pelosi wrote today to members that for her personally, her father was actually in the House of Representatives in 1941 when Churchill came and addressed, Congress asking for more support in the war in Europe. So obviously, the symbolism here is really heavy on Capitol Hill. And it's really an important moment for the speaker herself as she prepares to leave that position and step down from that post. [12:05:00] BROWN: All right, Lauren. Lauren Fox, appreciate it. And joining me now to further discuss Leon Panetta, a former Defense Secretary and former CIA Director under President Obama, and also the former Clinton White House Chief of Staff. Also joining us, CNN national security analyst Beth Sanner and former Deputy Director of National Intelligence. Thank you both for coming on. Director, I want to start with you on this because as we've been discussing, there's huge symbolism here and importance of this visit. And it's coming at a time that the U.S. assistance to Ukrainians that support is being tested. How critical is the timing of this visit?",

As we keep hearing from analysts and experts and the administration, Russia has no intention of peacefully ending this war. The U.S. is already committing $1.8, nearly $2 billion that's expected to be announced soon. Adding to nearly $20 billion, that's on top of the $46 billion in the omnibus.

I think that if we can have a message at the end of this day, that says the United States and our allies are strongly unified behind President Zelenskyy. I think that's an important message to send to the world and to send to Putin. BROWN: And we have learned through our reporting, our fantastic White House team reporting that earlier in December that President Obama when he was talking - President Obama - President Biden, when he was talking to President Zelenskyy invited him to come visit the White House, because as the administration has said, this is a new era in this war.

And as you know, Pamela, over the last year and a half, this committee has gathered an enormous amount of evidence, including over thousand interviews, documents, emails, phone records and texts. We've seen some of what they've gathered during those hearings over the summer and earlier this week. But now they're going to present their findings in this final report.But as you noted, the biggest news today, and over the next few weeks will likely come from the transcripts. The committee is expected to release of some of the interviews they've conducted behind closed doors. This is really the next phase of the investigation. The committee they're done. Now these transcripts are going to move into the hands of prosecutors and defense attorneys. Now source tells CNN that special counsel Jack Smith, sent a letter to the committee earlier this month requesting all of the information from this investigation. And the committee according to CNN reporting has been sending documents and transcripts in the last week. And it's interesting because this handoff has been really focused on evidence related to former Trump attorney John Eastman, and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. The Justice Department even has Meadows' text messages, which you may remember yielded some of the biggest headlines so far in this investigation. Now, I've been talking to former President Trump's legal team. And they also want to see these transcripts, because they believe there have been witnesses that have given testimony that undercut the committee's narrative, and they believe some of that was excluded from the public hearings. So, Pamela, amid all the controversy, there is in fact, yes, one thing that all people on all sides have this, prosecutors, Trump attorneys, even the lawmakers who are hostile to this committee, they all agree that they want to see these transcripts. The Committee Chairman tell CNN, they will release hundreds of transcripts, but there are some witnesses with some sensitive material that they have agreed to protect.",

But that is a significant part of this.TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION: And it's significant. And particularly, because this lawyer prior to joining the Trump administration, was working in Georgia where his reputation was helping Republican lawmakers staying on the right side of ethics and stay out of trouble. So, what he's being accused of doing, according to the CNN reporting is very troubling, and could get him in some trouble, you know, with the bar and things like that. I think what we're also going to learn from this committee report isn't just what people said, but what they didn't say. Who pled the fifth? Who had their attorney there stopping them from saying too much? And that didn't always get touched on as much in the hearings, but the transcripts will really lay that out in ways that may be enlightening.",

And what potentially didn't, right, I mean, that's a big part of this.I do want to mention Stefan Passantino's statement he gave to CNN. He said, I represented Miss Hutchinson, honorably, ethically and fully consistent with her sole interests. As she communicated them to me, I believed Miss Hutchinson was being truthful and cooperative with the committee throughout the several interview sessions in which I represented her. So clearly, he believes nothing was wrong. The committee looks at it in another way. We're going to see the transcript soon.

This came up in some of the hearings over the summer and into the fall. So, I think one of the things that people will be looking at, like Tia said, is just a number of people who said, I don't recall. I remember the committee at one point played testimony from Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser where he took the fifth. And so, I don't recall over and over about very basic detail. So, I think instances like that are going to be very telling and who cooperated and to what degree they feel people in Trump world were trying to influence people's testimony or the details that they did or didn't reveal.",

So, it wasn't just turf battles, why the Justice Department is seeking this evidence. There's a legal relevance to it. And they can get a lot of trouble if in fact, they come across something that they've been investigating. It's new to them that, you know, that contradict something they'd had. So, they really needed these transcripts to be able to conduct prosecutions and investigations. They're really going to be poring over them now.

So, there are still others in his orbit who are sort of at the center of this investigation. But I think as we pause here nearly at the end of the year, everything that we have learned from this committee, yes, some Republicans can say it's been a politicized. Well, that was Kevin McCarthy's decision for the makeup of this committee. So, we have learned so much, and there's no doubt that it contributed to the midterm elections.
