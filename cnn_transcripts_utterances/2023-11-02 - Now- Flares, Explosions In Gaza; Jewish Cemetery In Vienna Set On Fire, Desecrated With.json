I mean, Israel is obviously escalating right now, it's unlikely to back down until the job is done. And it's difficult to see that if they now entered the face of capturing Gaza, how that pause can come about, which means that the humanitarian sets of issues, and the pressures that the United States is facing in terms of how to manage this conflict and the fallout around the region is going to be all that much more difficult.",

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yeah, that's potentially right, Wolf, and what you're seeing is something that would be possible when you have the beginning of an air campaign. Now, in this particular case, we've had a lot of activity from the Israelis through the last week or so, and this is an escalation of that. As far as the type of weapons that they are using, you know, it looks like they are using various types of precision guided munitions. Potentially there is also potentially some artillery there, but Nic Robertson has a closer view obviously than I do. As we're looking at, this there's some very key elements that seem to be part of the air campaign, Wolf, and that air campaign is clearly designed to not only soften up the target, but in this case really make it impossible for the Hamas fighters to stay in their positions.

We believe that this is the town of Beit Hanoun, it's about two and a half miles from where we are standing right now, and what appears to be happening is that the IDF has been on the outside of this very dense urban environment, it appears to be making some kind of assault on it. It's been on the relatively heavy air assault for the past three weeks, but now we have witnessed a lot of layers coming down for about half an hour.Those flares we have seen coming down now we have not witnessed a number of players illuminating the area like this for such a sustained period in the almost for weeks now that we have been here in Sderot, watching the IDF forces in action in Gaza. So, this is different, there appears to be a smokescreen on the ground as well. It all appears to indicate that the IDF is trying to sort of move forces in and around Beit Hanoun. Earlier this evening, the IDF said that they had now surrounded the larger nearby city of Gaza City. That's about six and a half miles from where we're standing. That's a little bit to the south of Beit Hanoun, that they had surrounded that, indicating almost that they have potentially cut off the northern part of Gaza Strip from the southern part of Gaza Strip. That the activity has eased off now, but we've been watching not only flares, not only smokescreens on the ground. I'm hearing fighter jets. We're still seeing huge flashes and illuminations. So if I'm hearing a fighter jets, we'll probably hear the explosions momentarily from those flashes. That's very likely missiles that are being dropped in and around that area right now. We've been hearing artillery fire, booming coming from positions around, them behind us landing in Gaza City. We've also seen in the midst of all of this, Wolf, we have seen Hamas fire rockets out of Gaza City. We've heard the Iron Dome, and seeing them interceptors take it down what appeared to be two rockets being fired out of Gaza. What is happening precisely on the ground right now, we do not know. But the IDF has described this area is the enemies stronghold, that the Hamas there has effectively been using armor piercing rocket propelled grenades, fired at tank crews and infantry troops in armored fighting vehicles, the IDF by the day's been slowly notching up the death toll of troops. This is a very, very dangerous conflict. Not just for the IDF, let's remember, Wolf, there are many civilians in there right now, in fear, suffering, as they have been caught unfortunately, as the IDF would say, collateral damage in this ongoing offensive against Hamas.",

Now, this is oftentimes a town that's very much in the front line and oftentimes, early on when there's a flare up between Israel and Gaza, many of the people lead that town because it's very dangerous.But, nonetheless, it's really, if you take into account the difficulty as an invading force of going through this town because there's a lot more ahead of you before you actually get to Gaza City. So, this is really just the first step and what is going to be a very bloody and difficult battle for the Israelis, but let's not forget the civilians who are really caught in the middle, and watching what's going on, hearing that the Israelis have encircled Gaza City, I'm reminded of what happened here in Beirut in 1982. Israeli surrounded west Beirut, they had control of the sea and air and all the entrance and exits to the city. But they were very hesitant to go inside because of the difficulty of urban warfare, where your advantage in terms of armor for instance is oftentimes reduced because of the difficulty of maneuvering, and narrow streets, refugee camps particularly here in Beirut in 1982. So it's difficult to say how far the Israelis are going to go, how far they're going to want to go given the problems they -- the challenges they can encounter as they go in to really build up areas. Beit Hanoun compared to other parts of Gaza is relatively un-crowded, and therefore this is really just the first step in 1,000-mile journey -- Wolf.",

While hundreds of foreign nationals are making their way out of Gaza, millions of folks in Gaza simply can't leave, including the 242 hostages these really defense forces say are there, taken by Hamas during the terrorist strike against Israel. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz has more what we saw earlier today inside of Gaza before sundown. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The victims of Jabalia, victimized yet again. Some of the survivors of Israel's bombardment took shelter here, a U.N. school, home to be cut down, desperate moments after in Israeli strike nearby showed on social media. This is one of four schools and Gaza impacted by strikes in the 24- hour period, the U.N. said, in total, housing some 20,000 displaced people. Many of them frightened young children. What did we do, this boy cries, we did nothing wrong. The living conditions in these shelters are unbearable, but families come here for safety. That too is gone. Bring me my son, bring me my son, this father screams. It's unclear if his child is dead or alive. Three straight days of airstrikes in Jabalia have brought horror and bloodshed. CNN has reached out to the idea for comment on the latest attacks. Israel says it is targeting Hamas infrastructure in this densely populated residential area. And it says it killed a senior Hamas commander with the strike on Tuesday. But with scores of civilians believed, killed the U.N. Human Rights Council warns what you see here are disproportionate attacks that could amount to a war crime. Gazans don't understand why the world can't stop this. We keep pulling out bodies, small children, women. It is a catastrophe, this man says. If the countries of the world had any shame, we would not be in the situation. And more suffering is all but certain. Israeli troops are inching closer, and as ground forces backed by near constant air raids move towards central Gaza, the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians hang in the balance. The IDF has warned all residents in the north of the strip to leave, an order deemed inhumane and impossible by the United Nations, so many remain in the crossfire. Where is the world? This woman screams. Her children are being torn up before our eyes. And with the death toll mounting, pressure is growing on the U.S. and Israel to stem the violence. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London.
