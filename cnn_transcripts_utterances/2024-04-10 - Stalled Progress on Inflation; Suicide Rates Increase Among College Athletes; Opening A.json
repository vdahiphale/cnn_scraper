      "sentences": "Yes, the markets don't like it. So, inflation on an annual basis, this is CPI core - consumer price index, increasing more than we expected. Also increasing more than the prior month at a - at a rate of about 3.5 percent. The same sort of trend on a monthly basis, 0.4 percent.Two really big takeaways from this report, John. One, as you said, it appears that inflation is stalling. Definitely not the direction that we were looking for or hoping for. And, two, the likelihood of a rate cut in June is looking real iffy after this report. And so you can sort of see the path of inflation. I want to take a look at some of the components. And if you look sort of under the hood of the report and look at sort of where we're still seeing prices go up, gas prices and shelter were the really big components in March. This was more than half of the increase we saw. So, gas prices continue to go up. And shelter. We had been hoping to get some relief on shelter. Shelter you think rent, you think the price of - to put a roof over your head. So those prices continue to go up. Food, modestly, but that actually seems to be perhaps some - some good news there that food is only going up modestly at this point. We did see some declines, right? So, if you were in the market for a new car, you might like what you see here. So, we saw prices for new cars and trucks go down. Used cars and trucks go down quite a bit, 1.1 percent is - that's not nothing, right? And then airline fares also going down as well. A few things to put this in perspective. So, we have gone from, John, and you and I have talked about this a lot over the last six months or so. We went from rate cuts are absolutely coming in 2024.",

And that really set off some alarm bells on Wall Street and really set off some alarm bells. And now I've actually seen economists after this report this morning say the Fed's next move may be a rate hike.So, we have really gone from absolutely seeing rate cuts to March to June to now being like maybe the July meeting, hopefully the July meeting, because essentially what we're seeing is a still-strong economy. You have really strong job growth. You have consumers who continue to spend and yet inflation is moving sideways. It's stalling. So, it's not what - certainly not what the Fed wants to see. Yes, they want to see it dropping to 2 percent. They see it stalled out at that 3.4, 3.5 rate. You saw that line graph before when it was flat.",

The psychological impacts of injury and possibly losing your scholarship and the pressure to perform academically and athletically. But this rise in suicide that we see among athletes really reflects, on a broader scale, the rise of suicide we're seeing among young people in general. When you look at the data across the United States, suicide is the second leading cause of death for ages ten to 12, the third leading cause of death for ages 15 to 24, and the second leading cause for ages 25 to 34. So, this is a growing public health concern for the nation as a whole. And this study really highlights the impact it's having specifically on NCAA athletes at this moment, Kate.",

These are real people.And it was in 2018 that Lori Vallow lived in Arizona with her husband. Chad Daybell lived in Idaho with his wife. In 2019 they met at a religious LDS conference. Chad Daybell was really a leader in what is called an extremist sect of the LDS church, which is the doomsday philosophy. That the world is going to end. And Lori signed on and it is the belief, and they shared this, this will be evidenced in the trial, that the people are filled with spirits. Some people. And those people Lori referred to them legal documents have as \"zombies.\" Those people need to be killed because it is God's will. In 2019, Lori's husband in Arizona was killed. Several months later, no charges. She moves to Idaho where Chad lives with his wife. Her two children, in September, they were last seen alive, they were gone, they were missing, but nobody really knew about it. In October of 2019, Chad's wife, she's found dead in her bed. While the children are missing, they go to Arizona. They go to Hawaii. They get married. They're on a honeymoon. There are lays. There are poolside visits. Suddenly, investigation. She's arrested. She's brought back to Idaho on child endangerment. The children still aren't found. Chad ultimately goes. They are found buried on Chad Daybell's property, her two children, Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow, 16 and seven years old. They were buried on his property. Now, she was convicted last year, three consecutive life terms. He is now charged with the death penalty and three murders of his wife, Tammy Daybell, and her two children.",

These Republican supporters of Donald Trump are calling on the Nebraska Republican governor, Jim Pillen, to call a special session of the legislature to change this election law. Now, the governor said he would call a special session if there was support in the legislature. But up until now there has not been. And here's why. It takes about 33 votes of the 49 member legislature to survive a filibuster to get this through. As of now, Republicans do not have that.So, John, so many interesting things converge in here. One, Nebraska has a non-partisan unicameral legislature. One body. It ends its session next week. So, the governor would have to call a special session back in to change this law. It's been on the books for about 30 years or so. Obama won this district in 2008. .Biden won it in 2020. Important to note, though, Donald Trump carried it in 2016. They're trying to change the law rather than campaign for the votes here. So, John, it's not far-fetched at all to say that in November all eyes could also be here in Nebraska and in Omaha. John.",
