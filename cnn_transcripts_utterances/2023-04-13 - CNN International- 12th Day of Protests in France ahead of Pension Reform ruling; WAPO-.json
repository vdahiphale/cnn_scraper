Just ahead President Joe Biden's trip to Ireland any moment now he'll meet with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. Earlier he was greeted by Irish President Michael Higgins.Then thousands are marching across France against the government's pension reform. This is just before a much awaited verdict by the Constitutional Council on the legality of the bill. And new details are emerging about the massive leak of classified U.S. Military documents, including person who may be behind it. A busy day for U.S. President Joe Biden, he just met Ireland's President Michael Higgins in Dublin and now he's set to meet with Ireland's Prime Minister this hour. The two are expected to discuss several pressing global issues including the war in Ukraine. Shortly after Mr. Biden will address Ireland's parliament, his speech will likely tout the close ties between the two countries and his own family ties to Ireland. So let's get some more insight now on this meeting, Phil Mattingly joins us now from Dublin. Phil, what are the President's political objectives south of the border?",

      "sentences": "You know Bianca, I think what's been interesting is so much of this trip for President Biden has been framed in the personal nature. And certainly the ancestry is both well mapped out and very deep here. But this is a day, I think very clearly of both ceremony and substance with that meeting with President Michael Higgins that's ongoing right now.The tea shook that will follow that and then the speech to Parliament, it underscores that there's a very real very substantive bilateral relationship here between the U.S. and Ireland. And one the President hopes to utilize and continue to build on. I think when he speaks to Parliament later today; you will certainly see a President looking back over the history of which he and his family are very much intertwined. But also looking forward, you mentioned the invasion by Russia and Ukraine. Ireland has been a critical piece of the Western alliance that is sought to push back against that while they are militarily neutral. They have been certainly a key component of the humanitarian assistance, whether or not they can build on that going forward is certainly a topic of discussion. And keep in mind where the President was just yesterday up in Northern Ireland wants to consult with leaders and top officials of Parliament later today, about their view of things reflect what he has heard in his meeting with the five political leaders up there as well. So I think it's something that you understand how deeply personal this is for the President. But you also when you talk to Senior White House Officials, Senior Administration Officials. They underscored this isn't just about that. This isn't just about the President visiting pubs or visiting former family members or long lost cousins. This is about a bilateral relationship that is critical with Europe that is critical for the President that is critical given the scale of the geopolitical issues that have certainly consumed much of President Biden's time in office up to this point, Bianca.",

Police are bracing for possible violent attacks as hundreds of thousands of protesters are expected to take to the streets. In Paris, garbage collectors and incinerator workers are on strike yet again.All this comes on the eve of the constitutional Council's expected ruling on the wildly unpopular pension reform bill that would delay retirement for many by two years. So let's go straight to Fred Pleitgen who is in Paris for us. Fred, is there concern or police intelligence to suggest that they are expecting violence from these protests today?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, Bianca were a little way away from where Fred was just reporting from the back of the protests move on where they are currently gathering. And you can see the sheer size and scale of this protest behind me. The authorities anticipate that this will be another large protest expecting at least 400,000 people to take part in today's demonstration.That we have over the last few weeks, seeing the number of protesters taken to the streets dwindling somewhat is not as large as perhaps we have seen in the past. There are record breaking figures, but of course, this is almost the final chance for protesters here for union members to have their voices heard before the Constitutional Council comes to its final decision tomorrow evening. So this is going to be a huge moment for these union members and processes to get that message across. And of course, we've also heard from one of the largest unions here in France, saying this isn't the end, even if the Constitutional Council passes this legislation through, which is widely anticipated to be the case. They will continue to protest in some form or other and you can see behind me despite the bad weather, there has been a huge turnout and of course, a spread veterinary, a significant police presence, as well. We're seeing about the same amount of police turning out as we saw last Thursday. This is of course, the 12th round of protests and we have seen pockets of violence in the past, although they have been largely peaceful protests. And that is the anticipation say that we may again, see those pockets of violence in the past, we have seen protesters throwing smoke bombs towards the police, painters in the storming of high profile buildings. And of course, in response police using tear gas and water cannons, there is anticipation that there could be pockets of violence there. But of course, the people here as it processes we are all frustrated to say the least. There are huge amounts of anger directed towards the government over the raising of pension age over the government's decision to push through this legislation without a final vote. And of course, there is also anger given the fact that France is facing a severe cost of living crisis. Of course, a significant amount of anger in these protests will likely continue because tomorrow is the big day when we do have Constitutional Council to make its final decision. There is the anticipation, expectation and we could see smaller pockets of protests again tomorrow as well, Bianca.",

      "sentences": "Nada Bashir, great to have you there, thank you. We're getting stunning new details about whom maybe behind the leak of highly sensitive U.S. National Security secrets. The Washington Post spoke to an alleged friend of the leaker who describes him as a lonely young man known as OG, who worked on a military base and was part of an online chat room.CNN hasn't independently verified that report. Another report on the leak of those classified Pentagon documents suggests there's broad infighting within the Russian government over its war in Ukraine. According to The New York Times, the rift is between Russian Officials, some within the Federal Security Service and the Defense Ministry. But again, CNN hasn't been able to verify that report. So for more now, let's go to CNN Natasha Bertrand who joins us from Washington. Natasha, what more details are we learning about who this leaker might be and also if he would have any possible motivation for perpetrating this leak and the fallout that it's creating?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Bianca. So what we're learning from the Washington Post here, who actually found a member of this social media server, where all of these classified documents were being posted, is that the original person who had been leaking these documents allegedly?Is someone who works at a military base in the United States, someone who has access to these classified documents on a daily basis and essentially was sharing them with his friends on this social media server platform in order to kind of show off as well as to convey some of his views about the government which were very dark and very conspiratorial. [08:10:00] So essentially, what happened was this group was created because all of these people on this server were kind of young men and boys in their early 20s and teens who shared a love of military gear, God and importantly guns, and they all kind of shared their, you know, a shared bond over these interests. And eventually this leaker, who the Washington Post and who these members of this group only referred to as OG, began to post these very sensitive documents onto this channel, in a way to kind of show his friends that he had access to it. As well as what was going on inside the government on any given day kind of as a way to show these friends. Kind of where U.S. government money was going, what the intelligence community was doing, and importantly, how the U.S. was supporting the Ukrainians in their fight against Russia? Now, in terms of a motive, it seems to be just that he was boasting about his access to this material. He also had a very dark view of the government. And while the members of this group do know his actual name, according to the Washington Post, if and where he lives they're refusing to reveal that at this point, because they know that there's a massive FBI investigation underway to find him and they do not want him to be found. Now all of this comes is we're learning that the Pentagon is severely restricting who can actually access this classified information on a daily basis, their distribution list used to be much larger than they are now. But those lists have been whittled down significantly in recent days to the point where U.S. Officials across the U.S. government who used to receive those documents are now no longer getting them on a daily basis, Bianca.",

      "sentences": "CNNs Natasha Bertrand, it's great to get your clarity and insights on this story, thank you. In Russia anxiety is growing, that a second wave of mobilization may be nearing after lawmakers approved a bill making it harder for Russians to avoid conscription.On Wednesday, the upper house of parliament gave final approval to a measure that would allow for electronic delivery of military call up papers, and includes tough penalties for those who ignore them. President Vladimir Putin is expected to quickly sign the bill into law. CNN's Clare Sebastian joins me now for more. Clare, this has been rushed through. And it makes me wonder many things but two. Primarily one, the impact that this could have potential mobilization on a Ukrainian spring offensive and the other we've seen a mobilization from the wives and mothers of Russian troops before. Could this have a negative impact on Russian morale?",

      "sentences": "You know, I think the context here is that Russians never really believed that the previous wave of mobilization had actually ended. There's this phrase that is sort of doing its rounds, certainly among independent voices in Russia, which is creeping mobilization, or even silent mobilization, which leads you to believe that one they don't trust that the government had finished.And to that there is some thinking that if another wave happens, it might be done insidiously, that they might not announce it as they did the last time, in order to avoid that sense of panic that hit to public opinion that they saw and obviously the Exodus as well. But this new law, while the Kremlin is strenuously denying that another mobilization is on the cards would certainly make it easier removes friction by allowing them to deliver those papers electronically. And of course, it brings in as well, those pretty coercive measures, if people are trying to avoid the draft. For example, as soon as the electronic papers dropped, you're not allowed to leave the country. So obviously, that seems like a response to what happened last autumn with the mobilization. If you then don't show up at a recruitment office within 20 days, other measures come in, you can't set up a business, you can't take out a loan, buy a property, there are restrictions on using your driving license, pretty serious coercive measures. All of this, of course, part of what we've seen since the start of the war, this repression of people at home, there's also going to be a unified database of people eligible for the draft, which, you know, smacks of surveillance, which is another thing we've seen stepping up in Russia. And I think this is going to raise those fears of that potential creeping mobilization and certainly going into a potential spring offensive. We know that manpower is critical on the battlefield.",

So I think in the President and Michael Higgins, the President of Ireland, President Joe Biden finds a kindred spirit in a love of the country. But when he comes here, and he speaks to Parliament, a joint session of the parliament, in a couple of hours, will hear him there, perhaps more formally articulate how he sees not only his personal connection with the country, but also the United States connection with Ireland as well, whether it's shared peacekeeping missions, or thoughts about the climate, or perhaps on Ukraine. These are all issues that both countries share. And of course, since the U.K. left the European Union, Brexit and the United States used to, you know, look upon the U.K. as a country that could express the U.S. voice, if you will, within Brussels, European Union meetings. Ireland, certainly, with that closeness of connection can express the United States interests around the table with other European Union leaders. Obviously, President Biden has a great relationship with Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission President, but she doesn't have a vote at the table and Ireland does. And it would be important as well for the United States to feel. That it can at least be heard inside the chambers when big decisions are being made in Brussels.",

And the way that democracy works here, in Ireland, is a shared value with the United States, but at a practical level. This is another country that the United States can count on to support it in many ways. They might have shared views on the amount of military support, or rather different views on the amount of military support that goes to Ukraine. But Ireland has certainly responded to the United States, calls for more help for Ukraine over the past year since Russia invaded it.
