And we begin with breaking news out of Morocco, where rescues are underway at this hour as dawn breaks. And authorities hoped to get a much clearer picture of the devastation from a powerful earthquake overnight.The government says nearly 300 people were killed and more than 150 others injured as the tremors brought down buildings and sent residents running into the streets for fear of aftershocks. The U.S. Geological Survey says the 6.8 magnitude quake was the strongest in the region in more than 120 years. CNN's Larry Madowo has been tracking all of this for us. And he joins us now live from Lagos, Nigeria. I mean, Larry, things are becoming a bit clearer in terms of the devastation here. But what more do we know about rescues that may be taking place at this hour?",

Part of the problem overnight when this earthquake hit about 11The worst impact was felt south of the historic city of Marrakesh, but the actual aftershocks and the tremors felt as far as Rabat and Casablanca and other parts of the country. So far, the interior minister saying nearly 200 people dead, 296 -- 153 wounded. But as now they begin to assess the damage when they can see clearly, the fears, is that those numbers could rise. The U.S. Geological Survey has just updated its guidance that significant casualties are possible. They say there's a 34 percent chance that between 100 to 1,000 people could have been killed in this earthquake. That is consistent with what we've seen so far with this turning 296 people dead. And we're also seeing some buildings totaled damaged, some buildings completely collapsing near the High Atlas Mountains where the worst impact was felt. But it's been felt even in the historic city of Marrakesh, which has some historic buildings. I'm going back to the 12th century, the walls one most goes back to the 12th century. And there's been some damage there, partly because they've been around for a long time. That's about the elements. But these are narrow streets. These buildings have been around for a very long time, and they're not as strong as maybe they used to be. So I want to hear -- I want you to hear from one person who is not in the epicenter of this earthquake. They're in Casablanca, and even there, they could not sleep overnight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOHAMED TAQAFI, WITNESS (through translator): The house rocked aggressively. Everyone was scared. And I was shocked and didn't understand what was happening. I thought it was only my house that was moving because it's fragile and old. I heard people screaming. Everyone went out of their houses. The street is full of people and women screaming, that's what happened. Even now, people can't go back home because they're still afraid. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Prime Minister has been pulling out all the stops as he welcomes the U.S. President Joe Biden and other world leaders to this year's summit. Now parts of the city have undergone significant makeovers in preparation for this event, but two key players were not there; Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, and that is significant. Divisions over the war in Ukraine have some observers wondering whether the leaders will be able to issue a joint communique this year. CNN's Kevin Liptak joins me now live from New Delhi. Kevin, really good to see you there on the ground as this summit gets underway. I mean, Biden is there with his set of priorities, of course, but it is a crowded agenda. I mean, where does the White House believe they're likely to make some progress?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly, I think their main goal at this summit is to speak to the developing world. And that is what Prime Minister Modi has tried to put at the center of this summit that he's hosting and President Biden is coming armed with certain proposals to try and convince members of the so-called global south that the U.S. can be a good partner and will be a good partner, particularly when it comes to things like infrastructure.And the president does have an opening here, because certainly, he is challenging in some ways, China's role in the developing world. The U.S. really trying to make the case that the U.S. can be a better partner, not involve the coercive lending practices that the U.S. accuses Beijing of engaging in, in the developing world. And so you will see him armed with proposals, including proposals to reform the World Bank, invest more in that body. The White House says that could unlock potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in loans and grants for developing countries. But you'll also see him today announced this major new transit corridor coming from Asia through the Middle East and eventually onto Europe. This would potentially unlock a massive amount of global trade. And that is also indirectly a challenge to China's attempts to expand its trades -- trade relationships around the world. So President Biden certainly has an affirmative agenda here, but that's not necessarily papering over the very real differences that the leaders of the G20 still have when it comes to Ukraine. And that is the big issue that's looming over the summit. And we are told President Biden will speak about that when he is -- it's his turn to speak in the larger summit gathering that's underway right now. Of course, President Biden has had a lot of success at other forums like the G7, NATO, and trying to convince countries to punish Russia, to supply Ukraine with military aid. That hasn't necessarily been as convincing for some members of the developing world, the so called Global South, including members of the G20. Countries like India, where we are, which continues to purchase large amounts of Russian fuel, but also countries like Brazil and South Africa. And certainly President Biden's message, I think is that defending democracy in Ukraine is a global imperative and that it is in these countries own self-interests to take that stance and to take a stance against Russia aggression. They are under -- there's work underway now trying to draft this joint communique that could potentially come out of the summit. We were told this morning that that hadn't been finalized yet. Diplomats are working furiously to come up with some kind of consensus language around that. But remember, Russia is still a member of the G20, even though Vladimir Putin is not here. They would still need to sign off on any language in a joint communique at the end. So it does remain to be seen how successful they will be on that front at the end of the summit. Paula.",

The Interior Ministry says nearly 300 people were killed and more than 150 others injured. Now, as the sun is rising, officials and residents are now trying to assess the damage and determine how many more rescues they need to mount.

Joining me now is Kishor Jaiswal, Kishor Jaiswal, pardon me, a structural engineer with the U.S. Geological Survey. And I thank you for joining us, as everyone wants more information about this. I mean, in terms of this magnitude of an earthquake, apparently, it's unprecedented in more than a century. This was a shallow earthquake. What does that imply for structures? How might that affect the intensity of the damage and what we're seeing there in that video? KISHOR JAISWAL, STRUCTURAL ENGINEER, U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY: A very good morning to you and your viewers. Before I start, you know, I must say My thoughts and prayers goes out to those who are affected by this tragic event in the country of Morocco, as you said, roughly eight hours ago or -- 6.8 occurred, around 11:00 P.M. in the city, southwest of Morocco. So this earthquake was one of the largest and deadliest as the country has seen in a long time. And as you said, that the depth was pretty shallow. And what it means is essentially, a strong shaking that originates from the source of the earthquake that can easily reach out quickly to the affected epicenter region. And that area could actually experience very strong shaking. According to our estimate, approximately 2.8 million people experienced strong, very strong shaking from this earthquake. And this earthquake was followed by a magnitude 4.9 aftershock, which occurred, south southwest of the main shock. Again, the epicenter was close to the city of Marrakesh, which is about one million people. A big city and, of course, there are several villages and small towns, which were heavily affected from this -- on this earthquake.",

So, given the climatic condition, people often prefer to use clay or mud constructions. So, the predominant building stock in this part of the world is essentially mud brick construction, unreinforced brick masonry constructions, or in the urban areas, non- ductile concrete buildings.So, these buildings are essentially highly vulnerable to seismic shaking. They are -- and that's what you saw in your videos, that many buildings -- it took only few seconds to bring them down. The shaking was pretty strong, but at the same time, these buildings are not really designed to the modern seismic standard that we know of. And thus, they really gave in pretty quickly, killing, unfortunately, all the occupants that that they have. So this is a very unfortunate situation. And I think one of the important worry that the search and rescue people have is the potential of experiencing aftershocks. And if they're trying to rescue people, what would that lead to. So a magnitude 6.8 can easily produce sizeable aftershocks, many good size. And these kinds of earthquakes can -- given the vulnerable building stock, can still pull down some of the weaker buildings that are left over from the main shock earthquake.

So it was really paramilitary forces, industrial workers that were showing what they could do, and what they would do to support any war effort. So the sorts of things that you saw was you did see rocket launchers, but you saw them hidden in the back of trucks. You also saw tractors that were pulling people of the soldiers and also weapons. So it was really what KCNA, statement media called it the, quote, backbone of national defense. So it was different to what we are used to seeing in in recent months, certainly, as Sir Kim Jong Un has been showing off his arsenal. It was also about diplomacy, though. It was the 75th anniversary of the founding of the nation. There was a Chinese delegation that was there to -- in attendance as well. And as you said, there were letters that were given to Kim Jong Un, congratulatory tweet messages from Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia. Xi saying that he was ready to strengthen strategic communication. And Vladimir Putin saying he was ready to, quote, expand bilateral ties in all respects in a planned way by pooling efforts. Now that -- these comments are what Washington and Seoul are listening out for at the moment, as there is speculation that there could be a meeting between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin. We've heard this from the U.S. side, U.S. officials say that they believe it may come this month and we do know also that in Vladivostok in Russia from tomorrow, the 10th to the 13th of September, there is the Eastern Economic Forum. So, of course, all eyes are on that to see whether or not any kind of meeting does materialize. Paula.",
