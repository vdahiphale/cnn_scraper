Hundreds of homes and other buildings across Lahaina were turned to ash by the fire, leaving almost nothing behind to show for what was days ago a thriving community.So here's what we know right now. Authorities, just a short time ago, reported that they have now confirmed 80 deaths. There are fears that number could continue to rise. Crews with cadaver dogs are sifting through the wreckage. The only road in and out of Lahaina was opened briefly on Friday to give people the chance to go in to see what, if anything, remains of their homes. But authorities closed it down again a short time later. Officials say the Lahaina fire is 85 percent contained but the danger isn't completely gone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They also demonstrated against France, saying the former colonial ruler should leave their country for good. Jim Bittermann joins us now. So Jim, for many in Niger, France is seen as the enemy here. What role is France playing in this crisis? JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTL. CORRESPONDENT: Well, it has to be noted, France has been a colonial power in that part of Africa for more than a century. And only in the last of this century, first part of this century, Niger got its independence from France. And the feelings are still very high against France. There is a widespread belief, for instance, that France is taking advantage of Niger, taking its uranium and using it in its nuclear reactors, which is largely not true. They are buying some uranium but not much. As a matter of fact, the folks on the ground there in front of the embassy were saying all kinds of things anti-France, like down with France, down with ECOWAS. That's the Economic Community of West African States -- we need Russia's help to get rid of these French monkey. So you can see the tone of that crowd. And it's exactly what the French did not want to see. They've been trying to keep a very low profile. They basically have said that they are absolutely in favor of the restoration of power of the democratically elected president of Niger, Mohamed Bazoum Bazoum. And they want him restored to power and they said that's the goal at the moment. They've kept their troops where they are, about 1,500 troops on the outskirts of Niamey, the capital. And they basically, it looks like that's the posture they're going to maintain. They're saying that even though the junta has said they want the French military out, they're saying that their agreement, their military agreement was with the real democratically erected regime of Mr. Bazoum. So as a consequence, they're not moving their troops. By the way, the same should be said about the Americans. They have a base further north in the capital, about the same number of people on that base. The Americans and the French both would like to stay because they see themselves as a force for stability in that part of Africa. Kim.",

We appreciate that.In Ecuador, the shocking assassination of a presidential candidate has left the country deeply shaken and increasing calls for better security. On Friday, the slain politician's casket was taken to an exhibition hall so that more people could come and pay their respects. He was then buried in a private ceremony. With the latest on the investigation, here is CNN's Rafael Romo in the capital. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SR. LATIN AFFAIRS EDITOR: The Ecuadorian attorney general's office announced Friday they introduced what they call 22 elements of conviction against the suspects. By this, prosecutors mean evidence collected at the crime scene and during raids carried out after the assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio. Investigators say they obtained witness testimony and ballistic tests. They have also analyzed security camera videos in and around the crime scene. There was another crucial piece of information revealed by investigators. They say the autopsy shows the victim received long distance shots. And they have been able to match shells to a rifle confiscated in the raids. All six suspects are Colombian nationals, according to authorities. There was a seventh suspect who died after being shot by police, whose identity has not been revealed, although police said he had been previously arrested for gun possession in mid-June and later released. In one of the raids, officials say they found the stolen vehicle that had multiple weapons in its trunk, including rifles, a submachine gun and four pistols and three grenades and four boxes of ammunition, containing 384 cartridges as well as two magazines. Of course, many questions remain; among them, who was the mastermind of the attack. But given the information provided by authorities so far, it seems like this was a well planned and coordinated attack. Late Friday night, five presidential candidates signed an agreement for the peace of the country. They're demanding a swift investigation and more resources to improve security in Ecuador. Officials say a presidential debate scheduled for this Sunday and the presidential election for the following Sunday will still go on as planned -- Rafael Romo, CNN, Ecuador. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

She made an appearance in their last game and we weren't sure how much of a role she would play in this.There was a huge roil, not only here in Auckland but inside the stadium, 2,288 kilometers away in Brisbane, as Sam Kerr came on, she made almost an immediate impact. And for 20 odd minutes or so, Australia threw the kitchen sink at France. But they could not find a way through. And you could see the tension starting to build amongst that Australian side. France then started to come back into it. And nobody yet has made the breakthrough. So it looks like to extra time we will be heading. Both of these sides know its first-ever Women's World Cup semifinal is on the line. And that opportunity to meet, as you mentioned, the winners of the second semifinal taking place in Sydney a little bit later. England going into the game the favorite against Colombia. But they've got a suspension of Lauren James, one of their star players, to deal with. She scored three goals. She's provided another three in their four matches so far. So it will be really interesting to see how the European champions deal without her. And Colombia, for their part, have really ripped up the rulebook over the last few weeks. They have been many people's surprise package, pulling off that shock defeat of Germany, of course. They've got the 18-year-old teen sensation Linda Caicedo, who has been stealing so many of the headlines with her incredibly impressive masterful performances, much older than her 18 years of age. And Colombia know, not only are they looking for a first ever semifinal place themselves, they have very boldly declared they are a team on a mission. They feel they haven't had the respect they deserve on the national stage. They've had money pulled from their domestic league and they say they're here to earn respect and dignity for them and fellow women's footballers across the country.
