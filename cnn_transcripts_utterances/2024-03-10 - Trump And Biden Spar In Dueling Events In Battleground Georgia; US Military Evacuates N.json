President Biden and former President Trump, the two presumptive party nominees trading pointed jabs at dueling rallies in the battleground state of Georgia, which holds its primaries on Tuesday. Biden won Georgia in 2020 by about 12,000 votes, and the state will once again be critical to winning the White House in November. CNN White House reporter, Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now live and Priscilla, you were at Biden's Atlanta rally yesterday. Tell us about his message to voters as he hits the road and we turn our focus to this general election.",

Now the president still faces another reality, which is that there was a heckler in the crowd who called him \"Genocide Joe,\" this regarding the Israel-Hamas war. So the president is still having to navigate that reality among the coalition where there are fractures over how the administration is handling the situation in Gaza, but what is clear is that the president is also really using the momentum of his State of the Union address, which also came up yesterday as he hits the road and the campaign telling CNN this morning, that it raised $10 million in the 24 hours after the State of the Union. Again, voters really excited about what they heard from President Biden. That's what they told me, and the president is going to continue that momentum in the days to come.

That's going to be there. It's not going to go away anytime soon. You mentioned the reproductive rights issue, that is something that the Democrats have campaigned well on. That's going to be something that Joe Biden will mention frequently. So he is going to focus on those issues that he thinks that suburban women voters, for example, will respond to. Donald Trump is doing the opposite. He is saying: Are you better off than you were three years ago? I don't think so.

And as you say, get re-elected easily in 2022. Donald Trump can win without Brian Kemp actively campaigning for him. If Brian Kemp showed Donald Trump how to do it, what you have to do is you have to do well outside of Atlanta, obviously, if you're a Republican, but you have to do well enough, and enough of these big Metro Atlanta counties like Fulton County and DeKalb County to overcome that natural advantage that Biden will have with those suburban voters in Atlanta.",

The judge has announced being adjudicated, so things are looking kind of bad right now for Fani Willis. We'll see what eventually happens.But it could be that that case in Fulton County is unraveling as we speak. If Fani Willis is removed, if the DA's office is removed, that puts that whole case in question. Fani Willis had put this case around the RICO conspiracy statute in Georgia, which is controversial, but another prosecutor may not see it that way at all, and maybe a completely different case. And, at best, it's going to delay the case from happening if it even happens this year. So the stakes are pretty high there.

And now, hearing as well that German diplomats and EU diplomats have also left the country because it has simply become too dangerous and this is really a country, that's no stranger for diplomats operating in very tricky circumstances.But you know, last week, I've talked to some diplomats who said that, you know, they had stockpiled food and water and it's running low, and that they simply never remember instances like this, where the gangs have been working together in unison to take on the Haitian government, the Haitian National Police, and essentially are in many places are winning. Other parts of the capital, you know, there is a tense calm. You see people sometimes on the street, waiting in line in ATMs, that kind of thing. It seems like life is going about back to normal in certain places. But by and large, the gangs are not allowing aid to come in, are not allowing people to circulate freely throughout the country, and are preventing flights from coming in or out of the airport. So essentially, have the country of Haiti on lockdown or holding the country hostage as they continue to demand the Prime Minister Ariel Henry himself unable to come back to Haiti. He is stuck in Puerto Rico, last we heard, until he steps down, that is their demand, as well, they want to prevent a force of Kenyan soldiers that are supposed to be coming in to restore order. So a very tense situation, and for many of the diplomatic missions, simply too dangerous to continue operating in Haiti.",

There has been over a couple of hundred thousand meals that have been dropped, but the air drops can't deliver other things like medical aid, and in some cases, large quantities of water.Once those harbors, those artificial harbors get in, you can pull any kind of ship or barge into those, get it to the transload site, but it is still difficult, Jessica, because you have to have security forces on the shore, or some type of humanitarian forces, whether it's the UN or the Red Cross, or even Chef Andres with some of his World Kitchen facilities, transferring them from the ships to the people, and that's very difficult. You're talking about humanitarian assistance for over a million people, that's very challenging and the reason they're not coming in on roads, on trucks is because of the blockages of the port facilities, getting them across the transfer points on the roads, but also because it's right in the middle of the active combat zone. Once you pull that off of those roads and where the rubble is from the ammunition and the bombardments and get it toward the shore, you can have a cleaner transfer of this equipment, but it is also you know, what is in their equipment. So there is no smuggling of any things. It's not handed out to Hamas. So it's a control transfer of the kinds of things that you need in a humanitarian crisis. I've run one of these things one time, it's very challenging. It's a joint operation, it's tough. But once it gets moving, I think you're going to see a massive amount of equipment and food delivered to the people of Gaza. The one other thing I had mentioned, there's been a lot of people talking that this will take two to three months to set up. I don't buy that. I've seen these things, as long as you can get the equipment there in a couple of days, which I think will happen. I think we'll see these port facilities set up in a few weeks, and you'll see the airdrops continue until then.",

That is something that is rarely seen on Capitol Hill, but that bipartisan support ultimately forcing the House Majority Leader to put this bill on the floor very quickly. Steve Scalise said that he would take up this measure, the full House would in just a matter of days. That doesn't mean though that TikTok isn't trying to kill it. In fact, that's exactly what they're trying to do. The top Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee told me that she is getting flooded with phone calls over people opposed to their efforts. REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R-WA): Yes, we've been flooded with calls, record amounts of calls. Any member of the Energy and Commerce Committee that voted yesterday has been flooded.

They had been down to Uvalde right after the shooting and a spokesperson for Meghan at the time had said that she had done this in a personal capacity, as a mother to offer her support and to offer her condolences and it's really support that this family and all of the families of the victims need right now.

He is having some meetings, but not crowds. The doctors have advised him to stay away from crowds. So Kate does not have a constitutional role. So she can keep her medical information private. Charles does have a constitutional role. And also, I think it is quite different situations here in that Kate has obviously undergone this very difficult surgery, but we've been told it's not cancerous, it isn't something that could possibly be seen as one day life threatening. Charles does have cancer. And that is something that is different, it does take longer treatment. But what we don't know either at the moment is when Charles is going to be back out there with the crowds. We do expect we have to at some point in this year have a general election, possibly a change of government, a new prime minister. Charles has a key role in that election. And so what we don't know if an election is called for May or June, whether he's going to be able to do that; if not, William would have to stand in and that is uncharted waters, unprecedented that the King cannot deal with the change of government, his key constitutional role.

Tennessee doesn't even cover six foot seven Kamilla Cardoso. No way she makes the three, right? Wrong. Buzzer beater. It's the first three pointer she has made in 118 games at SC. Balls coach, Kelly Harper wasn't wrong. It was only Cardoso's second ever three point attempt. Camilla said this was her favorite moment of her career, the Gamecocks will face LSU in the title game today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This one was spicy.In the first half, Dukes' Kyle Filipowski and UNC's Harrison Ingram get tangled up, fall to the court, and it appears that Filipowski tried to trip Ingram, but he said afterwards he didn't. North Carolina, they weren't tripping though. They rallied for the 84-79 win. But watch what happens as they celebrate. The Dukes' students section starts tossing stuff at the UNC players before they made their way to the locker room. We're talking drinks bottles, and apparently whatever else they could get their hands on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
