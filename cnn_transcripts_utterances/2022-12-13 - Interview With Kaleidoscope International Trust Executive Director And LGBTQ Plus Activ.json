      "sentences": "A simple gift of song from folk music legend, Judy Collins.Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Two events in Washington today tell a story about Americas global priorities. First, President Biden hosts a summit with African leaders to recognize what the administration calls the continents enormous potential and promise. As not just the U.S. but China, Russia, and Europe, all jockey for advantage there. The second important event in D.C. today has the president hosting a signing ceremony for the Respect for Marriage Act, the bipartisan bill that requires the federal government to recognize same-sex marriage across the country. Meantime, in Africa, there is a gaping human rights hole where homosexuality is outlawed in many countries, like Ghana. So, while their presidents visit the White House, a draconian new bill being debated at home would criminalize, not just same-sex conduct, but any support of LGBTQ rights. If it becomes law, it could spark new surveillance and new violence against an already marginalized community. And what makes this new bill particularly problematic, correspondent, Nima Elbagir reveals how U.S. and western aid donors who pledged to support gay rights have also funded supporters of this controversial bill. And in recent years, at least $5 million in aid from Europe and in the United States went to projects involving churches in Ghana whose leaders have a long track record of hateful rhetoric against this community. Nima and her team traveled to Ghana to see the human cost. And their report is part of CNN's ongoing series on gender inequality called \"As Equals\". (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  The Jamestown Lighthouse in the capital Accra overlooks the Atlantic. The historic gold coast inexorably tied by the slave trade and Christian missionaries to the American shoreline, an ocean away. Ties that remain to this day. Today, the nearby market is a busy and vibrant. ELBAGIR (on camera):  This is the beating heart of Accra, you can buy pretty much anything here. And here, like much of the capital, the spirit of God, the word of God, is omnipresent. ELBAGIR (voiceover):  And you can see its influence in all corners in this religiously conservative society.",

Video seen by CNN show attackers growing increasingly brazen, filming their violent abuse of people they alleged are gay. Forcing them to confess, and in some cases name other people who are also gay. ELBAGIR (on camera):  It's not just the capital Accra, violence is permeating across this country. People are really afraid. Friends and neighbors are turning on each other. For the safety of the people we're meeting, we've agreed not to disclose their location. ELBAGIR (voiceover):  A worrying trend is that people need only to be accused of being part of the LGBTQ Plus community. Mobs take it upon themselves to dull out what they perceive as vigilante justice. In effect, a witch hunt. These men, after being beaten, falsely accused a woman of being a pimp.

Anyone that's targeted based on sexual orientation, they fear having to go underground, they fear having to lie about who they are, they fear not being able to retain, keep their jobs, not have housing, they will be destitute and on the streets, and be even more of a target.

This is, like, total erasure and totally eliminating any part of society that has any sympathy or compassion. OPOKU-GYIMAH:  Uh-huh. And this is what makes this bill anti-LGBTQI Plus bill so horrendous. Because it doesn't just target LGBT Plus persons, it targets allies and those supporters, and those who wish to, you know, embrace what human rights and dignity is about. When you think about Ghana's cultural and rich heritage, you understand that we're about equality, freedom, and justice.

But when there are deep rooted ways of looking at how funding travels into particular organizations, to churches, to mosques, wherever that may be. You have to ask yourself, what kind of due diligence are they doing and checks, sort of, emulating the same models as colonial -- colonizers did in the first place? So, I think the stopping of this is about working with organizations, like the one I work with, Kaleidoscope Trust. Money others like Human Dignity Trusty which are looking at policies, practices, behaviors. Working alongside friendly missions and also embassies that can say, this is wrong. And really making sure that that voice is heard loudly and clearly. But not just saying it is wrong, but thinking about exactly where they direct their efforts. I think businesses also have a major part to play in speaking about human rights and what we call sustainable development goals which are called STG's. It's about leaving no one behind.",

And then, I met up with Leonard Cohen and he said, I don't understand why you're not writing your own songs. Everybody else is, why aren't you? And I raced home and wrote a song called \"\"Since You've Asked,\" what I give you since you've aske is all my time together. And that was my first song. And I've written -- in these past 60 years, I've written about 60 songs. I've recorded them on albums with songs from other artists, of course, everything from \"Both Sides Now\" to the \"Northwest Passage.\" When 2016, I started writing a lot of poetry and to be sort of the feeder for the songs. And I said to my husband, I'm going to do any poems to 90 days and he said, well, why don't you do 365 days? And then, by the end of the year, you'll have a year's worth of poetry and probably some songs. So, I did that, and I harvested out of that 365 days a lot of songs. And when I came to the end of the year, I thought, you know, you were right. And I've got a ton of songs and I went on writing.

You needed a lot of noise. You needed to be very expensive and hot and get it done, but it was hard. And so, there was a kind of a growing underground of the folk singer with the one instrument, with the one song and with a message which was quite often beautiful. I am a maid of constant sorrow. That was my first album -- my first song in my first album, or perhaps the Irish songs about, then tell me Sean O'Farrell, tell me why you're hurrying. So, there was a mixture of political music, traditional music, old, old, old songs, brand- new songs. Dylan was starting to write and writing things like \"Tambourine Man.\" But he also wrote \"Masters of War.\" So, it was a combination of exotic, esoteric beauty and, you know, get down, get to it, protest music. ISAACSON:  But you and Pete Seeger in the 1960s could turn things that you wouldn't normally think of as a protest song.

And I was there the summers of -- when I was 16 or when I was 17. When I was 17, I had a driver's license, a learner's license, but I didn't have a car. But I decided that I would try to borrow a car and go over to the Stanley to visit a friend of mine who was working and living in Estes Park. And so, I got in that car, drove over, had lunch with her. And we had, you know, a couple of drinks. I don't know. Enough for me to be not behind the wheel, but I was young, I was crazy. And so, I got in the car and took off and I hit a dirt road in -- on my way back to Grand Lake. And suddenly, I found myself stuck between a fence and a road. And down on the road to my left. sitting by the road were two little babies sitting on this little blanket. They were fine. But I had missed them by a mere a few feet. And their dad came running out of the house and screaming at me and saying, you know, I'm going to call the cops on you and I'm going to get you out of here. I'm going to get a rope and pull you out. Well, he went to do that and I rocked my car back and forth and got out of the mess and sped away. But it has haunted me ever since. And so, one of the songs on the album is called \"Hell on Wheels,\" which already has helped me to finish.
