AI innovation, global health, huge talkers here and you will hear from some of the world's biggest thinkers in the next two hours. Its 6 pm in Dubai, I'm Becky Anderson. This is \"Connect the World\". Well, President Erdogan who spoke yesterday at the summit in Dubai where I am now of course is in Cairo. He will discuss the situation in the Gaza Strip with the Egyptian President. And Ukraine's military leaders are claiming a big victory at sea against Vladimir Putin's navy. Well the IDF says it has begun an extensive wave of attacks in Lebanon as local media there report air raids on several towns in the southern part of the country. This comes after a rocket attack on the Northern Israeli City of Safed on Wednesday, which responders say killed one person. The IDF says the rocket originated in Lebanon. Meantime, the Palestinian Authority President trying to prevent what he fears would be another catastrophe and move into Rafah by the Israeli military. Mahmoud Abbas, calling on Hamas to quickly cement a deal for the release of hostages in Gaza and a pause in fighting look this as a growing chorus of world leaders and aid organizations warn against an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah. More than a million Palestinians packed into the Gazan City, which Israel directed civilians too. The U.N.'s Relief Chief says a military push into that area could lead to \"slaughter\". A lot happening, our International Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson is following this from Tel Aviv for you. Nic, where do you want to start this hour?",

Very important military base fairly close to the Lebanese border. We understand as well as the report you have which is one person killed, eight people were injured one of them seriously were moderately the others with relatively light injuries. It's not clear how many missiles were fired into Israel yet. But overnight or late last night, the Israeli Air Force conducted a couple of strikes inside of the South of Lebanon again, and those seem to come off the back of Hezbollah strikes inside Israel earlier on Tuesday. This is not a massive escalation. But it does seem to mark just that slow, slow uptake that we've been seeing where it goes from here. I mean, typically expect both sides to respond to each other. But so far, neither is going sort of all out if you will, Becky.",

They'll be discussing efforts towards a ceasefire in Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid as well as relations between their two countries. Let me be quite clear here. This is a landmark trip for Turkey's President who has not visited Egypt in 12 years. Here in Dubai, Mr. Erdogan reiterated calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 orders. Well, so far, there's been no significant outcome from the negotiations in Cairo, the U.S. official tells CNN, the progress is being made this as a Palestinian news agency says the President of the Palestinian Authority is calling on Hamas to quickly complete a deal.

There are two former hostages who traveled here as part of this delegation. But beyond accountability, they are also of course, seeking another way to remind the world that it has now been 131 days since their loved ones were taken hostage by Hamas during those October 7th terrorist attacks. And so today, these 100 representatives of hostage families have flown here today, we flew on a plane with them El Al flight 131, representing the number of days they've spent in captivity. And they are coming to The Hague, which is just behind me here to file a formal complaints urging the International Criminal Court and its top prosecutor Karim Khan to charge Hamas leaders with war crimes with genocide and with crimes against humanity relying on a body of evidence and testimony, including from some former hostages, talking about not only the kidnappings, but also the killings on October 7th, the sexual violence that has been alleged to have been committed by Hamas. And in speaking with several of these family members, obviously, there is just a sense of frustration, a sense of, you know, the difficulty of the situation for them, as they see these negotiations going on, but certainly not moving a pace fast enough for someone who has been missing their loved one for 131 days. But they do hope that this message that this complaint sends a powerful message to the world about the need for Hamas's leaders to be held accountable. They hope that beyond the complaint itself and the potential for charges, that it also leads to sanctions, perhaps against Hamas leaders, but they are certainly sending a very powerful message to the world 131 days into this ordeal.",

It's really hard to overstate just how intense and frenetic the pace is onboard the USS Eisenhower which is the aircraft carrier that is given the flying jets over the skies at a constant rate up to 50 fighter jets per day taking off from this aircraft carrier to patrol the skies over the Red Sea and of course to strike targets inside Yemen when necessary. Now we also had the chance to go on board a U.S. destroyer called the USS gravely which has been again on the frontlines, kind of the tip of the spear of the attacks against the Houthis intercepting missiles and drones on a regular basis as they are launched from inside Yemen. Here's just a quick look at what the crew onboard this destroyer has to deal with when they detect a missile and respond. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we actually saw one of the last lines of defense that the gravely was forced to use just a few weeks ago called the failing system.

Also allows them to hold the kinds of missiles with which they would be launching attack towards Ukrainian soil, so an important tactical victory for the Ukrainians. But I think what's important about it, Becky, is that beyond their claim that they've now taken out a third of Russia's once formidable Black Sea Fleet is the way they went about it. So these are highly maneuverable sea drones that are actually made by Ukrainians. And this is all part of their effort to try not only to get their own weapons manufacturing up to speed while they wait for desperately needed Western supplies, of which they have repeatedly complained that not enough have been arriving this now, for so much of the war. It is the types of weapons that they've been manufacturing that they're seeking to ramp up their production of that's interesting. These are these drones that really allow them to try and take on a much bigger and much more formidable enemy that has systematically been out manning and out gunning them. Over the course of the last couple of years, you're looking at these drones that have a range of some 800 kilometers, and that are essentially very difficult for these ships, these warships to detect and prevent attacks by and that's what we saw overnight in the Black Sea. It is a confirmation of the wisdom of their shift of strategy away from the much more static land frontlines and towards the Black Sea, as well, Becky. We'd heard from the outgoing Commander in Chief in an Op-Ed on CNN just a few weeks ago saying that part of their plan was to shift the dynamics in the Black Sea. And if they can continue with these victories, and there is some suggestion that they're making progress there, where they failed to make -- elsewhere, Becky.",

U.S. President Joe Biden has slammed House Republicans for voting to impeach hisHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Republicans say they did it because of the way he has handled the migrant crisis at the U.S. Mexico border. Mr. Biden calls this vote a blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship and called on Congress to pass legislation to actually address the situation at the border. Let's go to CNN Politics Correspondent Eva McKend is on Capitol Hill. This was the second attempt to impeach Mayorkas. And our viewers would be forgiven for thinking this is sort of you know, this had failed ultimately, but it's back again how the Senate in the end going to handle this. EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Becky Republicans were successful in this effort in this impeachment effort just now only. And it's important to remember that there's no material impact here, Secretary Mayorkas, he continues on the job. This is a non-binding resolution. To give you a sense of how partisan this affair was, Congressman Steve Scalise, he's a prominent congressman here in leadership in the U.S.; he was seeking cancer treatment in Louisiana. He flew back yesterday and it was his vote. That was the critical vote for Republicans to achieve this. But there were a few Republicans who were against this, Congressman Gallagher, Congressman Buck, Congressman McClintock. And they argue that essentially, you don't impeach someone over a policy dispute that something that you traditionally think of when you think of impeachment, like corruption or misusing public funds, that that is not what is going on here, even though that they two have disagreements with Secretary Mayorkas on the border. So now what's next? The Senate does have to take this up. But it is led by Democrats. This is divided government up here and they could dismiss this on a simple majority vote even before each side has the opportunity to argue its case. So for anything, it is a stain on Mayorkas, but it doesn't have any actual weight or actual impact, Becky.",
