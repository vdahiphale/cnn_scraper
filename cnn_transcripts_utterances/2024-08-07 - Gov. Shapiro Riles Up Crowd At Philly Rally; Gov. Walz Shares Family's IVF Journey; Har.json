Regardless, they showed a united front at last night's rally. When Shapiro took the stage, hyping up the crowd. And look, this was a performance that underscored why Shapiro is going to be someone who is a rising star in Democratic Party, why he was considered for this role. It also may tell us something about why he ultimately wasn't chosen. His mannerisms and his delivery reminded us quite a bit of someone else. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They could have done this rollout in Wisconsin, someplace where one of the finalists wasn't from, so it wouldn't seem like an, you know, in-your-face kind of move. But also, even if it's a second-order or third-order, you know, issue, the fact that a lot of people, sometimes boosted by the Trump campaign, we're now learning, but a lot of people in the Democratic Party and on the very online left, singled out Shapiro because he's Jewish. And they did single him out because he's Jewish. He doesn't have any positions on Israel that are different from any other people he's competing with or from Kamala Harris.
