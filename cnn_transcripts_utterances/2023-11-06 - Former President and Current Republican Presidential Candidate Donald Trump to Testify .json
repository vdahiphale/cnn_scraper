It's interesting to hear in your interview with Scaramucci that he's confident that he's going to be calm, cool, and collected on the stand, because while we have seen him be that person in depositions, he's done, he's said, over 100 in his life, he has been on the witness stand before, he's never been on the witness stand as a candidate who's trying to portray himself as a martyr.

His Doral golf course, 40 Wall Street.I think one of the most sensitive is going to be the value of his Mar- a-Lago resort down in Florida. He has taken issue with the fact that the judge found that to be valued around $18 million. One of his lawyers suggested that it would likely be closer to $1 billion and said it was, quote, the Mona Lisa of real estate. Legally speaking, he is likely going to be advised to just stick to the defense that there was a clause in there, banks should do their own due diligence, and that valuation is more of an art than a science.

      "sentences": "This is going to get interesting really quickly. In this any case, the party who calls the witness to the stand gets to question them first. Ordinarily, that's the easy part. That's what we call direct examination. It's usually a friendly witness, it's usually been prepared, and only after that do we get to cross-examination where the fireworks start.But really important to know, here, the party that is calling Donald Trump to the witness stand is the attorney general, Letitia James's office. So they're going to get to question Donald Trump first. And only after that are we going to see Donald Trump's own team get to question him. A couple of other courtroom dynamics we need to watch for here. First of all, the dynamic between the judge and Donald Trump. There has been tension between them. The judge has made several legal rulings against Donald Trump. Donald Trump has made several non-legal attacks on the judge. Will the judge be able to keep Donald Trump in line? And finally, really important to notice, this jury box is empty. There is no jury. The judge is presiding. He is also deciding the case, so he will be watching the witness with that in mind. Also, one other thing we need to watch for the in the next couple of hours, will Donald Trump take the Fifth? All indications are that he will not take the Fifth, that he will testify coming out of his camp, but he does have that right to take the Fifth. This is a civil case, but he can still say, if my testimony might be used against me, I can take the Fifth, as we just saw in that clip. Phil, in this case when he was deposed over a year ago, he took the Fifth over 400 times. Important to know, if he does take the Fifth, there's some risk. The judge can do what we call draw an adverse inference, meaning the judge can assume the worst about what Donald Trump's testimony would have been. So if he takes the Fifth, there's a real downside here.",

Let's remember, the allegation again, this is a civil suit, the allegation by the attorney general is that the defendants, Trump and his businesses, grossly inflated his personal net worth by billions of dollars. I think we're going to see a couple of main defenses here.First of all, as his sons did last week, Don Jr. and Eric, I think Donald Trump is going to try to push blame down the line and outside. He may say, look, those financial statements, I didn't prepare them, I just signed them. I relied on my accounts. That only gets him so far, though, because the Trump Organization as a whole is a defendant here. I think we also are going to see Donald Trump try to defend the alleged overvaluations of his properties. Paula just talked about, if we look at Seven Springs Estate, that was assessed at $30 million or so. Donald Trump and his organization have claimed that it was worth $260 million. Obviously, a huge discrepancy. Trump has actually said publicly, I think my valuations were low, if anything. We'll see. But that's going to be an uphill climb because the judge has already found before this trial started that Trump committed, quote, persistent fraud by submitting false and misleading statements of financial conditions. So Trump is going to have to argue to the judge, essentially, you got it wrong. We undervalued our own assets.",

Joining us now Israel's ambassador to the US, Michael Herzog. Sir, we appreciate your time. Mr. Ambassador, to start, there have been reports about humanitarian corridors operated by the IDF that would allow Gazans to evacuate south. Is there a commitment tied to those corridors that there will be no strikes by the IDF anywhere near those corridors as they are operational?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, as the only strikes that we have experienced are Hamas attacking these corridors in order to prevent civilians from going south.We are calling on all civilians to go away from the war zone, from the north to the south, where we provide humanitarian solutions and we are building humanitarian zones there. Unfortunately, Hamas is trying to prevent them. But we are doing everything possible to ramp up humanitarian solutions in the south. As we speak, we are in the process of allowing into Gaza, 130 truckloads of humanitarian assistance and we are doing it in close cooperation with the UN and with Egypt.",

We see it as both our obligation and interest to provide solutions, but will do so in a way that does not feed the Hamas war machine. They have troves of fuel, of food, of medicines which they use for their own for war machine, and they bear major responsibility. They started this war, not we, but as I said, we see it as our obligation and interest to provide solutions. We opened a joint operations room with the UN and with Egypt in order to provide these solutions. In fact, we are leading these efforts, so when people talk about a pause, let me explain that.",
