He, you know, won the popular vote, the first Republican to do it in 20 years.I think that he is going to focus on a series of day-one actions and I think we're going to see them, you know, seeking to essentially swamp the system, for lack of a better way of putting it, and you know, just overwhelm the system. And I think you will see a lot of that on immigration. I think you will see a lot on a number of other campaign promises. The one that is unclear, Anderson, is, what does Trump do about these pardons that he said he was going to do or suggested he is likely to do for some of the people arrested in connection with the January 6th attack by a pro Trump mob during the certification of his successor's election? Now, it's one thing that people didn't vote with January 6th and Trump's lies about the election as their guidepost. But it's entirely different than to try to test the system and see what people will tolerate with these pardons. There's not a huge appetite for them nationally. So we will see what that looks like.",

What they will do is they'll weaponize other investigations and look into everything and start an investigation that will end up coming to naught, force people to pay money. This happened to Brad Raffensperger in Georgia. And he was forced to defend himself. But as soon as you take a pardon, it looks like you are guilty of something. I am guilty of nothing, besides bringing the truth to the American people. And in the process, embarrassing Donald Trump. Because, for 187 minutes, he sat there and did absolutely nothing and showed how weak and scared he truly was. So, no, I don't want it. And, you know, the bottom line is, I mean, if he wants to bring -- if he wants to bring up January 6th again -- we've had this talk about how we're moving on from January 6th and trust me, Anderson, I would love to. Like, my life has been defined by this for four years. And if he wants to bring it back, I will be happy to talk about everything the committee did and learned and --",

And then, ultimately, DOJ or whatever says, yes, we didn't find anything but, three years later after this spending. This is how they weaponize this. It's not going to be that they're going to come after you for actual January 6th investigation. They'll make -- but, you know what?

And I do think it is probably going to be enabled by pretty senior people in the Congress. And that we should probably just get used to it. This is the reality. Trump, in a way, not only does he want to do it but I think his base is giving him no choice. He ran on doing this. So I think that's one of the reasons that we can expect it. (CROSSTALK)",

Look, I will sound like a broken record. There is an opportunity here for Donald Trump. I'm not going to agree with his policies, policies he put forth in the tax bill or on immigration. But he could be a leader and earn some of my respect by acknowledging the mistakes of the past and saying we are moving forward. I am highly doubtful he will do that. But there is an opportunity. Because we are an extremely divided country and there are many Americans that did not want him to be reelected because of January 6th. And there is a chance and an opportunity for him to govern.

Instead of certifying the results of a presidential election where a Democrat won, they were certifying the results where a Republican won. And not just any Republican but Donald Trump, who many Democrats blame still on Capitol Hill for really inciting rioters to come to the capitol four years ago. And, you know, I talked to a lot of Democrats going into today and after today's proceeds. And I will note, you know, a lot of them were really emotional about what took place four years ago. Here's one of them, Rep. Jim Himes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM Himes (D-T): And I am a keep-calm, carry-on guy. But, you know, that day was traumatic enough for even those of us who like to keep calm and carry on, it caused an upwelling of emotion. I can feel the anger and I can feel the resentment, which I don't, by the way, celebrate. But it's exacerbated by the fact that about a week after this terrible event that made a laughingstock of American democracy around the work, you've got Kevin McCarthy going down to Mar-a-Lago to try to patch things up.

CNN Pentagon reporter, Oren Liebermann, joins us now with more. Oren, bring us up to speed. OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Boris, the entire purpose of this lawsuit that was filed about a year and a half ago and the settlement here that the plaintiffs say they have reached is to correct the records of thousands of the servicemembers who were discharged under \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" The total number discharged was 30,000 and this, according to the plaintiffs, could affect about 18,000 of those, so a very large group here. The purpose is to correct the records. If the record upon discharge, has the words \"discriminatory, sexual orientation\" indicators as part of the reason this service member left the military, this settlement agreement aims to correct that. Without going through a formal Board of Corrections process, which could be timely and difficult, this effectively makes everything simpler and more efficient and could help thousands of servicemembers, according to the plaintiffs here. We should note that we have reached out to the Department of Defense for comment here. They haven't confirmed a settlement has been reached. The plaintiffs say there is an agreement in this case. This has been an ongoing process, as you can tell, that, for years, tried to correct the records for those who were discharged under \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" And this, a big part of it, was actually to make it easier to show an honorable discharge and, if they want, an option to re-enlist much faster.",
