The markets and the events of the day, the main events of the day: EU chief encourages the US to do its fair share for Ukraine after Europe approves 50 billion euros in new funding. Outside of that meeting, raucous protests from farmers, the discontent is finding a voice across the continent. And the closest outcome to riding in a royal coach, a tour of Bonhams auction of memorabilia from \"The Crown.\" Absolutely. Live from New York, Thursday, February 1st, new month. I'm Richard Quest on February, as elsewhere, I mean business. Good evening. We begin tonight, President Zelenskyy has welcomed as a clear signal of support, Europe's decision to approve 50 billion euros in aid. That's about $54 billion. The current plan is to use the interest on the income from frozen Russian assets to fund the package. More than $200 billion worth of assets are within EU jurisdiction. All 27 members agreed, Hungary lifted its veto and President Zelenskyy said the unanimous decision is crucial in making it clear that Europe is behind Ukraine in a united way. Krisjanis Karins is Latvia's foreign minister, he joins me now. In the run up to the vote, I got an indication it was going to happen, but what did you do to buy off Viktor Orban's opposition?",

It is a very clear decision, a unanimous decision, a very clear signal for Ukraine that they will have our undivided financial support over the next four years.

There were tractors galore, protesting over rising costs, stricter rules and what they say now unfair competition and that includes from Ukraine. It followed protests in France more today and resting concessions from the government. CNN's Melissa Bell is our correspondent in Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): From Italy to Greece, Portugal and France, the anger of farmers has grown and spread, reaching now all the way to the heart of the EU, too restrictive they say in terms of regulations, but with little to protect them from unfair competition, especially from duty free Ukrainian meat. Calls for action forcing themselves onto the agenda of leaders gathered in Brussels to discuss aid to Ukraine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We are asking the leaders to review their laws. They talk about being greener, but if that happens, then there will be land which isn't worked anymore and it is difficult enough, as it is. BELL (voice over): Concerns echoed by farmers in France who've reached the edge of Paris where the police have drawn a line. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We can't earn a living. We are subject to enormous constraints and there are products coming in from outside Europe that compete with us without having to apply the same rules that we're obligated to in order to produce. BELL (on camera): Scenes like these have been playing out across the European Union, and whilst the grievances are fairly distinctive from country to country, what unites the farmers across the EU is in the end, frustration with Brussels, the red tape, and bureaucracy regulations that it imposes and the facts say the farmers that it doesn't protect them sufficiently from competition from outside the EU. SEBASTIAN ABIS, FRENCH INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL AND STRATEGIC AFFAIRS (through translator): Why is it that we tell a European farmer that he cannot produce like this, but we allow food products to enter the European market which cost less. They have to produce food and increasingly, they have to offer bioenergy, and bioeconomy. They have to keep in mind, the environment, the landscape and sometimes regulations and standards. Not all measures are compatible or convergent. BELL (voice over): The anger has spread across the EU and beyond the disruption now represents a political threat. With European elections just a few months away, and leaders rushing to announce concessions. GABRIEL ATTAL, FRENCH PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Our livestock farmers need specific support. That's why I'm announcing that we're allocating 150 million euros to them in tax and social support starting this year and continuing on a permanent basis. BELL (voice over): Yet so far little has calmed the farmers, united across Europe in their anger at Brussels which they say is killing their livelihoods. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In other words, that her son would harm somebody. So it is a high standard. That's why we haven't really seen cases like this before. But there's a lot of evidence that she did know the extent of her son's troubles and of course she knew about the gun and didn't notify anyone in authority about that. So, you know, we'll see how the testimony continues, particularly cross-examination I think will be really instrumental as prosecutors probe her and what she did and didn't know and what she should and shouldn't have done here.
