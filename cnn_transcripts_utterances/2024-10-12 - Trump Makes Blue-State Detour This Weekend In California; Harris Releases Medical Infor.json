I'm Alex Marquardt in today for Fredricka Whitfield.We are now just over three weeks, only three weeks away from election day, and the candidates and their running mates are keeping busy campaigning all across the country this weekend. Right now Senator J.D. Vance, Trump's running mate, he's in battleground Pennsylvania where he just toured a company that is developing military vehicles and defense systems. Meanwhile, the Democratic VP nominee Tim Walz, he is spending part of his morning or he spent part of his morning pheasant hunting in his home state of Minnesota, where he is of course the governor. A brand new poll out today of two key battleground states shows how tight this race really is. The \"New York Times\"-Sienna College poll has Vice President Kamala Harris with a slight lead in Pennsylvania, while former president Donald Trump takes a similar size lead out in Arizona. Both candidates are on the campaign trail today, traveling to battleground states on opposite sides of the country. Trump is campaigning out west. In the next hour, he's going to be holding a roundtable campaign event near Las Vegas in battleground Nevada. And later tonight he's going to be holding a rare campaign rally in the deep blue state of California where he lost by some five million votes in 2020. And that's where we find CNN's Kristen Holmes right where Trump is going be holding that rally tonight. Kristen, so what do we know about Trump's strategy here for campaigning in this state where frankly he stands no chance of winning in November.",

He's planning for an event in Chicago later this week. So he's clearly doing some diversion from these battleground states. And when you talk to his senior advisers they say that it doesn't really matter where Donald Trump is campaigning.Sure. They are still doing these battleground states. In addition to Colorado yesterday, he was in Nevada where we see him again today. He will be in Arizona tomorrow, but they say that they believe the media landscape has changed and one of the things that they are trying to do is reached these low propensity voters. These voters that don't typically engage with politics in a general media landscape. They might get their news from podcasts or clips on social media and they believe that this, a rally at Coachella, could go just as far as a swing-state rally. Now this also gives him an opportunity and this is what we expect to hear from him today to just rag on Kamala Harris. One of the things that he has done time and time again is attack her record in the state of California as well as Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom. So we expect him to go after her for that as well. When you talk to these traditional Republican operatives, they think this is a wasted opportunity. They have no idea why Donald Trump is in this state today. Now I did have some sources tell me that Donald Trump has been saying he thought he could win California. But if you talk to the people who are actually close to him, the people running the campaign, they think that is absolutely a pipe dream that there's no way that that could happen. Of course we will be here on the ground. We'll keep you posted on how many people actually show up. We know he has some supporters in Southern California but, again, as you said, almost zero chance of winning in this state.",

Let me start with Vice President Harris releasing this medical report and part of the reason that she's released this letter is to really draw a contrast between herself and Donald Trump who at 78 years old is vying to become the oldest person ever elected to that office.

If you'll recall, in presidential elections past it was very common for both candidates to really pretty detailed medical histories. I mean, I remember John McCain in 2008 released some piles and piles of documents because he has this cancer history.So this is sort of a new norm since President Trump was elected in 2016, where it's just campaigns are run so much differently. But honestly, I think most voters have largely made up their minds and also even if they're worried about health, they're worried about issues like the border, the economy, immigration, fuel prices, inflation, a lot of other things that they're more likely to make their decisions on.",

This time we don't know if any fundraisers, but Coachella Valley, that desert, there are a lot of wealthy donors out there, so it would not be surprising if he's meeting with them, you know, or they show up at this event. In addition, I think, you know, the point his campaign makes about this sort of a nationalized campaigning. Wherever he goes, his message is going to be played all over the airwaves everywhere.And I've heard one other thing from some Republicans in California, who have ties with his campaign, and that's, you know, he wants to have a better popular vote showing than previous elections. And even if California is extraordinarily blue, because the state is so big, it's home to like 5.5 million or so Republicans, registered Republicans, which is the most of any state that has for your party preference. So even though California is obviously very, very Democratic, but still there are so many Republicans here who could help him with the popular vote.",

There's no such thing as getting an A grade but in terms of the collaboration that's happening between the White House, FEMA and the governors, I think they're doing a good strong B.

That hasn't happened yet, but that doesn't mean it won't happen.The primary Israeli objective is to eliminate Hezbollah's presence in the area below the Litani River, which is roughly 18 miles from the Israeli border. And that's the area from which Hezbollah can most easily launch projectiles and other rockets into Israel and harass both military and civilian installations within Israel. So at the very least, I think we should expect to see the IDF continuing to move on the ground towards the Litani, rooting out infrastructure. The question is, where do they go beyond that? Do they go north of Litani? There have been airstrikes south -- north of the Litani, south of the Awali River. Is that just going to be limited to air activity or is there going to be an effort to potentially move IDF forces farther north which would break the pattern that we've seen over the last 40 years in which most of the combat was relegated to the Litani.",

I think that's what the Israeli government is telling President Biden on. And we shouldn't be insensitive to the possibility that there could be some advantage to be gained from this. But we also have to keep in mind the long history of Israel and Lebanon, and things seldom continue on a linear trajectory. I think focusing on those as opposed to nice-to-haves is really critical.
