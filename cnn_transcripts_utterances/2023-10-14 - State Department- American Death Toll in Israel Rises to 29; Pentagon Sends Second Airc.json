Good evening.A short time ago, the US State Department confirmed that the American death toll from the Hamas attacks has climbed by two to 29 Americans dead. Meanwhile, Israel has put the world on notice, it is planning for the next stage of its war with Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted a video online of his visit with troops at the frontline near the Gaza border, a ground invasion seems more likely by the hour. Israel has told people in Northern Gaza, more than one million people we should note, to get out, to evacuate to the south for their own safety. But even the United Nations has called that impossible and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is only getting worse. The United Nations says water is running out, putting two million people at risk. Palestinian officials now say more than 2,000 people have died so far. Israel says that includes a Hamas commander who played a key part and last Saturday's attack. And I want to bring in my colleague, Erin Burnett, who is live in Tel Aviv. Erin, I know you have seen a lot, you have heard a lot, but I guess all of our collective sense is at this point, there is much more to come in the hours and days ahead. What's the latest on your end?",

Today, we saw heavy artillery -- Israeli heavy artillery, tanks as we've been seeing throughout the week, but they are ready and actually speaking to a soldier today at the kibbutz of Be'eri which had been hit by the Hamas, one of the first to be attacked by Hamas militants on Saturday morning. It was that steely preparation that he said in two decades as a soldier he has never seen the things that he saw. Actually, in Be'eri today where he was and they were soldiers right along that Gaza border, Jim, all ready, all at alert, all with their machine guns out. It's still an active zone. You know, we saw the horrors. The body bags still coming out, a soldier telling us of walking into a room and a baby girl on her back shot execution style on the head. These are the things that we're still hearing about, new and unbelievable and unspeakable atrocities and it is that that has them ready. They are ready and they are waiting, and it is almost with a finger on the trigger, literally in some places, Jim, literally fingers on the trigger that we see. They are ready to go and they are waiting, hundreds of thousands of them on that border of Gaza. And as this tension builds, we do have some breaking news on the United States role in this and Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. So Oren, what are you learning at this hour?",

And second, the risk of this escalating beyond Israel's borders.The goal here is not to get involved in the fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza in any way. Instead, it is to send a message of deterrence to everyone who is watching and watching very closely and perhaps waiting for an opportunity to take advantage of perhaps what they perceive as weakness on the part of Israel. So that message directly to Iran and Iran's proxies in the region, especially Hezbollah, just to the north of Israel in Lebanon. The first carrier strike group, the USS Gerald R. Ford arrived earlier this week. It comes with it four guided missile destroyers and a guided missile cruiser. Now, we've learned according to two US officials, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower is also headed to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea as part of or rather leading a carrier strike group. It left Naval Station Norfolk just yesterday, so it'll still take a couple of weeks to get there, and it is unclear at this point what ships it's traveling, but two aircraft carrier strike groups in the Eastern Med is an enormous statement from the United States of support for Israel and a warning to others in the region who might seek to get involved. It is also worth noting that this isn't -- these aren't waters after the withdrawal or the end of the war mission in Iraq and the withdrawal from Afghanistan that normally see two carriers, so that too, is part of what makes this so significant -- Erin.",

It's when we are listening to those phone calls, we're passing on information.Now there's two operational pieces that are forming here. One, first and foremost is the rescue of those hostages, over 150 were taken hostage after the massacre in Southern Israel, which means that Israeli Special Operations units such as the General Staff Reconnaissance Unit, Sayeret Matkal, which reports directly to the chief-of-staff, that's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's old unit. That's the same unit that went to Entebbe, Jim, in 1976 and rescued 103 hostages, brought them back to Israel after a week of very highly skilled unit. You've got the YAMAM, the Ye?ida Meyu?edet Merkazit, Israel's national police hostage rescue unit. They're preparing right now in conjunction with the command to potentially blitz and get all of that information together, hopefully, they are training on scenarios right now. They've got time to build structures so that they'll be able to make very clean and fast entries into buildings and into tunnels and that would potentially happen at the same time as this ground offensive, a smokescreen possibly and at the same time, we've got the counteroffensive right now. We've had missiles that have been coming down for a couple of days, there are special operations units from our troops from the Shaldag Unit, which is the kingfisher unit. Those are commandos who infiltrate, put those missiles down there selectively so that innocents don't get hit and so we're looking at those two main pieces right now which are getting prepped, and this quiet could just mean, you know, this is the calm before the storm.",

And the reason why is because the hostage siege right now is happening in multiple locations, with dozens and dozens and dozens, a hundred fifty, probably more that just hasn't been verified.And so you've got multiple target locations, and you're going to have to have multiple teams working in multiple places, at the same time, performing very high level operations, which Israel is really good at, however, to try and predict how that's going to happen is tricky, because at the same time, the operational goal is the complete destruction of Hamas. So what we've been seeing for the last couple of days with all the missiles and all the artillery, is designed to really create pathways and openings for tanks and for the Givati unit, which is the unit that is responsible for the southern command, they are an elite infantry unit, they've got special operations within those units. So they're softening Gaza to be able to open up these pathways. But you know, who is to say that Israel hasn't been on the ground for the last four days conducting reconnaissance and surveillance missions within Gaza to bring that information back because the hostage rescue mission, Jim, is only as capable as the intelligence is real time. But again, Israel is really good at this. They're really creative, and they have a lot of experience with this particular set of missions. So it may be a combination, it may be a smokescreen, creating diversions, a lot of moving pieces here. This is the largest hostage siege in the history of modern warfare. It's going to be interesting, but I'll tell you this, Israel is really good under pressure, and they're really smart, and they really are able to come together when the going gets tough. So, I think you might see some magic here. ACOSTA: Well, and you know, I was talking to an Israeli Defense Forces spokesman earlier on in this program, who said that they want to give Gaza civilians as much time as possible to evacuate, and I suppose it raises the question as to how long you can wait.",

What I see here is a hostage siege that involves the 150-plus Israelis who are being held captive -- old women, children -- and I see another 170,000 being held captive in the city of Gaza, and whether they're moving them south. From what I understand, El-Sisi is not opening the backdoor to Egypt, and even if he did, Hamas isn't opening the other side of that door to let them out.",

It's now time, in Israel's mind and the world is seeing it for the complete destruction of Hamas militarily and in every other format. Israel's focus right now is hostages. Their focus right now is the complete destruction of that organization, logistical supplies, every potential structure where weapons and communications -- everything is being stored, as well as every Hamas terrorist.The complicated part is that because we're dealing with this terror group, it opens up all of the civilian casualties. But at this point, right now, Israel is going to lean in to a couple of things that they're really good at, which is selective fire, making sure that no shots are fired at civilians. I can tell you firsthand, I've gone through extra beatings in my training to make sure that my weapon is pointed in the right direction, to make sure that I'm looking at the threat, fratricide, all these things that we train for.

Oren Liebermann did a great - a lot of reporting on Hamas' arsenal, what they had, where they had gotten it, right, when it's so difficult to things to get material in and how Israel clearly was unaware, obviously, of what was being planned or the scope of what Hamas had.I spoke to IDF spokesperson and he told me, he was very open about it last night, that they still, Israel still does not know the extent of Hamas' arsenal right now, that they simply do not know. Robin, how surprised are you at how much Israel has clearly from this attack itself and now admitting that they don't know the scale of Hamas's arsenal, how much Israel does not know?",

And the fact that Israel was surprised both by the scope of the aggression by Hamas and the size of its arsenal, that it has still managed to fire things from Gaza, even though parts of Gaza have been decimated.And remember, Hezbollah's arsenal is far larger than Hamas. So this is where when you kind of look at what could happen down the road, what the potential, whether it's this conflict or the next one, because wars in the Middle East inevitably beget more wars. And so we're looking at the immediate conflict with Israel will gain some kind of military control, but it doesn't eliminate the ideas, the ideology or the other adversaries that Israel faces.",

They're talking about Putin, who has failed to make comments supporting Israel, who certainly benefits from the situation here as pertains to the eye of the United States or the money of the United States coming off of Ukraine. You have China making at best tepid and what seemed to frankly be quite supportive of Hamas and Gaza comments.How much bigger really could this get?",

And there had been progress, and now this, of course, brings it to a halt. But you're absolutely right. The great - the thing that worries me the most is the scope of what's happening worldwide, that the kind of principles of warfare have changed, that there are - this - the international institutions are no longer as functional in bringing about peace, that the kind of rules, the world order has begun to erode.We see this play out in Ukraine. We see this in China's statements on aggression on Taiwan. We see this in shifting alliances. It's very worrisome and I think that it's very smart to kind of stand back and try to figure out what does this mean for the whole world, not just this part, this small part of the Middle East? It's very worrying on a lot of different levels.",

Priscilla, it's been a busy day for the President. He's spoken to both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas.

But the secretary of state has been making the rounds in the region in diplomatic talks with different countries that have stake in this. And then, of course, the Defense Department making this move to make that show of force to, again, make sure that the conflict is not widened.
