They're being taken not on a field trip to see the dinosaurs, but out of harm's way from the scene of a school of mass shooting, another one this time in Nashville at the Covenant School, a private Christian school for kids from pre-K age to sixth grade. Reading from its webpage, the beauty of a preschool to six school is in its simplicity and innocence. \"Students are free to be children,\" the website says, \"Celebrating childhood\" says at the top of the homepage. Two girls and a boy, reportedly all nine were murdered there today by a 28-year-old former student who also murdered three adults before being killed by police. The children were Evelyn Dieckhaus, William Kinney, Hallie Scruggs, and Hallie's dad, a Senior Pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church which runs the school. Two of the adults murdered Cynthia Peak and Mike Hill were both 61. Mike Hill's friend posted this photo of him online and said Mr. Hill was the last employee hired when he ran the school and church kitchen. He said he was the kind of person who would sacrifice for others. Katherine Koonce was also murdered. She was 60, head of the Covenant School. Her daughter is also a teacher there. Police say her killer who they say was transgender was carrying a handgun and two assault style rifles. President Biden today called on Congress to do what it has shown no willingness to do since the Federal ban on such weapons expired in 2004. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So we've seen it, we've seen mass shooters literally copy the things that they've read from previous manifestos of previous mass shooters and their statements about why they've decided to strike out against innocent civilians in their own community. So it's not uncommon, it does give us some insight as to what this person's motivation may have been, but at the end of the day, you know, I don't know that it really tells us that much.",

They exhibited well-practiced and well-trained tactical techniques. They went in with five people. They covered both the first floor and the second floor. Excuse me, they also had medical folks from the Fire Department deployed with them. And yet, despite that remarkably efficient and quick response, we still have six innocent people dead. So it just proves the point that no matter how good law enforcement is, they'll never be in front of the shooter, they'll never be before the shooter. You're constantly trying to just limit damages.

This is very common planning and preparation activity, acquiring the weapons, acquiring the ammunition, oftentimes, special clothing and it is shocking that while this is going on, people around them and their families and their communities don't see these things and bring them to law enforcement's attention that can certainly help.",

Right? Essentially, you know, the Pew Research Center has this interesting question, which is, is it more important to protect the right to own guns, or control gun ownership? And when it comes to protecting the right to own guns, only about 20 percent of Democrats thought it was more important to protect the right to own guns than control gun ownership in 2000. That's about the same percentage now. But if you look at Republicans, the number -- the percentage is way up. It was about you know, 40 percent back 22 years ago, and now it's close to 80 percent.And so you know, when we come to the issue of how are we supposed to deal with all of this, the fact that the two parties are farther apart than they've ever been, and I think part of the reason why we really haven't seen much movement is because it just doesn't seem like there's very much that can bring the two parties together, Anderson, on the fundamental question about the right to own guns versus controlling gun ownership.",

What is going through your mind tonight? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Well, listen, obviously, in Connecticut, 10 years later, we are still reeling from the massacre in Sandy Hook Elementary School. There is something uniquely cataclysmic when you lose a child, when you lose a family member, but it is also important to remember that all the kids in that school, all the adults in that school are never ever going to be the same. The entire community is going to experience trauma that's going to stay with them for a very, very long time. And so, you know, I've stayed very close to the victims in Connecticut, but I'm frankly, equally as close to the victims of everyday gun violence -- the suicides, the homicides, the accidental shootings.

The question in that Pew poll is, do you think you should protect people from gun violence? Or do you think we should respect the rights of gun owners?In fact, you can do both at the same time. And so I'm never sure how relevant the answer to that poll is, other than Republicans increasingly think that as Republicans, they are supposed to answer one way and Democrats increasingly think as Democrats, they're supposed to answer the other way. The reality is, most Americans think you should do both. You should respect the Second Amendment. You shouldn't take guns away from law- abiding citizens, but you should make sure that criminals and people who are seriously mentally ill don't get their hands on guns and that we should take these military style assault weapons off the streets. I think we can still continue to work to find common ground. Obviously, we made a breakthrough last year. The bill we passed, the bipartisan Safer Communities Act is the first significant anti-gun violence legislation in 30 years. I understand that was a difficult vote for some Republicans, the first time that they ever crossed the NRA, but I think they've seen that the sky hasn't fallen.
