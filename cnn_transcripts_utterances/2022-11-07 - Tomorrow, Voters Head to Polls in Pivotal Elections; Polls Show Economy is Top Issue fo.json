Now, two-term Republican Senator Ron Johnson is facing Wisconsin's Lieutenant Democratic Governor Mandela Barnes in a closely contested state, a state where President Biden won by less than 21,000 votes. Now president -- pardon me, Senator Johnson is a close ally of the former president, Donald Trump. He has a history of controversial statements of conspiracy theories, about COVID-19, as well as the January 6 Capitol attack.Now, he was asked a relatively simple question on the campaign trail last week, whether he would commit to accepting results of the midterm elections, his answer, in part, and I quote, I sure hope I can, but I can't predict what the Democrats might have planned, obviously not a yes. Now, he was asked in part this question because a top Milwaukee election official was fired last week after requesting military ballots for fake voters and then sending them to a Republican lawmaker. And more recently in his final pitch to voters, Johnson has been pushing racial divisions. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI):  He's talking about racism in Wisconsin, said it is actually scarier than down south because we institutionalized here in Wisconsin. We just figure out how to conceal it. He called it concealed carry racism. So, that is what he thinks of you. Kind of makes you scratch your head. I mean, why would he want to represent people who have institutionalized racism? LT. GOV. MANDELA BARNES (D-WI):  Ron Johnson is a completely negative campaign because he doesn't have a record to run on. He spent 12 years serving himself. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They put out a list. They're hoping people can update that information and get it all fixed before Election Day. There is about a thousand of them here in Allegheny County. Same thing, they put out information. So, if you did mail in your ballot in one of those two counties, you may want to check on that. And as you mentioned, this is an incredibly tight race here, projected to be quite tight. So, any sort of edge that any candidate can get, they certainly want it, and any sort of 3,400 or a thousand ballots could absolutely make a difference. We've got Republican Mehmet Oz and Democratic Challenger John Fetterman, they are all across the commonwealth today. This is after three presidents were here over the weekend. Former President Barack Obama and President Joe Biden rallying in Philadelphia and then Obama here in Pittsburgh for the Democratic candidates. And then former President Trump was just about an hour outside of here in Pittsburgh rallying for the Republican candidates. Oz really still trying to pitch himself as an independent voice, as a moderate. He really kept that even at the Trump rally, not mentioning former President Trump by name, not mentioning the Republican gubernatorial candidate by name, Doug Mastriano. Fetterman really attacking that position, saying that Oz, essentially trying to frame him as a phony, saying that Fetterman is really the only one that's been here that will stick up for people in Pennsylvania. But, ultimately, it is the people that get to decide. And we talked to some of them over last week. Listen to what they had to say. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

One of the things that's interesting to me is there is so much focus on this Senate race in Pennsylvania. But there are dozens of states who will also be voting for governor.

And so Shapiro is going to win. But the focus is on the Senate race because it is so tight. And, frankly, we have two fairly flawed candidates running for Senate right now. But it seems to me that Oz is pretty well positioned to win after the disastrous debate performance by Fetterman.

But you also have to talk about the economy.I think the tragedy here is that the Democrats have something to say on the economy, in terms of what Biden has done when it comes to 10 million jobs, what Biden has done when it comes to prescription drug prices, standing up to China or the CHIPS Act and also the fear of what Republicans will do. If you think it is bad now, I think Democrats should have been saying, wait until Republicans shut down the government to knock out social security and Medicare. Wait until prescription drug prices go up. But we didn't focus enough firepower on that issue. And I think it is going to potentially cost us. However, people still got to go vote.
