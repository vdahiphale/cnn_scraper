A new NBC News poll shows the president's approval rating at just 41 percent. And potentially a more alarming sign, a \"Washington Post\"/ABC News poll shows Biden ten points behind former President Trump among registered voters in a head-to-head national matchup. But the \"Washington Post\" is acknowledging this poll may be an outlier. The NBC poll found Biden and Trump tied, each getting support from 46 percent of registered voters nationally.CNN's Jeff Zeleny joining us now to discuss. Concerned is a word. I feel like that word might be a little more extreme, if you will, looking at these numbers.",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Sara.There's usually an adjective in front of concerned when you talk to Democrats about how they are feeling about the White House and the state of Joe Biden's re-election effort. But, of course, all of this must be put into context. We are more than a year before the general election next year. That's why all of these polls certainly offer us a sense of where things are. But as you said, that ABC News/\"Washington Post\" poll is an outlier. All of the other recent national polls show that this is a -- essentially a dead heat between President Biden and former President Donald Trump should they actually face off next year in a rematch. But one thing that's very clear, the specifics of these polls are not as important as the underlying dynamics here. And that is that there are challenges for the White House that they have not overcome concerns about the economy. They have not overcome concerns about immigration, inflation, on and on. So that is, of course, the backdrop for all of this. Now, this is a big week in presidential politics. One, President Biden is going to Detroit tomorrow to appear with the striking workers. Former President Donald Trump is going on Wednesday to appear in Michigan. Of course, Michigan at the heart of the blue-collar workers, at the heart of the blue wall, if you will, the states that Trump won in 2016 and Biden won four years later. Of course, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania so important. There's also a Republican presidential debate on Wednesday in California that former President Donald Trump is skipping, but his rivals certainly are there. When you look at a couple other numbers in these weekend polls, Sara, this is very interesting. When you ask Republicans if they are satisfied with the choices that they have, of course, they have a deep bench, so many candidates. Look at this number, 86 percent of Republicans say they are satisfied with their choices. Of course some prefer the former president, others prefer other candidates. But when you look at Democrats, are they satisfied? Would they like to see someone challenge Joe Biden? Take a look at these numbers here. Fifty- nine percent of Democrats say they would like to see a challenge. Of course, the question remains, who would that be? There is no one stepping forward. There's no consensus. And the reality is that it's very unlikely to happen. So on this Monday morning, that is where things stand. But certainly for the next year plus a very tight race in this deeply divided country, Sara.",

But, you know, Jeff's exactly right, this thing -- this race is going to be really tight. American presidential elections are very tight. And in the battleground states that matter, the blue wall, this race will be very tight.But a little history matters as well here. Joe Biden's numbers are almost exactly what Barack Obama's numbers were in 2011 when people were counting out President Obama. We had the same challenges with messaging on the economy. That takes some time. And polls -- you know, I've been very critical of polls because, as Jeff says, we're 410 days out here. They're just not predictive. What is actually predictive is these 30 special elections that we've had in this country in 2023 where Democrats are performed 11 percent better than they did in the last two presidential elections, largely because of the abortion issue and some other issues. But, you know, those -- the polls don't show that. And so polls are nice. Everyone gets all excited about them. What actually matters are real numbers. And a real contrast between the Democrats and Republicans. And that's what you're going to see on Wednesday night in the Republican debate.",

Here's the reason I believe fully why Democrats are engaged in such bedwetting is because President Biden is under water on these approval numbers. And look, we're seeing this with regard to how does he handled the economy, immigration, foreign policy. And the numbers are in double digits. And that is not an outlier. Those polls are consistent with regard to his unfavorabilities across the line. And that is going to be a very difficult hill to climb as he moves further -- closer into the general election. And another thing in terms of who is going to stand up and challenge him. \"Politico\" reported this morning that Minnesota Congressman Dean Phillips says I'm considering it. He says, if Democrats are going to be the so-called adults in the room, we need to start looking at a better electoral strategy. And so we do have some that are seriously concerned and potentially others getting in the race.",

He leads by huge numbers, historic numbers in that primary. Or I would look at my candidate and say, OK, what you're really running for is vice president.

DeSantis says he's frustrated that the other challengers haven't gone after Trump as much as they should and sort of given him a pass. Nikki Haley has gone after Trump with regard to how he handled the economy and his current positions on abortion. And all of the candidates are going to show a much stronger contrast between themselves and the other candidates. And specifically Mike Pence. He saw the opportunity in the last debate to show a contrast with Vivek. He certainly will do that. And Tim Scott as well.

And they realize you have to get Donald Trump out of the way in order to get to Joe Biden or whoever the Democratic nominee will be. And they realize this is a very important opportunity to do so on Wednesday night. And it might be in their best interest that Donald Trump won't be there.

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, what I've done is I've talked to contacts and sources on both sides of the boarder from the tip of Texas all the way to California. And what I've been able to learn from these individuals who work with migrants every day, who talk to migrants every day, is that a few things have been driving this current surge.First of all, they tell me that it's misinformation. And not just the cartels distributing this information, but also when migrants actually enter the country, are processed by U.S. immigration authorities, and then released into communities. These community leaders tell me that when migrants send videos back to individuals, to migrants on the border, showing that they have been processed and are now in America, that gives individuals on the Mexican side a lot of hope. And that that has been driving some migrants to go ahead and try their luck and enter in between ports of entry. The other thing that - that one community leader tells me from the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas is that kidnappings in Mexico, in that part of the border, so in the area of Matamoros and Reynosa have increased. And so migrants are having to decide, do they stay and wait for a CBP 1 app appointment, for example, to actually enter the U.S. legally, or do they go ahead and try their luck in fear for their lives crossing the Rio Grande, hoping that they are processed by U.S. immigration authorities and actually allowed to get an immigration court date. But if you ask Customs and Border Protection, what they'll tell you, and U.S. Border Patrol chief tweeted about this yesterday, is they believe that it's the cartels. They say that it's the cartels distributing a lot of this misinformation, using organizations like Facebook and other social media to distribute information prompting migrants to then cross the border at certain areas, also so that they can be used as decoys, Sara, so that they can traffic, whether it be drugs or firearms or what have you in between the ports of entry to make sure that they can conduct business. Because, as you know, at the end of the day, cartels run a business and their goal is to make a buck. Whether they are transporting migrants or drugs or firearms, that's what they're up to and they say that that's what's causing this current surge. Sara.",

And adults, of course, over the age of 70 are the ones predominantly being hospitalized for Covid right now.But the American Academy of Pediatrics is drawing attention to some concerning trends among kids. Hospitalizations among children are up by 5 times since June. And they're particularly rising in kids under the age of five. Now, it's important to put into context that this is off of the lowest levels of hospitalizations that we've seen since the beginning of the pandemic, but they are now getting high enough that some doctors are calling attention to this and they're concerned about how sick people are, some people, when they come into the hospital with Covid. Now the places in the country we're seeing the most hospitalizations right now tend to be in the south. Florida has the highest concentration of hospitalization, the highest rates right now according to CDC data. But when you look at those levels in kids, the American Academy of Pediatrics is pointing out that the vaccination rates for kids under the age of five are really low. Only 13 percent of kids zero to four have gotten any dose of Covid vaccine, compared with about 68 percent of kids who are 12 to 17 years old. So that's a lot of kids who don't have any prior immunity to Covid, either from getting infected or from vaccination.",
