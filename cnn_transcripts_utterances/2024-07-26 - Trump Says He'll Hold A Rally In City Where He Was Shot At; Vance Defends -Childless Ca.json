Trump accusing Vice President Kamala Harris of being, quote, \"disrespectful\" to Netanyahu by forcefully criticizing Israel's conduct in Gaza.Also tonight, Trump running mate JD Vance is defending his controversial past remark, portraying Harris and other Democrats as, quote, \"childless cat ladies.\" Vance now accusing the Democratic Party as a whole of being anti-family and anti-child. Plus, Kamala Harris gets the high powered endorsement she has been waiting for. Barack and Michelle Obama now officially in her corner as the Democrats tighten ranks around their presumptive presidential nominee. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world.

Donald Trump just revealed plans to return to the scene of the attempt on his life. Let's go straight to CNN's Kristen Holmes right near Mar-a-Lago following all the new developments on the Republican side. Kristen, Trump says he's planning another rally in Butler.",

And when I've asked several of his senior advisors if this is on the books, they said that everything is still in the works. But he did just put this on Truth Social, saying he's going to be going back to Butler, Pennsylvania, for a big and beautiful rally honoring the soul of our beloved firefighting hero, Corey, obviously talking about Corey Comperatore, who was killed during that assassination attempt on Donald Trump.But again, Pamela, we still don't have the details of what this is going to look like. We know that he's expected to be in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, next week on Wednesday. But I do want to talk about what you also mentioned in your introduction here, which was how Donald Trump spent his day today, because in addition to sending out this Truth Social, he had a very critical meeting at Mar-a-Lago with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Remember, these are two men who had not sat down together since Trump was in office. And their relationship had really soured with Donald Trump turning on Netanyahu after Netanyahu congratulated President Joe Biden on winning the 2020 election, essentially saying that Netanyahu was disloyal. But today in that meeting, it seemed like that was just water under the bridge. They did let press in briefly. I was able to ask a few questions, and the two men were interacting like nothing had ever changed between them. Now, in addition to saying the relationship was fine, that was Donald Trump. They reacted to Kamala Harris's remarks after her meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday, saying that she stood with Israel, but also talking about the atrocities that she had seen in Gaza. They essentially went after her. Well, Donald Trump did at least saying that they were insulting, those comments were insulting to Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu saying he hoped they didn't impact any of the ceasefire talks.",

So I want to play for you right now what he said in 2021 versus what he said today. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JD VANCE, (R) OHIO SENATE CANDIDATE: We're effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made. Having children, becoming a father, becoming a mother, I really do think it changes your perspective in a pretty profound way that this is not about criticizing people who, for various reasons, didn't have kids.

One thing that Vice President Kamala Harris did this afternoon was call into a meeting of her national finance committee, really taking the opportunity to thank major donors for showing their support over the last couple of days. I just got off the phone with a major donor who was on that call, and they said that there was just palpable enthusiasm on this call as the vice president and top officials took questions as well. It was described as really top officials laying out what needs to happen in the next hundred plus days leading up to election day. Campaign officials really made clear that, of course, a top priority for the vice president is going to be traveling to these key battleground states.But really it's clear that they're doing a really quick reshuffling of her calendar of events and travels as she is now embracing this new role. I'm also told by this donor that I spoke with that she took one question, took multiple questions, but took a question in particular, I should say, on the issue of reproductive rights. And they summarized her as saying this, her administration will be about freedoms and taking the country forward as opposed to repression and taking the country backwards. That's obviously not surprising at all for the vice president. This has already been a major issue that she has taken the lead on for the administration and the campaign as well. Another interesting topic of discussion that came up on this call, I am told, is the Democratic National Convention. That is just around the corner now, Pam, as you know, in August in Chicago. And now that it is not President Biden but the vice president that the party is planning this convention around, party officials on this call made clear that they are rethinking everything from the music to guests and entertainment, quickly trying to figure out how this convention should now look now that it is somebody else, again, that is going to be at the top of the ticket now. All of this, of course, coming as Vice President Kamala Harris has had a really busy couple of days and is continuing to rack up major endorsements, including, of course, from the former president.

Democratic Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut is here, and he is the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, great to have you on. So you heard the Vice President's remarks yesterday. Do you think they would have any impact on the hostage and ceasefire negotiations?REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): Hard to say. You know, I certainly hope that they do. It is well past time for this ceasefire deal to be agreed to. Too many people are dying. Too many hostages have spent too much time in the tunnels of Gaza.

Hamas is, apart from being an appalling terrorist group, drawing on the fact that the Palestinian people have not had hope for a very long time. So in addition to doing the deal, it's incumbent on the Prime Minister to start talking about the future. I would hope it would be a two-state solution. Sadly, I don't believe that will be the case.
