Rahel Solomon is in New York. Eleni Giokos is in Dubai and Anna Stewart is in London. Let's start with you, Rahel. You've seen what the markets are doing.

I'm not sure that investors really buy that the financial system is completely safe at this point because the bank stocks are sharply lower as we open this week. And there is a real question about what exactly happened here this weekend. And who exactly benefits from this? So, essentially, Becky, what you had here was the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve stepping up in unison. And, of course, the White House stepping up in unison to announce that the FDIC will ensure not just the $250,000 that is customary, but going above and beyond that, saying that it will ensure all deposits at SVB and any other institutions like it. And real questions now about who ultimately benefits from this? I talked to one founder, Becky, who has her money at SVB. And she said there's a part of the story that many people are missing.

I mean, we've heard President Biden say just about an hour ago, that we need a full accounting of exactly what happened here. And people need to be held accountable. So, there will be a lot of questions in terms of what happened here. Because as we understand it right now, Becky, it doesn't appear that anything criminal took place, it appears that this was interest rate risk.

Maybe the investors are as keen on the acquisition, at least not if you look at the share price at HSBC, sorry. Shares are down today, although so are pretty much all U.K. banks, all European banks, which does make you question, are they playing catch up from the market moves on Monday late when European markets was shut or is and I'll pick them what Rahel was saying, is there a fear here that given the backdrop we're against with raising rising interest rates?

It's heartwarming to have seen the empathy towards their plight from so many of you. Gary Lineker will be back on air for the BBC and the F.A. Cup game on Manchester City against Burnley on Saturday.

The diplomatic breakthroughwas mediated by China and announced in Beijing on Friday. Well, many in this region, and remember, we are broadcast from the UAE. This is our Middle East Broadcasting hub. Many in this region are hopeful that that agreement can usher in a new era of reduced hostility in some of the region's most complex areas of conflict such as Yemen and Iraq. The UAE which was struck in January of 2022 by missiles and drones fired by -- from Yemen by Houthi rebels welcomed the agreement and said it valued China's role in the negotiations. Well, my next guest says there needs to be a trust building period and actions on the ground to cement this agreement. Some may be skeptical of Saudi intentions or indeed call this a U-turn while they are clearly not up to date with the kingdom's declared policy. Those are words of Faisal Abbas who is the editor-in-chief of Arab News. And he joins me now live. Just let's pick that apart, if we will. And let's see if we can sort of expand on what you wrote here. You talk about the kingdom's declared policy. I think, here you are talking about their policy of diplomacy first. A new era of diplomacy first, which you are seeing not just in this region but around the world. Let's just talk about that this new declared policy and how this agreement between Saudi and Iran fits into that. FAISAL ABBAS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, ARAB NEWS: Well, Becky, first of all, thank you very much for having me. In the wise words of Sun Tzu in the famous book, Art, for the best battles are one without fighting. So, if this agreement can help us achieve our goals, get us where we want to be in 2030. And end this bloody chapter, which have -- we have lived through, the whole region has lived through for decades, then it's a win on all fronts. Now, there has been some geopolitical factors that has helped in the change or accelerated this process, as you very well -- might very well remember, in the beginning of the Biden administration. There were some not so assuring, reassuring messages sent when the Houthis were removed of the terror list and the Patriot batteries were withdrawn from Saudi Arabia at a time when our civilians and our cities were being targeted. For us, in Saudi Arabia, we have a very clear vision. We are headed towards 2030 to diversify away from oil, we want world class entertainment, we want to open up new sectors. And this is an opportunity not just for Saudis but for everybody in the world who wants to come and live here and contribute to this thriving economy. And we don't want anything to risk achieving that. Now, if Iran chooses to stay in 1979, that's their choice. But we certainly want to go to 2030 and we cannot have that with drones and missiles hovering over our heads.",

And then I wantto talk about the implications for the kingdom's relationship with the U.S. because some of what you've just been describing there very much sits in that bucket. Let's talk about Iran-Saudi relations. There have been years of hostility and these aren't regional rivals who have, you know, that rivalry has really created a lot of conflict and crisis across this region. So, how does the kingdom expect to get this deal to strike? They've given Iran, they've given Tehran two months before they reopen embassies. What do they need to see in those two months to fully believe that Tehran is on board?",

And Iran's history speaks foritself, unfortunately, has history has a way to repeat itself. So, there's a lot of attention paid to the details. And this is probably why, as you just mentioned, the deal wasn't signed immediately. It was given two months which I think is a very wise decision for the nitty gritty or for the details to be agreed upon. Under no circumstances are we expecting to wake up the next morning and everybody's suddenly hugging each other. As I said earlier, this is a conflict that has been going on for decades, there has been previous attempts of rapprochement. But it has failed mainly due to Iran not sticking to their end of the bargain. But we'll -- let's keep the keep an eye on the ball here, what this could possibly achieve. By being a realist, we -- if we want to be realists, this is the first step towards a very exciting future. You and I both live in this region. Imagine waking up one day with -- without having a war in Yemen, without having a conflict in Syria with a thriving Lebanon, with Iraq going back to its full potential, that would be a dream come true. And that would be good for the whole region and the whole world. What this is, it's the first step towards that direction, but I don't think anybody is expecting us to get there quickly. And I don't think anybody is expecting us to blink during the process. However, the most recent statement from the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, just today actually, is saying that is very reassuring, since that -- what they've said is this could possibly lead to a resolution in Yemen. And of course, nobody in the right mind wouldn't wish that that would be true.",

America has a lot to gain from a stable Middle East, not just in terms of market, but in terms of their own military and intelligence commitments to this part of the world. And to think of the passage through the Red Sea maritime security. So, this -- first of all, first and foremost is in the absolute interest of the United States to have a stable and secure Middle East. Second of all, you know, it wasn't like the United States approached Saudi Arabia with a proposal to resolve this and it was rejected. But the mere fact is, if we put aside the sensitivities, which I don't think are necessary, this is a very logical step forward in the sense that the nature of these agreements have to be shrouded in secrecy for them to be successful. And the other thing is, you need a mediator that is trusted by both sides. Now, China has no history of aggression or colonialism in the region. It's not like the United States, or U.K. or France, even. It has on most issues in the Middle East, it has to remain impartial, focused on trade and commerce. And most importantly, and I will say this is, you know, the factor in this equation. It actually has leverage over China. Sorry. China has actually leverage over Iran. It is Iran's biggest trading partner. It supplies Iran with nuclear technology with military equipment and technology and has invested billions in the gas and -- oil and gas industry in Iran. So, if anybody has leverage over Iran, it is China. And this is why these talks were successful.",
