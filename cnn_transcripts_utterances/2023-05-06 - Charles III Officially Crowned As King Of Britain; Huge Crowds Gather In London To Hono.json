It's still pretty festive atmosphere, a bit of a party atmosphere, despite the weather, and they've been here all day. In fact, some of them have been here for a few days. Look over here. People were camped out along the Mall to try to catch a glimpse of the procession.And you can see what is left of a few days of camping. They have some cleanup to do, for sure here. A lot of people that I talked to, you know, we're just over the moon to be here. I met one woman who is 70 something and she sat in the rain on a lawn chair overnight just to be here. Not everyone was so enthused, though. Of course, there were anti-monarchy protesters. The Metropolitan Police say that more than 50 people are arrested and some of them seemingly for very little as well. The police have just been granted new powers to arrest, make arrest during peaceful protests. They say that some of those people were committing conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. In other words, they thought that they were going to glue themselves to gates or buildings or roads, or what have you. The ceremony itself as you saw in Max's piece there went off virtually without a hitch, but there were a few funny moments. One of them that went viral was Katy Perry. The singer who's actually here to perform in a coronation concert tomorrow couldn't find her seat, it seemed. And so, she kind of walked around the Muse. Befuddled for a little while and she tweeted later saying, don't worry, guys, I did find my seat. There was also a bit of a timing mix up with King Charles and his son, Prince William, the Prince of Wales, where Charles actually arrived at Westminster Abbey, before his son sort of waited in the carriage for a few minutes and then it was decided that the King would actually proceed into the Abbey before his son out of order. But a lot of people surely wouldn't have noticed or wouldn't have cared. One of the things I mentioned, Fredricka is this was an amazing exercise in crowd control. So, people were along the Mall for the duration of the day, with the exception of the very end of the ceremony where they open this up and allowed people to come down here towards Buckingham Palace. That building right there. To see the Royals waving on the balcony there which they saw and even when people were allowed to come down and you didn't see a stampede of people, it was really an amazing exercise in crowd control. Unfortunately for people here, they had to cut short, the flyover, it was supposed to be some six minutes of military flying past it ended up being less than half of that. They also missed out on seeing Prince Andrew and Prince Harry who were left out of that balcony shot. And I asked some people about it afterwards. And while some people were happy that Harry wasn't included because he's no longer working royal, others realize just how difficult of a decision the King had to make and who to include and who not to include, but it seems like nothing could have put a damper on this day for most people, Fredricka.",

Some families were here for days camped out, waiting to see a procession. Waiting to get a glimpse of this once in a lifetime event. And perhaps, it's the youngest here. You can see so many kids in the crowds, that -- this really stood out. Families were so insistent that this be an intergenerational event. And that's what you heard from the palace time and time again. They wanted this coordination, to be inclusive, to be diverse. They wanted the public to be a part of it. And as you can see around me, it very much is. After a day like this, of course people just taking this opportunity to take a breath, to think about the day, to reflect with their family.

The firm has a large sprawling financial empire that certainly made the Windsor family rich indeed. But there are many myths about just how wealthy they are.For instance, the family doesn't privately owned Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, or the crown jewels. These are owned by the nation. There are other assets like Regent Street, Ascot Racecourse and even Britain's lucrative seabed that are owned by another institution called the Crown Estate. In a deal struck in 2011, the Royals have paid the Sovereign Grant. It is set at 25 percent of the crown estates profits. This money is given as a kind of allowance pays for staff, royal duties and the upkeep of palaces. And the rest of the Crown Estate money goes back to the British Treasury.",

They did not go into details. But look, it was members of that same community that essentially led police to Dominguez. Fifteen people, at least, called on Wednesday saying they had spotted someone that matched the description of the suspect in this case. And at least one of these callers followed Dominguez to the point where authorities were able to get to that exact location. Once they got there, authorities found a large knife in his backpack. They arrested him for that to begin with. And authorities saying they spent hours trying to interview him. They described him as someone who was very reserved. And, unfortunately, police say they do not have a motive. What they do have, though, according to authorities, is evidence linking him to the crime.
