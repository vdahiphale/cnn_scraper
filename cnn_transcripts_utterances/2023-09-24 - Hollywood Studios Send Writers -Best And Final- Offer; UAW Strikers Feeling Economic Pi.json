Both sides will meet again today. Now, CNN's Parent Company Warner Brothers Discovery is part of the negotiations with the Union. The Writers Guild of America, which has over 11,000 members, has been on strike for nearly five months over wages, worker protections and the use of artificial intelligence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And according to my colleague Oliver Darcy, this deal could come by the end of the weekend.(Voice-over): The two parties spent Saturday negotiating for the fourth consecutive day. And source is telling CNN that while the heads of the four major studios, including Warner Brothers Discovery, CNN's parent company NBCUniversal, Disney and Netflix, were no longer in the room on Saturday, they were engaged in this whole process. Now, this strike that has paralyzed the entertainment industry and has had a major impact when it comes to the economy, some estimates indicate a five-billion-dollar economic impact. And this has affected not just Hollywood, but many, many other industries. A lot of the writers that I've talked to have said that they were ready to return to work after a deal is reached between the two parties. But WGA members still have to ratify the new contract. And furthermore, because the actors are also on strike, a deal doesn't necessarily mean that all productions will go back to normal. But some in the industry do believe that a deal with the writers could speed up the process for SAG-AFTRA negotiations. Overall, it's been a very difficult few months for those in the industry, but it certainly hope is now in the horizon. Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles.

And now you've seen it reaching into movies and television. And just the way that programming is getting delivered, the way that movies are getting delivered has changed. And the real fear of the people who make them and work on them is that they're being left behind, that the technology is changing and they're not keeping up in terms of cashing in and sharing in it. Of course, the studios are their business has taken a hit also. I mean, they're undergoing changes too. So it's not, you know, that everyone has a reason to be a little bit nervous, a little bit antsy about what the future holds.

      "sentences": "And welcome back to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada and around the world I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN Newsroom. Mexico says it has a plan to ease the migrant surge at its border with the U.S. Officials say they'll implement a series of measures in the cities that border El Paso and Eagle Pass, Texas as well as San Diego, California. And that includes a plan to deport migrants who are seeking entry into the U.S. and to prevent migrants from using its railway system to reach the border.Now, Paso, Texas says it's reached a breaking point as it struggles to deal with the influx. The city's opened an overflow shelter for the unprecedented surge in arrivals. Now, this is the Governor of Texas is pledging to send more buses to transport the migrants to other cities. CNN's Rafael Romo reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Texas Governor Greg Abbott is railing against the Biden administration saying border communities are overwhelmed and overrun by the large number of migrants arriving there and calling the situation a crisis. Governor Abbott announced he had directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management to deploy additional buses to the border cities of Eagle Pass and El Paso. The purpose is transporting immigrants to what Abbott calls a self- declared sanctuary cities, which are municipalities mostly run by Democrats. In a statement, Abbott said Texas has bused nearly 12,000 migrants to our nation's capital, nearly 15,000 to New York and an additional 8,702 Chicago. In a statement Abbott said that until President Biden upholds his constitutional duty to secure America's southern border, Texas will continue to deploy as many buses as needed to relieve the strain caused by the surge of illegal crossings. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has announced several steps being taken to address the situation, including the deployment of 800 active-duty military personnel, adding capacity to border facilities, and continuing to conduct deportation flights. The problem goes beyond the migrants who have already made it to the U.S. Southern Border. Take a look at how these migrants are traveling through Mexico on cargo trains using bedsheets as tents to protect themselves from the sun during the long trip north. There may also be tens of thousands of others on their way north. On Tuesday, Ferromex, Mexico's largest railroad operator, suspended service of several northbound train lines after reporting half a dozen injuries and deaths of migrants. We reached out to the government of Panama, a Central American country, that serves as transit point for many immigrants coming from South America and other parts of the world. They told us that during the month of August, nearly 82,000 migrants crossed through their territory. And so far this month, more than 55,000 have done the same. So far this year, nearly 400,000 migrants have traveled through Panamanian territory. Rafael Bromo, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In fact, officials had actually closed off access to the beach section, hoping to deter any individuals from actually accessing some of the coastline here.In fact, if you look off in the distance, you can see some of those windward waves and what it really looked like on Saturday here as authorities do expect these conditions or at least similar conditions to continue into Sunday, but they certainly are hopeful that they won't be as bad as what we experienced earlier in the weekend.

And it's exciting because like you mentioned, this is leftover material from the formation of the solar system about four and a half billion years ago. And we believe it's asteroids like these, it was bodies like these that came together and formed, particularly the terrestrial planets, of which Earth is one.And so once we get this material in our hands, it'll be like holding the building blocks of the early Earth. And it'll give us an idea about how Earth came to be the way it is. In fact, because of the particular nature of the asteroid we went to, which is a carbonaceous asteroid, it could also give us some insight into the theory that it was bodies like these that seeded the early Earth with organic material from which where -- from which life was eventually created. And so it's a super exciting time for us on the project. And we -- we're really looking forward to getting our -- getting our hands on those samples.",
