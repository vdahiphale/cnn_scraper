And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul`s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Accordingto a recent study, it turns out that the cold air damages the immune response occurring in our noses. When we`re exposed to cold air the temperature in our nose can drop by as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit and that kills nearly percent of the billions of virus and bacteria fighting cells in our nostrils. It`s enough to essentially knock out all of the immune advantages that our nose has to offer. More research is needed to understand how this research could be used to prevent illness in the future.

ESPEN KNUTSEN, SENIOR CURATOR OF PALEONTOLOGY, QUEENSLAND MUSEUM:  So, usually, what we find is that when we`re digging these things out of the ground is that we`ll find bits of the body, no head, and very, very rarely, we`ll find just ahead, but unfortunately with no body attached. So the fact that this guy had both allows us to close that gap where they have this overlap between the body and the head that will unravel a lot of the species diversity, of how many species of these long neck pieces also swimming around here in this outback ocean 100 million years ago.",

Exhibit A, this year, Navy flew over the Army`s campus and dropped a bunch of ping pong balls that said, go Navy, beat Army. But every year, the Navy has to protect their beloved mascots, their goats, because the Army tries to steal them. A while back I got to interview the goats and their protectors. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
