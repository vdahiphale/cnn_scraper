      "sentences": "Well, Christine, we know that tension is certainly rising in the region after North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles earlier today -- its 28th such launch this year. It comes just as South Korea is wrapping up doing military exercises on the east coast of the country, and it also comes just days before the U.S. and South Korea are due to kick off joint Air Force military drills -- that to begin on Monday, October 31.This is what he heard from the South Korean joint chiefs of staff earlier today. They said that North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles around noon local time. They covered a distance of about 230 kilometers. The South Korean military has been on alert as is the U.S. military. We do have a statement for you -- let's bring it up -- from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command saying this. Quote, \"While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory, or to our allies, the missile launches highlight the destabilizing impact of the DPRK's unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs. The U.S. commitments to the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan remain ironclad.\" North Korea has been carrying out a flurry of missile tests this year. It was just last month when North Korea fired a missile over Japan -- the first such test since 2017. And this year, North Korea has fired the highest number of missiles since 2011. That was the year when Kim Jung Un took power. We also know that tensions have been rising between the North and the South earlier this week. Both these countries were exchanging warning shots at sea. And as you mentioned at the top of this live broadcast or at this live hit, we know that concerns are rising about a potential nuclear test. If that happens, the first such nuclear test since 2017. And we also heard from the U.S., along with its allies in the region (Japan and South Korea ), if that was to take place, they have already agreed to a response that is, quote, \"unparalleled.\" Back to you, Christine.",

It's facing a shift back to in-person shopping and surging inflation and recession fears slowing demand. Looking at markets around the world right now, you can see Asian shares all closed lower. Europe has opened down, so a grim mood around the world. Stock index futures on Wall Street also pointing to a lower open this morning. The Dow ended the day higher after a stronger-than-expected GDP report in the U.S., but the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq fell. Really, a tech wreck on Wall Street yesterday. Widely-held Amazon tanked, of course, and shares of Meta crashed to their lowest level since February 2016, wiping out years of gains.
