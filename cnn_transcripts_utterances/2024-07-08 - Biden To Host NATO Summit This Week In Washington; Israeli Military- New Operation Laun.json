But how can they up that support in a way that Ukraine actually feels is effective, goes far enough to continue defending against Russia?Then over the course of the next few days, there are meetings with all these world leaders here in Washington. President Biden and the First Lady are going to be hosting a dinner for all of the world leaders. That will be a critical moment to watch as well. And one of the things that we have talked to diplomats, they're going to be watching for is not only the substance and how these conversations evolve. What kind of product the actual NATO Alliance is able to come to in their final communique but also, how President Biden is performing, what he looks like, what he sounds like, and what his conversations behind the scenes look like because they all saw that disastrous debate performance just a few weeks ago, and it was concerning to many of them. I spoke with diplomats who saw aspects of President Biden's age declining when they were at the G7 in Italy. That was just last month. So, they're going to be watching his performance very closely over the next few days. And of course, there are questions in terms of additional substance too on the NATO alliance, what the joint communique will say about countering China, and the like. So, we'll be watching for both of those things. The substance and the performance this week, Wolf.",

They're going to talk about it in the margins. But a lot of what we see at a summit like this was pre-planned weeks ago, months ago, some incremental steps to increase support for Ukraine, bringing the Ramstein process under a NATO flag, helping Ukraine with long-term defense reform and defense industrial production, but commitment to winning the war and what's the future of U.S. leadership.

In fact, come back saying that the talks are essentially falling apart.So, Burns going out there is a promising sign. He's going first to Cairo. We believe that that's for bilateral meetings with the Egyptians who have an important relationship with Hamas. And then he'll go on to the Qatari capital of Doha, where he'll meet with fellow mediators from Egypt -- from Qatar. And the head of Israeli intelligence, David Barnea. Wolf, the U.S. is saying that this is not something that's going to happen imminently. Israeli sources are telling CNN that this could happen. It would be about two to three weeks away. There are still clearly many points that need to be hammered out between the two sides. How many Palestinian hostages -- prisoners would be released in exchange for the Israeli hostages? Who those would be? And then there's this major question about whether this will lead to a permanent ceasefire. That is something that Hamas has insisted upon for many months. Now, we believe that there are pulling back from that demand that a temporary ceasefire would lead to a permanent ceasefire. So, what we could see is this temporary ceasefire go into effect. What we do know from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is he continues to insist that even if there is a temporary ceasefire, that the IDF would then retain the ability and the right to continue going after Hamas.

These came the combination of cruise missiles and these hypersonic missiles or super-fast missiles -- ballistic missiles as well came around 10:00 a.m. in the morning Ukraine time when people officials say would have been on their way to work. So, it does appear by the nature of the targets the fact that a children's hospital was hit, now the Russians have pushed back and said that this was -- that the hospital was hit by falling debris there from a missile intercept. We've had independent military analysts -- CNN has had independent military analysts who've looked at the damage at the hospital that you're seeing there and other people picking through the rubble. Hundreds of people stopped what they were doing to try to -- try to get people out from under the rubble, particularly the children in the hospital.
