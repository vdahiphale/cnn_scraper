But it also puts some daylight between the Israeli public position and the public position of U.S. leaders, including President Biden, who has stated his opposition publicly to a reoccupation of Gaza. Now Netanyahu did not say reoccupy; he said security, manage the security. It does not necessarily mean then that they would then control the politics or re-enter as they were present, pre-2005, when Israel left. But to manage the security controls Gaza and he did not set a timeframe for that. Is it weeks, is it months, is it potentially years? So that signals ongoing Israeli involvement in Gaza for some time, with the unanswered question, as for how long. But beyond the daylight on that issue, with its closest ally, the U.S., there is daylight on other issues. The U.S. has been pushing for a humanitarian pause for some time. Netanyahu said, in the same interview, that he would be open to shorter term pauses but nothing quite like the cease-fire that many Arab leaders have been calling for. And his standard for doing so is also higher than we've heard from, whether it be U.S. leaders, Blinken when he was out here, or Arab leaders as well because Netanyahu is saying he needs to see the release of all hostages. That may not be realistic in the near term. The negotiations over the weekend focused on releasing women and children first. Of course, everyone involved wants all of the hostages released as quickly as possible. But if that is the standard and they don't appear to be close to that standard, then, of course, it sets up more daylight and perhaps between Israel and the U.S. but also perhaps a greater delay between seeing any sort of sustained pause or cease-fire that many leaders in the region are seeking now.",

We know that, overnight there was fighting in Gaza City, right outside of Al-Quds Hospital and that clearly, Israeli forces are advancing inside of Gaza City from several directions. That, is of course, very significant because we know that the deeper Israeli forces get into Gaza City, the more dense the combat becomes and the more Hamas fighters are fighting from very established, very reinforced offensive positions and also, of course, taking advantage of their expensive tunnel system below Gaza. Even as that fighting is very much ongoing, we are also witnessing a lot of fighting behind, me in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. Israeli forces there capturing a Hamas compound in northern Gaza, according to the IDF, and also destroying several tunnels in northern Gaza. And, yet despite all of that military activity from the Israeli forces, despite the fact that they are fighting in the heart of Gaza City, according to Israeli generals, we also just witnessed moments ago a barrage of rockets emerging from the Gaza Strip. Heading toward Israeli towns and cities, so even as Hamas finds itself under siege by Israeli forces, they are still managing to fire off those rockets, effectively to try and show that they are still there, that they are still capable of hitting Israeli cities. Now amid all of, this we are also watching an increasingly large number of civilians moving from northern Gaza to southern Gaza, facilitating, the Israeli military says, by these corridors, that they are trying to establish along Salah a-Din street, one of the main arteries that runs north to south in the Gaza Strip. Yesterday, the United Nations says that about 5,000 civilians took advantage of that four-hour window that Israeli forces told civilians to leave from. We saw a video from today, as well, showing Palestinian civilians with their hands up, carrying white flags, as they also walked on foot, moving north to south. All of this developing, of course, as we expect that Israeli offensive in Gaza City to grow more intense in the coming days.",

Right now, more than 60 percent of Gaza's hospitals and medical centers are out of service, according to the Hamas- controlled ministry of health in Gaza. The organization cites fuel and medical supply shortages, as well as damage from Israeli bombardments. Adding to the hardship, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency says that 70 percent of people in Gaza are now displaced, with many living in, quote, \"inhumane conditions\" at U.N. shelters. Decomposing bodies under collapsed buildings amid limited rescue efforts have also raised concerns about disease. And now, one month into the war, the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 10,000, according to the Palestinian ministry of health in Ramallah. A short time ago, I spoke to Dr. Medhat Abbas, the director general of the Hamas-controlled ministry of health in Gaza, about the report that 60 percent of medical facilities are no longer functioning. Under circumstances inside the remaining hospitals, I want you to take a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. MEDHAT ABBAS, DIRECTOR GENERAL, GAZAN HEALTH MINISTRY:  Well, the problem is that, those hospitals without fuel, they have closed. And some of them were partially attacked. And some of them were totally annihilated, like the eye centers in Gaza City. So the patients was supposed to go, to be treated within those hospitals, are shifted to some other hospitals. The other hospitals are already overcrowded because of the mass casualties, what is arriving along the hour. Due to the excessive bombardment along the hour in the Gaza Strip for this month. For 50 days, day and night, continuous, ongoing, chilling and bombardment from the sky, from the, sea from the eastern side of the Gaza Strip. So with large numbers coming to the hospitals, in fact, the operating hospitals, the remaining hospitals still operating now are overcrowded. And you can find the injured lying on the ground anywhere, in the emergency room, in front of the operation room. And many of them were operated upon in the corridors without even anesthesia. Some amputations were performed and that was admitted by the WHO, by the way. They were operated upon without anesthesia. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Since the initial deal to allow anyone out at all was struck, to get foreign passport holders out, Eleni, but also the most wounded Palestinians. Now their insistence over the weekend was that the ambulances should get safe passage after the bombing of the Al-Shifa Hospital on Friday, that led to the border being closed entirely for nearly 48 hours. It's now, of course, been reopened. And what we've seen when it's open, are different kinds of (INAUDIBLE) problems. There are the political issues we're getting open and, once it is open, there are the logistical issues involved, Eleni, in getting all of these people out, out of a situation that is desperate inside, very chaotic, a system that is fairly opaque in terms of how the lists are drawn up. We know that every day, a list is put up with several hundred names on it, of who will be allowed to get out on that particular day. Anyone who is on the list needs to know (INAUDIBLE) bear in mind that we've had now three total blackouts where there were no communications at all. And even when the communications are up and running, it is pretty patchy and difficult for people who are anywhere in the Gaza Strip to find out that their name is on it. Once they get, there and through the many crowds of thousands that have been camped out there for days in hopes of getting out, many of them -- and we've heard so many stories of this -- will find that their names but not the names of their loved ones or their family members are on there as well. So they decide to stay behind. It is 7,000 foreign nationals that are expected to be brought out as a result of these negotiations.
