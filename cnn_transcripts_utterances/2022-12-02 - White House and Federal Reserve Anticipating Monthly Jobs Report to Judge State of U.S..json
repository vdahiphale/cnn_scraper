President Joe Biden has enjoyed a string of economic reports over the past week that seems to suggest that inflation could be cooling off. M.J. Lee live for CNN this morning at the White House. Good morning to you, M.J. What is the White House hoping to see in these November jobs numbers, reports coming out later this hour?M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Don. Yes, you're absolutely right that moderation really is the key word today. White House officials are hoping to see somewhere in the ballpark of around 200,000 new jobs created last month, and that would further convince the White House that the economy is making the transition that it wants to see after a week of some positive economic data from their perspective. For example, there was this key measure of consumer prices that slowed a little bit in October, and then quarter three GDP growth was revised up which really shows overall resilience in the economy. Of course, we had the Fed chair also suggesting that interest rate hikes could get less aggressive as early as this month. And then of course the big one, it's gas prices that are continuing to fall. That's been great news for the White House. So the White House is cognizant that things can always take a turn, but in the big picture they do feel like things are starting to move in the right direction.",

One opportunity, I think, is having a Democratic senator who is a reverend from Ebony Vale Baptist Church. And what's fascinating is some of the folks you talk to, and some of the folks I've been talking to in Georgia. The rationalizations that are being used by evangelicals, largely white evangelicals, to support Walker over an actual reverend. And it's really interesting. Now, not all are going to have an easy time about it. You saw it from Georgia exit polls from CNN, though. A third of the Georgia voters and the Midterms were evangelical, 88 percent went for Walker. That's despite the record of domestic abuse allegations of playing for abortions, mental illness, et cetera.So, I've spoken to a bunch of folks coming -- trying to understand this, and it's -- for someone it comes just down to the raw politic of it. You know, we want to Republican in the seat. But it's interesting that Warnock's deep, professional familiarity with faith is not swaying them. It may be enough to make the difference, you know, in this kind of a race, because whether it's Kemp Warnock voters you were talking to, but I had folks say, look, even -- people who were active in the pro-life movement down in Georgia, Christian -- committed Christian conservative say, well, you know, I don't know if we should believe those women. And if they do, I had one woman tell me, it blew my mind. That, you know, he has so many children out of wedlock, why would he pay for an abortion? I mean, you know, so the ornate rationalizations that people are putting into place to justify the fact that they're not voting necessarily for the reverend. But faith drives their politics. Ultimately, we got to take faith back from the partisan divisions in our politics, history shows that's a dangerous line. And so, I think there's an opportunity here, and we'll see how the results come down.",
