Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. The Ukrainian port city of Odessa has faced its third consecutive night of Russian strikes. This bombardment of Odessa comes after Russia left the Black Sea Grain Deal that allowed Ukraine to export food stocks amid the war. Top E.U. official Josep Borrell is accusing Moscow of causing a global food crisis and deliberately attacking grain storage facilities in Odessa. These kinds of attacks punctuate live from for my first guest, the journalist and activist Daria Kaleniuk, the head of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre in Kyiv. She's been holding her government and others to account during the war. Just listen to her questioning of U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan when she pressed him on NATO membership for Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DARIA KALENIUK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ANTI-CORRUPTION ACTION CENTRE:  Jake, please advise me, what should I tell my son that President Biden and NATO didn't invite Ukraine to NATO because he's afraid of Russia, afraid of Russia losing, afraid of Ukraine winning or the (INAUDIBLE) channel communications with Kremlin, which terrorist organization, to reach the main (ph) three deal? Should I prepare my son to be a soldier and fight Russians when he will be 18 years in seven years? Thank you, Jake. JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  So, first of all, thank you for the work that you do every day to try to advance Ukraine's democracy, deepen it, to try to deal with the challenge of corruption which continues to exist and I know that you have been a big champion for that. And what I would say to your son and to everyone in Ukraine is, you know, the rest of the world is in awe the bravery and courage of every Ukrainian citizen who is standing up in the face of Russia's brutal war, it's brutal aggression. So, I think the most important thing in this respect is for us to be able to have the kind of honesty that was inherent in your question, but also for us to make sure that in having that honesty certain insinuations or implications inherent in your question, which are not founded get checked at the door so that we can talk to one another in goodwill, in good faith. And, you know, there has been a lot of conspiracy theorizing that simply is not based on any reality whatsoever. And also, I would just say, the American people have sought in watching and wanting to stand in solidarity with the brave and courageous people of Ukraine to step up and delivery, and I think the American people do deserve a degree of gratitude.

Now, we are talking about NATO. And every time we're starting to talk about specific weapons or specific decisions of various administrations across the world, particularly in the U.S., especially in the U.S., first, there is no, then there is hesitation and then there is the final decision, which is actually broadly support by the American people. However, this delays with the final decisions of supporting commitment for Ukrainian victory means that somebody will lose his or her life. It means that more and more Ukrainian kids will be sleeping in corridors like my sons are doing. It means that more and more people in the world will be struggling because of the hunger, as Russia just blocked Ukrainian Black Sea ports militarily and is not allowing our farmers to trade with the world with our grain and to feed the people across the globe. So, therefore, I'm frustrated with this hesitation, with this non- escalatory approach, non-provocative approach. And I believe that if you show weakness to Russia, it is provocative. If you show hesitation, it is provocative. This is the way how Russia behaves and we'll learn for decades exactly that.",

Especially, we are in huge gratitude to American people because Americans are providing the largest part of the support. But still, you know, we feel that American people would support more firm and decisive support for Ukrainian people. And particularly, I can't understand why there is such a delay sending fighter jets to Ukraine as it could stop suffering for many Ukrainians and would to unblock the Black Sea Ports, and we are talking about fighter jets for more than a year and still, there is hesitancy from the administration. And as for the gratitude and expressing the gratitude, I differentiate people of various nations and their administrations. So, we are very thankful to the people of the United States and people of the U.K., but we think that administration, particularly in the U.S., could be much more decisive. And one of the reasons why is because Ukraine simply decided to give up our nuclear weapons, which we had, and it was the second largest nuclear arsenal in the world in 1994 in exchange for security assurances from this particular two nations, from the U.S. and from the U.K., and by the way, from Russia. So, Russia invaded us with a genocidal war. Every night they are terrorizing all our civilians and killing somebody. They kidnapped hundreds, thousands of our kids. I can't understand what they are doing with our kids, whether they are alive or not. And U.S. and U.K. are expected gratitude from Ukraine. We are extremely grateful. However, we try to explain to the world and particularly to the leaders of the free world that while we are -- while you are hesitating, we are dying. So, what is left for us? Simply to be patience, strategically patient and to die? That's the open question.",

When I asked this question, it was not unnoticed among Ukrainian audience and I received so many feedbackfrom people whom I know and from people whom I don't know that, thank you for asking this. That it is in the minds of millions of Ukrainians. And particularly, it is in the minds of the parents, of Ukrainian parents who have to grow kids in the situation of the constant air raids, of the constant attacks and the constant terror coming from Russia. But important thing which I want to mention is that I don't feel that we walked away from NATO summit with security guarantees. The only security guarantee, which is real guarantee, which matters something is invitation to NATO and the clear path with clear deadlines for Ukraine NATO membership. We already had security assurances. We thought these were security guarantees, but then, everybody told us, well, the U.S. and U.K. told us that in exchange for us giving up nuclear weapons that there were no guarantees. We are not obliged to do anything. It's just assurances, just a piece of paper. So, guys, survive. We will send you some weapons. And now, we've got commitments from various nations, and we are thankful for that commitment to keep supporting Ukraine with weapons. And -- but, you know, the decision how much weapons to send, what quality of weapons to send directly depends on the strategy of the NATO and particularly of the most powerful members of NATO, like the U.S. What is the endgame?",

And I don't understand and many people in Ukraine, they don't understand what is the end game coded in the words, which is like we are ready to support Ukraine as long as it takes? So, whenever I am hearing this message, I'm asking myself, what does as long as it take mean? Does that mean as long as it takes all of our soldiers to die? Does that mean as long as it takes all of our critical infrastructure to be destroyed, or as long as it takes Russia to blow up Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which they are occupying and which they simply mined and they can blow it any moment like they've done with Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant? So, we would want to expect from the leadership from the U. S. and also from NATO leadership, NATO members leadership, clarity. What are their endgame strategy? And the reason I've asked, you know, that we feel that there is smell of some back channel communications with Russia, there is hope within administration in the U.S. and probably some other nations, particularly in Germany, that Ukraine and Russia will reach certain level of the ceasefire. And we don't believe in any ceasefire with Russia, under Russian terms. We in Ukraine, and sociology supports, it's absolutely majority of Ukrainians, we believe in the full reoccupation of all our territories and return of our people and Russian troops must leave Ukrainian territory.",

So, if corruption is a problem for not inviting Ukraine to NATO, please specify what thehomework we need to do, and we will get it done. So, my particular opinion is that the reason, the only main reason for not inviting Ukraine to NATO is Russia. Corruption is a very, you know, good face-saving excuse. It is not taking into account that there is still corruption in Ukraine, and still, we have to do a lot, particularly in the security and the (INAUDIBLE) sector. But what we were arguing and we were trying to encourage leaders of the free world to do is to invite Ukraine to NATO, it doesn't mean that immediately Ukraine will be a member of NATO. And then, how the joint work with Ukrainian civil society, with the Ukrainian reformers, with Ukrainian government on the least of the reforms, like the E.U. did for Ukraine, they gave us the list of seven reforms, including five anti-corruption reforms, and we will fulfill this list until the summit in Washington. So, I would have expected Jake Sullivan and NATO leaders to present this kind of list of reforms for our homework. My personal opinion that, well, built successfully anti-corruption infrastructure in Ukraine. We have separate anti-corruption agencies, which are now throwing into jail judges for corruption.

Christine, I hope I didn't just jinx Team USA with that wish for a hat- trick, but, you know, I'm not the only one that is really hoping that that's what we see. This is the ninth Women's World Cup.

The nation fell in love what it created with Title IX, of course, the team won. Brandi Chastain is amazing, an infamous iconic penalty kick to win it, ripping off her shirt. The team, Mia Hamm, et cetera, all of them becoming household names. That really was the start of what we are seeing today, which is Australia and New Zealand using their big stadiums. Those stadiums are full. Women are taking over the headlines. Female athletes getting the respect that they -- that is deserved for them. Now, you are right, the pay is nowhere near. It's about one-fourth of what the men got in Qatar, just a few months ago, but it is so much better than it was.

And so, I think the U.S. can do it, but it's not going to be easy. And those European countries, where the men's pro leagues have women's teams now. So, they are investing big-time in the pro league for women in Europe, England, Germany, Sweden.

But if we look at the consumption numbers, 8.2 percent woe (ph) suggests an economy is slowly recovering from the structural -- sorry, from the kind of lingering pains of the pandemic.

They're having a high cost of capital, 6 to 10 percent, and it doesn't transmit because it's all stuck in the banking system. So, I think that's kind of currently why the stimulus are not as effective, and also, they don't have an appetite for a huge stimulus, again, because they want to gear towards longer-term goals. But the unemployment problem is fundamentally because that the education has raced ahead of the economy. It's not like there are no jobs around, 25 million manufacturing jobs around a gap by 2025 300,000 talent gap in semiconductors, et cetera.

And so, they used the fact that he had given money to the communist party, although he had never joined it himself, to bring him down in 1954. But their real concern was not that he was a security risk or even a spy, there is no real evidence of that, but their real concern was that here, the father of the atomic bomb, beginning in 1945, just months after Hiroshima, had begun speaking out against reliance on these weapons. And specifically, after 1949 when the Russians acquired an atomic bomb, he spoke out against the development of the hydrogen bomb, the super bomb. And this was a threat to the budgets of the Defense Department, the budget of the air force and the navy who wanted to spend more money on these weapons. So, the father of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer, was becoming a threat to their budgets, and this was the real motivation to bring him down, his policy differences with the national security establishment.",

And he was very ambivalent. On the one hand, he was extremely aware of the tragic human consequences this was going to be used on whole city in which most of the victims are going to be civilians. And yet, he was convinced of Niels Bohr's argument. When he arrived in Los Alamos on the last day of 1943, Niels Bohr, the great Danish physicist said, Robert, I have one question for you. Is it big enough? Is the bomb big enough so that humanity will understand that it can no longer fight wars? Will it end all wars? And Oppenheimer convinced himself that, you know, the weapon had to be demonstrated in this war, on a target, so that people would understand its horrible destructiveness. And therefore, the next war would not be fought with -- by two adversaries, both of whom would be armed with nuclear weapons, and that would, of course, be Armageddon.

So, maybe Niels Bohr and Oppenheimer were right. On the other hand, in the course of human history, it seems the odds are that these weapons will be used again unless we do it Oppenheimer suggested, which was to essentially ban them and create an international atomic authority that would have the ability to monitor and inspect every laboratory, every factory everywhere in the world to make sure that no one is building these weapons. You know, he was trying to make the argument that we need to control this technology. So, coming back again to artificial intelligence, I think if he was with us today, he would be making the same argument, that we need to understand the consequences, socially, for society of artificial intelligence and regulate it. And he would be making the same argument today, he'd be appalled that we had an arms race. He'd be appalled that Mr. Putin is threatening tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and he'd be very fearful, as I am today, that someday we might actually see another nuclear war fought. Maybe not between Russia and America, but between Pakistan and India. You know, they're both nations who are enemies and they're both armed with nuclear weapons. So, I don't know.
