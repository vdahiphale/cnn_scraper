A big day, all eyes will be on the show and how she fares against Former President Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. It is at 9 am there and we're following that story very closely and it is 6 pm here in Abu Dhabi, I'm Eleni Giokos, this is \"Connect the World\". Also happening over the next two hours, Israel's military suffers its biggest single loss of life since the start of the war with Hamas, as the death toll among Palestinians in Gaza passes 25,000 and the worsening humanitarian crisis will be speaking with the U.N. Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories. And Russia has launched a wave of aerial attacks on cities across Ukraine. Welcome to the show, and Israel's military is calling it the biggest loss of life since the start of the war with Hamas. The IDF says 21 soldiers were killed in Central Gaza Monday, when a pair of two storey buildings exploded and collapsed. Now it happened very close to the Israel-Gaza border just 600 meters from an Israeli kibbutz. A spokesperson says its likely explosives. The soldiers were lying to demolish the buildings went off after a tank protecting the soldiers was hit by a rocket propelled grenade. Now that news coming as the IDF says Khan Yunis in Southern Gaza is now surrounded by Israeli troops. We've got all those lines for you with Jeremy Diamond who is in Tel Aviv. He's got more on both of those stories. Look, we know that Benjamin Netanyahu is calling the death of those 21 soldiers one of the most difficult days since the start of the conflict. What more do we know?",

And so that is having enormous reverberations here in Israel is such a small country, where nearly everyone has a relative or a friend who is currently serving in the Israeli military. What we understand from this single incident in which 21 soldiers were killed, they were about 600 meters away from Israel inside central Gaza, where they were working to create what the Israeli military is calling a buffer zone, demolishing buildings clearing Hamas infrastructure to try and make it safer for Israeli civilians living in Israel near the border with Gaza, to make it safer for them to return to their homes. And what we understand is around 4 pm, yesterday, an RPG was fired towards a tank in that area. And at the same time, there was an explosion in two storey buildings where those soldiers were operating. We understand that two soldiers were killed inside that tank 19 of them killed inside those two buildings. It's not clear exactly whether that RPG caused those explosions in that building. But it is something that the Israeli military is currently investigating. Now, even as this incident happens, the Israeli military is also undergoing a major offensive right now, in the Southern City of Khan Yunis in Gaza, where the Israeli military says that it is working to dismantle Hamas's Khan Yunis brigade, one of the most significant brigades that Hamas operates in Southern Gaza. They say they've been circled this refugee camp. They say they've killed dozens of militants over the past 24 hours. But we do know that there is very intense fighting in Khan Yunis between the Israeli military and those Hamas militants, which is really worsening the humanitarian situation in that area where there are not only several hospitals. But also the headquarters of the Palestine Red Crescent Society and thousands of displaced Palestinians who have sought shelter at the Al Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. The Israeli military has ordered that hospitals evacuation but a doctor at the hospital telling CNN that, that is very difficult at the moment because of the heavy fighting and because so many of the roads around that hospital are now blocked, Eleni.",

I think this is only the 15th trading session that's just begun here. And we've already had multiple record highs for various indices. Looking a little bit more mixed today. And as you say, I think this is going to be more earnings driven for this week at least because we're not getting a Fed meeting this week. We're not getting any U.S. jobs data. Netflix, you mentioned also Tesla, Intel quite a big tech focus for the week. It has been a very different start of the year though for Chinese equities, what a pivot? Now year-to-date, the SHANGHAI COMPOSITE is down now about 6.5 percent. And this is really just following on from what has been a very disappointing few years. I think in the last three years $6 trillion has been wiped off Chinese and Hong Kong equities. But if we can show you some of these indices and how they're performing today, you're going to see a slightly different story led by the HANG SENG up 2.6 percent. And this is very much on the back of a report from Bloomberg suggesting that some sort of rescue package is being discussed, at least by Beijing that will try and help bolster confidence in the Chinese stock market to try and bring prices back up. Now the biggest part of this includes apparently a 2 trillion Yuan fund that's around $278 billion. This would be the offshore accounts being put together into a fund from Chinese state owned companies using that to buy into stocks onshore in China by the Hong Kong stock exchange, which I think is why we're seeing the HANG SENG there leading those games. Now will that be enough? It's interesting. There are so many different elements to the China story at the moment, whether or not as the ongoing restructuring of the real estate market? Whether it's debt levels? Whether it's looking at the risk of deflation? The declining birth rates and what that means for us of shrinking workforce, plenty of issues there. But also the fact that policies recently have been so ideologically driven in Beijing and that's very much scaring off foreign investors. So I'd say this is clearly having some moves in the markets right now, whether or not that sustained and really turns the story around for Chinese equities. Will depend I think, Eleni on whether this is piecemeal or whether this is the beginning of something a bit more consistent.",

To freeze out Greta Gerwig from the best director nomination, I think is honestly blasphemous. But this goes to my whole thought on the Oscars where you are rating art. How can you say that Greta Gerwig accomplishment doesn't stack up to Christopher Nolan's in \"Oppenheimer\" or Martin Scorsese in \"Killers of the Flower Moon\"? But since we rate art because that's what we do. We give out awards for performances. I think what we're really looking at these Oscars is hopefully an ushering in big names with big performances right. So the usual suspects are there, I mentioned Christopher Nolan for \"Oppenheimer\". In that movie, you've got Cillian Murphy. For Best Actor, you've got Robert Downey Jr. for Best Supporting Actor. \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" directed by Martin Scorsese has Robert De Niro in the Best Supporting Actor category. But really what is going to be fascinating, I think is the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, because Lily Gladstone has the opportunity to be the first Native American actress to win an Oscar. She's the first Native American actress to be nominated for an award. She's been nominated for \"Killers of the Flower Moon\". I think since she won from the Golden Globe, she's got a really great chance to make it a clean sweep at the Oscars, but she's going up against Carey Mulligan, who was an Oscar favorites. She's going up against Annette Bening, whose Hollywood royalty. So snubs aside, the Oscars should be interesting to see if some big names and some first timers get their love.",

You know, you've got Paul Giamatti, Cillian Murphy, that's stacked but his performance is fantastic. In Best Supporting Actor just the names alone, Ryan Gosling, Sterling K. Brown, Robert De Niro, Mark Ruffalo, like these categories are stacked with names we know, even though the movies weren't necessarily watched as heavy as \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\".
