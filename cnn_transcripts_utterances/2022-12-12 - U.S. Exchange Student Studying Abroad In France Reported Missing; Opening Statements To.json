Three defendants are accused of actually going inside. Another defendant is accused of putting together a quick reaction force. We've talked about this a lot on CNN, and the accusation here is that one of these defendants, again, put together this group with the intention that these people would go into D.C. once this -- once basically the chaos broke out, once the overturning of the election broke out, and that plan included bringing weapons to a suburb just outside Washington, D.C. So, that's the way that the DOJ is laying out this case. They're having to make some adjustments here because they fell flat on 3 out of 5 attempts to try to convict on seditious conspiracy. So, those alterations certainly on full display today. The DOJ, again, making this case that the plan was to use brute force to try to overturn the election. Here's just one quote from some of these opening statements by the Department of Justice. In the defendant's words, they were at war. These defendants agreed to and joined together to stop the transfer of power, and they were ready to do it by force and on January 6, 2021, they did -- Victor and Bianna.",

They have not put out information about the second ISIS official they killed.They do say according to an initial assessment there were no civilian casualties as part of this helicopter raid. We have seen the U.S. putting emphasis on the coalition and the campaign to defeat ISIS, even as there's been some tension with Turkey over Turkish operations in northern Syria. So, in that area, the de-ISIS campaign is still a priority for the U.S. They're working with their local Kurdish partners and the SDF -- the Syrian Democratic Forces -- and trying to stay focused on this campaign as they move forward. We've seen a number of raids over the past few months. Notably the raid in February in western Syria that kill the ISIS leader Haji Abdullah. So, the U.S. remains focused on this campaign and says ISIS still has the power, even in its degraded form to destabilize the region.",

So, what are we talking about here when we talk about nuclear fusion.It is two hydrogen atoms that are being fired upon by 192 lasers at this department of energy lab in California. They are firing on these two particles, hydrogen atom particles, a quintillionth of a second, once every quintillionth of a second. And the force of the laser -- which you're looking at there -- and the heat that it generates, that is what creates this energy. And the reason why this is such a big deal is because we're talking about hydrogen atoms that at the core of creating this energy. That comes from water. You know, we have hydrogen abundantly throughout the universe so we are talking about creating an energy source that has zero carbon footprint. It is clean. And essentially unlimited. I spoke with several scientists today who say, you know, this is a big deal because this is the birth of a new species. A new kind of energy source is being brought into existence. And this is so significant because as we've been talking about this climate crisis and the need to pivot away from those dirty energy sources, this would give us a source to lean upon. But to give you the big picture here, the context of how soon could we see something like this powering our homes, et cetera. It's, we're still a ways away. As one scientist put it, we have the embryo now but it's like asking when will that embryo graduate from Harvard. There's still clearly a lot of work that needs to be done within the scientific community to figure out how to harvest this energy and get it to the power grid. But still, this is a very critical step and we can't get to wide scale use unless we have this step that we're seeing here today.",

So, there is a movie that everybody is talking about called \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" and it stars Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and it is supposedly the movie to see. Leading the way with eight nominations.But I do want to talk about two huge blockbusters that are nominated. \"Avatar\" -- which comes out this weekend, I'm seeing it Thursday night. I think it's like three hours. Then you have \"Top Gun: Maverick.\" Which I remember telling you guys telling you that that was one of the best movies I had seen last year. But why is that significant? Because usually you see that it's more Indy films that are being nominated. It's not the big blockbusters that everybody's talking about. And that's been a criticism of awards shows, especially the Oscars in the past that, well, I want don't to watch the Oscars or I don't want to watch the Golden Globes because these aren't movies that I've seen or things that I've heard on the street from friends and family members. But maybe this is an effort to drive up viewership because ratings have really been down when it comes to awards shows. Now want to come to TV, I know everybody's talking about \"White Lotus\" -- no spoilers about last night's season finale. But I will say that they were nominated along with \"The Crown,\" Dahmer,\" the Jeffrey Dahmer story -- which also got a lot of criticism.

But could this mean that maybe he won't see any nominations? Or the film which Antoine Fuqua, he worked so hard on that whole team. Is getting rave reviews. I hope it's not that completely overlooked.And then you know, the best original song score. You know, you have Rihanna, you have Gaga. So, you know, I think the big question is this. Is anybody going to go to the Globes this year? Didn't air last year on NBC because of all of their diversity and ethical issues. So, are people going to go. Are they going to have presenters. I me, Jared Carmichael, who I love, the comedian, he's going to be hosting. I'm going to be sitting down with him in a few weeks. But the big question is, are people going to tune in?
