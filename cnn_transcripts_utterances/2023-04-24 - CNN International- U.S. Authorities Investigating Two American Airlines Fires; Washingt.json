Maswadeh landed an internship with the Israeli public broadcaster, Kan Arabic channel. And after it jumped to the network's main Hebrew channel, he became a Jerusalem correspondent where he's covered everything from clashes between police and Palestinians in refugee camps, to Israeli politics. His first major scoop put the spotlight on his constant internal dilemma. How to balance pressure from his community versus the story. In 2020, Maswadeh showed how COVID restrictions were being violated at the al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, one of the holiest sites in Islam. The backlash was swift. MASWADEH: And I remember that my grandfather calling me and telling me that everyone there is, you know, talking to him and telling him that what his grandson did was a shame to the community.
