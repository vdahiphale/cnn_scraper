All right, back from the brink. Today our nation's military service members don't have to worry about missing paychecks. TSA agents, same thing. National parks are open as well. Just a few hours before a midnight deadline to shut down the U.S. government, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill to keep the nation's government open for at least another 45 days. The breakthrough came after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy surprised everyone by pushing a short-term spending bill through the House with Democratic help. It's a deal that may cost McCarthy his speakership. Republican hardliners are now vowing to bring a motion to the floor to oust the leader for ignoring the spending cuts conservatives were demanding in a package. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): I do intend to file a motion to vacate against Speaker McCarthy this week. I think we need to rip off the band-aid. I think we need to move on with new leadership that can be trustworthy. Look, the one thing everybody has in common is that nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy. He lied to Biden, he lied to House conservatives. The only way Kevin McCarthy is speaker of the House at the end of this coming week is if Democrats bail him out. Now they probably will. I actually think that when you believe in nothing, as Kevin McCarthy does, everything is negotiable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He wanted to push us into a shutdown, even threatening his own district with all the military people there who would not be paid only because he wants to take this motion.

But ultimately in the end that was stripped from these proposals that were weighed just yesterday.And the president and House Democratic leadership have said they believe McCarthy will bring up a vote, a separate vote on a Ukraine aid bill at some point soon, though the House speaker has not detailed exactly when that might be. But the president will also have the task of trying to convince allies that aid for Ukraine will be there in the long run, especially as they are about to hit this winter, colder season of fighting in Ukraine, and the president is trying to stress that there will be that aid there, though he is warning that time is running short.",

She says, you know, sometimes the next available appointment is three, four, five months in advance.

GASKILL-HAMES: Yes, it's a great question about our wages. And, you know, I would encourage our employees to get the facts about the deals that are at the table. We have no takeaways. When we look at our current wage position, we are above the market in every single market that we're in. We're talking about eight markets. And in every single market, we're above the market. In Southern California, my market, if we look at that, we are 20 percent above the market right now. And so if our employees were to leave Kaiser Permanente, it would take a 20 percent pay cut when they look at the benefits they would get. We know that we have richer benefits than almost everyone in the market. And the deal at the table, conversation at the table to enrich that, we actually have a four-year deal that would add an increase of 12 percent to 14 percent. And we have richer benefit elements to that as well. So it's a very fair -- it's a very fair stance and it continues to push us as a leader in this space. It's one of the reasons that we've been able to recruit better, we've been able to retain better than others. We've been voted as the best place to work because of the fair wages and the benefits. We have to balance that with being reasonable and being good stewards of our members' dollars, and so we think 12 percent over four years, 12 percent to 14 percent across America is more than fair and it keeps us above the market, keeps us among the best in the industry.",

Ozempic has been called a miracle drug for weight loss by some, and its sales are soaring. Well, now it also has an updated warning label after dozens of reports of intestinal issues. CNN's Jacqueline Howard has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER (on camera): Some people using Ozempic have reported that they're experiencing blockages in their intestines. And now the label on the medication has been updated to acknowledge that. Specifically, this gastrointestinal disorder called ileus, or having blocked intestines, may be related to how semiglutide drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy work. You see, they mimic a hormone that the body naturally makes to slow down the passing of food through your digestive system. So that's what helps make people feel full longer, leading to weight loss. But it also could be related to these reports of having blocked intestines or possibly even stomach paralysis, which also is rare, but has been reported previously in some people using these medications. Now, the company Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Ozempic and Wegovy, told CNN in a statement that it's working closely with the FDA to continuously monitor the safety profile of its medications, and it, quote, stands behind the safety and efficacy of Ozempic and all of its medicines when used consistent with the product labeling and the approved indications.
