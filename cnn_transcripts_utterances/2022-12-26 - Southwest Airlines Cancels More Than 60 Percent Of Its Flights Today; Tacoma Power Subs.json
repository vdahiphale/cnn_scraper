Thousands of flights have been canceled or delayed across the country today. The hardest hit, Southwest Airlines which has scrapped more than 60 percent of its flights. Take a look here. These are some of the long lines of Southwest passengers in Raleigh, Atlanta and Denver airports. In a statement to CNN, Southwest Airlines said it is \"experiencing disruptions across our network as a result of the winter storm's lingering effects on the totality of our operation.\" CNN is Carlos Suarez is at Atlanta's airport. Carlos, you're on the southwest side of the terminal, what are you seeing? What are you hearing from passengers?",

The airport here in Atlanta has seen well over 200 canceled flights and a majority of those flights have come from Southwest Airlines.The airline has canceled 64 percent of its flights out of Atlanta. This line here behind me are passengers that are on board one of these canceled flights. We're going to take a bit of a walk so you can get a sense of just how long this line is. We're just on the other side of the terminal, where as you can imagine people have been waiting for hours to see if they're going to be able to get booked on another flight. The line, it goes all the way down the Southwest Airlines' terminal. It wraps up to the other side and just about everyone that we've talked to out here has been in this line for anywhere between two to three hours. Now when we're talking about the overall number of canceled flights across the U.S. where you can imagine that number at this hour is in the thousands with thousands more flights being delayed. Now we caught up with one passenger who made this line here for this Southwest Airlines flight. She had some pretty harsh words for that airline and here's what she told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But when they chose to take flights into the middle of the storm or not preemptively cancel enough flights, their systems have not been able to keep up with the rescheduling, the cancellations, the notification to crew members about those cancellations and changes in flights. We've had flight attendants on hold for up to 12, 17 hours in some cases and unable to get hotel rooms. They've been sleeping in airports. And we've also had issues with being booked - rebooking.

They're one of my favorite carriers. They have such great leeway for people that use their tickets. They give you up to 10 minutes before departure to cancel.One of the issues with them though is they are more of a short haul carrier, short and medium range. So that means they have a lot of what we call turnaround times. In other words, on a given day, on average, their jets are making more flights because they're shorter. So those turnaround times really bog things down. You're not making any money. You're not efficient when you're on the ground and that has helped to slow them down, unfortunately, just because of the route structure that they have.",

But again, as more of a short to medium haul carrier, that means there's - they have the shorter flights. It's these turnaround times that are - they're really hurting the airlines and with staffing.Trying to get people to the airport in this storm system that we've had, people calling in sick because they are sick, people are calling in sick, let's be honest, sometimes because it's the holidays and also because of the brutal working conditions. When you're an hourly employee out on that ramp getting maybe $17 an hour, few benefits because a lot of the ramp workers don't work for airlines, they actually work for third party contractors. It's tough in these conditions when it's below zero windshield to be out there swinging bags and that sort of thing. It also slows everything down. So I know they're kind of in the line of fire right now, but they have great customer service. They're trying their best but I think all the carriers will once again be reviewing their battle plans after we get through this holiday season.",

So as they focus on any potential rescues, they're also focusing on keeping the streets clear. However, they're not just doing it across the board. It is a very sort of calculated approach here from city officials. These plow trucks, they're focusing on the streets that lead in and out of some of the medical facilities, for example, some of the main thoroughfares, some of the main arteries as well to allow firefighters and other personnel to actually get to any potential calls. But as you're about to hear from one of the officials that we've heard from here recently, basically stressing that point that that driving ban, it's still in place, unless it's an emergency or essential, there should be no cars on these streets.

All three happened in the middle of the night on Christmas Day causing power outages. Nothing was stolen from either or any of those facilities. So there's a good possibility they are related.
