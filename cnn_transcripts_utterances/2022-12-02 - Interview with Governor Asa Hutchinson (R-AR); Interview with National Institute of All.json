Welcome to the program, everyone, I'm Sara Sidner in New York. Sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. The Republican party is laser focused on Georgia's Senate election next week. Early voting in the rematch ends today. And the latest CNN polls show a slim lead for democrat Raphael Warnock over Republican Herschel Walker. Either way, the Democrats will hold the Senate in the next Congress after an expected red wave at the midterms turned out to be more of a light splash. Even though the GOP did take the House, the repercussions of that vote is spelling trouble for Kevin McCarthy as fringe members of his party pushed back against his candidacy for House Speaker. Adding to this drama, former Donald Trump's legal woes continue to mount as he campaigns to lead the party into the 2024 election. A federal appeals cult -- court halting a third-party review of documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate. So, where does the grand old party go from here? And what does that mean for America as a whole? What is happening in each state may reveal some of those answers. Republicans have maintained a strong grip on State houses nationwide, and my next guest leads with one of them. Asa Hutchinson has been Arkansas governor since 2015. He is now leaving his post after the maximum two-year terms in the job. Welcome to the program. GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR): Thank you, Sara. Good to be with you.",

Our -- we're going to have a Republican governor succeed me. And so, if you look at it state-by-state and the last midterm elections did not reject Republican ideas. They just rejected certain candidates. And the fact that we did win the House, we won all -- the incumbent Republic governors won. And so, it was -- you look forward to 2024 and we have to be able to provide good leadership based upon Republican principles. And Donald Trump has announced, he is the only one to announce, and I fully expect that there is going to be multiple options that we are going to offer the voters then that's what I've got to focus on and think about over the holidays.

And I think we are tired of the chaos. We are tired of fighting about the last election. We want to move forward and problem solve it, that's what governors do. And that's what conservatives do. And when you talk about the cultural issues, we're all concerned about our culture. And it's worth fighting for, but how do you do that? And you do that through your individual life, through your community, through your schools, through choice and education. And so, it's how you deal with the challenges that we face as a country.

And so, this is not good. And we want to repudiate that kind of attitude, that kind of talk and not to empower it by meeting with somebody. That's the main point. In the 1980s I put on a flak jacket, I helped negotiate the surrender of white supremacists that fought law enforcement, that murdered people, and we put them in jail. And that's important that we take a stand and say, we are a people of equal opportunity. Where everybody is at the table and not be a message of empowering those that engage in hate.

We had HIV that came upon us in 1981, at least recognized in 1981. And then we had pandemic flu, and Ebola, and zika.

Which means that our human species has a great degree of variability, probably largely geneticallyprogrammed of the ability or not to respond to different types of infections. The strength of your immune system, the durability of an immune response, it is like a big bell-shaped curve. I mean, there are some people who never gets sick, and just never -- their immune system or their natural innate immunity is so strong. Then there are some people who are very susceptible, and get seriously ill. And then the big hump of the bell-shaped curve is the people in the middle who do reasonably well, occasionally get sick for these things, but it doesn't become a very severe issue.",

With COVID, it's not that way. 50 to 60 percent of all of the transmissions occur from someone who has no symptoms at all.

One, I think, is the dominant one because even people who got the original vaccine to begin with are slow to get the boost. I think it has to do with COVID fatigue, Walter. I think people want so badly to put this behind us that they don't want to hear any more about COVID. I got vaccinated, I got boosted, I don't want to be bothered. That's a mistake. Because these updated vaccines do a really good job in being matched to what we're seeing outside in the environment. And even with the new variants, there are going to be enough cross reactivity. Some of it has to do with ideological differences. You know that if you look at the vaccine uptake in red states versus blue states, it's very, very different with much less vaccine uptake in red states.

She included pecans, which were actually a luxury item in South Carolina in the 1850s. Because pecans were not native to the southeast. They were native to places like Texas. And pecans were, not only very nutritious, but also sought after. So, Ashley could've used the pecans for food or to trade them for other items. Rose included a braid of her own hair which was incredibly meaningful in so many ways. The braid was an actual piece of the mother's body, so that Ashley would always have her mother with her even after separation. The braid represented continuity, lineage, and connection. And African Americans spiritual practice, pieces of the body, especially things like hair, could be used to create protective talismans that enslaved people would wear this to ward off the punishments or the violence of their enslavers.",
