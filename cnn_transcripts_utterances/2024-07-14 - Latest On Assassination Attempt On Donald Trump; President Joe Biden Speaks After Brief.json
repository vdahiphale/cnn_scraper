So in less than two minutes, we are expecting to see President Biden walk there into the Roosevelt Room where he is expected to speak.This is the first time we're really hearing from him since we've learned more about this attempted assassination. Last night he wasn't -- they weren't even calling it that yet. He said he had an indication of what he thought it was, but he was still waiting to learn more from officials. And we know he got a briefing last night. He's had that briefing this morning. What are we hearing from other officials there at the White House about the status of this investigation?",

They were very short, but he made very clear that he feels strongly that this kind of political violence just has no place in this country. Now, hours later, because the president has been here back in Washington, back at the White House. We are again just hoping to get a little more insight directly from the president himself on how that federal investigation is going. Given all of the folks that I just mentioned earlier, the heads of the various law enforcement agencies that have been briefing him in the situation room, we very much hope that we can get a little -- and here's the president, so I'm going to toss it back to you.

Jill and I are keeping him and his family in our prayers. We also extend our deepest condolences to the family of the victim who was killed. He was a father. He was protecting his family from the bullets that were being fired, and he lost his life. God love him. We're also praying for the full recovery of those who were injured. And we're grateful to the Secret Service agents and other law enforcement agencies who -- and individuals who risked their lives literally, for our nation. As I said last night, there is no place in America for this kind of violence or for any violence for that matter. An assassination attempt is contrary to everything we stand for as a nation -- everything. It's not who we are as a nation. It's not America, and we cannot allow this to happen. Unity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is important than that right now -- unity. We'll debate, and we'll disagree. That's not -- that's not going to change. But it's going to -- we're going to not lose sight of the fact of who we are as Americans. Look, Vice President Harris and I were just briefed in the Situation Room by my homeland security team, including the director of the FBI, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the attorney general, the director of the Secret Service, my homeland security advisor, the national security advisor. And we're going to continue to be briefed. The FBI is leading this investigation, which is still in its early stages. We don't yet have any information about the motive of the shooter. We know who he is. I urge everyone - everyone, please, don't make assumptions about his motives or his affiliations. Let the FBI do their job, and their partner agencies do their job. I've instructed that this investigation be thorough and swift. And the investigators will have every resource they need to get this done. Look, as this investigation continues, here's what we're going to do. First, Mr. Trump, as a former president and nominee of the Republican Party already receives a heightened level of security, and I have been consistent in my direction to the Secret Service to provide him with every resource, capability, and protective measure necessary to ensure his continued safety. Second, I've directed the head of the Secret Service to review all security measures for the -- all security measures for the Republican National Convention, which is scheduled to start tomorrow. And third, I've directed an independent review of the national security at yesterday's rally to assess exactly what happened. And we'll share the results of that independent review with the American people as well. And, finally, I'll be speaking more about this tonight at greater length from the Oval Office. We must unite as one nation. We must unite as one nation to demonstrate who we are. And so, may God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you very much.",

You saw Vice President Harris, Attorney General Merrick Garland at his sides as he was talking about the briefing that they just had in the Situation Room.First, he talked about the conversation that he had with former president Donald Trump last night. He said he was genuinely glad for his safety and the fact that he did survive this assassination attempt. And the president also offered his condolences to the family of Corey Comperatore. That is the man who was killed attending that Trump rally. He's a father of two daughters and his wife talked about how he dove to protect them and shield them as the chaos was breaking out at that rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The president also made some news there, as he said, that he is taking several steps here in the light of what happened. He said one, that they already talked about the increased protection that is afforded to Donald Trump, not just because he is the former president of the United States, but also given he is the presumptive Republican nominee. President Biden said that will stay in place. He also said that he has directed the Secret Service to review all the security measures for what is happening, where I'm sitting right now at the Republican convention. This site here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin already heightened security here, but the president says he's directed the Secret Service to review those measures and to make sure they are up to par. Lastly, and this may be the most important, is he is telling them and directing them to conduct an independent review of the security and the measures that were taken leading up to that rally in Butler, Pennsylvania as there are major questions coming about how someone could have gotten this close to the former president of the United States where he was able to fire shots in his direction. It's not clear who is going to be conducting that independent investigation, but those are the questions we have right now. I have M.J. Lee at the White House, Mark Preston is here with me in Milwaukee. M.J., let me start with you and what President Biden was announcing. I mean because that was news there in saying that there is going to be an independent review that he is scheduling with the Secret Service of how those security measures were put in place for that rally in Butler, Pennsylvania?",

Kaitlan, you know, these remarks that we just heard from the Roosevelt Room from President Biden really struck me as the president wanting to send a message to the nation that he very much understands from his position here at the White House, the seriousness and the gravity of the situation, and really the shock that the nation has gone through ever since the events unfolded yesterday.And I say that because these remarks were incredibly brief. Even though we know that he was just coming out of a lengthy briefing by all law enforcement agencies in the Situation Room, he actually didn't present a lot of details, didn't go into details at all really other than to say that he is committed to the federal agencies conducting a full and swift investigation. And he also at one point emphasized and this I thought was really noteworthy that there is nothing that they know right now, nothing he can share right now on the motives of the would-be assassin. And he said, quote, don't make assumptions about his motives or his affiliation. That to me struck me as the president really wanting to temper everyone's rhetoric around the events of yesterday and temper the speculation that, of course has just been so ramping on social media and elsewhere. He understands the situation and the moment that we are in. and I think this was a president that wanted to just get out of the cameras one more time to say there is a full investigation that is ongoing, even if he couldn't share a lot of the details. And certainly this sounds like the situation where there are no big conclusions yet. He made clear that the investigation is unfolding and that he is going to basically stay on top of things. I think the fact that you pointed this out yourself, Kaitlan, that he is talking about an independent investigation into the role of the U.S. Secret Service. That is so important because those are some of the biggest questions coming out of yesterday, again, as we were talking about before, how is it possible that there was such a massive security breach at an event featuring the former president.",

Who's watching the rooftops? Do you have a person on the roof? Do you have drones? I mean there are a lot of unanswered questions and somebody has to take a deep dive into it, but they need to do it sooner than later. You've got a major convention starting tomorrow. A month after that, you've got to Democratic convention. And then in-between, you've got a lot of campaigning by both the president and the former president and their vice presidents.

It does need to be independent, which means to me, someone from outside of that agency ought to be the person sharing that particular effort to make sure that its transparent, to make sure they have uncovered everything they need to uncover. I have a suspicion. They already probably know some of the things that broke down that didn't go well. It doesn't take long to kind of figure that out. The question is whether or not now or are they ready to really come forward with information? Do they have all the facts to verify to make sure that whatever theories you're working on right now actually turn out to be accurate ones that can be then shared with the public and lead to real change in terms of the security posture.

You know, he was bullied, the loner, and so forth, access to a high-powered weapon. All those kinds of things. But the whole point of that is to learn from it so that when you identify in the future potential people that are capable of doing these kinds of things, you can identify them early on. Again prevention is the whole thing, you know. We don't need something like this to happen again. And it doesn't matter if you're Democrat or Republican. All of us should be outraged of the fact that an elected official or potentially elected official, former president was targeted for assassination. That should not happen in the United States of America, period. And anything, any of us can do to prevent that from happening in the future and certainly our elected officials and activist and even media personalities need to tone it down. You've got a lot of people out there that are mentally unstable and they hear all this rhetoric and they take it upon themselves to do something. That is -- that is a huge part of the problem.

He is going to leave Bedminster in the next hour. He said he considered delaying his trip by two days, but he says he has decided he cannot allow a shooter or potential assassin to force change to scheduling or anything else. He says, \"Therefore, I'll be leaving as scheduled for Milwaukee at 3:30 p.m. today.\" Now, of course, this is coming, he has been recovering there at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey. His daughter, Ivanka Trump is on hand, according to CNN's Kristen Holmes. And all of this is coming as we're learning more about what it was like at that rally yesterday, where the former president was on stage just for about ten minutes before the shooting began. A mother and a son who are just a few rows in the front of the attendees who were there say it was too close for comfort. Donna Hudson and her son -- so they almost made the decision to actually sit higher up in the bleachers. We have now learned, of course, from Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, that one attendee Corey Comperatore was killed. He's the father of two daughters and his wife said that he dove on top of her and one of those daughters as the shooting and the chaos was unfolding. Two others were critically wounded. We have not heard an update on their condition, but were following all of this incredibly closely. I want to bring in CNN's senior justice correspondent Evan Perez, and also CNN's Danny Freeman, who was near the home of the gunman. Danny, let me start with you because this has been a lot of questions and you heard President Biden himself talking about this just in the Roosevelt Room a few moments ago, saying, give the FBI some time, be patient as they are trying to determine the motive of this shooter.

We just heard from Governor Josh Shapiro a little while ago. He said a few different things. First, he said that he is encouraging people to take the temperature down, to rise above the hateful rhetoric that exists in search for a better, brighter future. But then he turns to that man who was killed. That's Corey Comperatore. He also made an announcement just a little while ago in this past hour that all U.S. flags and Commonwealth flags will be flying at half-staff today in honor of Corey, who he described as a father, a loving husband. And he actually recounted a conversation that he had with Corey's wife describing him as a hero. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): Corey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community. And most especially Corey loved his family. Corey was an avid supporter of the former president, and was so excited to be there last night with him in the community. Corey dove on his family to protect them last night at this rally.

So, again, we're still waiting to hear if any of that may have led to what investigators are trying to find out, what was the motive, what led up to the shooting.

And, Evan, obviously, you heard Biden just mentioned that the FBI director was in the Situation Room with him. We saw the Attorney General Merrick Garland standing behind his shoulder what else are we learning about how -- what they've determined now that we're closing in, getting close to being 24 hours since this attempted assassination of Donald Trump. EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the fact Kaitlan that we have a shooter who is dead, makes this a much more complicated investigation for the FBI, because now there's no one to interview, right? So they are going through the normal police work, which is going through every facet of this former shooter's life, going through everything that he may have written. There is no -- so far, they've not found any indication of social media or anything that might explain what happened yesterday or what led up to yesterday's events. We do know that at the scene there they did when they did an initial search, they did find some explosive material both in his car and at the home where he and his family resided. So that's one of the precautions that were being taken us tonight as the investigation was under getting underway. But one of the parts of this that I think is -- we're going to learn a lot more about in the coming hours is certainly how close the police were in trying to stop this shooter. We know for a fact that from witnesses that there were multiple people who are trying to get that law enforcement's -- law enforcement's attention. Law enforcement themselves saw him. They saw him near the magnetometers, whether the Secret Service screens people going into the rally, they saw him, they thought he was suspicious looking, and they watched him and they also shared that information with Secret Service. Now the question is, you know, how did he end up on that roof without being noticed, and, of course, fired off those shots before the tactical team, before the counter sniper team from the Secret Service finally shot and killed him? That's one of the big questions that remains at this moment. We know from a local sheriff who spoke to \"The Washington Post\" that actually won one sheriff's deputy tried to get onto that roof, saw that the shooter and the shooter turned and pointed the gun at them and it appears that that is reason why the deputy left that one perch where he might've been able to do something about it. Again, this is part of the chaos and some of the explanation of how this happened when it did yesterday after 6:00 p.m. in Butler, Pennsylvania -- Kaitlan.",

Here to talk about the implications of it all, Scott Jennings, CNN senior political commentator, and also the former special assistant to President George W. Bush, and also David Axelrod, a CNN political commentator and former senior adviser to President Obama. Obviously, so much has changed we thought we would be talking about 24 hours ago, David Axelrod, let me start with you because President Biden gave those brief remarks with the vice president and the attorney general flanking him. He did announce he's giving a rare Oval Office address tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern. What's he going to use a moment like that? What would you advise him to use a moment like that?",

We know from our polling than half of Americans were expecting potential violence because where we stand right now, we have fewer people who trust the electoral process, fewer people who think that their voice is being heard, fewer people who have confidence in the electoral institutions and the people who run them this is a crisis. And one side talks about democracy in how it's executed, the other side talks about democracy in terms of the electoral process. We have to cool off. We have to calm down. I know in my focus groups, every time I address this, they go nuts and they do it either face-to- face or online. We are an agitated, irritated country right now. And I will tell you that this is not the end. This is potentially only the beginning. So I appreciate the directness of your question, and we have to hold both sides accountable.
