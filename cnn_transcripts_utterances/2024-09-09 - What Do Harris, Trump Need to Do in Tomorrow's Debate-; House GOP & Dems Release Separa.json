His numbers never recovered at the -- to the extent they were at before then. And look, I think what we're also going to hear is not just about the conditions-based withdrawal that the Trump team had and that the Biden team tore up, but also how they did it. Right? Closing Bagram Air Force base forced a bottleneck into Kabul. It's like trying to get people out of New York City but closing LaGuardia and Kennedy and having everyone go through Newark. And so, it forced a bottleneck that made Kabul, obviously, a massive target, as we saw. So, look, I think the Trump team absolutely feels like this will be on offense.
