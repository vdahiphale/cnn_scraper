      "sentences": "In making the announcement, the president- elect said that Mehmet Oz, quote, \"has been at the forefront of healthy living for decades.\" But Oz has faced criticism in the past, including from Capitol Hill, for some of the health claims that he promoted on his show.Joining us right now to talk about this is a former secretary of Health and Human Services under President Obama, Kathleen Sebelius. Thanks for coming in, Secretary. What do you think of Dr. Oz as the head of CMS? KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, FORMER HEALTH &amp; HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: Well, Kate, as you've already said, CMS is really the nerve center for one of the largest health programs in the world, and about half of America depends on one of those programs, Medicare, Medicaid, the marketplaces, children's health insurance to go to the doctor or get their medications, pay for their services. Dr. Oz had a distinguished career as a cardiac surgeon, and then he became a TV doc. And that career is a little more muddied. He was accused of promoting various kinds of alternative medications that were proven to not really have any beneficial value and be paid highly by the companies he was working with. So I think -- I think the jury is a bit out. I'm concerned not necessarily about Dr. Oz's policies because I don't really know what they are, but about the fact that incoming Vice President J.D. Vance has already talked about dismantling parts of the Affordable Care Act so that people would once again be put in risk pools based on their health experience, which cuts the heart out of getting rid of the preexisting condition protection. So issues like that, I think, come within the jurisdiction of CMS. What drugs to be approved to be paid for by Medicare? And, again, Dr. Oz has promoted hydroxychloroquine in the last pandemic, which was proven to be not only not effective against COVID, but dangerous to people. More people died having being treated than not treated. So I think there's some issues that Congress really should talk about when his nomination comes before them.",

You've got the alphabet soup of that when it comes to public health in America today. How bad do you think this is, having RFK running it, from your experience heading it up?",

      "sentences": "I think the most dangerous thing about the nominee for secretary is his view on vaccines. And when you have an incoming potentially incoming secretary who declares, without hesitation, that there is no safe and effective vaccine. That is enormously dangerous and life-threatening for people in this country and across the globe.There already is growing vaccine skepticism which Bobby Kennedy has helped to fuel not only here but around the world. We have a number of children who now are not vaccinated. States are granting broader exceptions for kids to go to school or childcare without vaccination. You know, I have an 11-month-old grandson, Kate, and he is not old enough yet to get the measles three-dose vaccine which means he's very vulnerable to getting measles, which was almost entirely eliminated in this country. That causes blindness. It causes brain bleeds. These are not minor illnesses for children. We see now -- we have whooping cough back in this country. So just that view of Bobby Kennedy's, I think, is extraordinarily dangerous from the leader of the largest health system in America. And I think what influence he could have over what CMS does, over what drugs they approve for Medicare, what they pay for issues, are they going to cut -- try to cut back on benefits? The good news is most of the public programs are protected by Congress. The benefits are set by Congress. The law about Medicare and Medicaid has been in place since the mid '60s, with the Affordable Care Act since 2010. So these programs are pretty solidly embedded in law. But there's a lot of discretion within CMS and a lot of interaction with the health system and states around the country. [09:35:01] BOLDUAN: Before HHS, you were the governor of Kansas for years.",

I'm really interested in a -- as a citizen in a democracy about the number of people who just didn't turn up at all for this election. It's a -- it's a frightening idea that we have many individuals who voted in 20 -- 2020, who voted again in 2022, who just didn't come out in 2024.I want to know why. I want to know why they feel like their voices and their votes aren't important. That's step one. Step two is to talk to folks who shifted from voting for President Joe Biden in 2020 to voting for Donald Trump. What are the issues? So we can learn something really going back and talking to voters. And then I think we need to be very humble about what has occurred and go on really a national kind of listening tour with constituencies, who are either unengaged or disengaged, who feel like the Democratic Party no longer speaks for them. What are the issues that are most of concern to themselves and their families? What did they hear from Democrats? What did they hear from Republicans? And I think that will be very illuminating.",

VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, John, why now? They wanted to make sure that these measures are in place ahead of the incoming president being put into office. We're going to get to the L.A. City Council bit, but I do want to also share that within the same hour that the L.A. City Council voted to unanimously pass to become the - a sanctuary city, that ordinance being passed, the Los Angeles Unified School District also passed essentially the same thing, reaffirming their position as a sanctuary district. Now, what this means for school personnel is that essentially they cannot voluntarily engage with immigration officials. They also cannot share the immigration status of staff members, students or their families. Essentially, preparing for the very real reality in the position that ICE were to show up to schools. This is one of a handful of motions that the L.A. Unified School District board passed to protect students. They also put in other measures in place to protect LGBTQ students, among others. Here's what the board president had to say.

Kindergartners would learn the golden rule tied to the Sermon on the Mount. Fifth graders, poetry lessons would include Psalms. The new curriculum would be optional, but school districts would receive a big financial incentive to adopt it. This move has already, of course, drawn protests, while proponents are arguing that the Bible is a fundamental part of American history.

The preliminary vote was only eight to seven in favor of these lessons, and that eighth vote was the vote of a political appointee by the governor.

It's good news because it's a decrease from last year, down 5 percent from last year. But, of course, up 19 percent compared to pre-pandemic.And you can thank the turkey for that, very much so. Turkeys this year, 16-pound turkey, a little more than $25, down 6 percent from last year. And that helped bring the overall cost down. But of course, Americans are grappling with higher costs of living. Grocery prices are up 22 percent since President Joe Biden took office in 2021.
