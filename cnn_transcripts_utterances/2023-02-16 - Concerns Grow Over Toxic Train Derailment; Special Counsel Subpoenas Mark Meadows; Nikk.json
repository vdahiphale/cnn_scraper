Smith is investigating Trump's handling of classified documents after he left office. And while the subpoena is related to January 6th, Meadows also may be of evidence in the document investigation. He played a role in the months and months of discussions, going on between the National Archives and Trump's representatives over returning government records that were in his possession.

And I do think there is an audience in each party for the idea of generational change.She's got two big challenges, though, I think, in pressing that argument. One is that the Republican primary electorate is not only very white, rosemary, it's also very gray. In almost every state, at least two-thirds of the voters and often three-quarters of the voters are voters aged 45 or older, which means that she's going to have to convince older voters that they need, ultimately, a younger candidate. The other problem I think she has is that we have seen a generational change argument work in the past. And I think if candidates like Democrats Gary Hart in 1984 or Bill Clinton in 1992 or George W. Bush in 2000, it hasn't been just we need to turn to page in terms of age. It has been tied to a critique of the party agenda and a call for an ideological change in direction. It was really none of that today in her announcement. There was no sense that she was offering a different direction for Republicans. She was just saying, I represent a different generation.

Trump dominated among those who did not. He won almost half of the total votes among non-college Republicans, even in a very crowded field with many alternatives. But he only won about one-third of the college educated Republicans.Now, he was able to make that work because, as I said, the two-thirds of college Republicans who were not keen on trump never coalesce behind a single candidate. I think, once again, those college educated Republicans will have to be the basis for any candidate who wants to seriously challenge Trump. And the question is whether anybody can consolidate him better than the group like Jeb Bush and John Kasich and Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz did in 2016. On paper, you would say that Ron DeSantis is better positioned to do that and also better positioned than any of them to cut into Trump's blue-collar strength by stressing some of the same cultural issues, but you've got to get on the field and actually run against Donald Trump.

Were there artillery shells coming in close by that would've made you aware that this was a particularly dangerous spot?",

Joe Biden has yet to comment on the three objects that were downed last weekend and has said very little about the suspected Chinese spy balloon shot down earlier this month.U.S. Intelligence officials now believe it is possible that the Chinese balloon really did drift off course and was not deliberately sent into U.S. airspace. They're still assessing what happened as well as which parts of the balloon's mission were ordered by Beijing. If the whole thing was truly an accident, it could help smooth things over between Beijing and Washington, which hopes to reschedule Secretary of State Anthony Blinken's visit to China. He postponed his original trip over the balloon controversy. Ten days after the catastrophic earthquake, more than 42,000 people are now confirmed dead in Turkey and Syria. But the window for survival that was expected to close days ago may still be open. Several surprising rescues were carried out on Wednesday. One of the survivors is a 13-year-old boy. He was freed from the debris in the Turkish city of Antakya after 228 hours. And a woman and two children were also saved in that same city during that same hour. They were rushed to a hospital by a helicopter. Many of these recent survival stories raise questions about how these people managed to last for so long under the rubble. One man trapped for more than 180 hours wrapped himself in a rug to keep warm while waiting in the dark, and he explained the drastic action he was forced to take to stay alive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HUSEYIN BERBER, SURVIVOR (through translator):  Now, I've got diabetes, you see. So, more important than food, there was some medication on the cabinet and a bottle of water. They all fell down next to me. I swallowed some medication with the water. The bottle was empty. So, what to do? Now, this is a bit embarrassing, I urinated in it, kept it for a while. It became nice and cool. And then, I would drink it. That's the way I managed to survive. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We've seen in these videos coming from Southeast Turkey as well as our teams there on the ground, there are countless families, thousands, still waiting, desperately hoping that their loved ones buried beneath the rubble may still have a chance of survival. We are still seeing those rescue teams which have traveled in from across the globe, working around the clock.There is still hope that there could be survivors, though, that window for finding people alive beneath the rubble is actually closing very, very quickly. And that is the concern here. We are seeing more people being pulled out, unfortunately, not alive. And, of course, the situation on the ground there is dire, to say the least. [03:40:00] It is freezing cold. The humanitarian conditions are poor. Thousands have been left homeless. And there are real concerns for the health and safety of those now left homeless in Southeast Turkey. We heard these remarkable stories of rescues. You mentioned there the woman and her two children who were pulled out of the rubble after their apartment collapsed, 228 hours beneath the rubble. They are said to be in a good condition health wise, but, of course, the question is, what is next for them? What is next for all of these families who have lost their homes, who lost absolutely everything? We have been able to meet some of those families who have now been evacuated over here in Istanbul. They say that they are starting completely afresh. They don't know what is next for them, for their children, where they will be housed, what sort of compensation they will receive. And, of course, as you can imagine, the trauma that they have experienced, the emotional trauma there is hard to get a grip on. Now, we have seen a huge outpouring of support when it comes to that humanitarian assistance. We see donations pouring in from across the country. Humanitarian distribution centers established here in Istanbul, a city which was, of course, hard hit by the earthquake. We are now seeing a ferry which was converted into a clinic there treating people injured and wounded following the earthquake. There has been a huge outpouring of support but there is a huge infrastructure challenge ahead as well. Around 50,000 buildings deemed unsafe and now requiring demolition, according to the Turkish authorities. Rosemary?",
