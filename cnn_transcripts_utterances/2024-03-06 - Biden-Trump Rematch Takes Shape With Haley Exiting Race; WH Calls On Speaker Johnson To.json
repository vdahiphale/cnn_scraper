The current president and the former president all but wrapping up their party's nomination nominations last night, but now they are trading jabs and they're vying to win over Nikki Haley supporters. But poll after poll reveals a skeptical American public that largely does not want this rematch. Not necessarily surprising as president, they both have notched historically low approval numbers.We're going to talk about how we got here. But first, let's talk about what happens next. CNN's Kristen Holmes is near Trump headquarters in Florida. So, Kristen, Trump didn't moderate his Haley attacks today, but does his campaign see an opening here?",

      "sentences": "Well, they absolutely do, Brianna. When you're talking to his various campaign advisors, they know that a race with Joe Biden, a rematch, is going to be incredibly tight. And they also know that they are going to need every single vote that they can get and that includes some of these Nikki Haley supporters.Now, they are aware that some of these people are just people who are never going to vote for Donald Trump. They are Republicans who have decided they would not back Donald Trump under any circumstances. But some of them are Republicans who are just looking for an alternative to Donald Trump and those are the voters that they are trying to get, people with conservative values who wouldn't vote Democratic under any circumstances. The point to mention here is that part of the reason Donald Trump and his team have been so annoyed that Nikki Haley wouldn't drop out of the race is because they wanted to project this image of unity. They wanted to say the Republicans all around were coming around, coalescing around Donald Trump as the nominee, and then they could move forward because he needs, again, the biggest base that he can possibly get going into this very competitive race. We are starting to see that. We already saw Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell coming out and endorsing Trump. The two men have not spoken in three years. Now, Donald Trump is responding to that on Truth Social, saying, thank you, Mitch. I look forward to working with you and the Republican Senate majority to make America great again. Again, the two have not spoken, but you are starting to see people who really have no relationship with Donald Trump or have talked poorly about him, even in recent weeks, coming out and backing the former president as the Republican Party becomes the president of Trump. We also heard from the Republican National Committee celebrating him as the presumptive nominee. Brianna, as you know, that is a very big deal because it gives Trump and his team the access to the entire infrastructure that the RNC has across the country, as well as donor lists and fundraising abilities and money which is a very important thing to run a presidential campaign.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I still think they view this as a pivot moment as President Biden turns towards the general election campaign. And they really do hope that as it becomes clear that Trump is the presumptive nominee, that voters will come to regard him as such. And as voters tune in and as President Biden makes his case, it will become clearer and clearer that this is a Biden versus Trump rematch.And even though that that particular rematch isn't necessarily popular with the American people, they do hope that it will become clear, this contrast, this choice that Americans have in front of them. Because according to their own research, many voters at this point just don't believe that Trump will be the nominee. And until that happens, it's very hard for them to make this argument to remind voters of the chaos that Trump brought with him when he was in the White House, of the policies that he's planning to impose if he were to return to the White House. And so I think they do really view this sort of as a kickoff week as they look to sharpen that contrast with the American people. And it was very interesting this morning. When Nikki Haley dropped her bid for the Republican nomination, they were very quick to try and peel off some of those voters to make this argument that President Biden represents some of the attributes that Haley was presenting to her coalition as well. President Biden saying in a statement, Nikki Haley was willing to speak the truth about Trump, about the chaos that always follows him, about his inability to see right from wrong, about his cowering before Vladimir Putin. Very interestingly, the President goes on to say, \"Donald Trump made clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley's supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign.\" So the recognition that there is this imperative to try and find voters everywhere that they can who just will not vote for Trump, who really are turned off by the attributes that Trump brought to the presidency, I think that will continue as well tomorrow when we see President Biden deliver his State of the Union address. The most watched television appearance for any president of the year, certainly a very important moment for President Biden tomorrow.",

This is not the kind of race that comes around every four years. I might compare it to 1968, for example, when the stakes were so high and the candidates, frankly, were not beloved by the electorate. In that case, Democrat Hubert Humphrey and Republican Richard Nixon, but a choice had to be made.You could argue about whether the right choice was made, but it's those kinds of stakes that exist in 2024 and people have to focus on that. They have to get away from their inability to accept what has been obvious for weeks and months. This is a rematch. This is a rematch. And people have to accept that and come to terms with it because it's either going to be Joe Biden or it's going to be Donald Trump in the Oval Office. And those - the third party candidates may well steer the election to one of these two candidates, but they're not going to be in the Oval Office.

We know he'll never concede. His base, which is still, because of Trump's big lie, still believing that he actually won the 2020 election, when he most certainly did not.That is the set of circumstances most likely to produce violence. But there are plenty of things that can happen on the campaign trail. High emotions are prevailing, especially this year with these two candidates. And at any time, on any day, the chemistry set of American politics could produce an explosion. We all need to be concerned about that and to the extent we can have an effect on it through our own commentary, our own beliefs, the way we conduct our work and the way we conduct our work ourselves. Maybe we can help to lower the temperature a little bit, but I think it's out of our control for the most part.",

It was the third party candidates that stripped Hillary Clinton of at least two and probably more of the key states that went to Donald Trump and gave him an electoral majority, even though he lost the popular vote by three million.That is a serious consideration, I hope, for anyone who's thinking about voting for RFK Jr. or Jill Stein of the Greens or Cornel West, who I imagine is a pure independent, or a no-labels candidate, whoever the heck it turns out to be, if they even have a candidate. These candidates are going to do some of Donald Trump's dirty work for them, and they're going to hurt Joe Biden.

They have the upper hand here and they've prevented Haitian prime minister, Ariel Henry, from returning to his own country.He's unable at this point and air travel is suspended because one of the places they have targeted through these days of terrible violence has been Port-au-Prince's airport. So it's unclear where this goes from here, because Ariel Henry is an unpopular prime minister. He was not elected. He came into power after the assassination in 2021 of the president of Haiti. And for years, the U.S. has called on Haiti - on Henry to hold elections. He has responded to the security situation and Haiti doesn't allow that. Certainly now, it certainly does not seem like any kind of elections could be held. But that is what the U.S. is calling for Henry to do to begin a transition, to call for elections, to see if that quells some of this violence. But for the Haitians caught in the crossfire, they need someone to come in, some force to come in from abroad, from wherever, and save them from these gangs, something their government apparently is unable to do.",
