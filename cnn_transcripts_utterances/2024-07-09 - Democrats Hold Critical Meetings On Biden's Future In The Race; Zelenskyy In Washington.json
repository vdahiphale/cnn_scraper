I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And good evening, tonight, it is a make or break day for US President Joe Biden and his political future as congressional Democrats meet to discuss his re-election campaign. Now, House Democrats held talks this morning. Members described it as more of a listening session. They said no decisions were made and no consensus was reached. Democratic senators wrapping up their meeting about an hour ago, some of them apparently expressed deep concern about the upcoming election. One senator said a wide range of views were shared about the best path forward, Biden insists, he won't leave the race, but top Democrats tells CNN that the decision is in the hands of party leadership. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says the presidents still has strong backing on Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We respect members of Congress. We expect their view, but I also want to say there is a long -- also a long list of congressional members who have been very clear and in support of this president, whether it is the CBC who gave full support, the Congressional Black Caucus for folks who are watching and I am not sure what CBC is, they were very much supportive.

The president is also, after he delivers his speech at NATO tonight, going to be participating in a roundtable with Democratic mayors. He is engaging in full-court press to try to shore up support from every corner of the party, and including some organizations where there have been some officials who have been willing to suggest that they are not fully sold with Biden's candidacy at this point and he is trying to change that. But this week is critical. That is why he is making this all-out effort because top Democrats say that it is up to leadership on Capitol Hill to determine whether they are willing to force Biden off the ticket if that is what their members suggest that they broadly want to do, but that that needs to happen soon, so that Democrats can either find a new candidate and figure out what that process looks like or get behind Biden quickly and try to limit the damage on the fallout that his reputation and his campaign has sustained in the interim.",

Trump, during his first term, I've been told by senior members of his own administration that he very nearly took the US out of NATO. He has spoken disparagingly of it. He recently said publicly that he wouldn't come to the defense of eastern-facing NATO allies and you have Joe Biden with a -- what was a bipartisan approach to the alliance in the world keeping -- staying the course, in effect, and their nervousness is if Trump were to win, the US role changes dramatically, and that opens up a whole series of questions for alliance members including what -- how do they defend themselves, right? I mean, there is even discussion of some NATO allies going nuclear in effect because they would no longer trust the US nuclear umbrella. So that's the primary focus and the primary question for them. The question about President Biden's health is added to that, right? Because the concern is, does that weaken his chances of being elected? What does that mean for his leadership now, and even if he is re-elected. It adds already to a stew of quite genuine and serious questions for the alliance going forward.",

What is going on in his country? He said in a speech today that Ukraine will fight for more air defense systems, F-16 jets, as well as security guarantees. What are his odds of getting that?

So it is a real question for them. And meanwhile, you still have the largest, bloodiest war since World War II carrying out on the European continent with Ukraine very much looking at itself as fighting for its life and as it relates to Ukraine's NATO membership, the realistic fact is Ukraine is not going to be NATO member today, this year, they're not going to get a commitment at this Summit while the war with Russia goes on because that would immediately put the Alliance at war with Russia, which the members don't want to do. So the question is, what kind of language or long-term commitment can they agree on to hold that prospect in effect out there for Ukraine?

The fed is politically independent, wants to remain politically independent, but of course there will be concerns that, you know, Trump is already alleged without any evidence that Powell is calibrating policy to help Joe Biden, that maybe he will cut rates to help Joe Biden. In fact, of course, there are a lot of people who have been calling for the Federal Reserve to cut rates more than they already have and they have been holding off precisely because of those concerns about inflation. So now, concerns about a softening labor market potentially, a slowdown in hiring may push the fed a little bit more towards cutting rates, but it will not be because of the political context.

You know, by your estimation, how nervous are NATO allies right now? And do you believe they should be? PETER WESTMACOTT, FORMER BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: Well, thanks for giving me the chance to talk a little bit about these issues, Paula. I think a lot of your visitors are arriving in Washington with some concern not only about how the alliance is performing on the really big issues that matter strategically at the moment. The immediate one of course the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but there's also the Middle East, which is not going well. And there's the big issue which is on many people's minds of what to do about China or what to do about the really very strong alliance that has now developed between China and Russia, with a bit of North Korea stirred into the mix as well. But as you've rightly pointed out, a lot of the leaders are arriving either with their own baggage or with just having arrived in power and many are looking, probably don't really want to, but looking inevitably at the question of who is going to be the Democratic candidate for the U.S. presidential elections on the 5th of November. So this is not really what foreign heads of government want to do. They want to talk about how to strengthen NATO, how to deal with the global crises, how to work more effectively together, how to do something about capabilities, how to stand up more and more effectively to the Russians who are invading Ukraine. So all those issues should be on the agenda. But inevitably, the way the news cycle operates, people will be saying, well, how is President Biden actually performing? So it's obviously a big issue for him, but it's also something that's on the mind of the 32, I think it is, heads of government from NATO countries, who have been turning up in Washington, in the nation's capital tonight and tomorrow.",
