And later, one on one with the one and only, a conversation with Simone Biles. Hello, everyone, live from New York. I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD. An extraordinary meeting is underway right now in Saudi Arabia. Foreign ministers from Islamic nations have gathered at Iran's request. Now this comes as Tehran moles its response to the assassination of Hamas' top political leader, Ismail Haniyeh last week. Among those in attendance at today's gathering in Jeddah is Jordan's foreign minister. He's been conducting a flurry of talks to try to diffuse hostilities in the region. He stepped away from that meeting earlier to speak with CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, is in Jeddah, where that meeting is underway. And CNN's chief international correspondent, Clarissa Ward, is in Tel Aviv.

Clarissa, I want to turn to you now, because as we mentioned, Hamas has now named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the appointment of Sinwar as the political head of Hamas, quote, underscores that it really is on him to decide whether to move forward with a ceasefire. How are Israelis viewing this move and the fact that he's now been officially appointed ahead of the organization?",

      "sentences": "Well, we've heard a couple of official reactions from the Israelis, both from the spokespersonof the IDF and the foreign minister, basically saying that, you know, the only place Yahya Sinwar belongs is underground. Foreign Minister Katz also went on to say that this really underscores how the Palestinian cause has kind of been hijacked by hardliners who are aligned with Iran. I think more broadly speaking, this did catch some people off-guard, because traditionally, the leader of Hamas' political faction is not based in Gaza. They are outside of Gaza. Now, some Hamas watchers are saying that's part of the problem in their eyes and that those who are outside in countries, such as Qatar, are too vulnerable, if you will, to pressure from countries like Qatar who might be really trying to exercise all their might to try to pull together a ceasefire agreement. And everybody understood, Bianna, that behind the scenes Yahya Sinwar was always pulling the strings and calling the shots. But there's definitely symbolism in naming him the official political leader because what you're essentially saying is, if you're going to assassinate the more moderate force within the context of Hamas, then you're going to have to deal with the hardliner. And so the question now is, how does this impact all these attempts that Nic has just been talking about to try to get to a ceasefire? In the past, Sinwar has sought to prolong the conflict. He has sought to widen it to a regional conflict. He has closer ties to Iran than any previous Hamas leader. And so it does seem to dim any hope of trying to get all parties to the negotiating table. And I should add as well that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, although he did send some negotiators to Cairo last weekend, real questions within Israel, even, about his ability to execute on a ceasefire and perhaps more importantly, whether he has any desire to do it whatsoever or whether he has also been seeking to prolong this conflict for his own political experience, Bianna.",

Well, Russia's military chief says that the country's military stopped a Ukrainian assault on the Kursk's region. His comments came during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin earlier. It is the first time, since the two and a half-year-old war began that Ukraine has attacked this region, which is on Russia's southwestern border. Despite the military leader's statement, there are reports that heavy shelling continues in the town of Sudzha, about 10 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. Nick Paton Walsh joins us live from London with the details. Quite a bold incursion now entering its second day, Nick.

Nick Paton Walsh, thank you so much. CNN military analyst, Colonel Cedric Leighton, joins us now from Washington with a military perspective. And I want to pick up Cedric where we heard Nick and that is that this this type of incursion has happened in the past, but with Russian soldiers who had been fighting for Russian citizens who had been fighting for Ukraine.

This means that the Ukrainians are owning this operation. The other operations with a unit that is made up of Russians that is fighting for Ukraine, that is basically a paramilitary or an extra military unit. This is part of a Ukrainian effort that belongs to the Ukrainian military. And I think what it really means is that the Ukrainians have developed some kind of a strategy to not only distract the Russians from their operations in the Donetsk Region, but it also means that they are willing and able to take the fight to the Russians into Russian territory. And in some ways it's a warning to Russia, but it's also a diversionary tactic to make sure that the Russians realize that the Ukrainians can fight back in places that the Russians might not expect.",

So what the U.S. position is basically make sure that we don't get involved in a major escalation and keep that escalatory ladder kind of at the lower rung, if you will. In this particular case, it's hard to say if they really got permission from the U.S. I suspect they did not. But I think it would be who was (ph) at this particular jump sure to allow the Ukrainians to do as much damage as possible to the Russian forces that are masked on the Ukrainian border. And that also means all of the forces that are used in a standoff type fashion. In other words, those that use aircraft flying over the Black Sea or inland Russia that can attack Ukraine by launching missiles like the caliber missiles and the various hypersonic missiles that the Russians have. So this is something where the Ukrainians need to be able to head back as much as possible. And we also have to, of course, keep in mind that the Russians may respond in a way that is not seen at the present time. That's certainly what they're threatening to do.

He continues to say, we hate our religion, we're disloyal, we're uninformed. He continues to send vitriol and hate toward the majority of American Jews. This is consistent with who he is. In 2017, he called neo-Nazis marching in Charlottesville very fine people. In 2020, he refused to condemn white supremacy from the presidential debate stage. Instead, he incited right-wing extremists. He continues to traffic in vitriol targeting our community instead of speaking about the issues. And you're right, there has been anti-Semitism that's emerged from the far- left as well. We condemn that. And there was anti-Semitism that originally fueled some of what we saw as this smear campaign against Governor Shapiro. It appears that it was later fueled by Republicans, however, including Trump, who has commented on it.

In fact, Governor Walz, Vice President Harris, and Governor Shapiro all share the same views with regard to Israel.
