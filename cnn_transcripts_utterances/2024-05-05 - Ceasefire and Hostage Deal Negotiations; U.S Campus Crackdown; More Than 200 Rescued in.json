I'm Anna Coren live from Hong Kong.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, the world holds its breath waiting for a possible Gaza ceasefire and a hostage deal as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces pressure on both sides at home. In the U.S., there are crackdowns against some pro-Palestinian protesters on college campuses. And devastating floods hit Texas, prompting emergency workers to launch hundreds of rescues. Negotiators in Cairo are said to have made some progress in ceasefire and hostage release talks involving Israel and Hamas, but they don't appear to be close to a deal. CIA Director Bill Burns is in Cairo, representing the U.S. in the talks. Officials from Egypt, Qatar and Hamas are also taking part. The director of Israel's Mossad is not there, but Israeli sources say he could travel to Egypt quickly if Hamas agrees to the framework. Well, even if there's a framework agreement, both U.S. and Israeli officials say a deal to stop the fighting and release hostages could take days to finalize. CNN Senior White House Reporter Kevin Liptak has more.",

And so, certainly, American officials are hopeful that this round of talks could eventually lead to a release of hostages that are being held in Gaza in exchange for a temporary ceasefire. And the framework on the table now, which has been on the table for about a week, is a generous offer, according to the American secretary of state, Antony Blinken. And it would include the release of about 33 hostages in exchange for a ceasefire of about six weeks. This is a deal that certainly the Americans are pressuring Hamas to accept. Listen to how Blinken described this over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We wait to see whether, in effect, they can take yes for an answer on the ceasefire and release of hostages. And the reality in this moment is the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There still are some final details that would need to be ironed out before the hostages are to come out of Gaza.And I think the real fear among American officials is that if this deal falls apart, that could be impetus for Israel to begin its ground invasion of Rafah. That, of course, is the city in Southern Gaza, where more than a million Palestinian civilians have been sheltering. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that he will go into Rafah with or without a deal. And from the American side, they have said that they need to see a credible plan to protect those civilians, and they haven't seen one yet. And that is certainly the great fear, I think, as these talks heat up, certainly President Biden very hopeful for a deal that would, in his mind, lower the temperature both in Israel and in the United States, provide the diplomatic space to negotiate a broader ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

More than a dozen people were killed, most of them children at the Al Maghazi refugee camp in Central Gaza, yet the Israeli military still hasn't taken responsibility for the attack.Jeremy Diamond has more on what CNN has learned, and we warn you his report contains distressing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  This grainy home video is the closest Mona Aoudatala (ph) will ever get to seeing her ten-year-old daughter. A stack of school certificates, a wardrobe of her favorite clothes, the perfume she used to wear, all that remains of the daughter Mona poured everything into. There is no Shahed (ph) now. Every time she came in, she said, Mom, I would say my soul, my soul, my soul is gone. Shahed was one of ten children killed when an Israeli airstrike hit the crowded street in the Al Maghazi refugee camp where she was playing with her friends. Her pink pants impossible to miss, among the small bodies splayed around a foosball table in the chaotic aftermath. Two weeks later, the Israeli military still won't take responsibility for the strike that killed her. CNN provided the IDF with the coordinates and time of the attack, based on metadata from two different phones in the immediate aftermath. The IDF said they did not have a record of that strike. They said they carried out a strike at a different time than described, and that the collateral damage as described in the query is not known to the IDF. The IDF makes great efforts to mitigate harm to the civilian population from areas where strikes are being carried out. Evidence recovered and documented by CNN at the scene of the strike paints a very different picture of Israeli military responsibility. This circuit board and bits of shrapnel, walls and shop steps distinctively pockmarked, and a small crater barely a foot wide, all pointing three munitions experts to the same conclusion, the carnage was likely caused by a precision-guided munition deployed by the Israeli military. CHRIS COBB-SMITH, WEAPONS EXPERT:  I've seen these strikes so many times. There's a relatively small crater in the road. There's no large shrapnel holes or fragmentation holes, which would have been caused by, say, a mortar round or an artillery round. The fragmentation is consistent",

And while it did not disrupt the ceremony, people that we spoke to who were inside Memorial Stadium here in Bloomington said that they could at least hear the protest.Our understanding, based on those conversations as well as social media video, is that the students stood up, made this audible protest, and then walked out. It was a big question here, to what degree protests might disrupt the ceremony, if at all, for two reasons. The first is because Indiana University had set up a protest zone outside Memorial Stadium, but also because they have had pretty robust protests here in Bloomington. It was in April that 33 students were arrested at Indiana University at a pro-Palestine protest. And what we've seen all across the country is that schools that have seen those protests in many cases have seen disruptions to their ceremonies. For example, at the University of Michigan, pro-Palestine protesters were able to actually disrupt the ceremony briefly before they were escorted out by Michigan State Police. So, again, that was the big question here at I.U. in Bloomington, Indiana, 41,000 people inside that stadium, and our understanding is that just dozens of students stood up, again, as the president was speaking, and then filed out. It was audible, but it was not disruptive. Whitney Wild, CNN, Bloomington, Indiana. COREN:  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has a new status in Russia.

Of course, these are hours of frantic wait and great caution. CNN's affiliate network in Australia have reported that the family of Jake and Callum Robinson are traveling to Ensenada to be as close as possible to the investigation and perhaps even assist with that DNA matching. In the meantime, the three Mexican citizens who had been previously brought in for questioning in relation to this investigation had since been detained on the allegation of kidnapping, according to the attorney general of Baja California, the state where Ensenada is located. The FBI and Australian Foreign Office are also assisting the Mexican police, but so far, the ultimate clue on what happened to those three tourists who have been reported missing since April 29th has not surfaced yet.
