It does seem that the winds are shifting in his favor, that Democrats in that meeting are not en masse calling for him to step aside, though there are some who have expressed concerns that Biden could drag down Democrats across the country.What does the polling say? CNN's senior data reporter Harry Enten is with us now. Mike Quigley, who was on with us yesterday, one of the things he continues to say is that Biden will drag us all down. If he stays on the ticket, it's going to hurt House Democrats. What do the numbers say right now in terms of the House?",

But the fact of the matter is, you look at the national polling, the generic congressional ballot choice for U.S. House, look at this, CNN poll, plus two Republican. \"Wall Street Journal\" poll, plus three Republican. Monmouth University poll, plus three Republican. Yes, Joe Biden may be in slightly worst shape in these particular polls, but the fact is, when Biden's down four, five, six points in these polls, you can only run so far ahead of Joe Biden. At this particular point, at least in the race for the House, it does seem like Republicans are ahead because Donald Trump is so far ahead.",

And the best Dem pickup chance perhaps to reverse that so the GOP doesn't gain - net gain of at least one, is Texas, but that's still a likely GOP win.So, the fact is, if Donald Trump wins this election, the race for the Senate, for all intents and purposes in my mind, is over.",

But the House popular vote that year actually went Democratic, even though Republicans maintained control of the House. So, the fact is, five out of six times. That's not good math.And let's just take a look at the Senate here. Senate and presidential races in 2016 and 2020. States that voted the same way in both, 68. States that voted for a different party, just one. That was Maine back in 2020. The fact is, straight ticket voting is the way of the land these days. The idea that Democrats down ballot could somehow outrun Joe Biden to such a great extent to win control in the House or maintain control in the Senate, that seems to me to be an unlikely proposition.",

So, all of the concerns are valid and have to be taken into consideration. As I've said before, I believe the president is a responsible patriot, who's going to take into consideration all of those - all of those key points.

And the American people cannot trust any platform that is being put forward in this convention, whether it's softer language or not. He told us who he was in 2016. He told us who he was and what he would do in 2020. And I believe he's just now trying to - he's now learned that the American people don't support that position. And he's trying to fool the American people into believing that he now has some - somehow now become softer on this issue.

He told me that they were not putting their thumb on the scale at this moment.Inside the room, members are taking turns coming and voicing their views of what exactly Biden should be doing, what the Democrats should be doing in this moment. But I will tell you that Richard Neal says he is standing by the president, and he did hear several members talking that they also are standing by the president. Now, he declined to lay out specifically what was said in the room because leadership made the case to their membership that if they are going to have a true conversation, that they need to keep the details of what happens in the room between the Democratic family. Richard Neal told me that that was actually the largest applause line of anything that leadership said inside. Again, we are still talking to members as they are just starting to trickle out. Mike Quigley just left this meeting. He was getting his bike, saying that he still has concerns about the president. But I will just tell you that right now Democrats are really soul-searching in this moment. They are trying to figure out what the next steps are going to be. And the reality here is that changing horses in the middle of this race would be extremely difficult. And I think that that reality is starting to sink in for members. You know, you heard that from Jerry Nadler as he entered the meeting. Just a few days ago CNN reported that he had some concerns about Biden's ability to do this job.
