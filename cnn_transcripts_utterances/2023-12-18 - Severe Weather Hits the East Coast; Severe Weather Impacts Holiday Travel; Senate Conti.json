Justice O'Connor was the first woman to serve on the nation's highest court. She passed away on December 1st at the age of 93. And she, of course, will be remembered for so many things. She's going to be honored during a private ceremony this morning at the court. Afterwards, the public is going to be allowed to pay their respects to this trail blazing, legendary woman and justice. And tomorrow there will be a private funeral service for Sandra Day O'Connor at Washington National Cathedral.You're seeing now live as they're walking her casket up the Supreme Court steps. Sara.",

Winds up to about 30 miles an hour here are the peak gusts.We are see, according to the FAA, some ground stops and ground delays going into effect. In fact, the FAA just put a ground stop in effect for flights going into Boston Logan, also flights being delayed on the ground there as well due to the heavy wind. The big story here is the fact that this is mostly rain, that this is not a snow event. So, we could be seeing a very different story right now. The number of cancellations and delays remaining relatively low. Here are the latest from Flight Aare. About 388 cancellations so far today, about 1,100 flight delays. Let's put this into context over the weekend where this weather was. We saw 10,500 delays, but only 200 cancellations. Airlines really repeating a story that we saw over Thanksgiving when they were hit by big rain and there were a lot of delays but not many cancellations. The weather is the big x factor as we go into holiday travel here. And it really begins to ramp up now. The numbers that we have seen, according to the airlines, is that these -- these rushes for Christmas and New Year's are getting longer. And so many people are leaving earlier. So, we are right on the precipice of what will be likely a record-setting holiday travel season. AAA says it's going to be one of the biggest ever.",

If you talk to some Republicans, yes, they will say the White House did kind of intervene in these discussions a little too late because if you recall the White House has had pretty good success during President Biden's time in office of kind of staying out of these legislative negotiations and just kind of letting the senators, letting the lawmakers kind of do the lawmaking and then kind of having Biden there at the last minute to sign these priorities into law.It's a little different here. Obviously, immigration is incredibly complicated. It's incredibly technical and complex, which is why the White House and DHS officials are in the room, pretty much as we speak, you know, hammering out these negotiations. But I've talked to a lot of Republicans who are involved in these negotiations, and they say there's no way you can close a deal until the White House is really fully engaged because the president, the White House, really needs to send a signal to other lawmakers, particularly Democrats, what the president is willing to do on the border.",

      "sentences": "Well, there are several outstanding issues at play right now. And a lot of it revolves -- first of all, this isn't like the traditional immigration negotiations where there's all this talk about border security, but perhaps a pathway to citizenship. So, it's more of a balanced approach. This all really focuses on the border, on sort of scaling back these migrants' ability to apply for asylum, which is - which has been causing the rising number of people arriving at the border.So, you have a lot of sticking points inside the room. For example, you have Republicans who, for weeks, insisting on provisions that would essentially scale back President Biden's what we call parole authority, kind of this authority, kind of power by the president to allow in certain types of immigrants, or basically Republicans say that should be handled on a case-by-case basis and the president and this administration has not been doing that. There are certainly areas of agreement there -- already there are agreements inside that room on making basically the asylum interview process a little bit harder. So, it's a little bit harder to pass these procedural steps to get to, perhaps, apply for asylum in this country. But this is a really complicated, technical issue. And also, if the law is not written right, if this law is not airtight, then it could open -- the administration could open itself up to numerous legal challenges. And that's going to cause serious problems down the road.",

And what you can see is that overall they're spiking. Flu and Covid together are coming up and flu is rising pretty quickly. You can see here the geographic distribution. It's really bad in the south right now but it is starting to move north. And Covid in particular in wastewater is being detected at the highest levels in the Midwest right now.
