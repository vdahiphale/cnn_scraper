And just in to CNN, we are learning more about what is in those documents and also about what the attorney general, Merrick Garland, is doing about them, and how lawmakers and both parties are reacting today. President Biden has not responded to questions on the issue twice today. You saw him there again faced with reporters, but he will face reporters again later this afternoon. And we will see if he responds then. In the meantime, we have a full team coverage here with Evan Perez and Phil Mattingly here in Washington. Also with us, CNN legal analyst and a former Obama White House ethics czar Norm Eisen. Evan, I want to start with you, because we're getting some new information right now, about both what is in the documents and also how this is being handled by the Department of Justice. What do you know this afternoon, Evan?",

Now, these documents apparently cover every -- they were related to intelligence memos. They were briefing materials that were prepared for Biden when he was vice president, and they cover a range of topics, including Iran, the Ukraine and United Kingdom. So these were documents that would have been prepared for him when he was serving as vice president. And,somehow, they ended up in these boxes that were sent over and were provided -- or, rather, housed at his office that was being set up at the University of Pennsylvania here in Washington. A lawyer who worked for Joe Biden and his operation, their political operation, was at the center trying to close out this office last fall. And that's when they came across these documents inside a manila folder. And this person saw a label that clearly identified material that said it was classified. And that's when, of course, everything stopped, and they alerted the National Archives. And now we have obviously an investigation into exactly how they ended up there, Abby.",

November 2, when they first encountered these documents, that's just before the midterm elections. But it isn't until now that we are learning about it. Why is that? What is the White House saying?",

      "speaker": "PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "sentences": "Abby, there has been no explicit explanation as to why there has been a delay.Some people I have talked to have made the point that the administration was cognizant of the fact that there was a review under way, that this had been referred to the Justice Department and that the U.S. attorney that everyone was talking about in Illinois was in the midst of working through this process. Perhaps they didn't want to get involved in that. And, certainly, this is a White House that for the better part of two years has done everything in their power not to be seen as playing any role in the Justice Department's efforts or decisions. But it is certainly a question they are hearing from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, and not necessarily just Republicans. Now, it's worth noting White House officials have not spoken publicly about this beyond the on-the-record statement they released from the White House Counsel's Office last night, that statement confirming that the documents had been found and confirming that a review was under way and then giving a detailed timeline, a timeline that was detailed, again, behind the scenes privately in a White House call with allies that my colleague Jeff Zeleny is reporting on. Now, they also gave a top-line view of what they said those documents actually were to some degree, no details. Obviously, they are classified documents, but downplaying those documents, saying they're not particularly sensitive and the intelligence community was not particularly concerned about those documents. Obviously, we don't know what those documents actually are specifically. And the White House hasn't publicly said anything about those documents, but the primary purpose of the call to really amplify the idea that immediately once documents were found, or once the president's private lawyer found a document with classified markings, a call was made to the counsel's office, who then called the National Archives. And Archives went over and picked up those documents the next morning, trying to draw a clear contrast from the former president and make clear they have cooperated every step of the way, Abby.",

I mean, we're talking about 10 documents, according to our reporting.However, Norm, you were in the Obama administration their ethic czar early on. And I think we have to ask the same question that we would have asked when we were dealing with this issue with Trump, which is, how could something like this have happened? Can you think of any good reason why documents like this would have remained in his personal office for this length of time?",

The reality is that accidents do happen all the time. And the key -- so it's not a good reason, but it's a human reason. And the key question is, was it willful and intentional? If you look at the criminal laws that apply to this question of documents, classified documents, being held outside of government premises, the felony laws all talk about willful or intentional misconduct. Right now, we have no indication of that. And, as you have noted, that's very different from the pattern of behavior exhibited by the former president and those around him.",

The question in that case is, in addition to the fact that they were classified, how they were handled and why they weren't returned promptly.But, Evan, from the Department of Justice's perspective, it seems like there's no way to disentangle this from the politics of the Trump probe.

Do they know what might be out there?Norm, I have to ask you. I mean, one of the factual pieces of information that we got from our colleague Jamie Gangel's great reporting is that these documents were, it seems, found in a box that contained a lot of personal effects, including information about Beau Biden's funeral, et cetera. However, in the Trump case, his documents were also entangled with a lot of personal effects. Does that matter to you? Does that actually make it worse? Were they mishandled because they were just mixed in with things that were unclassified?",

Joe Biden may never have known that these documents were in that box. Someone else may have loaded them in. They were in a sealed envelope marked personal. So, those are the kinds of things that the investigators are going to have to look at. They have to treat like situations alike. There are some other differences here, the volume of documents. The number is smaller. There's no indication that there's code word, the most sensitive documents, as we do have in the Mar-a-Lago case. And there's no finding of probable cause. There, there was a search warrant. A judge found probable cause of criminal violations. We don't have any of that here. But, by the same token, we do need answers to these basic factual questions. And it needs to be done in a way that inspires the confidence of the American people that this was fairly and completely looked at.",

And, look, we're already seeing some contradictions. Yesterday, we heard from some officials who indicated that the president and his team didn't really know what were in these documents. And yet, today, they're doing a call with allies saying, well, we know that this was not really that important and the intelligence community doesn't really care about it. So those two things are a bit in conflict. And so they're going to have to get their story straight as the days come -- in the days ahead.",

And just to give you some perspective, like, here's the bus stop. It is halfway underwater. I spoke to the people in this house. They told me they were not flooded. But the house behind it completely flooded. The guy there told me:  Look, I had to put everything on high places just so that I wouldn't lose all of my stuff. And I have talked to a lot of people here who told me that they lived here for years, and this is the worst that it's ever been. There are some of the evacuation orders that have been lifted, but officials here in the county telling me that still about 20,000 people are without power right now. So you're dealing with the flooding. And then you also do not have power. County officials also telling me that a lot of trees fell on top of homes overnight, telling me that they don't know exactly how many injuries or what happened overnight, but they're trying to evaluate all of that, as you wake up and as you see all of this. People are being told, do not drive, because many of the streets look like this. So, of course, it's dangerous if you're out on the road, and they're telling people, if you do not have to be out on the roads, do not drive, because you're putting everyone at risk. There are sheriff's deputies working around the clock, telling people to go back to their homes, to not be on the road. They have been working 24/7. And they're super overwhelmed. And so it's been really tough for a lot of the local authorities here. And the problem is, they're going to have to keep cleaning. This is going to take days, maybe even weeks to clean up.
