The judge peppered attorneys for both sides and ruled that Donald Trump's team had not established their case, saying to them, you are literally accusing the Manhattan D.A.'s office and the people assigned to this case of prosecutorial misconduct and of trying to make me complicit in it. And you don't have a single site to support that position. The judge took a 45 minute break and came back in a surprise move, ruled from the bench, saying that Manhattan prosecutors were not at fault for any delayed production of documents to Trump's team and said that this case would move forward on April 15th. But Donald Trump got some good news on Monday when the New York appeals court said that he had more time to post the bond in his civil fraud trial and the court chopped the amount that Trump has to post down to $175 million.

Courts have to assess the relative merits of a case, have to determine whether or not a reduction of the bond in this case, again, from a half a billion to $175 million is appropriate. I think the judges evaluated the equities in this case and said, listen, let's extend 10 days. You know, certainly the ability for him to get any type of bond and let's reduce it. And so I think that that in this particular case is a significant win for him, considering that he went to 30-30 insurance companies to attempt to get a bond and all said, no, perhaps he will have better luck getting it now that it's significantly been reduced.",

They concern themselves with whether you can get a jury, select a jury fairly and appropriately and carry out the matter at hand, which, of course, would be a fair trial.And so ultimately, that's what we're going to do, meaning the judicial system. And so it's not really a surprise, Rosemary, that the judge said, listen, no as to the issue of a further delay and no as to the issue of a dismissal. Right? We know that there were delays in discovery with respect to what prosecutors turned over to his defense team. But the judge, considering that, said, listen, if I extend the trial for a couple of weeks, that will give you as defense lawyers the ability to digest, read, review this material, otherwise support and defend your client. And therefore, that adjournment is appropriate. And I think that the matter will move forward. In terms of the risk, Rosemary, listen, he could face incarceration in the case. Certainly it's an e-felony. The way felonies work in New York State, it goes from a felony, most severe, 25 to life, to e- felonies where you certainly can do still jail time.

And if you do that successfully, that's a big deal. In the event your client testifies, it goes from the burden of proof and you whittling away to do we believe your client, is your client credible, is your client's testimony compelling? In this case, of course, it's the president of the United States, a little bit different. I think his attorneys would want to keep him off the witness stand. But you know what? I think Trump keeps his own counsel. He's indicated he wants to testify and perhaps he will testify. But it's a documentary case, meaning it's a paper case. And to the extent that prosecutors can establish that there were payments that were made and they were not retainer payments paying back his lawyer, his fixer, Michael Cohen, but instead they were going to pay off Stormy Daniels, who of course is the centerpiece of the case, then I think it creates significant problems.

Security Council vote on a Gaza ceasefire, clearing the way for the measure to pass. The move prompted immediate reaction from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who canceled a trip by two of his top advisers who were expected in Washington this week to discuss the situation in Rafah. American officials say they were perplexed by Netanyahu's decision, calling it overreaction. Journalist Elliott Gotkine joins us now live from Jerusalem. Good to see you again, Elliott. So the sudden cancellation of Israel's delegation to Washington by Prime Minister Netanyahu has perplexed the United States. How might all this impact ceasefire and hostage negotiations, as well as U.S.-Israeli relations, of course?",

      "sentences": "Rosemary, as you noted, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is in Washington specifically to discuss Israel's plans for an operation in Rafah. Now, that was something that this delegation that Netanyahu canceled was supposed to discuss as well. So it's hard to see any real practical impact of that cancellation.Of course, the other issues, as you mentioned, there are ongoing talks to try to secure the release of hostages who were abducted on October the 7th and who are still being held in the Gaza Strip in exchange for the freeing of Palestinian prisoners. Now, Israel has reportedly agreed to a U.S. proposal for the release of around 40 hostages in exchange for some 700 Palestinian prisoners, including a number who are serving life sentences. But Hamas, in its response, seems to be pushing back, saying that that still doesn't meet its demands for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, an end to the fighting and allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. So those talks are ongoing, mediated, of course, by the Egyptians and the Qataris. They've not broken down yet, but still not, neither have they led us to the breakthrough that many people were hoping for. As far as Israel-U.S. relations are concerned, we've seen this rift widening over the past few weeks. It's hard to see how the U.S.' abstention from this U.N. Security Council resolution allowing it to pass is going to heal that rift. And it's also interesting that the language in this Security Council resolution doesn't appear to be meaningfully different from previous resolutions that it has actually vetoed. So what's changed mostly is the situation in the Gaza Strip, where it has deteriorated and where many are now on the brink of famine. But also, I think it is evidence that the U.S. is continuing to lose patience with the Netanyahu government. At the same time, of course, it will also perhaps allow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to portray himself as somehow defending Israel's right to act independently and in its own best interests, i.e. the need to go into Rafah to destroy those last remaining battalions of Hamas, even if it's not in the best interests of Washington or indeed the Israel-U.S. relationship.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ukraine's newest target is something they've long cherished themselves. Small, white, rectangular satellite internet terminals from Elon Musk's Starlink, apparently in Russian hands and hit by Ukrainian drones. They're not supposed to be there at all, according to Musk and U.S. sanctions. Here, a Russian soldier explains frontline damage to one of their Starlink units, connecting attack drones and command centers. While Russia has officially denied their use, their army of crowd funders openly flaunt Starlink purchases in third countries. Here is one key supplier showing off store-bought drones and five Starlinks too. UNKNOWN (translated): The next batch will be bigger, 30 pieces. PATON WALSH (voice-over): The look on their faces does not suggest they're too confident in coming home. UNKNOWN (translated): Take care of yourself. PATON WALSH (voice-over): She has posted other images of Starlinks and drones bought. Ukrainian troops we met across the east and south of the front line said Russia has near copied their system of attack drones, using Starlink's internet signal to control dozens of single-use first- person view devices to swarm Ukrainian positions. Here is even an intercepted signal one unit told us they had hacked from a Russian drone. You can see it maneuvering into a Ukrainian target. Near the heavily contested village of Robotyne, down in the bunkers where the drone wars are fought, this change is huge and has come with an apparent complication for the Ukrainians too. Their Starlink speeds have been getting slower, said this commander. ANTON, UKRAINE'S 65TH MECHANIZED BRIGADE (translated): Before New Year the speed was much higher. Now it decreased by half. I saw information about the Russians, through neutral countries, bringing Starlinks and using them on the Zaporizhzhia front lines for their purposes. PATON WALSH (voice-over): Another operator in the same area reported problems in the last month. MISHA, COMMUNICATIONS OPERATOR, UKRAINIAN ARMY (translated): What we really started to notice is a constant drop of speed and connection. We need to reboot the Starlinks all the time to make them work properly, but eventually speed starts to drop and connections breaks. PATON WALSH (translated): And it's messing with your work? MISHA (translated): Yes, it brings rather unpleasant complications. PATON WALSH (voice-over): A lot rests on Musk. While Ukrainian officials went public with their concerns six weeks ago, they've since gone silent. They're perhaps quietly pressuring Musk, who experts think can vet who uses terminals, even if that's trickier in contested areas.",

And what could this potentially mean for baseball's biggest star, Ohtani, given the questions surrounding his own possible involvement in this scandal?O'BRIEN: Well, Major League Baseball announced late last week that they were opening a formal process to look at the matter. And by the way, baseball has done this before. Regardless of where this is headed, this is currently in America, the largest gambling scandal that baseball has faced since 1989, 35 years ago, when Pete Rose, the subject of my book, got himself in trouble with gambling. Now, the details here are, for the moment, different. Pete Rose was alleged in 1989 to have bet on baseball and to have bet on his own team. There is no indication at this point that that is what has happened here with Shohei Ohtani and his interpreter in Los Angeles. However, baseball does have a process for investigating such matters. And if they want to look at a model for how to do that, they can look at their own history. They did this 35 years ago.",

All the questions about what has happened in Los Angeles now overshadow opening day. And if again, the Pete Rose story that I wrote about in my book is any model here, it could take months before we have real and final answers about what has happened.",

I hope that our vision has given substance to their aspirations. I pledge to govern with humility and transparency and to fight corruption at all levels.

One of the things that President- elect Diame Faye has promised to do is to review and look into the CFA Franc.

Inside, patients receive treatment in a waiting room because the wards are full. The vibe is very much 2020. The virus is different. It started with a headache. I thought I had migraine, then the fever, and then I've decided to come to the hospital to do the exams and confirm the virus. Dengue causes fever and pain. It can be lethal. Most worrying, there is no cure for it. Patients should hydrate and can take painkillers, but must wait to write out the symptoms.",

Well it's no secret the British royal family and the tabloid media have had a toxic history together, but when it comes to the Princess of Wales and her health, the tabloids seem tame compared to social media where the most scandalous rumors and conspiracies can run amok like never before. Our royal correspondent Max Foster reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Since Princess Catherine's announcement of her cancer diagnosis and even in the run- up, there's been a markedly restrained response from the British newspapers. By and large, sticking to the facts, careful not to speculate, lots of sympathy for Kate and her young family. It's a departure from a past when the tabloids were accused of deep invasions of privacy, illegal tactics and complete insensitivity. It's been a different story on parts of social media which filled a vacuum of information with rumor and lies. The palace found itself unable to control the narrative and it twisted out of control. For three months, all Kensington Palace would confirm was that the princess had abdominal surgery, then recovered well and wouldn't be appearing again before Easter. On social media, content creators filled the void, racking up millions of views and followers. No matter how wild and grotesque their claims were, they were cashing in. When Kate finally came out and explained, they suddenly went quiet.",
