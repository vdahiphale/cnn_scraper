      "sentences": "Breaking news, a deal gets the green light after six hours of cabinet deliberations. But how soon could hostages be freed from Hamas' captivity? That's tonight on Newsnight.Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. An outline gets approved and restores hope for 50 families. Tonight, a significant majority of Israel's cabinet has said yes to a deal that trades Israeli hostages during Hamas' savage terror attacks on October 7th. In exchange, Israel will green light a four-day pause in the fighting in Gaza. Now, a senior U.S. official is telling CNN in the last hour that three Americans could be part of this deal. The message from the Israeli government also gives Hamas an incentive to release even more hostages. For every ten abducted Israelis or people in captivity that get their freedom, that translates to another full day of stoppage of fighting in Gaza. Now, Hamas, minutes ago, confirmed this deal, and they said that 150 or so Palestinians held in Israeli jails will be released as part of this agreement. Let's get straight to Matthew Chance. He's in Tel Aviv for us. Matthew, when do we anticipate that we will see the first of these hostages returning to Israel?",

And so we're looking at sort of Thursday local time, about 24 hours or so from now, that we're expecting to see the first hostages released under this deal. Although, of course, remember, no real timeframe has been given, and so it's slightly speculative to give an exact time about when this is going to actually take place.",

There's the war cabinet, the security cabinet, and then it came to the full cabinet where the entire ministers and governments are sitting there. The entire back and forth was based in understanding that what we're going to be giving in return is also an ability for Hamas to regroup, rearm and recharge what they have and then come back at us at Israeli forces that are there. So, the entire deal is a complicated deal, but we want to make sure that our hostages are back home.

I think what the president personally weighed in made the difference that actually brought more hostages to be freed, hopefully also American citizens, including the three-year-old Abigail that will be released.

And, yes, we were quite strengthened by that meeting. We've also had other meetings, not with Prime Minister Netanyahu, but with the rest of the cabinet through these days, where, again, they tried to reassure us that they are doing all that they can do to get the hostages back, especially at times when it seemed like maybe they weren't. There were many of -- you know, a lot of questions regarding previous deals that did go through, that didn't go through. And this has been a very hard process, and it required a lot of faith and a lot of pressure on our end and pressure on the American end, which, as we've mentioned, was crucial in this regard.

It is 6:31 in the morning -- Wednesday morning here now. It is 5:31 Israeli time. So, within the next 24 hours from now, this announcement from Qatar suggests that a pause will be announced. We will get the timing on that pause. And that is crucial, of course, because of course, at the next stage we'll be actually seeing evidence that those hostages have been released. We are talking upwards of 30 children at this stage as far as we can tell from multiple sources and 12 mothers and another 8 women on the Israeli side. Those are the women and children who will be released from Hamas captivity and in exchange there will be the release of the Palestinians, 150 Palestinians. And this pause will be four days and it will be extended sort of on a rolling basis if Hamas continues to release hostages.

And then down here about south for Wadi Gaza, all the civilians have kind of moved southbound. The Israelis have given up the element of surprise because they don't really need it at this point. They have an overwhelming military advantage, so I don't think that the four or five-day pause will have a significant impact on military operations overall. There will be an opportunity to reset a little bit for Hamas, but Israel will still maintain the advantage in the long run.",

We're talking nearly four times that, you know, going in for right now.So, I think the first couple of days as they work out the mechanics of this will definitely be interesting. And I think if they can't get it through one gate, they're going to have to abide by the terms of the agreements. They may have to look at potentially a second opening.

The problem is, once each of those candidates were stamped that way as the candidate of evangelicals, they had enormous trouble reaching out beyond that community in other states. They all immediately crashed in New Hampshire. None of them even reached 12 percent of the vote. None of them ended up winning even a dozen states. And right now, Ron DeSantis, even if he does well in Iowa, is facing that same risk. You look at the polling, he's in single digits in New Hampshire and Nikki Haley does seem to be in position.
