Those are the markets and these are the main events of the day. The prime minister of Slovakia is fighting for his life. After a brazen assassination attempt in broad daylight. You see the pictures here. US inflation is slowing and it is renewing hopes of an interest rate cut, and tonight, Scania's CEO is with me. We are talking electrification competition from China, tariffs, you name it. Well, that's me driving one of their trucks. We will talk about what's next. Live from New York on Wednesday, May the 15th. Middle of the month. I'm Richard Quest, I mean business. Good evening. I begin with shocking news from Slovakia where officials say the Prime Minister Robert Fico is fighting for his life after an assassination attempt. Watch this video. It shows him being rushed to the car. He had just been shot multiple times, five times, we believe. The prime minister have been in a government meeting in the central town of Handlova. The prime minister was airlifted to a major trauma center in the central parts of the country. An official is calling the attack politically motivated assassination attempt. Slovakia's president says the suspected gunman has been arrested. Nic Robertson has been following the story from London. What do we know?",

That's what we were told by the interior minister and defense minister who gave that brief press conference about an hour and a half ago. By then, the prime minister have been in surgery for about 3.5 hours. They said he was still in surgery fighting for his life and that has been the narrative since he was shot early in the afternoon. This is a prime minister who is very divisive within his own country. He is anti-immigration, anti-Muslim anti-LGBTQ, but pro-Russia, pro-Putin, an outlier politically in Europe, divisive as I say, at home. And I think it is very telling that the two ministers that came out to talk to the press outside the hospital where the defense minister and the interior minister, and they were appealing for calm and appealing for people to avoid hatred and inflaming the situation on social media and in the media. So I think that gives you that sense that the shooting of the prime minister and the outcome unknown is something they fear could trigger potential outbreaks of a violent reaction.",

That's what we got today.What the Fed looks at is the Personal Consumer Expenditure Index, the PCE, and that puts far less emphasis on housing, which is the thing that has been so stubborn in these numbers. Remember, if you're looking at the CPI and forgive me for getting wonky, around 70 percent of this number is fuel and it is housing. If you take less emphasis or take the emphasis off housing and look at the PCE, then it is far lower. It has got a two handles rather than three handles. So I think if we were just looking at this CPI, we wouldn't be having the conversation about cutting interest rates anyway at this stage.

So if inflation falls to two percent, as they expect by the end of 2025, early '26, then rates could get down into the low threes.

But the reason that the Biden campaign decided to jump on this and essentially one-up Donald Trump and call him on his demands to debate IS that they want American voters to see this contrast, the side-by-side contrast early, because the race has been remarkably stable and that has not benefited President Biden. So they want to shake it up a bit. The question is, can President Biden show that he is fit for office? That is his burden and that is his challenge. If he shows up as the president that we saw on the night of the State of the Union, perhaps, he can. If he looks different, perhaps so there will be more questions.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Touching down in Haiti's gang-controlled capital, we move quickly. Armed guards holding the perimeter as a long line of anxious passengers hurry out the way we came in. Driving deeper into Port-au-Prince, we pass those desperately trying to survive a crippling humanitarian crisis. CULVER (on camera): Can you give us a sense how dire the situation is getting with each passing day? JEAN-MARTIN BAUER, COUNTRY DIRECTOR, WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME: Look, we are very worried. Right now, you've got five million people in Haiti who are acutely food insecure. That's the highest on record, the highest it has ever been, and we are going through the worst crisis in Haiti since the 2010 earthquake. It is that simple. CULVER (voice over): The WFP warns food supplies across the country are rapidly dwindling as hunger worsens. CULVER (on camera): For folks who are getting this -- BAUER: Yes.",

Konrad Borusiewicz is a reporter with CNN sister network TVN in Poland. He's in the town where he is at the moment. Konrad, I'm grateful for you taking time quickly to talk to us. You're outside the hospital. Do we have any more details about the prime minister's condition? KONRAD BORUSIEWICZ, REPORTER, TVN24: I'm afraid there's a big lack of details regarding that case, but we had an official conference here with interior minister who said that Prime Minister Fico's conditions are really serious. The wounds he has are life-threatening and there's an ongoing effort and the surgeons are right now working to save his life. But regarding next information, we know that for today that's it, so we will have to wait for another information after what happened in Handlova. We're in Banska Bystrica where he was airlifted, that's, I don't know, 50 kilometers from Handlova. The doctors decided that this is the best place to take care and -- with Mr. Fico.",

It's good -- you made a good recovery having been with me in a truck, so it's good to see you, sir. And look, before we get to your plans and because you've got a factory in China that you're building. You're not huge in EV trucks yet, but that's obviously the way it's going.

And we do that because we need to be competitive also there, and I think we should take the Chinese also in our industry seriously. But I do not think the solution to having competitive Chinese competitors is to introduce tariffs or trade barriers. I think we need level playing field and then we need to play.

One is that the business case is very difficult for them to handle and that needs to be handled on through price on carbon incentives, tax breaks, whatever.
