And I mean, before what took place this past weekend, obviously that may have scrambled the calculus a little bit with Iran's attack on Israel. I mean, there are a lot of members of the Democratic caucus who are uncomfortable with sending more aid to Israel considering what's going on in Gaza. What do you think?",

More than 30,000 civilians, half of which are children, have been killed. That is just not acceptable.Now, going forward, what are we going -- how do we deal with this? Clearly, Israel was attacked directly by Iran. That does change the calculus. The second piece of it is that the Biden administration remains and has the power to deal with the flow of aid to Israel, and it can modify, change, withhold certain elements of the support that is in the legislation. Given that situation, both the attack directly by Iran, and the ability of the Biden administration to yes or no individual pieces of the aid, I will be voting for that. Also, please keep in mind that the humanitarian aid is coupled with the support for Israel. So, if we, as I do, want to have humanitarian aid, not just for Gaza, but for the rest of the issues around the world, then we're faced with a yes or a no because it is tied together with the aid for Israel. So, yes, I will be voting for that part of the package.",

We've got Kristen Holmes with us first of all. We know that there were originally 96 jurors who were brought into the courtroom today. Some were very surprised to walk in and find Donald Trump sitting there. Maybe some thought this had been resolved in some other way or they weren't a part of that pool.

We even heard from jurors previously once they had talked after they had left the courtroom, after they had been dismissed, saying essentially, it was surprising to see such a person of power, someone you see on TV in the courtroom.So, of course, there is a question of whether or not when the former president turns around and looks at you, how does that make you feel as a potential juror? Now, where we stand now is of that 96, there are about 39 left. Half, 48 of 96, left and said they could not be fair or impartial. Another nine --",

They didn't think that they could participate in the jury.So, now we're going to see the judge go through these questionnaires and actually get down to whether or not these would be the actual jurors. COATES: I mean, it must be a very surreal experience for a number of these jurors to walk in. Thinking you have jury duty, it comes out, you know, a couple weeks in advance. You know, you're going to be summoned and define this very consequential and historic matter. And then, of course, you realize earlier this morning, there was a juror who called in, had already been empaneled, already been set as one of the seven jurors and said she can no longer do this. Does not think that she can actually be impartial in the end, felt that maybe her anonymity had been compromised in some shape or form. But then you have the original number from the judge, six alternate jurors. Now, if we know that one juror has already been excused based on saying that she can no longer be anonymous, they might have to widen that pool of potential alternates in addition to the 12.",

Clearly, these world leaders are really focused on what we are all focused on, this aggression between Iran and Israel right now and trying to do everything they can to tamp down what is this growing escalatory situation there.But we did hear from the top E.U. official who's at the table saying that the Middle East is on the edge of war. So clearly, they are concerned. The E.U. also saying that they are going to be drumming up new Iran sanctions to go after Iranian drones. And meanwhile, here in the United States, President Biden rolled out new Iran sanctions today. The administration had said that these were coming and they go after two significant factors of Iran's capability, both their metal sector and also their drone capabilities. One of the specific sanctions that were rolled out today are individuals who are involved in the manufacturing of engines in the drones that were used in that attack over the weekend from Iran to Israel. Also, individuals who are involved in the servicing of those drones. So, clearly, they're trying to make a statement here that they're going to go after Iran's capabilities that were used. And according to President Biden make sure that Iran is held accountable for that attack. But we'll watch to see what more comes out of the G7 today because as I said those sessions were just concluding earlier in the day and there may be more to learn as these world leaders, foreign ministers, gather while this is happening. ACOSTA: And, Kylie, the U.S. has put new sanctions in place on Iran. Can you tell us what that means?",

What it means is that the Biden administration wants to make it clear to Israel that they're not just going to watch what happened, even though they're telling Israel that they wanted to show restraint. They don't want it to further escalate things by responding to this dramatic attack over the weekend in a really aggressive way. They're not sitting on their hands.So, the fact that the Biden administration ruled out these sanctions is a demonstration that they think that there are ways to target Iran's military capabilities that enabled them to carry out that attack. I think they're questioned as to how effective sanctions sometimes are. But the Biden administration is really being very specific with these sanctions. As I said, you know, going after those who were involved in building the engines for those drones that were used over the weekend.",

We saw it in 2016 where, again, with Jill Stein, it doesn't take much to just pull away, you know, percentages, right, particularly these days as our campaigns are one on small percentages. So, chipping away a few percentage points in the right number of states can completely shift the election. And I remember people saying, well, I wanted to show the party, you know, show them a lesson. OK. We voted for Jill Stein and look what we got.",
