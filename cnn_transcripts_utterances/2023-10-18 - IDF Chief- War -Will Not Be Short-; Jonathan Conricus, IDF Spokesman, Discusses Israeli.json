General (sic) Conricus, appreciate it -- Colonel Conricus, appreciate you being with us. A U.N. spokesman is declining to acknowledge Israel's demand that the U.N. chief declare Palestinian terrorist organizations responsible for the Gaza hospital blast. I'm wondering what your reaction to that is. LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF SPOKESMAN: I think the whole fake story by Hamas is sad and dangerous. I think how it was reported and amplified in much, not all, but much of international and Arabic media is very dangerous and reckless. We've seen the consequences of it. It could have gotten much worse had we not gotten evidence out to debunk it. I think now is the time for moral clarity for organizations that claim to be humanitarian and claim to be on the good side, to be on the good side, and stop providing diplomatic and international cover for Hamas and their atrocities.",

I assume the U.S., having satellite capabilities as well, had similarrocket trajectories, which I assume led to their conclusion that Israel is right in their assessment of who is responsible for this. If that is the case, it is a sign just of how extremely irresponsible and dangerous the firing of rockets is from any civilian population. I've been in Gaza City and seen rockets fired near locations from where I was. They're fired from buildings in residential areas.",

They get there -- the rockets are brought there by a tunnel system under the civilian areas. Once they're fired, of course, that area is exposed to threat because we'll try to retaliate so they won't be able to fire again. That puts civilians at risk. That's typical Hamas operations. It is extremely regrettable that they choose these tactics to constantly put at risk their own civilians, the Palestinians who live there, in order to fight against us. And it is, of course, in contradiction to international law. You're supposed to have your weapons away from civilians and fight military only. We, the military, are a legitimate target. Our civilians are not. They're constantly threatened. The last air raid siren was maybe an hour ago in Tel Aviv, where I am. And there have been rockets fired at southern Israel a few times today already. And it's just the reality. Again, when people ask themselves and when pictures of the unfortunate situation in Gaza are shown, the disruption, et cetera, that needs to be explained. That's part of the context. When we fight an enemy heavily embedded in urban terrain and uses civilian houses to fire rockets from, that's where we have to retaliate. It's an unfortunate situation. In so much reporting, that piece of context is missing.",

So what we're seeing here is this is where Hamas is getting all of their messaging out, their propaganda out. And this is also the same platform that ISIS used about a decade ago. You mentioned the Russian entrepreneur, who founded this company. He is very committed to, quote, unquote, \"free speech.\" He did, in the past, however, take some action against ISIS. So there is pressure mounting that he might take action against Hamas here. I will just say, however, that despite its being on this platform, in terms of families, who have hostages -- who have loved ones who are being held hostage and things like that, that is where we're getting the videos about the hostages.
