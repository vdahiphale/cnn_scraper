Just ahead, Ukraine says they shot down 11 attack drones launched by Russia as two die in a strike in a city over 200 miles from Kyiv.Also ahead, the new U.S. support says COVID-19 most likely came from a lab leak, more on what they found. And shocking details emerged about how Model and Influencer Abby Choi was killed. Her Ex-husband, and member of the family are charged, details just ahead. Russia's relentless assault on Eastern Ukraine has shown no signs of slowing. Ukraine reports heavy shelling in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions while Russians troops edged towards the City of Bakhmut from three sides. This video posted on social media shows some of the damage left by a Russian shelling. Ukraine says troops are launching counterattacks to retain access in the city to the west both Russia and Ukraine - both Russia and Ukraine claim high numbers of casualties there. And we are just learning about Russian drone attack that killed two rescue workers that happened in the City Southwest of Kyiv. Ukrainian officials say workers responding to an earlier attack when they were hit. Let's bring in our Alex Marquardt form Dobropillia in Ukraine. Thank you so much for joining us. So what details about these drone attack you were just been hearing about?",

Most of them shot down by air defenses, but this really highlights the fact that as so much of the fighting is taking place on the ground in Eastern Ukraine. All of these cities where people are living a relatively normal life these cities continue to be targeted people live in fear of their cities being targeted. Also highlights the major concern about the visit by President Biden a week ago to the Ukrainian Capital. We're also hearing more from Biden Officials, Max, about what China may have planned in terms of their support for Russia in this war with Ukraine top U.S. Officials warning that China is actively considering sending weapons lethal aid they call it to the Russian side. They say that they have not yet made a decision in the past U.S. Officials have warned China about non-lethal aid that was being sent to Russia but that this is something according to the director of the CIA Bill Burns, among others, that is actively being considered at the highest levels of the Chinese government. Director Burns saying that so far, no decision has been made, but that they are confident that China is considering sending weaponry to Russia, which would be a significant boost for the Russian side since they have not been doing very well here in Ukraine, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations calling that a red line, Max.",

      "sentences": "Exactly right, Max. So essentially, what happened here is the Intelligence Community provided an update to Congress about kind of where they are in their investigation into COVID-19 origins. And in that larger update, there was a section that said the Department of Energy had recently concluded with low confidence that COVID-19 had originated in that lab in Wuhan.Now, it is important to note as you did that this is a low confidence assessment, meaning that they did not have enough intelligence or that it was too fragmented, or the sources were just not solid enough to come to a more definitive conclusion about this. But it is notable, because of course, it adds to the division within the intelligence community about where this pandemic actually started. The IC still does not have a good explanation for that. And that is primarily according to the intelligence community, which released a report on this in 2021, because China has not been fully cooperative, right with the International investigations into the origins of the pandemic. And the U.S. can only go so far in examining the pandemic from afar. And so the Department of Energy has been very instrumental in this investigation because they have these supercomputers that other agencies do not have that can kind of pour over reams of genetic data, and tried to get an explanation for the origins that way. But ultimately, according to Intelligence Officials, it is going to be very difficult to conclusively say whether this started in the lab, or whether it started with an animal, for example, in that seafood market in Wuhan, without of course, China's cooperation and being able to be there on the ground and assess this. And we should note that China has of course, kind of scrubbed the scene of the pandemics origins believed to be pandemics origins since that pandemic began, and so it is going to be very difficult one way or another to come to a definitive explanation on this, Max.",

The Israeli military says it is boosting its forces in the West Bank it comes a day after two Israeli settlers were shot and killed in the West Bank. Israel Officials call a terrorist attack.

The events in the occupied West Bank yesterday clearly show the situation has essentially reached a crisis point because the violence that we're seeing between Israelis and Palestinians, some experts say that we haven't seen in something like 20 years. As you noted yesterday, mid-morning to Israeli brothers who are around 19, 21 years old they were shot and killed. What Officials say was point blank range while they sat in traffic on a route that's often a flashpoint because it's a road that passes through Palestinian towns that often Israeli settlers use as well. That attacker managed to flee then in the night hours, we saw Israeli settlers essentially rampaging through Palestinian towns, setting homes and cars on fire. I can't recall a time where we saw this many settlers essentially running wild through these Palestinian towns. And we know that at least one man was fatally shot and killed know of at least two other injuries. Israeli Officials telling me at least 8 people potentially 10 have been detained in connection to these sorts of attacks. But there is a huge amount of tension that there already has been quite a bit of tension, there's been quite a bit of violence. Already this year, more than 60 Palestinian militants and civilians killed. 13 Israeli, 12 Israeli civilians and one Israeli Security Officer killed already this year, not even at the end of February to give you a sense of what's happening. Now after the events yesterday in the West Bank, the Israeli Military saying that they are sending in extra battalions to reinforce security in the West Bank. They say it's not only to try and catch this attacker that shot the two Israeli settlers, but also to try to keep the common keep these two sides, Israeli settlers and Palestinian residents apart in the West Bank, because that's what's really concerning to Israeli Officials is the sort of potential violence between individuals in the West Bank. On top of what they're already seeing between Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians between these Israeli Military raids. That have been some of the biggest raids that we have seen in some time. So while everyone is looking at Akobo what happened in Jordan between all these Security Officials, you know, good statements coming out of there about trying to restore calm on the ground. There's no calm at all, Max.",

We should be huge 7, 8000 polling stations. That seems like a lot, but keep in mind that Nigeria had about 176,000 polling stations.

As part of the U.K. is complicated exit agreement with the European Union is meant to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU.

That's perhaps going to be the easier part of though it's been months in the making. And there really seems to have been a coming together of minds between him, his government and the European Union.And then perhaps the trickier part is convincing the pro-British Unionists in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party as a biggest party there, that this deal and shows the seven tests that they are that Northern Ireland is being recognized as part of the United Kingdom, part of the Brexit deal. And where this problem grew was because of the need to keep an open border on Ireland between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, Republic of Ireland and the European Union, Northern Ireland, part of the U.K., which ended up being there'll be customs checks down the Irish sees. So the University the pro-British supporters in Northern Ireland felt that they were going to be more distant and not as respected and not as a mainstream part of the U.K. And that's Rishi Sunak's difficulty here. Has he answered their questions? And he may have answered some of them. But they drive a very hard bargain at the DUP. And perhaps their ultimate red line, as we understand it. Now that could change later today is that they don't want the European Court of Justice, the top legal body in Europe to have any set of their laws in Northern Ireland. Now, how has that been fixed in the language of a many, many page, thick legal document? We don't know but of course, we don't know it because it's not been made public.
