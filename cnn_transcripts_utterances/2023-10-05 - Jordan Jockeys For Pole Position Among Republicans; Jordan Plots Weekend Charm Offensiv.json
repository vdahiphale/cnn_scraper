As the Republicans, he says, he can unite, give the country drama and shade worthy of a Bravo reality TV show.Believe it or not, Joe Biden is building that wall. The president cites a migrant emergency to bypass the 26 laws and funnel federal money to break ground on new physical border barriers. Plus, no new car, no caviar, no four-star daydream for Ron DeSantis. The 2024 candidate faces a cash crunch and the very real possibility that he could run out of money before the Iowa caucuses. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We begin this hour with a question. Is being first enough? Today Jim Jordan is making it impossible to miss what job he wants next and that is House speaker. The Ohio congressman visited Fox his morning show to deliver the message to his colleagues and to the 2024 frontrunner. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): I disagree with, you know, what took place, but those guys are friends of mine. And, you know, I think that's the message I've been talking to my colleagues about is, who can bring the eight into the, you know, part of the team who can unite our team. I think I can do that. If I didn't think I could do that, I wouldn't run. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The personal insults are being slung mostly at the direction of Congressman Matt Gaetz, who was the ringleader of this effort.But also, on the seven other Republicans who joined Matt Gaetz and threads that perhaps their fundraising could dry up, but they get kicked out of off their committee assignments, maybe even expelled from the Republican conference. All that saber rattling coming, because the emotions are just so raw at the moment, which is leads to the question about whether the next speaker can actually bridge the divide within this conference after we saw that unprecedented vote to remove Speaker McCarthy from his position. Now, Gaetz is the one who has been taking a lot of this incoming fire from a lot of Republicans all across the ideological spectrum, some of the more conservative members and some of the more moderate members. But also, some that are aligned with Donald Trump contending that Gaetz actually broke from what Donald Trump's wishes, and they believe that it should be some retribution. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MAX MILLER (R-OH): Mr. Gaetz is only doing this for himself, and I believe that he should be looked at for an expulsion. This guy doesn't have his ducks in a row. And that's what you see with people who lie. They can never keep their story straight. And that's what Matt is doing right now. He's going to continue to lie. As he bragged about how he would crush ED medicine and chase it with an energy drink, so he could go all night. This is obviously before he got married. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I asked Gaetz's office about that he said in his statement, that he only had spoken 20 words on the House floor with Markwayne Mullin calling it a lie. And he went on to say that Mullin is coping with the depth of the political career of his friend Kevin, thoughts and prayers, so dismissing that.So, the question here, Dana, is can -- either Scalise or Jordan win over those eight holdouts, but also not alienate the many more moderate members of the conference were furious at those folks on the right or will a third candidate or maybe fourth candidate emerge. All major questions ahead of next week where the House is expected to have its first vote. So, the Republican conference to nominate their candidate for speaker before the full House votes, and that's where things will also be incredibly tricky. Getting the 218 votes. Any five members on the Republican side can scuttle that effort. That's what happened to Kevin McCarthy, cannot happen again, major questions at this moment. Dana? [12:05:00] BASH: And before I let you go, which is why the Speaker pro temp Patrick McHenry wanted to give some time and wants to have a meeting and he calls it a forum. Before they go to the floor to work it all out, so we don't have a 15-round situation on Capitol Hill again on the House floor again. All right, Manu, please come back to us if anybody emerges from any of those offices in that hallway. Thank you so much for that reporting. Here with me to share their reporting and their insights Tia Mitchell of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, CNN's Jeff Zeleny, and POLITICO's s Heidi Przybyla. Thank you so much, one and all for being here. You know, Jeff, I want to start with you because you cover the campaign trail, you've covered the White House and you have covered Capitol Hill.

I remember in the speaker fights when John Boehner took his leave and announces the day after the Pope was on Capitol Hill. That was such a moment. And a lot of people sort of disliked John Boehner, but there wasn't personal hatred toward him. Same as Paul Ryan.I wasn't around during the Newt Gingrich era, but my reporting from the time is that no, that wasn't there and Newt Gingrich speaking of him. He had an op-ed in The Washington Post this week saying, expel Matt Gaetz. So no, I have not seen this. But I do think we've never seen this moment in politics. This is sort of par for the course, in the Trump era. And you mentioned the White House in the campaign. It's all interlinked here. I mean, so we -- it's fueled by just a new of vitriol in our politics. But one thing I was talking with a Republican member, who said there's actually some support coming from an unlikely place, perhaps for Jim Jordan, because there are some people who would like to get him out of the committee chairmanship. Darrell Issa being the first example that he wants to be chair. So that's just an example of there, are so many inter sort of interwoven dynamics here of what is going to play out. But you're right, that's why Patrick McHenry wanted to take a pause. Their hope is to get a vote the first time. That's a tall order, I think, to get a House floor vote on the first vote.",

He has a place on Capitol Hill, but actually talking to Matt Gaetz, talking to Nancy Mace, having them on his radio show, and they invited the New York Times photographer in. As everything was brewing when they pushed out Kevin McCarthy with this vote, what does that tell you about the dynamics here? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION: So, it tells me kind of what you mentioned that the dynamics of the party have moved towards chaos, and we've talked about Donald Trump kind of being an X factor. He didn't quite say, he was in favor of keeping McCarthy or in favor of removing McCarthy. But Trumpism has been aligned with chaos. We did see President Trump saying, he was in favor of shutting down the government. We did see President Trump encouraging members to reject negotiating with Democrats. And again, that's kind of one of the catalysts for Kevin McCarthy's removal. So, to me what we see from Bannon again, we -- it's like an agent of an aspect of where the Republican Party is. And again, it's not necessarily about policy, or values, but it's about kind of the warzone of it all.",
