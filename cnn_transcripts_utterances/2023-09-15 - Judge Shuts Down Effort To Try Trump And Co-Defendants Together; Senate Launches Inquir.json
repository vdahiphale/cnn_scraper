You have to think about all of the suppliers that are also working with these auto companies who could be affected.But this also has broader political implications for President Biden. Of course, he has described himself as the most pro-union president in history. One of his priorities is trying to boost competitive wages and competitive conditions for union workers across the board. But at the same time, he is also balancing this desire to transition to a clean energy future. And that is at the heart of some of these negotiations as these autoworkers, the unions, and the auto companies are dealing with the transition to electric vehicles. But in a few hours -- they haven't given us an exact time -- we are expecting to hear from President Biden about these latest negotiations as the UAW has now gone on strike.",

It was dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor. And it found some of the accused had moved into top roles of the Coast Guard and other military branches, or retired with full pensions and benefits. Now, victims were discouraged from pursuing the allegations and still had to go to class and work with the people -- the person who allegedly assaulted them. Some victims ended up dropping out of the Academy. But the assaults and the investigation -- they were never reported to Congress or made public until CNN started asking questions. And now, the Senate wants answers. In a letter sent to the head of the Coast Guard, Sen. Richard Blumenthal cited CNN's reporting and said, \"...the leaders who oversaw or perhaps created the environment where misconduct occurred and did nothing must be held accountable.\" And, \"The public deserves to know why so many reported cases of sexual assault and harassment were allowed to go uninvestigated for so many years.\" Senator Blumenthal told us this was the most shameful incident of a cover-up of sexual assault that he's ever seen in the U.S. military. And the letter is also asking for a long list of documents from the Coast Guard, including information on every sexual assault at the Academy from 2006 to present -- Phil.",
