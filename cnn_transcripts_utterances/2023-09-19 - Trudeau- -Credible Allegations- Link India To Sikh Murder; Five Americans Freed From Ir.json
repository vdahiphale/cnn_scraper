Royal Canadian Mounted Police say Nijjar suffered multiple gunshot wounds while sitting in a vehicle outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia. Homicide investigators say two mass suspects described as heavier set males fled on foot and then possibly in this 2008 silver Toyota Camry. In the earliest days after the homicide, protesters demanded justice, saying the killing was politically motivated and chilling retribution for Nijjar's activism and support for sick independence in India. At the time, RCMP would not comment on a possible motive. But now Canadian officials are speaking loud and clear about their suspicions.",

And for its prime minister to stand up in Parliament and make such a serious accusation against the Indian government and its agents is very rare.Not only that, you also have the government coming out and publicly taking the name of the Indian diplomat who has been expelled again, very rare. This, without any doubt, is going to snowball into a massive diplomatic crisis between the two countries and indications of this for those who could read between the lines was a handshake between the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau, when he was in Delhi about 10 days back for the G20 Summit. Now, India's response has been very prompt and has been very strong. I'm going to read an excerpt from the statement that was issued about two hours back from India's External Affairs Ministry and it reads such unsubstantiated allegations seek to shift the focus from Khalistani terrorists and extremists who have been proved shelter, provided shelter rather in Canada and continue to threaten India sovereignty and territorial integrity, a very strong statement coming out from the Indian government there. And according to them, this is not the first time that they've raised this concern of anti-India activities by extremists in Canada who they call a part of the Khalistani movement. The Khalistani movement, remember, is a movement that has been on for decades demanding a separate state for Sikhs. And this has been condemned by India. This movement had been outlawed by India some time back. And the person that we're talking about, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was gunned down in June this year outside a Sikh temple in Canada is seen as a terrorist by India, what the Canada government calls is a citizen of Canada, Hardeep Singh Nijjar for the Indian government is a terrorist. And he was declared a terrorist in the year 2020. And the allegations he faces is that he has been or rather had been sending money to India, through which people were targeted in India and killed. And also there was extreme radicalization of the youth taking place in some states in India because of this leader. Now in the days to come, there is going to be outrage and uproar inside Parliament and outside Parliament here in New Delhi. A special session of Parliament is on this week, and we're going to see a lot of reactions coming out. But we'll have to see how this plays out between the two leaders, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart in Canada. Back to you.",

Many of them posted this statement to their social media accounts, stating that they had not agreed to come back to the team.Previously, they had asked not to be played until real structural changes had been made within the organization. In the statement they said, quote, \"We will study the possible legal consequences to which our federation -- that's the Spanish Federation -- has exposed us by putting us on the list which we had asked not to be called on due to reasons which we had already explained publicly to take the best decision for our future and for our health. We regret, once again, that our federation places us in a situation which we never would've desired. This would be a truly remarkable situation for any team. Not least the newly crowned world champions. The federation has publicly acknowledged the need for reform. And yet, it seems, the players feel as though they are being forced back into the national team. It's a reminder of the challenges so many women face in sport and in the workplace. But these players are clearly determined to fight for a better future. Back to you. (EVND VIDEOTAPE)",

Faces covered, as Wagner protocol dictates, they are unapproachable and untouchable. These are the first images of Wagner fighters in the country since Prigozhin's death. So they're clearly still very much a presence here in Bangui. That presence runs deep. The markets are full of cheap sachets of vodka and beer, made by a Wagner-owned company. The locals seem to like it. They say they don't drink beer, only Russian beer. We've come back to the center of Prigozhin's empire in Africa, right as his death raises questions for the regimes he protected and the mercenaries whose loyalty he inspired. Our last visit was in Wagner's early days here. Run like the Mafia, providing guns and fighters, and propaganda, in return for gold, diamonds and timber, using intimidation and brutality along the way. That car full of Russians have been following us for quite some time. We don't know why. We don't know what they want. But in this lawless, war-scarred country, one of the poorest in the world, that ruthlessness and the security it brought, is celebrated by many.",

And that is connected to the judicial overhaul that Netanyahu's government is trying to push through back here in Israel. Elon Musk even mentioning the protesters that had lined the streets getting up to the Tesla factory, protesting against Benjamin Netanyahu's presence there and against the overhaul. In essence, Netanyahu responded by saying he was trying to rebalance the branches of government and promising that there would be some sort of consensus middle ground found. And saying that Israel will remain a democracy, even saying that Israel will become an even stronger democracy after this overhaul has passed, that is. Obviously, something that the protesters here in Israel and the opposition parties here in Israel feel very strongly on the opposite end of. Hadas Gold, CNN -- Jerusalem. (EVND VIDEOTAPE)",
