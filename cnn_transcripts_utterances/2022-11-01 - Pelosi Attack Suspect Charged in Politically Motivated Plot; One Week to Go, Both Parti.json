LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Hey good to see you, Kaitlan, and congrats to you and the whole team on the launch this morning. Look, Florida is a state where Democrats and President Biden and his team believe that the contrast that they want to paint between Democrats and these so-called MAGA Republicans can really stick and resonate. Case in point, I spoke with Charlie Crist yesterday. He is, of course, running against Governor Ron DeSantis in the state. And he said, look, when President Biden comes down to Florida today, he really hopes and expects that he will go after DeSantis hard on the issue of abortion rights. He said that is going to be very, very helpful for me in my race, because it is a number one issue. Ron DeSantis, this goes to show, is sort of a poster child for Democrats when it comes to sort of trying to paint Republicans as having extremist policies. Now, you talk to any Biden adviser, and they will say, look, we are focused on the midterms, we are not thinking yet about 2024 in a serious way, but, yes, there is a universe wherein 2024 there is a Biden versus DeSantis race.
