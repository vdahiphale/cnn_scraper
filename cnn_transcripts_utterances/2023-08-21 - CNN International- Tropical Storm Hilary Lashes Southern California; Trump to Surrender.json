We're seeing the amount of rain falling pickup and we're also feeling the winds starting to increasing as well. And what we've noticed from the winds is that water is starting to hit and it's starting go down this street. And this is a major thoroughfare in and out of Palm Springs that will take you out to Interstate 10. And what I've been doing as I've been standing here, is watching that the water is rolling downhill and that is exactly why they have closed off this road. Because of the fact that this is a road that they know is prone to flooding and they don't want anyone on this road right now and into the evening as we see more effects of Hilary. But we are already starting to see mudslides. We are already starting to see some of this cascading earth, not a full on mudslide but happening off the side of some of the highways. And this is why they're asking people to stay home. Many of us getting alerts on our phones now since we are all based in Los Angeles. Telling us to beware of localized flooding within LA County as well. Overall though here in Palm Springs, they're asking people to just stay put unless they're trying to flee some water or some danger. Otherwise just stay put. In Los Angeles County, they say that they're prepared for this. They've already saved some vehicles that are high water vehicles in different parts of Southern California to help get people out if they need to. So, lots of preparations have been taken, and now it's a time that people just have to stay put and ride this storm out if they can. Because as you can see, Hilary is really starting to make her impact felt here. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

By 9, 10 in the morning, up until a couple of hours ago it's just been very consistent rain. We've had official reports saying over four inches within that time frame, with the unofficial reports we had over six inches. So this definitely has been hitting us hard. I was coming over from the East Coast and I landed at LAX at noon. And you could tell we arrived just when the airplane mode turned off on all of our cellphone, everybody lighted up with all those flash flood warnings.But overall, we've been doing OK as a city.

Governor Josh Green saying yesterday, 1,050 people remain unaccounted for. He said that many of them will never be recovered.So as we stand overlooking the town, we are seeing clouds of dust coming up from some of the heavy machinery. And it's so heartbreaking to realize that dust holds people's children, and parents, and neighbors, and loved ones. And how do you get a sense of closure in this particular space? This will be a sacred space for so many for so long. 3 1/2 square miles of area burned. The president is expected to fly over Lahaina. It's uncertain whether he'll actually touch down on the ground. He's expected to meet with first responders and victims of this disaster. He of course is known as the empathizer in chief, given the tragedy in his personal life. But he uncharacteristically gave a no comment when asked about Hawaiians a few days ago. The White House insists he's been on the phone hourly almost, making sure that everybody gets the resources they need. But this is really an emotionally charged time of so many tender emotions right now. And so, the president is sort of walking into that. As for the future, so much of that depends on sort of ancient fights over water rights in particular. So that's at the top of mind of people who say that the water that could have kept this place lush and fireproof was diverted to resorts and rich homeowners at the expense of local ones. That may come up during today's visit. But it certainly will be an issue going forward. Bill Weir, CNN, Maui. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Those conversations will continue into next week, specifically on the conditions of his appearance and also on the logistics of his surrender. Now we know officials, including the Fulton County Sheriff, Pat Labat, have insisted that Trump and the other co-defendants will be treated the same as everybody else, specifically with fingerprinting and mug shots. But likely that is impossible just due to the security precautions that must take place when it comes to transporting a former president of the United States and also the high profile nature of some of these other co defendants. So it's very likely that this booking process that would normally just take hours of waiting around, that will probably go much more swiftly for Trump and some of his co- defendants. It's also possible looking ahead to the arraignment, that first appearance in court, it's possible they might not even have to show up in court because the judge here can choose to do that arraignment virtually or allow them to wave that right to the arraignment.

And the problem for Meadows is the nature of the allegations here.Because in order for a case to be removed under federal law, it has to fall within the outer perimeter of Meadows' official duties, and the things he's accused of doing are not official duties. The president of the United States, certainly his chief of staff under the Constitution, have no role in counting the votes in Georgia or pressuring -- as they're accused of doing in the DA's indictment -- pressuring Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, after the vote had been counted, recounted and certified, to find just 11,780 votes. So that makes it tough on the removal standard. Then under the supremacy clause, the test is, did Meadows have a duty to do it? Did he do no more than was necessary and proper under that duty? And was it authorized? And the problem there again is, no real role for the feds and of course allegations of overturning the peaceful transfer of power. That's the opposite of what the law authorizes. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
