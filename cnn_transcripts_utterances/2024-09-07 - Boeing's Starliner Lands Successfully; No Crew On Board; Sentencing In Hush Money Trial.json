So, I wouldn't dare second guess the team. I'll add one thing that Miles O'Brien talked about a little bit earlier, but we have the benefit of remembering vividly, as we commemorate at the end of every January the loss of two spacecraft, three spacecraft, actually, with the account of Apollo 1, Challenger and Columbia, where we failed to communicate as we should. And I think this time, there was not exact agreement between Boeing and NASA on the shape of the vehicle or the condition of the vehicle. And so, in that case, the right thing to do is follow -- just take the safest course of action, which is what I think they did.",

So, that's the number one risk. And I think when the people in Houston and at Boeing were thinking about the decision to whether or not to bring the crew in, that was not a small risk. If the thrusters did not work correctly, and you got a faulty deorbit burn, then we probably would not have been able to safety -- safely get the crew back. I think most people felt very confident. I know Boeing felt confident that everything would work. They felt that they understood the problem. What we -- what I think they don't understand, of what I don't understand is the physics of a particular part of the thrusters, and that's -- I think it's a Teflon liner that didn't behave exactly the way that they thought they would. So, the thrusters behaved or performed, I think, perfectly based on the success of the reentry.",

But, speak to us about the importance of NASA having these commercial relationships with the likes of Boeing and SpaceX.BOLDEN JR.: Well, the guy who was there when the decision was made that we were going to do this, it is critically important that we have alternative providers, that you have back-ups. One of the big reasons is you want to be able to control the cost, and when you have multiple providers, you have alternatives, then you have competition and the cost stays down. You never want to find yourself with a sole provider. So, we need to get Boeing flying. We have another company called Sierra Space that I think some -- in the next few months should fly out their vehicle for cargo delivery, and it has a crew capability, but I think they're years away with that. So, we need an alternative provider. This was the point that we had most of our battles with Congress in getting funding for the Commercial Crew Program, when we went to them in 2010-2011, and they failed to fund the Commercial Crew Program and failed to do so for almost five years. And that's what really put the program behind. It was the failure to get full funding for the program so that we could get started in earnest.",

There were a lot of differences between the crew and the uncrewed mission, including, as Steve talked about, the differences in the departure sequence. Fantastic job executing that. After Starliner undocked from the harmony or node two forward port, it backed away and then executed a series of breakout burns. It went up over and behind ISS. The crew was watching it until it was out of view, but then they came back and they watched the reentry and the deorbit.

They did an excellent job. The proof is in getting the vehicle safely home today. I know we've got a lot of things that we learned on the mission.

I was going to ask both Boeing and NASA, but they -- I guess they didn't show up for some reason. But, anyway, it's been a decade since the CT -- CCtCap awards were given out. Had to go look up that acronym. I'd forgotten it. But, it was a big experiment in fixed price contracts and human spaceflight. And so, I'm just wondering, a decade later, literally, it has been a decade, after all this happened with Dragon, with Boeing, with the delays and now with this mission, just to get a sense of you from NASA, if -- is the experiment of success and kind of what is the future of human spaceflight with this commercial approach?",

We have commercial vehicles with cargo vehicles and the Dragon and the Northrop Grumman Cygnus. We have the Dream Chaser that's coming up next year. And so, is it slower than what we expected? Absolutely right. It is slower, but it's -- we're making progress. And to me, we are learning. Every time we have a mission, we learn something. That gets passed on. We're sharing things across the commercial world.You saw last year, I'll say Blue Origin had that parachute anomaly and the teams all got together and shared across the different companies what they learned. And to me, that's what this program is helping out. It's sharing the expertise of flying in space. And I'll let Steve and Dana add.",

We've laid out right now, manifest-wise, we have that flight booked next year in the second slot of the year. The first thing we'll do when we get the vehicle back is to continue to look at all the data, look at the thruster performance for this phase of flight in detail. And then we already have these teams that I've talked about established. They're going to start meeting weekly on looking at the design changes required and the helium system to eliminate the leaks.And then, can we fly the vehicle different? Can we change the thermal in the doghouses? What testing do we need at White Sands? It'll take a little time to lay that out and then get into the testing. And then, I think we'll see where we're at in another month or so, and then we'll have a little bit better idea of what the overall schedule will be.",

The third time now we've landed a capsule in the U.S. on land. The entry in particular has been darn near flawless. So, that -- I wouldn't say it surprised me, but as I step back and think about the mission, the entry itself was just -- and the orbit burn was spot on.",

I want to bring back Garrett Reisman, who is a former NASA Astronaut and a professor of Astronautical Engineering at the University of Southern California. Thanks for sticking around for us. So, part of the problem with this spacecraft when it tried to dock with the International Space Station back in June was, of course, the helium leak and the thrusters that malfunctioned.

But, there were some interesting things in there too that he got to kind of at the end there, which is that two of the thrusters of the 28 thrusters on the service module, two of them experienced high temperatures, higher than they would have liked to have seen. So, something still going on there. And -- but they still continued to function.But, they also have a separate thruster system on the capsule itself, and there are 12 of those thrusters of a completely different design, but one of them failed, and they have enough backups that it didn't affect the landing. But, I think there is just -- obviously, there is a series of problems here that NASA needs to look at carefully before they decide to put people on this vehicle yet again. We all hope that that day come soon, that we get people flying on Starliner. We all want that to happen. And I think if this would have gone differently tonight, that day would have been much further off if it wasn't successful. But, that doesn't mean that there is not more work to be done.",
