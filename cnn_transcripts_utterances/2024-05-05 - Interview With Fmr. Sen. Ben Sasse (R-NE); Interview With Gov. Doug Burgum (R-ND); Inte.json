      "sentences": "Hello. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is auditioning.Out of court for the weekend, Donald Trump was back in his element, fueling speculation over who he might choose to be his number two. Yesterday, at a donor retreat at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump called half-a- dozen vice presidential hopefuls up on stage and openly discussed whether one of them might join him on the ticket. In his remarks to top donors, Mr. Trump also continued to lie about the 2020 election. He vented about special counsel Jack Smith and the other lawyers prosecuting him, and he referred to his Democratic opponent Joe Biden as -- quote -- \"running a Gestapo administration\" -- unquote. He also said, according to \"The New York Times\" -- quote -- \"When you are a Democrat, you start off essentially at 40 percent, because you have civil service, you have the unions, and you have the welfare. And don't underestimate welfare. They get welfare to vote\" -- unquote. Quite a turnaround from, on Friday, when Trump was a criminal defendant, compelled to sit in a New York courtroom, fined by a judge for violating a gag order and forced to listen as a former top aide, Hope Hicks, his private reaction to that infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape released in October 2016. Joining me now is one of the vice presidential contenders on stage at Mar-a-Lago this weekend, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Governor Burgum, thank you so much for joining us. So, you were there with Donald Trump last night at Mar-a-Lago, where he claimed Biden was like the Gestapo, referring to the Nazi secret police. Are you comfortable with the presumptive Republican presidential nominee comparing the Biden administration to the Gestapo? GOV. DOUG BURGUM (R-ND):  Well, Jake, first, great to be with you. And I would say, yesterday, we had an opportunity to listen to the president talk for 90 minutes without a teleprompter, covering a wide range of topics, and largely very upbeat, because, if the election was held today, Trump would be winning. And relative to the reference you're discussing, I mean, this was a short comment deep into the thing that wasn't really central to what he was talking about. But I understand when -- and I think Americans understand, a majority of Americans feel like the trial that he's in right now is politically motivated. And if it was anybody else, this trial wouldn't even be happening. So I understand that he feels like that he's being unfairly treated. And I think that it's reasonable that someone who's being kept off the campaign trail as the presumptive nominee has got some frustration about that.",

I'm sure this network and others have done that. So that's not illegal. And then you have got a -- again, they're trying do this. And the only reason this trial is happening right now, it's the only one that could actually be brought forward. The other four couldn't be brought -- the other three of the four couldn't be brought forward before the election. So this one is largely intended to try to achieve a result before the election. And then you can be assured, as Americans would know, that any kind of appeal would be pushed until after the election. So that's why everybody sees this as politically motivated. And, like I said, a filing error is not something that would affect any American people that are trying to put food on the table and gas in the car. It doesn't affect them. And so this is why the outcome of this trial is not going to change a lot of people's minds. It might actually in some ways help President Trump because it reinforces the idea that the Biden administration is willing to use lawfare to try to attack a political opponent.",

I guess that's one interpretation. Another interpretation is that Donald Trump's attorney Michael Cohen paid hush money for -- to hide from the American people before the election the fact that Mr. Trump had had a rendezvous with a porn star and that they wanted to hide that from the American people until after the election. So far, the evidence that I have seen suggests there at least was some political motivation to this, and they hid it so as to hide that from the public. That's a little bit more than just checking the wrong box on a form. But let's move on, because I want to ask you about something else Mr. Trump said. \"The New York Times\" reported that, last night, Mr. Trump said that some Americans get -- quote -- \"welfare to vote.\" Is that how you see the electorate? You have, I think, more than 100,000 North Dakotans on Medicaid. Are they getting welfare to vote?",

You know, 2016, that was about immigration. Now it's about national security and public safety. And open borders is something the majority of Americans are very concerned about. Inflation touches every single American, the wars that are breaking out around the world. So, in places where President Trump had success, Joe Biden is having failure. Where President Trump was strong, Joe Biden has been weak. And so that's what people are actually thinking about. But then you throw on top of things like the student loan debt, and you start trying to give away hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money, and it's not even -- it's like we're borrowing to give it away. It's not tax and spend. It's borrow, borrow from the Chinese, and give it away. When you see those, those citizens understand those are like preelection payoffs. Those are like, hey, folks, please vote for us because we're -- we're relieving your debt. So at what point does it cross over, programs like student debt, to just vote-buying? And I think, again, the people that are working hard and are paying off their debts and aren't getting don't loan relief are saying, hey, this is just isn't fair. And, in America, people want things to be fair, not unfair. And I think it's clear that there's vote-buying going on at a scale like we have never seen before.",

He's refusing to commit to accepting the results of the 2024 election. He told \"The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\" -- quote -- \"If everything's honest, I will gladly accept the results. I don't change on that. If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country,\" echoing language he used on January 6. When \"TIME\" magazine asked him about potential violence if he loses, he said -- quote -- \"If we don't win, you know, it depends.\" Now, you called the violence on January 6 reprehensible and you said it does not represent American values. Donald Trump is openly discussing right now pardoning all of the January 6 criminals. I think that you heard a song from them last night at the fund-raiser. And those criminals, by the way, include those who have been convicted in an American court of violently attacking police. He's talking about pardoning them, and he seems to be leaving the door open to potential violence if he loses again. Based on comments you have made in the past, that must concern you.",

But it's not why I'm out supporting the president right now. As someone that runs a natural resource state, as a governor, I have had a chance to serve under President Trump as governor and under President Biden. And I can tell you, the difference is night and day for our citizens, for our small businesses, because, right now, we're under a barrage of red tape that's trying to basically shut down U.S. energy. We're a big energy state. And when we shut down U.S. energy, the supply gets filled by other suppliers around the world who produce it less cleanly than we do. So it's -- it drives inflation up. It destabilizes the world. It creates -- puts money in the pocket of Russian Iran and Venezuela are adversaries. And then it makes the environment less clean. And so his -- it's a trifecta of being in the wrong direction on Joe Biden's energy policies. And I understand that that's -- if we don't get that turned around, the U.S. is going to continue to be in decline relative to our position in the world. A strong energy policy is going to be good for the world's environment. And it's good for how we compete with China and Russia and all the challenges we have in front of us.",

And the states have actually taken him up on that. So you have seen in the state of Texas, you have seen in Oklahoma, you have seen in Florida incredible instances where women have -- lives have been threatened. That is Donald Trump's record. Joe Biden obviously has evolved over time, but, in the last eight years of his life and since his presidency, he has been very strong in his support of a very simple notion, that he trusts women to make decisions about their reproductive health.
