If you've been with anyone known anyone that's in the throes of addiction, they do irrational things.

But when you have a big case like this, and you have the defendant actually get on the stand, I think that'll be weighed a lot more than the missteps that were made in this case. Again, we know that there's no real physical evidence. This is all certainly - for the most part circumstantial, so what is going to fill in those gaps and that's where Murdaugh took the chance to tell his story and let that fill the gaps.",

      "sentences": "Yes, guys. Law enforcement source tells me that this didn't just come down to that tweet that you mentioned, which is how authorities were initially onto the suspect. But I'm told from this source that the suspect was interviewed by authorities after he was arrested and admitted to wanting to target Jewish officials in the State of Michigan.He listed four investigators names that included the State's Attorney General, Dana Nessel. I'll now read you the tweet that she put up this morning. She said that the FBI has confirmed I was the target of the heavily armed defendant in this matter. It is my sincere hope that the federal authorities take this offense just as seriously as my hate crimes and domestic terrorism unit takes plots to murder elected officials. Now, we're also learning what was happening behind the scenes, a source tells me that the FBI doesn't have a database of the religions of politicians. And so after seeing this tweet, they reached out to the Jewish community leaders in Michigan to identify potential targets. That's called - what's called a duty to warn. When I was working counterterrorism investigations, if you came across evidence that pointed to someone potentially being in danger, it was incumbent upon the FBI to reach out to those people. So that was what was happening. Now, just to walk you through the timeline here because this shows a lot of investigative work in a very short amount of time. On February the 18th, court records tell us that the FBI's national threat Operations Center. This is the central nervous system for FBI tips. They see that tweet that you mentioned talking about the suspect wanting to target Jewish officials in Michigan, they reached out to the FBI's Detroit division. They were able to glean an address based on looking at the identifiers of this account. They get onto the suspect, as you mentioned, Jake Carpenter III. Now, the FBI goes and interviews his mom who says that my son is in Texas. This is interesting. The FBI according to court records, gets a phone number of the suspect from the mom calls AT&amp;T. The FBI requests an urgent emergency disclosure letter to AT&amp;T to ping the cell phone of that suspect. They need to immediately know where he is located. That information from AT&amp;T leads them to North Texas, where later that day he is arrested. And again, he stands accused, charged with interstate threats. CNN is attempting to reach out to the public defender that is representing the suspect. But this is just the latest in the series of anti-Semitic threats that we've been reporting on. It's interesting, the Government Accountability Office just issued a new report saying that threats against from extremists between 2013 and 2021 increased over 350 percent. And I'll show you here, this is a report from the Anti-Defamation League that was just released that indicated all of the extremist-related killings in the United States last year in 2022 were perpetrated by right wing extremists. So it shows you just the nature of the threat. And, of course, where I'm standing here in Los Angeles, there's a suspect who continues to be investigated for recently allegedly opening fire on two men here in L.A. because of their Jewish clothing. So again, we see these incidents time and time again. This incident in Michigan, just the latest that certainly has the Jewish community unsettled across the country and obviously law enforcement on alert for these types of incidents, which aren't just academic, we're seeing these in real time case after case, guys.",

Joining us now Steve Moore, CNN Law Enforcement Contributor and retired Supervisory Special Agent. Steve, I always wonder and I'm glad they do, because this is how they're captured, why people tweet out these threats before they go about carrying them out.

So this is - they're wanting some credit. Sometimes, though, there are people we used to say barking dogs don't fight, who felt powerless to do anything about it, so they spouted this garbage online, in letters, things like that and it made them feel powerful when they weren't.

I'm - I wouldn't say that what we're looking at is a 10, 20, 30-fold increase in danger to them.It is, however, going to - this case is going to appeal to some people. They're buried in a cabin or in their mom's basement or wherever they are, who have these ideologies swimming around in their head. And when they see somebody else do that or when they see somebody else begin to do it and get taken down. They say, \"If he can do it, I can do it.\" So that's your fear, much like school shootings.

I mean, think about this, if Twitter had instituted that policy with this person had been able to say this, would the FBI had been able to get to it.And then you have the question of the First Amendment. When you move your meter to the point where just wishing somebody harm is now something that you can be taken down for. I think what happens is, you've just taken a huge chunk, unfortunately of society, and you've made it harder to enforce that. The other thing is when you let them speak, sometimes they speak themselves right into the FBI's custody.

It came on suddenly and without warning.Look at the images from onboard the plane taken by a passenger. The plane just thrashed. You can see all the debris in the aisle there. That twin aisle airliner, an Airbus A330, a 200-ton airplane, just gives you an idea of how bad this toss around was by the turbulence. Passengers say the food service was going on at the time, glassware was thrown up to the ceiling. One passenger badly hurt. This plane had to divert to Washington Dulles International Airport, outside of Washington, D.C. where first responders met the plane at the gate seven people, according to airport officials, taken to local hospitals. This is not all that unlike another incident with turbulence that happened on a Hawaiian Airlines flight, 25 people hurt as that flight was descending in Honolulu back in December. The NTSB says turbulence is the top type of incident on board commercial airliners. It is trying to get to the bottom of this not exactly clear yet if the NTSB will investigate this.
