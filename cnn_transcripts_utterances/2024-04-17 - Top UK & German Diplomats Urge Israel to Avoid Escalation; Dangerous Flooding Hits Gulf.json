This is \"Connect the World\". The British and German Foreign Ministers are in Jerusalem pushing for a tempered response from Israel's war cabinets after Iran's weekend attack. And Donald Trump's hush money trial picks up steam. The first group of jurors was seated on Tuesday, but there are still spots to fill. And the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now. Take a look at the futures for you. It looks like the main indices may have a better day yesterday was a mixed close, although futures now indicating a slight downward slant for both the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ, investors really digesting the fed chair's comments on inflation. It doesn't look like Jerome Powell is going to cut rates at any time soon. So keep an eye on those markets for you. That is how things stand at present. Well, top diplomats from the U.K. and Germany are in Israel today ramping up pressure on that government to not escalate tensions after Iran's weakened attack. Israel vowing to respond but it's unclear, when it will happen or what it will entail. David Cameron and Annalena Baerbock met with Israel's Foreign Minister and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose office thanked them for their quote, unequivocal support. Israel's Foreign Minister told his British and German counterparts that Iran's Revolutionary Guards should be declared a terrorist organization. He is asking them to push for new sanctions on Iran's missile program. Meanwhile, in Gaza, there is no let up to the fighting or the civilian deaths. The health ministry their reports -- 56 people killed over the past day and that includes 13, who died in an Israeli airstrike at the Al- Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza, 7 of them children. This video obtained by Reuters shows emotional scenes in and around a hospital -- as families mourn the loss of their loved ones. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And you're right. That's where the divide comes. That's where the pressure from the international community is coming on Israel to do more. We know that in the north of Gaza. Earlier in the week, people were desperate to try to get home. We've seen that there's an Israeli military operation in Beit Hanoun was there for two days in the early part of this week, that village right at the top end of Northern Gaza. I stood on the border there recently that, that town was pretty much destroyed from the outside and the most harrowing pictures, I think, perhaps that I've witnessed of the conflict last night that you were mentioning that we were hearing from people grieving their children, a woman begging the doctor just to give her a few more moments with her son. Harrowing scenes of distress and loss and suffering of people just trying to cling to a little bit of life, pull possessions from the rubble, take shelter in a school forced to leave the school.

I mean strong winds, my house was flooded most of the people in my area became flooded as well and almost impossible for people to leave homes. In fact, getting around Dubai has been very difficult. But today I feel like, it's A Tale of Two Worlds. I've been seeing, you know, immense destruction, cars that are submerged underwater, you can see quite a bit of damage and areas where just cause can't get through. People cannot get around. And then I see kids playing in the water with canoes. But honestly, Becky, it's been one of these unprecedented events, you know, people I've been speaking to saying they've never seen this for as long as they've lived in Dubai. I'm pretty new, have been living here for three years. And I can tell you that this was absolutely harrowing to see some of the images of people stuck on Sheikh Zayed road, one of the key arteries into the airport. People stuck for hours and the people trapped at the airport unable to get taxis to leave the airport. We spoke to one woman who eventually was ended up in Abu Dhabi after her plane. She said was circling around trying to find a place to land and then delayed in Abu Dhabi unable to come to Dubai and then with a six year old daughter trying to get through the floodwaters to go to her hotel taxis. You know, dropping people off in random areas. What is encouraging is you've seen a lot of Emiratis coming in with their big trucks to try and help people get around, but truly, just absolutely significant last 24 hours with this record rainfall that we've seen.",

Look, local flights out of Dubai were canceled. Anyone traveling into Dubai was able to catch connecting flights, but essentially no one could get to the airport. That was one of the big fundamental problems. We also know the airports had to deal with stranded passengers and they were helping people with food and drinks and trying to figure out a way to accommodate them. The latest as they started to clear up those runways. We still there's dramatic images of aircraft unable to effectively land and also take off. I mean, incredible flooding that we saw in that area. But overall, Becky, you've got to understand that this was an issue around the other Gulf countries in Oman. Over 17 people lost their lives in Ras Al Khaimah just an hour from here 170 year old man also died during the flooding yesterday. Now they're trying to assess the damage. The cleanup is underway. It's incredible just to see how much of this has affected the city, the roads are quiet and where they are cause, they completely trapped with really nowhere to go. It is definitely a precarious situation that is playing out. One that I think called Dubai by surprise in many ways and of course all the people traveling here as well. The questions are becomes is how to deal with the infrastructure damage and also calibrate the infrastructure and retrofit the infrastructure to deal with more rainfall which we have been seeing increasing over the last few months.",

Now, this trial is not in session today, and is expected to be dark each Wednesday for the duration of the proceedings. CNN's Zachary Cohen joins us from Washington.

But the seven jurors, we are learning a little bit more about who these individuals are? The four persons for example, is somebody who's originally from Ireland, he works in sales. He will be effectively the leader of this jury, once it's completely formed. In once the trial begins, which the judge said could start moving forward with opening statements as soon as Monday. Other members of the jury, we have four men and three women so far. We have five with college degrees or higher levels of education than that. We have two lawyers, there's none of them expressed very strong views about Donald Trump or politics, which is really key because that was the core question that defense attorneys and prosecutors were asking these potential jurors as they were screening them. And as they were going through the process of disqualifying or removing certain ones from the pool and we went we saw yesterday as defense attorneys were really harping on social media posts from some of these potential jurors, trying to raise questions about potential biases against Donald Trump. And even one juror was dismissed for acknowledging that he had potential bias for Donald Trump and therefore he couldn't render a fair and impartial verdict. So a very diverse group of people that make up the seven jurors so far, that process will continue on Thursdays. The judge and as the lawyers in this case, try to fill out those remaining five jury spots and the about six alternate slots that are left before opening statements can take place.",

And it was really unclear if she had much support within the Republican Conference. Well, yesterday that sort of started to shift because Thomas Massie, another conservative hardliner, who is opposed to the kinds of foreign aid packages that Johnson is pledging to move forward with. He announced in a private Republican conference meeting that he was now moving forward with Marjorie Taylor Greene, that he would be willing to support an effort to try and remove him from the speakership. The reason that's a problem for Johnson is that after Friday, he has just a one vote margin. That means that he can only afford to use one Republican on any single vote. And the question now becomes what democrats step in to try to save him. They have not said when they would move forward with this. They have not said definitely they are moving forward with this. But certainly it's hanging over every single step that Johnson takes, in fact, despite the fact that he committed on Monday night to move forward with four separate bills on Ukraine aid and other kinds of aid across the world.

Key witness as you mentioned, the whistleblower who allege just last week that the 787 is unsafe. His name Sam Salehpour, he was a quality engineer on the 787 line. You saw those big sections of the 787 fuselage being joined together. And he says the gaps in the fuselage are just too big, which could lead to failure over time. Now Boeing insists in the 16 years that 787 have been flying for airlines, there has been no evidence of that. There are about 1100 787s flying worldwide right now. Not one lost to a crash. Salehpour was on NBC ahead of this hearing. He takes his accusation a step further here. He says this -- in this section of this interview, the 787 is at risk of falling out of the sky listen.

These claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do not represent the comprehensive work Boeing has done to ensure the quality and long term safety of the aircraft. This is just the latest in the chapter. This long saga of Boeing issues that stretch about five or six years now. Two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people abroad then January 5th, there was the door plug blow out on that Alaska Airlines 737 Max-9. But remember this issue has to do with the 787. That plane has not been without its problems though deliveries of new plants were paused in 2021 most of 2022 because of quality issues. Some of that Becky is because the tolerances are extremely tight. The gaps allowed between the parts of the fuselage are five one thousandths of an inch. We're talking about the width of two sheets of paper or the width of a human hair. Sometimes it's very hard for Boeing to meet those tolerances, and it says it is only made exceptions in very rare cases.",

For my experience, a large portion of the time they are false claims. In this case, they actually backed it up. And what we're learning now several months later is that a hacking group that the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU has been linked to support it in the past, the exact nature of that connection isn't entirely clear, but there's strong evidence they have interacted with these people. And that's the group that was behind this disruption of the water facility in Texas. We're talking about a town of 5000 people in North Texas. I spoke to the city manager there and he assured me that there was no threat to the actual drinking water supply. But they had to work with the FBI. They had to replace their software. And it's a huge wake up call for small towns across America that may not think that they're the target of something like this. You know, what -- what is the -- the actual intention of the hackers it was a descendent message? We're not entirely sure. We know obviously, that over the war in Ukraine, there's been long standing tension between the U.S. and Russia and the Russians have bristled at all the sanctions imposed by the U.S. government. This may be a way of sending a message that they are still capable of disrupting critical infrastructure in the U.S. with an element of implausible or plausible deniability Becky. So this is a strong development. And what we've seen in recent months of facilities across the U.S. whether it be water plants, or hospitals, or others being the target of hacking when they're not necessarily expecting to be in the crosshairs.",
