      "sentences": "Hey, Wolf. Thanks so much. Good evening. I'm Victor Blackwell. I'm with you tonight to discuss the day's most interesting stories. Donald Trump's former impeachment attorney, a lawyer for one of the mafia bosses that Rudy Giuliani prosecuted. Eric Deggans, Cari Champion, Daniel Dale, and Linette Lopez.But first, if Democrats are not worried about next year's election, new numbers suggest they should be. Listen to this. In two new polls, the general election is a dead heat if the matchup is President Biden versus Donald Trump. Again, a dead heat despite Trump now facing his fourth indictment, 91 charges in all, and several trials next year while people will be voting. Something else noteworthy as we talk about the health of America's democracy, nearly 60% of Republicans today think that Biden was not elected legitimately. Also, today, Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis says that she wants Trump's Georgia trial to start the day before Super Tuesday. And of course, Trump is intensifying his rhetoric against prosecutors and judges in all of his cases. And one of his supporters today was charged with threatening to kill the judge overseeing his federal election fraud case. Using racial slurs, she threatened to kill Judge Chutkan if Trump does not win in 2024. Let's bring in now former Whitewater independent counsel and former federal prosecutor Robert Ray. He also defended former President Trump during the first impeachment trial. Robert, good to see you. Thanks for being on. So, I hear that this is your first opportunity to respond publicly to this fourth indictment. You've had a little time for it to resonate. What do you think? What do you see in those pages? ROBERT RAY, FORMER WHITE HOUSE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: I think my first reaction is I was inclined to agree with former Governor Chris Christie and a presidential candidate that this fourth one was heavy- handed and in sense unnecessary as duplicative of what Jack Smith has already charged. That's not to say that the district attorney has every right to proceed in the exercise of discretion as she deems appropriate. On the other hand, though, I will say my experience has been that generally speaking, when the federal government proceeds through federal prosecutors and a prosecution, the rule, the general rule is, and it's not always followed, there are exceptions, that state authorities -- state and local authorities defer to the federal prosecution. And that has not happened in this case, you know, for various reasons. But, you know, in the space of a little more than four months, we now have four indictments against the former president. It just strikes me as a bit heavy-handed. I have said previously with regard to the other cases that it seems like the exercise of prosecutorial discretion has gone out the window. And I think overall, in my sense, in the best interests of the country, that I'm worried about the course, the path that we're on, and that we may well rue the day that we have traveled down this path. And when I say that, you did, I think, appropriately mention the places where this intersects with the political process. And it's the timing of these trials where inevitably you're going to have clashes between judges and juries and trials and the political process. That doesn't justify violence. Let me be clear. Absolutely, federal judges and any judge needs to be protected in our system, and they should feel free from this sort of nonsense, whether it's, you know, a crank call or something potentially much more serious. It's intolerable. It doesn't matter what the issue is. That cannot be -- that's not acceptable. And that will be met with the full force of the criminal law as necessary in order to protect the judges and prevent this sort of thing from recurring.",

But, you know, in the political process where the First Amendment interests are heightened, you know, it's one thing to say, for example, that Mike Pence is a witness in a criminal case. It's another thing to say that Donald Trump is prevented from criticizing sharply a fellow presidential candidate.And by the same token, you know, I am well familiar with the dangers that the judges face and are familiar with judges who have been not just subject to threats but violence, and in several instances in my lifetime as a prosecutor, judges who have been killed. So, this is serious business. And I don't -- you know, I think everybody needs to watch their language. But it's true on both sides. You know, Senator Schumer, for example, the majority leader of the Senate, had strong words to say about Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Gorsuch that I think, you know, in some respects led direct to sort of protests and danger that Justice Kavanaugh in particular was faced with. All of those things are, you know, something to be watchful of. We can have strong debate in the political process, but we do have to be mindful that those actions have consequences. And then, you know, at the outer edges, there's behavior that just simply is not acceptable. So, I guess to answer your question, I think there are limits.",

I think we've lost patience in this political process, and we seem that we want to have prosecutors, you know, cure all ills and decide all these things. We've got now a number of special prosecutors running around and district attorneys who feel free to be able to charge a former president. We're going to get to the point where we are so engulfed in that process that it's almost like, you know, get all the prosecutors in the room and let them sort out between Joe Biden and Donald Trump who should be president. That's not a political system I want to live in. I think that cedes too much power to prosecutors, and I think it's an inherently dangerous road to travel.",

      "sentences": "I'm going to talk faster than normal, so forgive me. Number one was Trump's overarching lie that he won the 2020 election. He lost. Number two is his lie that he won Georgia in 2020. He claimed at least once that he won by 400,000 votes. He lost Georgia by 11,779 votes. The result was certified by Republicans. Number three was his lie that there was -- quote -- \"massive voter fraud\" in Georgia. There wasn't massive voter fraud there or anywhere else in the country. Number four was his related lie that the number of false and or irregular votes was much bigger than the number needed to give him a Georgia victory. He made this claim in September 2021.Number five is his lie that he -- quote -- \"also won the other swing states in 2020.\" He lost not only Georgia, but Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Wisconsin. Number six was his effort to get top DOJ officials to lie. Trump allegedly urged them to -- quote -- \"just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.\" Number seven and eight are about Vice President Pence. Number seven, that Pence had the power to reject Biden electoral votes. Pence told him this was illegal, unconstitutional. Number eight, Trump had his campaign issue a false January 5th statement declaring that Pence totally agreed with him on this, even though Pence had again told him that very that he totally disagreed. Number nine was Trump's lie that phony pro-Trump electors in swing states he lost were real electors, and then the indictment also gets into a whole bunch of specific lies he told about Georgia. Number 10 is a lie that anywhere from 250,000 to 300,000 ballots were mysteriously dropped or dumped in the rolls. In fact, these were normal votes counted as normal. Number 11 was a related lie that a huge number of votes were dumped into Fulton County and the Jason County, also did not happen. Number 12 was Trump's lie that a Fulton County election worker was caught on video stuffing the ballot box. In fact, she did nothing wrong. And number 13 was his related lie that this worker, Ruby Freeman, is a professional vote scammer. In fact, she was a fully exonerated elections worker. He was relentlessly maligning for no good reason. Number 14 was Trump's lie that Georgia had nearly 5,000 ballots cast in the names of deceased people. The Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told him that they actually found two such ballots, later updated the number to just four. Number 15 was Trump's lie that about 45 -- 4,500 people voted in Georgia even though they were not registered. Raffensperger wrote in his book that their pro proved there were zero unregistered voters. Number 16 was Trump's lie that Georgia had thousands and thousands of people who were told they couldn't vote because a ballot had already been cast in their name. As Raffensperger noted, this is just imaginary, completely made up. Number 17 is Trump's lie that Georgia had -- quote -- \"at least 66,247 underage voter. Raffensperger informed Congress on January 6th that the actual number was zero. Number 18 was Trump's lie about at least 1,043 Georgians having voted after registering using only a P.O. box. Raffensperger told Congress that a simple Google search showed many of these supposed P.O. boxes were actually apartments. Number 19 was Trump's lie that as many as 2,560 felons had illegally voted in the state. Raffensperger said his analysis showed the maximum even potential number of such voters was 74. Number 20 is Trump's lie that during this now infamous phone call with Raffensperger, where he pressured him to overturn Biden's win, Raffensperger was unwilling or unable to address his various debunked claims. In reality, Raffensperger personally debunked them in detail and at length. And then the indictment, Victor, gets into Trump's lies to Georgia officials, including Raffensperger, about what happened in other states. So, number 21 was his lie that 139% of Detroit residents voted. Nonsense. In fact, Detroit had 51% turnout. Number 22 is his lie that Pennsylvania counted more than 200,000 more votes than it had actual voters. Again, just made up, not even close to true. Number 23 was Trump's lie that thousands of dead people voted in Michigan, again made up. Number 24, 25, and 26 are other Trump lies about the election in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Michigan. The indictment didn't specify which ones, but you can basically take your pick. And then finally, number 27 is Trump's lie that states knew their certified vote totals were -- quote -- \"based on irregularities and fraud.\" As we know, state vote totals were entirely legitimate.",

I said, no, Angie, I don't know. He said, we just had a retirement dinner up in Newark. He said, you travel an average of 117 days a year, a round trip, 300 miles a day. Thirty-six years.

So, it's false in two ways.First of all, this conversation about the million miles, a flying milestone, could not have happened because Mr. Negri, who was an Amtrak conductor, was deceased at the time it would have had to occur. He passed that milestone, the vice president, in September 2015. Mr. Negri died more than a year prior in 2014. The second false element, Victor, is the president said that his mother was sick, at the time in hospice in his home. In fact, she had died more than five years prior to him reaching that million miles flown milestone on Air Force Two. So, two false elements. Now, I did speak in 2021 to Mr. Negri's stepdaughter. She said they were indeed friends. Her late stepfather adored Mr. Biden, spoke of him often. So, there was a relationship there. But, look, we -- I've counted at least nine times as president that Biden has told this story about his friend that is just inaccurate. So, it's probably time he retires it. BLACKWELL: Yeah, it seems like a favorite of his.

I think that this relationship is beyond repair. I do agree with Michael Oher's assessment. He was not taught football at a kitchen table with condiments, as portrayed in the movie. He was very intelligent. He was very smart. I think what we're arguing here is semantics. They have used the word adoption, and it's clear that he has not been adopted. It was a conservatorship, which he said he didn't know it was that. And so now we're sitting here. At 37 years old, they still have a legal conservatorship over Michael Oher. Something is wrong here. I do believe we don't know a lot. I feel like there is a lot that is missing and we'll find this all out with court documents.
