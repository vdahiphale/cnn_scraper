These arethe earliest signs of Hurricane Milton that have moved across parts of Southwest Florida. As you said, we are in Fort Myers. We're along the Caloosahatchee River. And we're keeping a close eye on it because two years ago, when Hurricane Ian made a direct landfall here in Lee County, the storm surge out here was 10 feet. And so everything that you see here behind me was underwater. It was damaged or destroyed by that hurricane. The amphitheater out in the background had to be rebuilt. The convention center to my right also had to be essentially built back from scratch because again, the storm surge out here was 10 feet. Now, with Hurricane Milton currently still forecast to make landfall to the north of us, this part of Southwest Florida is still expected to see a storm surge of anywhere between 8 to 12 ft. And so the folks out here in Fort Myers are dealing with the reality that although they're not getting a direct impact, right now at least from Hurricane Milton, they are going to see the type of flooding that they saw with Hurricane Ian just two years ago. You talked about whether folks are still out here. Yesterday, a curfew went into effect for 24 hours out in Fort Myers Beach. So folks out there were told, they have to get out. I was out there yesterday taking a look at how things looked then. And I can tell you it was pretty much a ghost town. In neighboring Sanibel, which was also destroyed by Hurricane Ian, there is also a mandatory evacuation. And so the folks were told, look, if you live on either of those parts in Lee County, you really have to make your way inland. Even where we are right now in Fort Myers, which you can see the rain has started to pick up, this here is also a mandatory evacuation zone. Yesterday, we were live a few blocks from where we are right now talking to residents and business owners there, and they were trying the best they can, putting up plywood on their businesses, putting up sandbags. One business owner put out an inflatable dam, filled it up with water, all in an effort to try to keep some of this flooding that we're going to see happen over the next couple of hours from taking place. And so that's kind of the situation right now from the ground. We expect this weather to get worse as the day progresses and into the night. And we're probably not going to see the worst of this when it comes to the flooding until overnight into tomorrow morning. And that's because the storm surge, the rainfall, and then high tide is not going to happen until around 12:00 or one o'clock in the morning and those water levels are not expected to recede until tomorrow morning.

Harris is on the campaign trail and is joining the briefing virtually. Kevin Liptak joins us now from Washington with the details. Kevin, we heard the president talk about his conversations with the governor of Florida, Governor DeSantis. DeSantis saying that they have everything that they need from the president right now. This is obviously a storm that's going to cost the federal government billions of dollars. But also an important point to make is the president highlighting the dangers of misinformation and disinformation as folks are waiting down in Florida for this storm to make landfall.",

      "sentences": "Yes. The White House really feels like they're operating on two fronts here. One, they're trying to getresidents prepared for this massive hurricane in Florida. They're trying to pre-position resources. But they're also trying to combat all of this disinformation that has been swirling in the wake of last week's Hurricane Helene, but also ahead of Milton's landfall in Florida. And they really do feel like this is a very concerning problem that they're trying to combat. They're worried that if people see things like that the federal government isn't on the ground that people aren't receiving resources from FEMA, that they're only receiving small amounts, that it will dissuade them from applying for the benefits that they're eligible for. And so they really do view this as a very serious problem. And you heard President Biden yesterday saying that it was un-American to spread misinformation about these storms. Of course, one of the biggest people who has been responsible for that is the former President Donald Trump, so this is all getting wrapped up in politics. One of the ways that the White House is trying to combat that misinformation is starting a Reddit page, trying to get information directly in front of people, where they are, where they're looking for resources. And so that is certainly an ongoing effort. I think what you'll hear from the president this hour, as he's receiving this briefing on Milton, is describing some of the federal efforts that are underway now on the ground. In Florida, for example, FEMA is prepositioning search and rescue teams. They're putting in vehicles that would be helpful in high water rescues. They're looking at trying to clear some of the debris that could be wrapped up in the winds that are coming in from Milton. So certainly, President Biden very much wanting to appear on top of this. This is just the first of two appearances that will he -- President Biden, today talking about Milton really trying to show that he is on top of this storm.",

Radley, thank you so much for taking the time to join us. First, just give us your thoughts and some of your biggest concerns as you're watching this storm just hours away from making landfall in Florida. RADLEY HORTON, CLIMATE PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S CLIMATE SCHOOL: Yes, absolutely. I mean, the speed with which it intensified but also, of course, how intense it became. The impacts, the damages go up in a non-linear way, every extra 10 miles per hour of wind means a lot more damage than the previous. So this is a really frightening situation from the perspective as we have been hearing of storm surge, wind strength, and also the amount of heavy rain that's going to be falling across much of Florida.",

Radley, help explain for us, as a scientist, obviously, you're not political. You are neutral. You're following the data. Why it's so important to identify this as climate change being at least a significant factor and the intensity and the frequency of storms like this? Because I would imagine that then results in how we deal with these storms and try to prevent them in the future.",

I mean, I think the place to start is to acknowledge just how deadly and how damaging these storms can be, right?These extreme events are where we see the focus in terms of the potential for loss of life. Look at the 250 or so people that died recently from Helene and the potential for damages. As I alluded to earlier, if we start seeing more of these category four and category five storms, which is exactly what the climate models are telling us to expect in the future, largely because of those warming upper oceans, which we're basically bound to see. It's a fundamental element of global warming. That is going to increase these damages. So as a society, that can motivate people both to adapt, to try to protect themselves, to evacuate, to build seawalls, to elevate their homes. And increasingly, there's going to be a discussion about having to move away from some of the most vulnerable areas. But not just to adapt fundamentally, we have to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions dramatically to try to minimize the amount of these storms in the future and their intensity.",

It's the emissions reduction and the adaptation, because the truth is, even before climatechange, even if there somehow hadn't been climate change, we've seen so much development in already vulnerable areas that now are becoming so much more vulnerable with sea level rise, with the heavier rain for a storm of a given strength, as you alluded to, and with the storms getting stronger. So we face the situation in places like the West Coast of Florida, but many other areas where that risk has not been acknowledged, it hasn't been communicated to home buyers, to businesses. So we've seen more and more people moving directly into harm's way. Sadly, a lot of the insurers in places like Florida are not as robust as you'd like to think they are in the face of some of these types of events. So, I fear we're really facing a reckoning where we're going to start to see actual sort of financial cascading of impacts.",
