Donald Trump indicted over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, marking an unprecedented third criminal case against a former U.S. president.European nationals flee the political turmoil in Niger. The latest on the evacuation flights leaving the West African nation in the wake of its coup. And rescues and evacuations are underway in Beijing after the remnants of Typhoon Doksuri caused the heaviest rainfall in 114 years. And we begin with an unprecedented moment in U.S. history as former President Donald Trump is indicted on criminal charges for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. This indictment now marks the third time Trump has faced criminal charges. In this case, prosecutors alleged Trump knowingly spread prolific lies of fraud, as he remained determined to stay in power despite having lost. Trump is scheduled for an initial hearing Thursday. That's when he will be formally charged with four counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States. The special counsel says Trump's repeated lies about the 2020 election fueled the attack on the U.S. Capitol. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "This is the third criminal indictment that former President Trump has faced this year. Now in this indictment, Special Counsel Jack Smith alleges that former President Trump after he lost the 2020 election that he pursued a series of actions to try to unlawfully overturn the results of that election. Special Counsel acknowledges that the former president is within his rights to alleged fraud, to pursue litigation, to call for audits.But they say instead, he pursued an on lawful series of actions that resulted in this criminal indictment. Among them, they say that he and his associates tried to install slates of fake electors to overturn the results in seven states. They also allege the former president and his associates applied a lot of pressure on individual states, on officials within specific states that the former president lost, trying to get them to investigate and overturn the election results in their states. They also allege that the former President tried to use the Justice Department with the help of a Justice Department official who was named as a coconspirator to try to apply pressure specifically on the state of Georgia. They also allege the former president applied pressure to his own vice president. Of course, this has been widely reported that he really pressed his Vice President Mike Pence not to certify the results of the election for now, President Biden. Now this all culminated, prosecutors allege in the violence that we saw on January 6.  Prosecutors allege that these lies that were being amplified by the former president and his associates helped propel this sense of distrust in the government and in the outcome, which in part resulted in the violence we saw on January 6, but the indictment lays out how then President Trump did not do anything to try to quell that violence. And in fact, he and his associates double down and their efforts to try to overturn the results of the election. The former president is expected to make his initial court appearance on Thursday. It's unclear if he'll be in person or if he will appear via Zoom. And the investigation continues to special counsel confirmed that on Tuesday. We also know from our own reporting that they will continue to interview witnesses, including a witness that they have scheduled next Monday. Paul Reid, CNN, Washington.",

Right now, he is in a strong position. Well, while he may be doing better among, you know, the hardcore base elements of the Republican electorate. I think these indictments are absolutely disastrous for the Republican Party in the general election.I mean, what independent or swing voter is being persuaded to support Donald Trump with these indictments particularly this latest one, I would argue no one. And so, I think that, you know, Trump has kind of hit his ceiling. And I suspect as time wears on, there will be a push. And it's only going to happen if these other Republican presidential candidates, other Republican leaders speak up and explain why Donald Trump is such a great risk not only to the party, but to the country. That's how they're going to defeat him. When you hear some of these candidates put out statements, more or less talking about, oh, the deep state, the Justice Department's out to get them. They're just -- they're just -- they're just empowering Trump. They're actually -- they're playing for number two. They're not trying to defeat him.

He is averaging about 52 percent compared to his -- the contender behind them at 17 percent, DeSantis. And the more these indictments come down and this is number three out of a likely number four, the more this happens, the more he gets a bounce in the polls.The more he makes money off of this. We know he spent $40 million already in legal expenses. But if you look at what's happening with undecided voters, with swing voters, with independent voters, these indictments are not playing well with them. So, it appears that the Republican party is on this pretty disastrous course to nominate Donald Trump. But his chances of winning in a general election he lost in 2020.

This plays so well into this idea that Donald Trump is using to really whip up his core supporters by saying, look, I'm being persecuted by a system that is rigged against me. And it's not just rigged against me. It's rigged against you if you listen to him on the stump.

But it's far too few.You cannot defeat the Trump narrative with silence, which is what has been the case for much of the last few years. So, until Republican leaders, you know, really find their voices and stand up and say the truth to the Republican voters. I think that's when things change these. These -- that's why you're called a leader. You can lead. You can actually help change and that they can actually help change the narrative. But they're not going to change the narrative by ignoring Donald Trump. And just hoping he goes away. He's been able to dominate this narrative for far too long.

The former super typhoon continues to wreak havoc in China, as you say, dumping the heaviest rainfall over Beijing ever recorded in 140 years.Heavy rains began pummeling the capital and surrounding areas last Saturday, with the average rainfall for the month of July falling on Beijing in just 40 hours. Now, as a result, and as you can see from these pictures, there was severe flooding that washed away cars, damaged buildings and roads, with many residents needing to be evacuated. Unfortunately, not everyone escaped. At least 11 people were killed. 13 are still missing, including two rescue workers. In neighboring Hebei province, over 800,000 people were evacuated. Authorities say nine people there were killed, six are still missing. State media reports that maximum rainfall was recorded in 10 weather stations in Hebei province, also breaking historical records. Now Rosemary, the good news is that rainfall in Beijing and Hebei is expected to ease today while the storm moves towards Northeastern China. We've heard from the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, he's called for every effort to rescue those lost or trapped by the rains. As we know, China has been experiencing extreme weather and posting record temperatures this summer, which scientists believe have been exacerbated by climate change. Now, the bad news, and unfortunately there is bad news, is that there is another typhoon heading towards China. That's called Typhoon Khanun. It's the sixth storm this year. It is powerful and slow-moving. Currently, it's lashing Japan. And so far, according to authorities, one person has been killed. It's knocked out power to one-third of homes in Okinawa. Phone and internet connections have been disrupted. The airport in Okinawa's capital city has been closed now for a second day. Okinawa, as we know, is home to the majority of U.S. forces that are based in Japan. This typhoon, Rosemary, is expected to move towards China and Taiwan by Friday.
