      "sentences": "Welcome to The Lead. I'm Jake Tapper.This hour what's going on at the FDIC? Lawmakers are trying to get at exactly that they grilled the man in charge of that key federal bank regulator. He's facing calls to resign after accusations of pervasive sexual harassment and discrimination at the FDIC and the bullying of lower level employees. Coming up, the tough questions that the chair of the FDIC face today on Capitol Hill. Plus, an attempted assassination of Slovakia's Prime Minister shot multiple times earlier today. The sheer panic in the streets as this attack went down. And leading this hour, a moment of truth that needs to play out tomorrow in the New York hush money cover-up case against former President Trump. The criminal conviction or acquittal of a former president could really come down to this question. Does the jury believe Donald Trump, the defendant, or Michael Cohen, the key witness? Tomorrow, jurors are going to continue to hear testimony from Michael Cohen, the key witness in this case who was once a self- described, quote, \"designated thug,\" unquote, for Donald Trump. Cohen will resume intense cross examination as the defense argues that Cohen can simply not be trusted. Just to give you a sense of how the defense set the tone yesterday, here was Trump attorney Todd Blanche on his very first exchange with Michael Cohen, \"Mr. Cohen, my name is Todd Blanche, you and I have never spoken or met before, have we?\" Cohen, \"We have not.\" Blanche, \"But you know who I am, don't you?\" Cohen, \"I do.\" Blanche, \"As a matter of fact, on April 23, so after the trial started in the case, you went on TikTok and called me a crying little shit, didn't you?\" Cohen, \"Sounds like something I would say,\" unquote. Apologies for the cursing there, but that's the transcript from court. The judge then sustained an objection from the prosecution. The defense highlighted Cohen's penchant for serial lying and going over a litany of insults that Cohen has unleashed on Trump since they became estranged. That includes calling Trump a, quote, \"Boorish cartoon misogynist,\" and a quote, \"Cheeto-dusted cartoon villain.\" Cohen's go to response every time he was asked something like, quote, \"sounds like something I'd say.\" The defense also got Cohen to say he has built up a lucrative business, especially from books focused on criticizing his former mentor, Donald Trump. But before the defense was unleashed on Trump's former lawyer, the prosecution had walked Cohen through the most important part of the case so far, not what Cohen has said but Cohen confirming that Donald Trump falsified business records to cover up the hush money payment scheme to Stormy Daniels doing this in an effort to influence the 2016 election by hiding those payments from the public. Now that is the alleged crime that Trump is on trial for and Cohen is testifying under oath saying, yes, my former boss is guilty of this. Of course, it is also true as we will hear tomorrow from the defense, being under oath has not stopped Michael Cohen from lying before, he has pleaded guilty on a charge of lying to Congress in 2018. In this trial, he testified the lies to Congress were meant to protect Trump. He says you can believe him now, because he was later reformed after a quasi-intervention from his family. So this is a tale of two Cohens. And all of that is what this Manhattan jury is left to ponder as the prosecution could rest its case as early as tomorrow. Let's discuss with Lanny Davis, a former attorney for Michael Cohen and a crisis management specialist. First of all, let me correct something I said because I said he lied to Congress in 2018, I think I meant 2017, right? That's when he lied, testifying behind closed doors before the intelligence committees investigating ties that Trump had with Russia. His justification is, I did that at the behest of Mr. Trump. But that doesn't make it any better.",

I'm going to get to co-moderate the debate with my colleague and friend Dana Bash.Moments ago at the White House, reporters tried to shout questions such as why he won't commit to a third debate and why a June debate. With all the shouting, you couldn't really make out President Biden's response. Let's bring in CNN's MJ Lee at the White House and Kristen Holmes here in studio. She covers the Trump campaign for us.

It would be after some voters had actually participated already in early voting in some parts of the country. And Jen O'Malley Dillon saying in a letter to the commission that the calendar shows the serious limitations of the CPDs outdated approach.And this, of course, was not the only issue that the Biden campaign took with the Commission, the CNN studio, the Atlanta studio, where the first debate is going to take place in June is not going to have a live audience. And the Biden campaign had said that the way that these debates were arranged in the past with these large audiences that they have become spectacles, and really a distraction for the viewers who are really trying to learn about the positions of the candidates that are involved. Now, one thing we have learned about debate prep is that one person who will be participating is Ron Klain. This is of course, the president's former chief of staff and very close advisor, he tells me that he's going to be taking some vacation time to participate in these prep sessions. The question that we don't know the answer to, of course yet is who is going to be filling in and the role of Donald Trump. The person that played that role back in 2020 was Bob Bauer, the president's personal lawyer.

So it's not surprising that Trump's team jumped on this. Now we were told that there was at least one conversation behind the scenes between the two camps, essentially saying that they both agreed that this was important to have these debates, but they were not prepared the Trump team for what happened today. And what I've actually been told by some of the senior advisors is that they're a little bit irked at the fact that that it seems as though Biden took control of the debate narrative, something they have been trying to hammer home over and over again for the past several weeks.And Biden got out there first accepted first, but I will let you know in case you're worried the mudslinging has not stopped yet.

And it's occasionally punctuated by explosions referred to in the last half hour or so. Again, this huge city, which felt, frankly in the first year of the war 2022 when Russian forces were kicked out of this whole area in a lightning move by Ukraine that they had seen the worst of the war behind it now having to get its head around the idea that it's coming back fast.The last five days, Jake, have seen an extraordinary move by Russia on essentially an entirely new front pushing again back from their territory down towards Kharkiv here, a key town on the border called Vovchans'k. We've seen a lot of the fighting. And today, Ukraine said they had to reposition their troops within that a euphemism basically for a tactical withdrawal that was coupled by local police chief saying he'd heard gunfire in the streets, clearly Russian troops now fighting it out for that particular town. They also say Russia, they've got about a double digits worth of villages in that border area under their control. Now, if they keep moving, which appears to be the case, then their guns may get in range of here and that will be both a huge blow for Ukraine's psyche and also to a big drain on already fatigued Ukrainian resources. Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday said cancel this travel there, so important to go around to allies asking for more aid faster. But he also reassured Ukrainians that the fight and the resources they need to throw at the fight here in Kharkiv would not see other losses along very stretched frontlines in the east in particular. We've seen, Jake, remarkable gains by Russia over the past month down there at Avdiivka in the east there. That continues as I speak. And a sense here, I think that the delay of that aid certainly has left Ukraine starved of ammunition. Its morale tanked back in December when they learned they weren't going to get that $61 billion, potentially at all. Now it's just delayed. But I think a feeling here that Russia has seen a window where Ukraine is weak. It doesn't have the weapons yet. Moscow does have the weapons. It does have the manpower and it's using it fast and fierce. Out towards Vovchans'k today, you know, we have multiple airstrikes, some landing near us.

Despite the feeling that they've had, frankly, they've been left to fight this by themselves. The weapons may start coming into their hands here, fine, this week today. But it hasn't materially changed the speed of Russia's advance.And certainly up here in the northern areas, it's flat territory. There's not a lot of it until you start getting into an area right here where you could punish kharkiv with its artillery. So that's a key threat now. But the real thing to watch, Jake, is how Ukraine in this next month has to spread the thin resources it has across multiple areas of bad news. The weapons will start to come in. But they haven't, they haven't been able to hold Russia back yet. And there's a danger here, I think, too, that, you know, while we in the West here that $61 billion is on its way. And we hear Blinken talk about solidarity and weapons and more money. It hasn't actually turned up here yet. It hasn't turned the tide here at all. And that sense of solidarity hasn't translated into a change of fortunes on the ground. And until it does, Ukraine is seeing possibly the worst period has had since the invasion. Jake?",
