CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister has more on Combs' court appearance and his indictment. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, Sean Diddy Combs, one of music's biggest stars, ordered behind bars after pleading not guilty to a sweeping federal indictment. Charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, the grand jury indictment accuses the music mogul of running a criminal enterprise over decades. DAMIAN WILLIAMS, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Between at least 2008 and the present, Sean Combs abused, threatened, and coerced victims to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct.",

      "sentences": "It says everything, Wolf, for a variety of factors. Number one, certainly, generally, you would be given bail if there's any condition or combination of conditions that would ensure, A, you return to court, and, B, there's an issue as to whether you're a danger to the community. Because of the manner in which the indictment was laid out, speaking about over a 16-year period allegations with respect to what he allegedly did, it becomes problematic.Let me tell you what the concerns are very briefly. Number one, you have very motivated accusers, right, very motivated people. We know that because they laid out the allegations in lawsuits, lawsuits of civil in nature, not criminal. But I think that provided a treasure trove of information for the federal government to do what they did. Number two, with respect to the seizure of things, right, evidence from his properties in California and Miami, videos, the other things in terms of Elizabeth's excellent piece moving into this, the lubricant, the cocaine, the, you know, other things that were taken, drugs, what have you, it's really concerning. And so at the end of the day, Wolf, it's going to be established with proof or not proof. But here's the last thing. This is a case of the United States of America versus Sean Combs. Why do I say that? Because a lot of other people who could have been charged in this indictment with him were not. What does that say to me as a defense attorney? That they are cooperating with the government. So, you have the accusers that are there giving their story, innocent until proven guilty, but you have other people who you could say were his enablers who are not being looked at by the government, who are looking at helping the government prove their case. So, it says an awful lot that he's detained at this point without bail. There'll be an appeal on that issue. We'll see what a court has to say thereafter.",

As Joey said, no, he did not act alone. So, there were enablers from his employees, his co- workers, his assistants to other people than law enforcement that have aided and abetted him in carrying out these crimes. So, what the judge made clear that there was nothing that he could really -- that she could, excuse me, determine that will really grant bail.Now, I wanted to point out that this is a magistrate judge, and the magistrate judge is really more administerial in nature, meaning that tomorrow or the day after or sooner after that this case will be given to the district judge who will be hearing this. Now, at that point, they will indeed try to -- his defense team will indeed try to convince the judge once again that Sean is not a flight risk and that he should be entitled to bail.

Yes, he's well resourced. Yes, he can go to anywhere really in the world, if he wanted to, but he didn't. He came here to New York to fight the charges.Number two, in addition to coming to New York, he offered to surrender. They chose it as prosecutors to get him at the hotel. Why? That was the indication that they were going to look to detain him, right, indefinitely until the case comes. And number three, they'll argue that, yes, these are decades allegations in terms of 2008 to present, but what they will say is that, you know, he hasn't as of late been certainly a danger to the community and these certainly are allegations. Last point, Wolf, and that's this. These are life changing allegations. Every indictment is. But there's also a forfeiture provision in here. So, irrespective of whether he's detained or he's out, if he's convicted on this -- and it's an indictment, which is a mere allegation, this has to be proven in court to be clear. But if he's convicted, the government can forfeit everything from the criminal enterprise. That is his world. That means the government could take everything and anything that was a result right of proceeds from who he is and what he does entertainment or otherwise. So, this could change his life as he knows it and, ultimately, that's going to depend upon whether the government proves the case beyond a reasonable doubt.",

In cases like this, how much do you weigh putting the survivors through a trial versus exploring potentially a plea deal that could spare them having to testify? BONNERAnd so when you look at that, and you look at the vehement denials that Sean has given over the course of this past year, and it wasn't until the video evidence came out with Cassie Ventura, where he was seen brutally beating her, kicking her, dragging her by the hair, throwing a vase at her. And so at this point, really he was really denying all of that. So, I don't really foresee that changing. He had an opportunity at some point. He knew this was coming. He still was trying to negotiate a surrender versus a plea. So, I really don't think that they're going to be inclined to offer a plea, or will Sean be inclined to offer or accept one. So, I do see this playing out in court very similar to what R. Kelly did. And that was tried over just across the bridge at the Eastern District of New York. So, I really do not foresee any kind of plea. And it is unfortunate for the survivors because you are pitting them up against the evidence and having to speak on that.",

One of the things they said specifically was, Kamala continued to stoke the flames of violence against President Trump just two days after an assassination attempt against him.

She clearly wanted to continue to hold Trump.
