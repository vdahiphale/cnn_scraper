And that closing argument began rather interestingly.He started with a long-winded story about Latrobe, Pennsylvania, native Arnold Palmer, including, and I'm not making this up, a description of the Hall of Fame golfer in the men's room, in the locker room, and what he looked in the shower. He then went into more conversation about how his hair looked and his combing regiments. And then he also accused Joe Biden, a Catholic, of targeting Catholic Americans. When he finally got on script for the night, he's put the rather stark terms of the election front and center for this audience. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: With your support we'll bring back our nation's strength, dominance, prosperity, and pride. We're going to do it. This will be America's new golden age. 100 years from now, the presidential election of 2024 will be looked upon as America's greatest victory. I hope that's true.

However, he has canceled a number of events, excuse me, interviews lately and he has also had some strange incidents at his events where we had the audio go out and he was just dancing on stage for a little while.All that is sort of feeding into this narrative that the Harris campaign has been pushing, that he is unhinged and that he is not stable, and obviously he is continuing to campaign vigorously and saying that by demonstrating that he's coming out here, like standing on the stage as he's speaking now for about an hour and he's probably will speak for another hour, demonstrating that he continues to have the stamina for this race -- Jessica.",

There has never been a race this close in the polling since 1972 in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.Keep in mind right now, Kamala Harris has less than a one-point lead, it's actually less than half a point. I go through those spreadsheets every single day, Jessica, I have never seen Pennsylvania be this close in the polling as it is right now.

So if Kamala Harris wins in Pennsylvania, she has an 87 percent chance of winning the election. If Donald Trump wins in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, he has a 92 percent chance of winning the election.Now, the one -- there are two ways you can look at this, right? Number one, Pennsylvania is extremely important to both of their paths to 270 electoral votes, but it's actually a little bit more important to Kamala Harris' path, because if she does -- if she does not win the state of Pennsylvania, she only has about an 8 percent chance of winning the White House. Donald Trump has about a 13 percent chance. Now those are still pretty small percentages, but the bottom line is this. Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania. It's extremely important to both of their chances to win the White House, but it's perhaps a little bit more important to kamala Harris than it is to Donald Trump's chances of winning the White House.",

And that is because historically speaking, it's been more important for Democrats' path than Republicans' path. So Democrats who won the presidency without Pennsylvania since 1924, it's only happened two times, Jessica, only two times.And the last time it happened was all the way back in 1948. Jessica, I think if you put our two ages together, we would not be this old. So the bottom line is that Pennsylvania is extremely important for Kamala Harris. It's extremely difficult to chart a path to the White House without winning. For Donald Trump, it's also difficult. But hey, at least there's some recent historical times where a Republican has won without Pennsylvania. George W. Bush actually did it twice in both 2000 and 2004.

Well, this was a luxury the people of Gaza did not have he said. Sinwar always prioritized himself, his money and Hamas terrorists over the people of Gaza, Hagari added. Well, Sinwar, who's seen as the architect of the October 7th attacks on Israel, was killed by Israeli troops in Gaza on Wednesday after more than a year of devastating Israeli pounding of the territory. The final moments of the Hamas leader captured on a drone camera showed him sitting alone in a wrecked building before lashing out at the drone with a stick. Hamas, which is reeling from the killing, has accused the Israeli military of blatant lies and a failed theatrical performance in its portrayal of Sinwar during that past 12 months. In a statement, the group said the Israeli army was humiliated by the man the statement calls Commander Sinwar and his brothers. The organization says Sinwar was killed while engaging in the battlefield, after having spent the past year moving across various combat fronts in Gaza, at the forefront of, quote, \"our brave people's\" resistance.

And that of course then leads the other side in this case, the Iranians and their proxies, to potentially go after leaders like Netanyahu on the Israeli side.

But the key thing is this. Now we have another power potentially getting involved in the war in Ukraine.It shows that Russia has a manpower problem. They also face significant domestic resistance to actually being grafted into the war in Ukraine. So the way to solve that manpower shortage appears to be to hire foreign troops. In this case, those foreign troops are North Korean, and that of course means that North Korea is more directly involved than we previously thought.

All this part is nonsense is that it's all designed to make people think that they're doing something for Jesus, when they're really not, they're doing something for Trump and look, they're going to do something for whoever replaces Trump. [END VIDEOTAPE] O'SULLIVAN: And, Jess, the big concern here, of course, as you heard, Pastor Ben Marsh say in that piece is that this belief that some people truly, really do have that Trump was sent from God, that he is God's chosen candidate with divine intervention but when those beliefs mix and merge with election conspiracy theories that if Trump loses that the election was automatically stolen. Well, we saw what happened when that happened last time, right, on January 6, 2021, some of the people who broke into the Capitol who stormed the Capitol were doing so under the Christian flag. They were praying, they had prayer circles, concern, as you've heard from one pastor there, that something like that could happen again -- Jess.",

So, they were doing their work. There was a lot of work to do and they kept asking for postponements. But things are looking positive now and as you saw that very emotional day when all of the family came to plead for their life. They have spent almost all of -- they spent all of their adult life behind bars and what is in question now is whether or not the justice system can show them mercy and whether or not they deserve it, whether or not they have been rehabilitated or would be any kind of threat to society. And what we've been seeing from our documentary that came out 18 months ago is an outpouring of support for the brothers and the DA's office diligently doing their work and deciding whether or not to recommend to the judge that they deserve a re-sentencing and ultimately, it is in the hands of the judge.",

Rarely are these close calls in midair.This incident was on Wednesday, but it's just now coming to light after new data from flight tracking site FlightRadar24, it shows an American Airlines flight lining up to land at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas, when a private Cessna 182 started to turn toward the commercial flight putting the planes nose-to-nose. FlightRadar24 says the American flight passed over the Cessna separated by only 400 feet. We're talking a little more than the length of a football field. The air traffic control recording from liveatc.net, details that the American pilots received an in-cockpit alert of an impending collision called a resolution advisory, which requires immediate action by the pilots. Now, this investigation is just beginning, but the FAA says the Cessna was operating under visual flight rules that does not require constant communication with air traffic control. You may remember that Austin was the site of another near collision. In February of last year, a FedEx flight nearly landed on top of a departing southwest flight that was obscured by dense fog. Investigators said the quick reaction of the FedEx crew saved the day and the lone air traffic controller in the tower simply could not see the problem playing out in front of them.

Will the US keep its longtime friends and allies or turn away from them to focus inward?CNN's Fareed Zakaria explores these questions and the history that brought us to this moment in his latest in-depth special America First. Here's a preview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS\" (voice over): Tens of millions dead. Cities reduced to rubble, an entire continent in ruins. Europe after world War II was a hellscape, decimated by yet another great power conflict that has spiraled out of control. The United States had been drawn into it at a cost of nearly half a million American lives. Yet, even after the Second World War, there were many Republicans who still believed in America First and that the nation's wisest course was to turn inward. It took a World War II hero to inspire an about-face in the party. General Dwight David Eisenhower, he believed that America's enormous sacrifices could not be allowed to have been made in vain. So he campaigned for a fledgling alliance called NATO and led Republicans away from isolationism for the rest of the 20th century. This is the little told story of how a general became a reluctant politician when the world and America needed him most. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
