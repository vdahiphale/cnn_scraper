One example, Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense.Now, if he wasn't on your bingo card, you're actually not alone tonight. One defense official telling CNN -- quote -- \"Everyone is simply shocked.\" And if you recognize him, it may be from Fox News. He has been there for eight years and cohost his show on the weekend. There he is. He's a veteran who served tours in Afghanistan and also Iraq. Advisers tell us he has been an informal adviser to Trump for several years already. And one source says Trump thinks he has, well, the look. So, it'll require a lot more than the look for a T.V. personality with no government experience to run the most powerful military in the entire world. It's also curious when you factor in what Trump told Joe Rogan.

Do you have any concerns about how this may play out, not only in the confirmation, but also leading the military as we know it? BRYAN LANZA, FORMER DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN: Yeah. And I don't think so. Listen, I've been involved in the -- in the confirmation process in 2016 as the communications director for the transition, so we handled the media strategy for all the cabinet designees. Listen, I think Pete is going to go through the same screening with everybody else. He's going to go through the same training. We're going to set up mock, you know, confirmations hearings. And his records are going to be exposed in a good way or in a negative way. But his record sounds really good to me. You know, two Ivy League degrees. You know, we had a previous candidate for president (INAUDIBLE) Ivy League degrees. It's good that we're celebrating Ivy League degrees today. But I think, you know, Pete's service is commitment to his country and his commitment to President Trump. You know, the president has his prerogative. He chose somebody who he's comfortable with.

So, you can have the experienced crew who has all these things, but they constantly make the same mistakes, so it's good to get somebody outside disruptive -- you know, McNamara, I was an admirer of his.

This is where Daniel Penny, a 26-year-old Marine vet, fatally pinned down Jordan Neely, a homeless 30-year-old man with a history of mental illness, on a New York City subway. Penny is now facing second-degree manslaughter and criminally- negligent homicide charges. He has plead not guilty, claiming he acted out of defense for the passengers on the subway car. And the government -- and the argument there is that Neely was making passengers on the subway feel unsafe. And the prosecution alleges Penny had good intentions, but went too far in trying to subdue Neely. Here's a look at what occurred on that subway train.

And while he did this, he signaled and said to Mr. Penny, I'm going to hold his arms down so you can let him go. But we know from video evidence and from testimony that Mr. Penny did not let go. In fact, he held Jordan Neely in that chokehold for nearly six minutes. Now, as you said, the defense has said that he was doing this in an attempt to protect the other passengers on the subway, many of whom have testified about feeling afraid and fearing for their lives when they saw Jordan Neely get on the train and start yelling about being hungry, about being thirsty, and about not being afraid of going to jail.",

Now, what does the word \"recklessly\" mean? It's consciously disregarding a risk to that person in a way that's unreasonable. Now, those are all vague terms.But he had good intentions. There's no question there was a threat that was presented. People were scared. One woman said, I was scared shitless. One person said, he terrified everybody in the train car. Fine. Right? But then the question is, was the chokehold, you know, sufficient to neutralize that threat? I think for the purposes of manslaughter in New York, you probably get there because of, number one, you have that video, with the amount of time, the number of people saying it. I think one person said, hey, man, you got a really good chokehold, you don't want to catch a murder charge, make sure he doesn't defecate on himself.

SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Those voices in her head that had made her crave food, experts call it food chatter, they were silenced. And that is part of the magic of these new medications. GLP-1 seems to act in a way that no other known hormone can. Here's how it seems to work. Every time you eat, all sorts of hormones are released, like GLP-1. They are called post-nutrient hormones. They travel here, to the hypothalamus, and the brain to tell you that you are full or satiated. [23:55:04] They also travel over here, to the pancreas, to kick out more insulin to help absorb the energy you just consumed. And also, over here, to your gut, to slow down the emptying, allowing you to better digest your food. In so many ways, it seems like the perfect hormone to help you stop eating as much.

And what it has taught us, I think, is that for some people, not everybody, but some people who have obesity, they -- they never really stop thinking about food and they never really feel full. It's kind of incredible spending time with people who have this sort of constant food chatter. Even as they're eating their meal, they're already thinking about their next meal. If their pantry doesn't have enough food in it, they get anxiety. So, you know, the way that we used to think about depression and addiction decades ago, people used to think depression, just pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
