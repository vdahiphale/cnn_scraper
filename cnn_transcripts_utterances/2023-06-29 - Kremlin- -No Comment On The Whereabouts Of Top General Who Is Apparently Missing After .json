Just yesterday, \"The New York Times\" reported that General Sergey Surovikin knew that Wagner mercenaries were plotting last week's insurrection.The independent \"Moscow Times\" reports that he is in custody, though CNN is still working to verify that. The Kremlin is referring our question to the Ministry of Defense. Surovikin is actually among a number of top Russian military commanders who have not been seen in public since the failed mutiny over the weekend. Also out of the public eye, the man who led the revolt, Yevgeny Prigozhin. The Kremlin says the Wagner chief was exiled to Belarus, but he hasn't been seen there yet. Russian state media says, before the insurrection, Prigozhin was told his mercenaries could no longer fight in Ukraine. CNN's Matthew Chance is live for us in Moscow. Matthew, no sign yet of some central figures.",

He's a former U.S. defense attache to Russia and a Wilson Center global fellow at the Kennan Institute General, what do you think about where Surovikin could be at this point? BRIG. GEN. PETER ZWACK, FORMER U.S. SENIOR DEFENSE ATTACHE TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION: Surovikin, he has either been arrested or been directed or taken himself out of public sight, which is more unlikely. I think with the news that's swirls and the distrust and paranoia that, in many ways, harkens back to the military to the Stalin era and a prelude to the great purge, though I'm not saying they're going this way. But you have -- nobody knows. And the fact that he hasn't come out, other than House statement early on during this chaos, is, yes, very revealing. And then, of course, this whole network with other generals that we're hearing rumors. And we have got to realize that there is so much distrust, inuendo, informants, disinformation. So we really have to be careful to parse out this information here. But what is for sure, things are really, really awry at the top levels of the Russian military, which translates into the society and, I think, has rocked the Kremlin.",

I have a feeling, if there are arrests coming on, there will be little mercy coming out of the Kremlin. I think that's a big question.The other big question is, while there's been talk about it, how is Russia going to digest, if you will, the Wagner Group? Are they going to give them those military contracts, the Ministry of Defense? Are they going to free them? Do they reunite in some way? No, I don't think so. There was talk about them going to Belarus. So there is a swirl all over what's going on. And one last point that I think is so important that adds to the intrigue, was the fact that Prigozhin on the push up through Rostov and up to Vernonish (ph), this so-called meeting outside of the southern military district. I've been there. This is a big deal. If he is sitting there having coffees with generals of the southern military district, while his forces are at that time, you know, roaring down a very, very good highway toward Moscow. If so, then he's in a lot of trouble. Those other generals are in a lot of trouble. And I think we see all kinds of potential factions. I think most of the Russian senior military will try to put their head down, pledge allegiance and all of that but what's going on in their heads? Huge fissures and cracks, I think, in this seemingly implacable authoritarian state.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLAUDINE GAY, PRESIDENT-ELECT, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: The Supreme Court's decision on college and university admissions will change how we pursue the educational benefits of diversity. For nearly nine years, Harvard vigorously defended our admissions process and our belief that we all benefit from learning, living and working alongside people of different backgrounds and experiences.

It's a very party line response to this ruling.You're hearing Republican after Republican, from the speaker of the House, on down to his rank-and-file praising this decision, hailing it, contending that no longer will people be discriminated against in the college admission process. On the other side of the aisle, Democrats furious, angry at the Supreme Court's decision. Senator Majority Leader Chuck Schumer contending it will be a major roadblock to the efforts to achieve racial justice in this country. You're hearing that being echoed down the line as well. Also, you're hearing from Democrats who are African American and Republicans who are African American viewing this issue quite differently. The Congressional Black Caucus, which is one of the major blocs on the House Democratic side, issued a statement expressing its outrage, saying: \"By delivering a decision on affirmative action so radical as to deny young people seeking an education equal opportunity in our education system, the Supreme Court has thrown into question its own legitimacy.\" Now, on the other side of the aisle, Byron Donald, who is one of a handful of African American Republicans, put out a statement saying: \"There was clearly a time when affirmative action was needed to end racial discrimination, but that time is over. The high court rightly ended the policy. Merit and achievement must be the number-one attribute that we all desire.\" So you're getting a flavor of just how both sides of the aisle are reacting to this historic decision and the views depend on which side of the aisle they sit on -- Boris?",

We don't know what this means, but it could mean a lot of different things. It could be just some additional inquiries. That happens sometimes when there's a pretty robust investigation after an indictment. There may be loose ends still to wrap up. But it also could mean that there may be other charges, potentially other defendants, potentially additional charges that prosecutors still are looking at, and they want to keep investigating, using this grand jury in Miami. And when you look at that indictment of Donald Trump that we have already, it's a pretty thorough story, but there are lots of questions that remain, especially what happened after June of last year before that FBI search and those documents were found and recovered by the federal government. So a lot of questions. Keep watching Florida, keep watching the special counsel's office because Donald Trump is headed to trial along with Walt Nauta, both entering pleas of not guilty. But there still may be legal risks that surrounds them and potentially others in this investigation -- Boris?",
