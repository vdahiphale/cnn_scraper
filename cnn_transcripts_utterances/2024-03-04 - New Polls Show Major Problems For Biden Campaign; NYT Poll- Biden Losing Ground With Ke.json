We're going to bring that to you when it happens. But first, tomorrow could mark an all but official end to the GOP primary season and the start of the general election campaign.And while Team Biden maintains that they are confident in their game plan, a weekend's worth of public polling has Democrats on edge to say the least. CNN Political Director David Chalian is here at the magic wall to break it all down. The floor is yours.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So take a look here. We got four polls over the weekend, all in the field last week that meet CNN standards for reporting. And what you see is a very similar story across all of them, Dana, which is that Donald Trump is numerically ahead of Joe Biden.Nationally, 47-45 in the Wall Street Journal, a couple of polls, New York Times and CBS just outside the margin of error. Wall Street Journal and Fox have Trump ahead inside the margin of error. No clear leader. And if you average all the polls together, our CNN poll of polls has it 48 percent Trump, 46 percent Biden. Again, this is national. We know about the path to 270. This is a national snapshot. And another thing to look at inside the New York Times poll is where Joe Biden is underperforming some key demographic groups that he had with him in 2020. So, again, I want to say this is a poll and these are exit polls of actual voters. Those are two different things, but instructive to look at. Under 30, in the New York Times poll, Biden's a 12 point advantage. That's half the size of his advantage in the 2020 exit polls. Female voters tied with Donald Trump. He had a 15-point advantage. Black voters, a 43- point advantage for Biden. That was a 75-point advantage in the 2020 election. And you see a similar story here with non-white no college voters. So voters of color without a college degree in the New York Times poll, Biden's advantage is six points. He had a 46-point advantage in the exit polls there. College graduates are the one place. The New York Times poll has a Biden advantage of 16. That's a little bit better than what he did with college graduates.",

We have been hearing him first and foremost talk about the fact that he is obviously very pleased about the Supreme Court decision to keep him on the ballot or prevent Colorado from taking him off the ballot and therefore other states as well because of the actions that he was involved with in and around January 6th.Then he veered into lots of other areas where we definitely have to fact check. Daniel, I want to first just say the last thing he was talking about immigration, which of course, has nothing to do with the Supreme Court decision today. He said a number of things that I hope that you get into, one of which was 20 million people he believes are in this country. We don't have any evidence to back that up and going on about the need for the president to use his executive authorities to, quote, unquote, \"close the border.\" There is an antiquated immigration system. Congress in a bipartisan way in the U.S. Senate tried to update it at least a little bit. And it was killed because the president did not want to give Joe Biden that political win. But let's start by talking, if you will, Daniel, about the allegations with absolutely no evidence that he was making against President Biden that he is behind all of the prosecutions that we are seeing both on a federal and state level. There is absolutely no evidence to back that up. In fact, there are -- there is a special counsel to provide not one, but two layers of distance between the president and these investigations. And that's just on a federal level.",

Appreciate it.We're going to quickly talk to our panel, CNN's Manu Raju, Laura Barron-Lopez of the PBS NewsHour, Seung Min Kim of the Associated Press. I'm glad that one of the many things that Daniel just said was about this notion that President Biden can use his executive action. I had the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on yesterday and I asked about any future executive action that they will use and he made that point that Daniel did that Donald Trump did use his -- the power of his pen without Congress and the courts overturned him.",

LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, I mean, there is -- the president and the White House is considering some type of executive action, which Seung Min has also reported, but I mean, again, it would likely face lawsuits from the progressive wing, from immigration advocates, and so that's something that we're seeing the president try to more forcefully act on.

And listening to his remarks, I was really interested on how much of the -- of his remarks he spent focusing on the immunity case, which is kind of his next big legal hurdle that will be facing aside from the hush money payments, a criminal case starting in a couple of weeks, because that shows you where his mind is.He is really thinking about the fact that he is trying to make the case that president, no matter what I -- what -- no matter what he does, is immune for his official acts in office. And that is just -- that goes to this whole legal strategy of how he's been trying to delay every single proceeding possible. Obviously, having the Supreme Court hear those arguments in the week of April 22nd, delaying those federal cases further is part of that strategy, and hopefully -- he's hoping that strategy takes him all the way through November and beyond.",

That we'll see how his opponents take advantage of that if they do. And I think what's also been -- also is Trump comes out and rails against all the prosecutions, the fact that Joe Biden has not said really anything about any of these criminal charges, they've tried to show that they had no involvement whatsoever, that has essentially created a vacuum of sorts, allowed Trump to come in and sort of define all these criminal charges or prosecutions against him as a political witch hunt.

They were young mothers, 22-year-old mothers who came alone with their children on this difficult journey and just were looking for this better life and trying to find jobs. And so that's on that.
