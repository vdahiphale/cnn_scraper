She told me before the Globes that she hopes to return, that she'd love to host again and again. And I could see that happening, so we'll wait to see next year.But she wasn't the only big winner of the night, John. Of course, there were big winners for both film and TV. So on the film side, \"Emilia Perez\" and \"The Brutalist\" were the top winners. And, as I said, the Golden Globes honors the best in both television and film. So on the TV side, it felt like a return to the Emmys where the leading shows were \"Shogun\" on the drama side and \"Hacks\" on the comedy side. Another huge winner of the night, Demi Moore, who as you said, won her first ever Golden Globe, which is almost hard to believe. But it wasn't that she just won and walked home with the trophy. She also won for best speech of the night, John. So let's look at a moment from her on stage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Thousands of flights have been delayed or canceled, many of those in D.C., where heavy snow is falling at this hour, and it could reach historic totals soon.Much of the city shut down, but a very active scene is happening outside Capitol Hill, as lawmakers are expected to soon certify the 2024 election despite this snow emergency.

There is a live cam. You're looking at Washington and the mall there. Of course, snow-filled, and the snow continues. A large, expansive snow system stretching from St. Louis all the way to the mid-Atlantic. And of course, we've got ice to the south and rain towards the southeast. But this storm stretches over 900 miles. We've got our winter weather alerts in place. And this is significant because looked what happened in Missouri. We had cars sliding off the highways. And then check out this 18-wheeler. Yes, that's sliding on ice, almost jackknifing right in front of this motorist. Dangerous driving conditions with the storm moving through. So the temperatures are supportive of snowfall. Lots of dynamics happening with this. But what I'm noticing here is just to the west of Washington, a bit of a drying trend. So will we make that historic snowfall total? Still to be determined, but not looking likely. We have to go back to January 2016 when we saw a storm total over a foot. And we called that the \"snowzilla\" snowstorm on the east coast. Many remember that. But additional snowfall to come, a good two to four inches in and around the nation's capital, higher amounts in the mountainous terrain. But we can't forget about the ice component to this storm, bringing difficult driving conditions across Interstate 70, 95, and then, of course, this is weighing down tree limbs and electrical wires, so we already have 250,000 customers without power across this area.

And I hope today will be a calm, peaceful day.But I want to say something, because as we are standing here and I'm looking out at the capital, law enforcement is out there in the cold, in the snow. More than 140 of them four years ago were injured and some died, and they have to take care of us today as we certify. They have a state funeral. They have an inaugural.

We need to -- tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. I don't believe in across the board tariffs, but in manufacturing, in steel and auto, they're a tool you need to look at.He and I both want to lower the cost of prescription drugs.

I want him to keep the auto industry strong. I don't think he wants anything to happen to the domestic auto industry. What does that mean? How do we compete in a global marketplace? There are a lot of areas that I want to work with him.

Because while we've cleared the snow, say, for most of our interstates, half-an-inch of ice is incredibly hard to treat if it's on every part of that road.So while we can spot treat, while we can do our best, you need to believe that any road you're going to drive on is going to have ice. Now, when the temperature falls, like it will, especially Wednesday and Thursday, but really even tomorrow, the salt doesn't work as well when the temperature gets colder and colder. We also have some wind gusts which are challenging. Because all those utility workers that are out there in the buckets that have to repair those lines, when the wind gusts get too high, it's not safe. So, we're asking people to stay off the roads, both for their safety and for the 2,300 Kentucky transportation cabinet workers that we have out there, as well as all those utility workers. I ask people to remember, those are Americans that leave their families to try to protect us, and we have a duty when we are out on the roads to protect them, as well. Like I said, we've got 2,300 transportation workers out there. We've got about 300 National Guard that are helping to get nurses and doctors to nursing homes and hospitals where they're needed. We've got utility workers that were prepositioned. Thankfully, through our news, through a bunch of great meteorologists, we had a lot of advanced notice of this storm. We've taken it seriously.

The reason it is a big risk this year is that we've been in a declining geopolitical system. Systems have been making less and less sense for a long time. This year, enter the unilateralist administration of Donald Trump, which is going to put the decline of international leadership on jet skis. That leaves a lot of room for rogue actors, a lot of room for market disruption. It's that complete absence, which is rare in diplomatic history, that complete absence of international leadership which leaves us so exposed this year. That's why it's our top risk.",
