And what I think they really mean is trivial, because I think we don't actually know what the evidence is.I mean, what was interesting reading the statement of facts is, yes, it relies very heavily on Michael Cohen, especially for two specific issues, but it also relies on David Pecker, who was the head of AMI, the head of the head of The National Enquirer. There was a detail in this statement of fact that I had not known before, which is that David Pecker apparently was brought to the White House to sit with Trump and Trump thanked him for help during the campaign. And so I think in terms of certainly the implications not just for Trump, but for the country in terms of the types of investigations, this one feels more trivial, but it's still a criminal case, assuming the judge allows it to go forward.",

And as I said, before, I was surprised when then the Southern District, an office that I have enormous respect for, stopped the case, and it didn't go anywhere. And at that time, therefore, we had moved on to financial crimes investigations , which led us to the Supreme Court twice and to the discovery of President Trump's tax returns and ultimately to the indictment of his company and his CFO. So, we were involved in many of the significant chapters that lead up today, but we did not charge. We did not make a decision to charge the former president on hush money payments. And I think the question, Jake, is not so much why didn't we bring the charge but why is District Attorney Bragg bringing the charge.

It is, as someone has said on this show earlier, a bread and butter charging decision by the D.A.'s office.During my time as district attorney, we also elevated the false business record charges to felonies, particularly in cases that we had brought against foreign banks who were hiding the source of their funding to move through the financial system that it was coming from sanctioned countries or entities. And that we did use that in some cases to elevate the misdemeanor to felony, but those were never tested by the defense counsel or by the defendants in those cases, they were simply not tested. So, it is an area of law that has not been fleshed out in New York. We never did a case involving where the object crime was an election law violation election. And law violations are quite specific. You know, they're quite technical. So, I do think that the first run of the defense will be to attack the legal basis for the charges in the hopes that they can knock the felony counts out and leave the case with a series of misdemeanor counts, which they will consider a victory both legally and would be considered a victory politically.",

So, that's what I think it is in his mind.Where I counsel to the former president, in an answer to your question, I think what he is saying is very, very ill-advised and repugnant and wrong. I think there is no place in this case for him to make the ad hominem and personal account personal attacks against the judge, the D.A. or family members. And I think it's also legally risky. As I've said before, there's a statute called obstruction of governmental administration in New York statutes and it is essentially impairing the operation of the functioning of government by threat or intimidation. And I think the president is drawing very close to the line where he could be at risk of being charged with those offenses. And the significance of that, if that were to happen in a superseding indictment, is it could turn a perceptually week indictment, on technical violations of election law, into something a jury would understand and be much more concerned about and of elevate the strength of the overall indictment against the president.

But the good news is, or at least from my perspective is, we were already prepared when I was district attorney when we indicted the Trump Organization and the chief financial officer. All that information was managed to be turned over to the defense in an organized way, in an earlier case, the one I've just described, and I'm confident that District Attorney Bragg and his team are going to be able to right away move to get the documents to the defense that's obligated, and that will be the first thing I think that happens.Then there will be, as I've said earlier, I think it attack on the legal sufficiency of the indictment and y on we go there's.

Can Donald Trump benefit politically like Bill Clinton benefited politically from something bad I think is the question before us.And it was a great interview in the sense that we're also sitting here wondering why is this process going to take so long, and he laid out the New York State law and he laid out the documents. So, you just talked about how the politics of this, the Hunter Biden investigation is could be, in many ways legitimate, but also has a heap load of politics on it. The case against Donald Trump, read the statement of facts, read the indictment, legitimate inquiry into bad business practices, cheating, if you will, hiding the hush money payments. How do you -- can you prove your case? August 8th is the next court hearing. This Republican debate, I think, ten days from that. Roughly, that point in August is the first Republican primary debate just after that hearing. In-person hearing on December 4th. Now, the people of Iowa kick off the actual voting, what, in early February, right, so two months from that. This case, as now scheduled, is going to track the American political system, and it starts with the primary system. And can Donald Trump -- you know, can he keep his hold?

It is bad to be indicted, and it's certainly bad to be indicted on these kinds of accusations. Because I think, you know, maybe you -- a lot of voters maybe may not know. Do they think it was illegal? Did they think it was bad? But some of these details are kind of bad.

That is something that McCarthy said also earlier in a statement today. A trio of House committees have been trying to investigate Bragg. They're trying to seek his testimony. But so far, Bragg has rebuffed their requests. But they are getting some support from Senate Republicans for this effort to investigate Bragg that includes someone like Thom Tillis, a member of GOP leadership, who hasn't always been aligned with Donald Trump. He has some significant comments from him there. We are still waiting to hear, though, from Mitch McConnell. That is one significant Republican that has yet to weigh in. And then, on the other side of the aisle, you have Democrats who are offering a pretty restrained response. You get a sense that they're trying to stay above the political fray.

But no one should be a target of the law. REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL):  It actually helps Donald Trump become the 47th President of the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But also, of course, this is the first time in the history of this Great Republic that a former president has been indicted and arraigned. It is not the first time we should note that a former President stands accused of committing crimes.Therefore, the point I'm trying to make is that one would think there would be a higher bar for this case, even though we are, yes, a country of laws, not men. Do you think this case is strong enough to warrant these historic charges?",

You do have to look at can you prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt, knowing the likely defenses and we hear the defense from Donald Trump the defenses, this is a politically motivated prosecution, I'm innocent, I never had that affair, et cetera. So you know, the prosecutor has to determine whether they believe they can prove the charges. The Manhattan D.A. believes that he can, and that would be put to the test.Now, I do think there are more serious charges against Donald Trump that are being considered in Georgia, and even more serious charges being considered by the Department of Justice. And I wish the Department of Justice, in particular, hadn't taken so long that that investigation wasn't taking so long because you would ideally want to see the strongest, most serious charges brought first. But that's not the fault of the Manhattan D.A. who brought the charges when the charges were ready, when the evidence, in his view, was present. But I do think that the Justice Department ought to have moved with a much greater sense of urgency. And then, we might be in a different case, different situation, at least in the order of charges.",

And I hear you. But I would note that while you're talking about the Department of Justice, the Department of Justice, according to reporting looked into charging Donald Trump with that specific campaign finance crime. And they declined.",
