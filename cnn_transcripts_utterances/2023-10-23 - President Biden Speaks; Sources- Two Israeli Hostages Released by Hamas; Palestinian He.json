In a statement, we've just received Hamas's that the two were released for humanitarian as well as health reasons. One source who was briefed on the matter says the two are Israeli citizens. And other says that were released to the Red Cross and Israeli official says the hostages are not back in Israel as of yet. This follows of course, are you remember the release of Natalie and Judith Raanan just last week Jeremy Diamond is in Ashkelon. Jeremy, just bring us up to date with the very latest because we know this is very sensitive issue. What more do we know at this stage about these two hostages?",

Well, this appears to be the result of mediation efforts that have been led by theGovernment of Qatar as well as some assistance it seems from Egyptian officials. What we do not yet know is where exactly these hostages are? Apparently they are two women. We have yet to officially confirm their identities but they are Israeli citizens and they appear to have been released into the custody of the Red Cross initially, whether they're currently in Egypt or still in the Gaza Strip remains unclear at this stage. But according to one source, they are not yet in Israel. A Hamas for its part says that it released these hostages, \"for compelling humanitarian and health reasons\". They also point to some reluctance on the part of the Israelis to release them. We know that there had been some back and forth over the weekend between Hamas saying that it was willing to release these two female hostages, and the Israeli saying that they were not going to play into Hamas propaganda. But regardless, what appears to have happened now is that this is now the second set of hostages who have been released by Hamas in just a matter of days with the most recent being on Friday evening, when the first two hostages, two American women, the Judith Raanan and Natalie Raanan were released into Israel. Now, what we know is playing out in the background of all of this is that Hamas is trying to delay a potential Israeli ground invasion, they have dangled the possibility repeatedly now of releasing hostages in exchange for humanitarian relief for Gaza, and also for some kind of Israeli ceasefire. And in the background of all of this, we know that U.S. officials have now also been pressuring is the Israeli government to delay its ground invasion in order to allow for more time for mediation efforts to get more hostages released.",

The American government has made clear that while it supports Israel's right to defend itself. And will be behind Israel if it decides to move forward with the ground invasion. You know, the Biden Administration has made clear that its priority is also getting hostages in particular U.S. citizens who are still believed to be held by Hamas, to get them released. At the same time, the Israeli government has made very clear that it is going to move forward with this invasion. They want to deal a blow to Hamas, like never before they want to destroy a Hamas and ensure that it is no longer the ruling power in Gaza after this military operation. And so there are bigger picture objectives that the Israeli government has here certainly, beyond getting these hostages released. But at the same time, there are pressures including from the U.S. government in order to allow these efforts to play out to try and get some of these hostages out in particular those civilians and dual nationals.",

And therefore, all of these efforts have had to go through the Qataris as well as the Egyptians who, of course, have a border with the Gaza Strip and do regularly interface with Hamas officials. So these talks have been happening quietly in the background, there are, you know, rumors and discussions of potentially larger releases of civilian hostages from Gaza. But these are complicated and very sensitive matters of course, you know, Hamas has been trying to get some kind of a ceasefire out of Israel in order to allow for the release of additional hostages. But Israel wants to make sure that it is not moving forward based on Hamas's terms. And they also want to make sure that they are able to carry out their objective, which is to ensure that Hamas no longer rules Gaza, and no longer poses the kind of threat that they pose two weeks ago, to Israeli civilians in Israel.",

But it does appear that the kind of overwhelming overriding sentiment in this country is focused on dealing that kind of a significant blow to Hamas. To ensure that it can never again carry out the kind of shocking and barbaric attacks that he carried out on Israeli towns, on Israeli civilians killing them inside of their homes just over two weeks ago. And I think that while Israel is willing to delay perhaps for a few days. It's ground invasion to allow some more time for the release for the negotiations at least to potentially lead to the release of these hostages. I think if you listen to the rhetoric, saying you're going to see the inside of Gaza troops telling them we will enter Gaza just this evening, the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant saying that this operation will move forward.

And so, you know, we're obviously staying in touch with all the parties involved. But right now, the four main parties that we understand are, of course, Israel, the United States, and then the two who are speaking directly with Hamas are Qatar and Egypt. Isa?",

      "sentences": "Isa, this is the reality on the ground for many doctors, for many medics that we've been hearing from justactually last couple of hours. We heard from a British Palestinian, Dr Ghassan Abu-Sitta who is working at the Al-Shifa Hospital. He spoke to Christiane Amanpour. It's one of the biggest hospitals in Gaza. Around 5000 patients there right now. And he said that without the electricity that this hospital so desperately needs, this hospital is going to turn into a mass grave. And look, we've heard those evacuation orders and warnings from the IDF. Many doctors, particularly those from Doctors Without Borders, international support teams as well on the ground have said that they cannot evacuate all their patients. They have babies in incubators. They have the elderly who require that medical assistance and they cannot evacuate those patients. And what we are seeing now unfolding inside Gaza has been described as a humanitarian catastrophe. The aid that we're seeing coming in now it's just a tiny fraction of what Gaza needs. In fact, over the last two weeks was we've seen Gaza under siege, less than one percent of the aid that Gaza would typically need has been brought in following the opening of the Rafah border crossing. So, you can imagine the situation on the ground. We've been hearing from Palestinians inside Gaza, who've told us that they are living a nightmare. Again, that they've experienced displacement once before the vast majority, of course of people in Gaza are refugees. Displaced after 1948 war -- Arab- Israeli war. And this is something that they fear deeply. And we've been speaking to Palestinians here in Jordan. Palestinian refugees who still have loved ones inside Gaza. They are terrified about what they are facing. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR (voiceover): Through the narrow streets of Amman's Jabal el-Hussein Refugee Camp, the mood is clear.",

We have heard from Lifshitz's daughter who said that the two women have been released that they were handed over to the Red Cross at the Rafah crossing. The Rafah crossing, Isa, is in southwestern Gaza. It borders Egypt and Gaza. It's where the aid has been going into Gaza. So, we understand from this family statement that the two women were handed over to the Red Cross inside Gaza at Rafa and then transported, we assume, because it's the Rafah crossing into Egypt, at which point we are told they are soon going to be handed over to Israeli officials. So, this is the second release of Hamas prisoners. Since Friday, we saw two American women. Judith and Natalie Raanan who were released on Friday afternoon, Friday evening, local time. And then this begs the question, of course, Isa, what does Hamas have planned next, in terms of releases? Obviously, they're seeing the pressure growing on Israel because they have shown a willingness to release more prisoners. And of course, Qatar and Egypt have been negotiating quite intensely on behalf of the U.S., the other countries who have foreign nationals among the hostages and Israel to release all of the hostages immediately.

And, you know, what Alex says there really raises thequestion of what happens next in terms of Israel. What does it do? Does it go from this ground incursion? How soon does it do it? Israel's defense minister says the country is preparing for what it calls a multilateral operation on Hamas from the air, the ground and sea. And it comes hours after Israel says it hit more than 300 terror targets in Gaza overnight on Sunday. Palestinian authorities say those strikes killed some 436 people reporting that residential buildings and the Jabalia Refugee Camp run long what was impacted. All of this comes as troops and equipment builds up as you can see there on the Israel-Gaza border. Our Nic Robertson has the very latest for you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voiceover): Bristling with battle ready troops. Farmer's fields north of Gaza churn with a controlled fury of a nation readying for an incursion to strike Hamas. Yet they are waiting with no explanation why. ROBERTSON (on camera): It feels like that early rush for battle readiness has passed. The troops are deployed standing by. The question is how long can they be kept out here?
