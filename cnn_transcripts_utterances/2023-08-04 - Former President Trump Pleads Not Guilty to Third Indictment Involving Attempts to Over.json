You see all the fake electors scheme, you see the preparation for that, you see going and calling these different states, but you don't see anything about the actual assault on the Capitol.And I think that gives -- earlier in your piece as I saw David Chalian, you have an interaction about Kevin McCarthy and some of these Republican responses. And I think that not having that charge in there about the insurrection, about the assault on the Capitol, allows people to kind of say, listen, this is about something else. This isn't about that violent insurrection we saw. This is really about a dispute about how the election played out, right. That's why McCarthy is pushing back and saying it's like Gore-Biden, it's like Clinton, it's like others. It gives them space to do that.

And I think that they felt -- I don't obviously know, but I think that they felt that if they charged something on January 6th, it would be a higher bar, much longer road to get there. I think they feel they're on much firmer ground here. But I think that there is no -- you can't defend the assault on the Capitol.

More important than a Congress that is passing a law is public sentiment. And what he meant by that was not a snap public opinion.What he meant was that at a certain point in the country's history, there's a settled feeling that comes upon the country, that something is right, and something is wrong, something doesn't meet the ideals of the country. That's what happened as the anti-slavery movement built up its momentum. So, that finally slavery was going to have to end. Once public sentiment knew that it was inevitable it was going to go. Right now, the challenge is for the country, to build up an overwhelming understanding that what President and former President Trump has tried to do is wrong. It's against the ideals of the country. And I think that's why it's so important that the trial be on television, so we can see what's at issue. That's why it's so important that we talk as we are this morning about what the peaceful transition of power means. It's not just a slogan, it's something that humanly has shown character of the people who've run for office, that they're willing at that hardest moment to accept loss. And if public sentiment can be changed, so far, there's a rock bottom Republican Party, that's not willing to do it. That's still not the majority of the country, that the country has to organize at every level, to make sure that public sentiment changes, if it changes. And if it overwhelmingly understands what's happened. And if the trials and the indictments helped to do it as January 6 then. Then, we're going to be OK. If it doesn't, then Lincoln's worry will be absolutely my worry as well.",

Why do you think a televised trial? Why do you think anything can change where the 35 percent of where Trump supporters have been or where a significant portion of Republicans have been due to the power that Trump has in the party, whatever change?",

So, you're getting a different story in different places. But if a trial is there, it's going to be like in the old days.When FDR gave a radio chat, 80 percent of the radios will be tuned in, it was the only thing on the air in the 1960s up till the time of cable, you had three television networks, essentially saying the same thing, the same facts, if not different opinions. But a trial will be watched, a trial will be there. You're not going to be able to change the facts of the trial, even though it could be interpreted differently.",

But as I say, democracy is so simple, you have to accept that the people who lose accept the loss. And that's what allows us to distinguish ourselves from other people around the country, around the world.And I think if this trial shows that was not accepted, and acts were taken to change the results of it, as a result of it, and that's wrong and against democracy, then it will be the most important trial in the country, bar none. This is a moment as important in our history as 1860 was, and it took a civil war to solve that problem when democracy was under attack. And let us hope that we can do it through our own understanding education, truth its -- television is going to be very important. The internet is going to be very important how this is all discussed in these next days and weeks and months ahead, is going to be an educational process for the country. And it better come out with an understanding of what's happened. So, we can really make a judgment. What do we as a people want? What is the character of the person on trial? What is the trial about? All of these things are essential, it's essential for President Trump as well. You would want -- we'd hope that he would hope that if he thinks he can make a change and in the public's opinion, that people who do not think he's done the right thing. It's absolutely a central happened before the election so that we can know that as we go to the election.",
