If you've ran a campaign, and Patti can also speak to this, I don't think there's a strategy that would say those are bad things. In terms of the overall impact, I think this is sort of a signal to the former president that you're not running against Joe Biden. You're running against a formidable candidate. And if you're going to win this thing, then you are going to have to be disciplined in terms of your message and staying focused on what is most important and consequential to voters, particularly those who are not a part of the MAGA crowd, who the former president will need in order to get this thing across the finish line.",

I'm figuring out where some of the vice president's struggles are. And if I'm advising Trump, what is the message that I need to hone in on and hit over and over and over again to penetrate to, I think, the 16 percent of undecided in Pennsylvania, to say, I am a better option then my opponent. Patti's right, this is going to be a very, very close race. Perhaps even closer than 2020. So, maybe you're looking at, John, a 2 percent marginal difference. And again, a state like Pennsylvania, that could make the difference. Both candidates are going to be fighting for that 2 percent. Can you make a convincing enough argument that you're the better option than the other person. People always say voters don't care about policy. I don't actually agree with that. The data suggests otherwise. And the person who provides the best solution in terms of policy to move the country forward is the person who, I believe, will ultimately win.",

Of course, this company owns \"The Wall Street Journal,\" Fox News, \"The New York Post,\" and assets around the world. The idea was that the four children, together, would decide what to do with the family business. But now Rupert Murdoch is in court right now in Reno, Nevada, fighting all this week to blow up the trust that he created, to change the rules, and to put his oldest son, Lachlan, in charge. Essentially, Kate, he does not trust his other children to run the companies in the future. He only trusts his son, Lachlan. And so there's this crazy court battle now underway, completely in secret.

He had a plan, or has a plan, to do so, but he would need the support of his sisters. In other words, if there's four votes, it will be three against one, and he could take over Fox News after his dad dies. That seems to be what Rupert Murdoch is trying to stop.
