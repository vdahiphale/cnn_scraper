Plus, a deadly airport runway inferno. Two planes collide. Five on one jet killed, nearly 400 on another escaped alive. How did the planes end up on the same runway in the first place? And a senior leader of Hamas assassinated apparently in an explosion in Beirut. Hezbollah has warned Israelis that any such action in Lebanon would merit a response. Is the situation in the Middle East about to get even worse? (MUSIC)",

They've now decided to accept the resignation of Claudine Gay, the first black president of Harvard's nearly 400-year history, just a second woman to ever lead this university. As you noted, it was just three weeks ago that the Harvard Corporation, the school's top board, they voiced their unanimous support for Gay. Now, they're accepting the resignation.Let me read you what the corporation said in a statement. They said that Gay has shown, quote, remarkable resilience in the face of deeply personal and sustained attacks. While some of this is played at the public domain, much of it has taken the form of repugnant and, in some cases, racist vitriol directed at her through disgraceful emails and phone calls. Now, the Harvard Corporation, they said they are accepting this resignation with sorrow. They did note that Gay should acknowledge some before missteps along the way. Still, this raises questions, what changed over the last three weeks? Now, we know that the plagiarism scandal around Gay has only escalated. There has been this drip, drip, drip of revelations, lawmakers have been demanding a mountain of documents from Harvard and mega donors have pulled their funding. So, after all of this, the board and Claudine Gay decided that her presidency, after just six months, is over.",

You know, no university wants students to think that, if they get accused of plagiarism, that there's hypocrisy afoot. JOHNSON: Absolutely not. This is actually essential. So, I -- I think asking a president to resign because congressional leaders don't like their testimony, that's not something that I support. A president found to have committed serious acts of research misconduct or scholarly misconduct, including forms of plagiarism, very might will be asked to resign. But unfortunately, we didn't see here an actual investigation consistent with Harvard's procedures for dealing with faculty research misconduct. So, you know, we've had instances in the past where prominent, well-respected faculty have been accused of plagiarism. We have had incidents -- there isn't a faculty committee that is formed, a serious investigation into their actions according to the highest scholarly standards. And then appropriate actions are taken, which can include apologies, which can include corrections, which can include, you know, censure. And that's actually a kind of response I would have liked to have seen. So, not a statement from a governing board, which isn't composed of academics and scholars, and I don't know by what standard they decided that -- you know, how to decide if something is a serious issue or not, but rather using the procedures that are already in place at Harvard and that wasn't done.",

EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTERJake, to take advantage of this moment and get people focused on what the candidates are actually talking about and say, these are extreme visions of what the presidency would be. Not only Donald Trump at all the candidates. They do think Donald Trump is the likeliest nominee at this point, but they're ready to make that case against every single one of the candidates. These are dark visions, extreme vigilance of the presidency, they'll say. They want to get voters to start focusing on that, start thinking about it. Not just in terms of the legal drama about Donald Trump, but what it would mean for him to return to the presidency. And they think they can do that on a parallel track to the next month for Joe Biden, which is going to be the buildup to the state of the union, likely the beginning of February, when he's going to start talking more fulsomely about what his own vision of a second term would be.",

And then, CNN anchor Erin Burnett will host a town hall with former Ambassador Nikki Haley. Both of those Thursday night right here on CNN, 9:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. Eastern. And then next week, Dana Bash and I are going to moderate the CNN Republican presidential debate. That will be Wednesday, January 10, just five days before the Republican Iowa caucuses.

Should they each come over their own process? Is there a role for congress?Well, not surprisingly, Trump's team argues that the individual states, particularly individual state officials who are either appointed or elected, should not have this kind of power. So, they are appealing within the state court system in Maine. They're not yet appealing to the Supreme Court. Again, this is a process, asking them to overturn the secretary of state's decision and put him back on the ballot. Now, her decision is currently on pause. So, we're waiting to see how this resolves within the Maine court system. But at the same time, we're still waiting for Trump to file his appeal to the Supreme Court about the Colorado decision. I've said it once, I've said it again, Jake. This is a big mess. We have disputes among states. Everybody making decisions different ways, different opinions on Section Three of the 14th Amendment, the Supreme Court must weigh in.",

We're hearing about skin diseases, of respiratory infections spreading across parts of southern Gaza. Now, as we know, some 1.9 Palestinians in Gaza are now internally displaced with no where else to turn. And there is real concern now as the Israeli military set to expand its military operation.
