She has also, this is crucial, secured the required delegates to get the party's nomination. Money-wise, she's brought in a stunning haul, more than $100 million raised between Sunday and Monday for more than 1 million donors, 62 percent of whom had never donated to a campaign before. That's a big number when you talk to campaigns. This all coming from a campaign official. CNN's Isaac Dovere joins me for more on how this campaign is heating up. Listen, these are good numbers -- the money of the volunteers, the endorsements, and the timeframe of them. I mean, the amount of money coming in a short period of time, particularly small donors first-time donors, and the timeframe of her getting the party's backing now. Things are going to -- it's a long campaign, right? I mean, I wonder what your view is of this. Is this -- is this a lasting bump for her as the new nominee?

But I digress.On the Trump side, look, they need to just simply transfer what they were doing to Harris. They should not -- I think the danger here will be to overthink this, over-complicate it, you know, over-nuance it. The bottom line is, she's been Joe Biden's right-hand person during inflation, during immigration, all the things that you don't like. And so, I think the danger sometimes in campaigns is just to try to overdo it or over complicated, they really need to resist that. They are now running against someone younger. And so, obviously, that is going to be used by Democrats. So they're going to have to continue to stay vigilant on the front of showing that Trump is a vigorous, you know, commander in chief. And they did not have any trouble contrasting themselves that way against Joe Biden, obviously. And so, now, they've got a different person to run against here. And that has to be also I think top of mind for how you frame the race. Remember, the whole thing was around strength versus weakness. That was how Trump wanted to run the race. And so, they have to continue to try to do their part of that framework showing Trump being strong and finding the political arguments that would show Harris to be weak. She's not going to be lethargic. She's not going to, you know, be sort of the way Biden was able to be portrayed, obviously. So, they're going to have to go down this framework on issues more than just the image of the two candidates.",

Tell me your response to that line.

And so, when you insult the biggest electorate in the country, that is not a smart campaign strategy. And, you know, what I would say about, you know, Scott's right about the strategy that they should actually follow. But we all know how bad Donald Trump is at following strategy and at doing what his campaign advisors tell him to do.The first thing out of the press that he did its called the vice president dumb as a rock. So if you want to expand your voter base and God knows Republicans and MAGA, especially, especially since they doubled down on their MAGA base with the choice of J.D. Vance as V.P., they absolutely need to expand their voter base. They're not going to do that with African-American voters by treating the first African American vice president, and now major nominee for president, the way they are. They're not going to do that with women. They're not going to do that with Latino voters that they continue to talk about mass deportation camps all across the country and wanting to rip families apart. So good luck with trying to add to what they need to add in order to win. And as Kamala makes, sorry, the future president of the United States, makes the contrast between the prosecutor that she is and the 34 times convicted felon that Donald Trump is, and using that as the frame of all of the issues that we know are incredibly popular with the American electorate, I think its going to be a great contrast to make.

She has numerous liberal viewpoints. She has espoused them. She had the most liberal voting record in the U.S. Senate when she was there, even more liberal than Bernie Sanders. So she's all in on being a liberal progressive. And I think it would make it difficult -- I mean, the Haley voters, I don't think of themselves as liberals.

But really I think it's safe to say that the appointment of Roe after Director Cheatle's resignation, it is really likely to quell what's been a groundswell of criticism that the agency has faced in those ten days since the assassination attempt. You know, there are currently. Jim, numerous inquiries into the Secret Service response, as well as their potential lack of proper preparation here. We've heard most vehemently from House Oversight Chairman James Comer, he said this in a statement after Director Cheatle's resignation. He said: There will be more accountability to come. The Secret Service has a no fail mission, yet it failed historically on Director Cheatle's watch. While Director Cheatle's resignation is a step toward accountability, we need a full accounting of how the security failures happen, so that we can prevent them going forward. And what's interesting, Jim, is that, you know, today, there's been another congressional hearing. Pennsylvania law enforcement, they're testifying, and we're hearing some about the lapse of security here. They testified that several minutes actually lapsed between when local law enforcement climbed up on that roof where that would be assassin was perched. And a few minutes between that and when he assassin or would be assassin actually fired his shots, it turns out the officer climbed up on the roof and actually fell off once the shooter aimed at him. So definitely a bungled law enforcement response, Jim, where there will be the a lot of questions as several investigations are actually ongoing now.",

And we've now had more than nine months of parents every single day, meaning to find the fortitude to continue to tell their children that it's going to be okay, and it is going to be all right, when many of them don't actually believe that themselves.And so as you say, whether it's -- whether it's violence from the skies, whether it's displacement. You know, we're talking now in many areas about 600 people per toilet and we're surprised that we are seeing, you know, waterborne and infectious diseases, now, we have been warning about this again and again and again. And I would say that we have also been prevented from bringing in portable toilets, the one of the things which we've had issues with previously. And so we continue to call for a ceasefire is the only way to protect children, to protect families, and to end this horror. You know, release the hostages, a ceasefire as soon as possible. Otherwise, our predictions will continue to come true and our predictions are that the situation will only get worse.",

She did not come out early on things like cannabis legalization, which its important to note, Governor Gavin Newsom helped sponsor legalization in California. I think she was always cautious.I also think she was held to a different standard as a woman of color and law enforcement and she was very aware of that. But on the other hand, you know again, a lot of I think activists on the left who are very angry about her lack of standing up and sticking her neck out on police accountability measures when she was attorney Bernie general, that was definitely out there. You know, on the other hand, she -- as I said, like she's not a lock them up law and order prosecutor. And I do think that you've seen some of this change. In 2019 when she was mounting that presidential campaign, we were about to come into the George Floyd's summer. It was a lot of movement on the left around this question of police and how they should be held accountable. I think in this moment, she's in a better position because there's a bit of backlash to that. Let's be real. And so, in this campaign, I think you're going to hear that. She's going to try to kind of have it both ways. And in some ways that's fair. And I also think there's a lot of people in communities of color, both here in San Francisco and statewide that appreciate some of the things she's done. They're not a monolith obviously. So, yeah, caution I think is really the key word here. She knew that she would be under a microscope her whole career and she really was and she had earn back some trust from police and other law enforcement because whatever first move her as D.A. was declining to seek the death penalty against a man who had killed a police officer. That really angered the police. His family, Isaac Espinosa, that officer has continued to put that against her. I expect that they will in this campaign as well.",
