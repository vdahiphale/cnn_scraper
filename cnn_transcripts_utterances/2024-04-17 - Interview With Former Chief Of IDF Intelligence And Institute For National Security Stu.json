We should balance three strategic aims that slightly contradicts one another or are lying in tension between them. First, we must somehow rebalance the deterrence that was eroded. Iran must not have the perception of abling to strike Israel from its sovereign state. It is unprecedented. It was -- it happened 30 years ago that the sovereign state target Israel directly with the barrage over 300 warheads. Second, we must not expand the war beyond the limits right now, and that will focus -- will refocus our attention. It will divide our attention between Gaza and other elements. We must be focused on Gaza. So, in that term, any kind of response that will escalate it to a full-scale confrontation with Iran is negative. And third, we must maintain and preserve the international coalition that worked together with Israel in order to defend Israel, and especially United States. So, if you sum that all to a recommendation, we should work -- we should retaliate in Iran soil, but time is not pressuring us. We have time. We -- and we -- and by the way, what's happening right now in Iran is in favor with the Israel interest, the internal pressure against the Iranian regime, blaming it for its arrogancy. And second, we can work differently in a more clandestine operation, special operation. We have done that before. It's something that the Iranian regime tries to hide from its civilians, that Israel has that kind of a capability. I do not recommend on a full-scale war with Iran right now. We have still the war objectives to obtain in Gaza. So, in that terms, moving to a more special operation kind of way is preferable. And maybe continue striking Iran militias that are trying to hurt Israel, as we speak right now, in other countries like Lebanon, like Syria, et cetera.",

He is the commander in charge over Lebanese Hezbollah, who is constantly bombarding our northern border. And all -- and everybody knows that Iran is pulling the strings behind all of that operation. Iran is directly instructing Mahdavi, as the Quds Force commander, to drive Hezbollah to do what it does. So, it's a matter of pressure. The logic is -- we will still have to see whether it works out for us.

Those are two mistakes, no doubt about it. But still something has changed dramatic in terms of the Iranian self- confidence and power projections in the era -- in the arena. The fact that they've allowed themselves, that supreme leader that was known for his moderate approach and how he's afraid from risking his own country for the past years has changed his strategy, has changed his policy. And you must ask yourself whether that is something that create a safer Middle East or a more dangerous Middle East. I argue that over self-confidence by Iranians, having the fact that they are controlling militias all across the Middle East is a very negative element. I think this is why all the international coalition that was formulated in Saturday night to block the Iranian activities, that was the motivation behind of us.

But if you would ask them that repeatedly, if we're going to face a routine -- a new routine of that kind of a tool, that is Iranian direct threat by missiles toward Israel to be something of our new -- next day reality.

And then days and weeks later, we've been recording more cases about confrontations between the Palestinian armed groups and the Israeli soldiers in different areas, including on the vicinity of Al Shifa Hospital as we have been reporting on -- within the past few weeks, and that's completely contradictory to what the Israeli military had been saying to the public, in different media press and statement released by its political and military officials in the army. What I can say is that as we've been hearing and seeing on the ground that there is no any, until now, full control by the Israeli military on the Gaza Strip. They are saying that they're controlling but what we can see and hear from eyewitnesses that battles are still ongoing without any lit up in fighting.",

After later, being released and they have -- as I mentioned earlier, they have killed our colleagues as they were doing their job. If there's going to be any practical blindness for the Israeli decision to ban Al Jazeera, it seems that we are about to lose one of the most prominent and used channels in the Middle East, recovering all the latest developments on the ground.

Of course, 1,100 Israelis, most of them civilians also dead, many hostages still in Hamas' control. Hamas still believes it was worth it. Their argument is, we wanted to draw back global attention to Israel-Palestine. We felt it was slipping away. We felt the U.S. didn't care about a resolution to this conflict. And to some extent, we felt Arab states had stopped caring, and so we really needed this kind of big explosion. In their telling, their narrative is, this isn't about October 7th, per se, you know, specifically they use this phrase, history didn't begin on October 7th. So, they're talking about this kind of, obviously, decades long Israeli policy of subjugating Palestinians to a large degree, right?

We have had people speak up against Hamas rule, and they do acknowledge that. So, I did press them on a couple of surveys done by quite respected Palestinian pollsters. And I said, look. I talked to people when I was in Gaza in 2019, who said -- I vividly remember this one woman, I'll never forget, right. She said, I have not been able to practice as a lawyer since Hamas took over because I refused to cover my head in court. Because I don't want to do that. That's not my belief. Their argument is, we tolerate everyone, we understand that there are some people who are more secular, we understand there are people of different ideologies. They are not -- they accept that they do not speak for all or even the majority of the Palestinian people. I think what's so striking is that they say -- and this is really hard to dispute, polls in the West Bank, in Gaza, do show that the majority of Palestinians are supportive of resistance towards Israel.
