Active shooter drills, threats of guns near campus that shut down school. And, now unfortunately, tragically, these school shootings. You, know we have kind of a limited window where this becomes normal for kids and they just developed a callous and it just becomes something that they have to deal with.

And in America, actually, we have at least two dozen days throughout the year that have anniversaries of more than one mass shooting.
