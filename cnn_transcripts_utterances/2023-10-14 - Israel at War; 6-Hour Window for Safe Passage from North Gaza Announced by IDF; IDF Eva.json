      "sentences": "And welcome to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada, and all around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber with CNN's breaking news coverage of Israel at war.The Israeli military says it will allow people in North Gaza safe passage to Southern Gaza during a six-hour window that's now in effect. The IDF also says, an airstrike on Friday killed a senior Hamas commander who was behind much of last weekend's carnage. United Nations is slamming Israel for ordering the mass evacuation of Palestinians from Northern Gaza and allowing those people so little time to get out. One official called it outrageous and said it defies, \"The rules of war and basic humanity.\" Tens of thousands of people have already fled south over the past 24 hours, but many others are staying put. Now, a sudden surge of people into Southern Gaza has put a lot of pressure on the Rafah Border Crossing into Egypt, the only place to actually leave Gaza. Egypt says, they haven't closed it on their side, but its status is unclear due to Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza side. All right. With us now from Tel Aviv is IDF Spokesperson Major Doron Spielman. Thank you so much for being here with us. So, the U.N. spoke yesterday about a 24-hour deadline to evacuate Gaza City, which is now long since to past. Can you clarify, how long do those in Gaza City have to evacuate? MAJ. (RES.) DORON SPIELMAN, IDF SPOKESPERSON: So, first of all, the residents in Gaza City are a priority for the State of Israel. Unfortunately, they are not a priority for the Hamas terror organization. Hamas, we really should be asking them, what are your contingency plans? When you came over the border and massacred innocent Israelis, took them off as hostages, what did you think we would do? And of course, we can say that they assume we would of course, like any normal country, come back and tried to completely annihilate their efforts and never do this again. And just left their civilians as hostages, they took all of them, 2 million civilians are hostages of Hamas in Gaza right now. We are the only ones that are actually trying to save these people by opening a humanitarian corridor. We know it's going to take time. We did create and ask for it to be done within 24 hours, but we're doing everything we can, including taking operational risks so that those people can make it to safety.",

Again, Hamas is keeping them there. We know for a fact that Hamas is trying to keep civilians in Gaza there.We are the Israel Defense Forces. We're here to defend our civilians. Hamas is the opposite. They use their civilians to defend them. So, we're doing everything we can.

At the same time, as hard as this is to believe, they told their wives and children -- I know your viewers, any sane person can't imagine this, they said to their wives and children, go to sleep above us in the apartment buildings. It's so absurd.And we assume also that our hostages, of course, they would be using them for the same cynical purposes. What I can tell you is we are working operationally on the ground in many, many ways to try, of course, and free our hostages. But at the same time, we say clearly to Hamas, our hostages and nothing else you're going to do are going to save you from the dedication of the State of Israel, which has declared war, to completely annihilate any capabilities that they have in the future.",

Some are disabled, some are in hospitals, some are elderly. They will not be able to leave, and therefore, could fall victim to continued airstrikes that are ongoing.And of course, there is a huge amount of concern amongst the Palestinian population in Northern Gaza. They will be evacuated southwards but won't be able to return to their homes. Many have spoken, we've heard them in their social media posts. Many have spoken to our teams on the ground. Saying that they fear that they will be made refugees. That they won't be able to return home. And of course, this is a deeply distressing and sensitive issue. The vast majority of Gaza's population are of course descendants of Palestinians who were either forcibly displaced or fled their homes during the 1947 conflict. So, this is something that is at the forefront of their minds. And of course, we have to remember that Gaza is still under a blockade, a land, sea, and air blockade enforced by Israel since 2007. And now, currently, is under complete siege. That means no food, no water, no electricity, and no fuel is getting in. Hospitals are running on just a few hours of electricity each day.

Hundreds of others have been injured in clashes with Israeli troops and settlers in the region. As Becky Anderson reports, some of those incidents were caught on camera. Now, we just want to warn you, some of the images in the report are disturbing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL NEWS ANCHOR (voice-over): A disturbing sight. An Israeli settler shooting a Palestinian point blank in the South Hebron Hills. While the man who was shot in this video did survive, many others who confronted with settler violence across the occupied West Bank recently have not. CNN has reached out to Israel's police for comment on this shooting but has not received a response. Nearly a week into the war between Hamas and Israel, at least 47 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by settlers and Israeli forces, with hundreds of others injured. Fears that the violence would spill over into this area are beginning to feel very real. At the heart of the conflict, this place, Al-Aqsa Mosque, usually filled with tens of thousands of worshippers, gathered for Friday prayers, today almost empty. The Israeli police restricting access to the compound only letting in the elderly. 57-year-old Untama (ph) says, seeing the compound so empty is upsetting. The atmosphere was so tense. It was difficult getting in, she says. We are just going there to pray. We're not going to fight. We're not going to war. What is a worshipper expected to do? Meantime, piles of prayer mats as younger Palestinians were forced to worship on the streets. Abbas (ph) was one of them. He says, this feels like an inflection point in this decades-long conflict. It's very different this time around, he says. This time it feels more difficult. May God grant us relief. Fridays can be fraught here. Over the years, all too often, these streets have witnessed clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police. And today, stun grenades, tear gas, and skunk water used to disperse local residents and worshippers. Munir Kamal (ph) was reportedly one of them. His nephew, Qasem (ph), said that his uncle was attacked by Israeli police as he tried to pray close to his home after being barred from Al-Aqsa. Like many civilians here, Qasem (ph) fears for his family's safety. What's happening is very ugly. I can't explain it to my kids. I'm trying to distract them, so they don't get scared, Qasem says. So, many people here scared about what happens next. They robbed us of our homeland, and now they punish us here in Al- Aqsa, and they punish the people of Gaza. They annihilated this small, tight space. Why? Why do they deserve that, she says. Becky Anderson, CNN, East Jerusalem. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, their goal was Israel. Their goal was killing Israelis.Right now, I think Hamas is a bit scared. They have managed to unify Israel as we've -- haven't been unified for years. This emergency government will give more legitimacy to whatever actions the government takes. But more important, if you look at the opposition in Israel, those who have still stayed out of the government, they are voting with the government. So, what Hamas has managed to do is create wall-to-wall support in Israel that we cannot live here whether we on the far-right or on the far left. Whether we oppose Palestinian statehood or support Palestinian statehood. We cannot live here with Hamas. And Kim, if I may, let's make a clear distinction between the Palestinians national struggle for legitimate rights, and a two-state solution on the one hand, and Hamas on the other hand. Hamas is not part of the Palestinian national struggle. They do not want to two- state solution. They want Israel destroyed. They want Jews killed. And they're willing to sacrifice their own civilian population in order to get to that. This is not part of the Arab Israeli or the Palestinian Israeli conflict. This is, as President Biden said, sheer evil and it needs to be eradicated.",

When Kevin McCarthy was ousted in that historic vote, becoming the first speaker ever to be kicked out of that position by his own colleagues.Since then, the House has been paralyzed. No legislation can be acted upon until the speaker is elected. And the question is, can Republicans who are in the majority, but barely, get behind a consensus candidate? So far, the answer is no. Steve Scalise, the House Majority Leader was elevated as the nominee for their party to become the next speaker of the House, but he decided to withdraw because he did not have the votes to move forward. He needed 217 votes in the House. That means, you can't afford as a speaker candidate to lose more than four Republican votes. Then at the end, on Friday, the Republicans nominated Jim Jordan, the House Judiciary Committee Chairman, to be the next speaker of the House. But this was his problem. When he put the question to his conference saying, how many of you would vote against me on the floor? 55 of them said that they would. So, they spent the next couple of days over the weekend, trying to convince 51 members to somehow come to his side. If he can't, then they have to confront this issue all over again. This all comes as there are fresh concerns from a wide range of members about how this reflects on the GOP and whether this can affect their ability to hang on to the house in next year's elections.

Aid to Ukraine cannot be acted upon. They cannot take steps to avoid a government shutdown. All hugely significant issues with many proponents here in Congress to try to deal with that.

Just ahead, we'll talk with an expert about fighting misinformation online. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [04:45:00] BRUNHUBER: The European Commission has launched an investigation into Elon Musk's social media site X over disinformation about the Israel- Hamas war. The probe into the platform, formally known as Twitter, covers its policies and practices on illegal content, how it handles complaints and risk assessment. X claims it has removed, \"Hundreds of Hamas affiliated accounts.\" Take a look at these examples of fake images. Now, this viral video claims to show Israel attacking Gaza, except it's actually a celebration in Algeria. And just hours after the Hamas attack, this document began circulating on social media. A fake White House memo falsely claiming the U.S. was sending billions of dollars in new aid to Israel. All right. Joining me now is Achiya Schatz, executive director of Fake\\ Reporter, an Israeli organization that monitors disinformation and hate speech. Thanks so much for being here with us.
