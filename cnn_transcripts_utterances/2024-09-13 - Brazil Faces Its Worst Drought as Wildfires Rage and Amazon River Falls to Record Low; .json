One was as the pressure was dropping in the cabin.That`s the first time they`ve ever let all the air out of one of these SpaceX ships and see if everything still works. You know, imagine if in your studio, if suddenly there was zero air pressure, would all the computers keep working? How would everything function? So that was a big step. But the second one was when Jared reached up, and I know if you watch it or not, I was jiggling, and opened that hatch. Because if that hatch doesn`t close again properly, then there`s no way to get air back into the cabin. They`d have to do an emergency de-orbit back to Earth with everybody still in their big pressurized suits. So I was, you know, amongst everything else, I was really pleased to see both those things work perfectly, have the crew safely back inside. And maybe most importantly, we have now a proven new spacewalking suit. It`s been a long time since we`ve had a new one. That`s great for the world. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Ten second trivia. Between 1974 and 2011, the NFL moved the kickoff line three times. Which NFL committee voted on the changes?Rules Committee, Competition Committee, Executive Committee, or Medical Committee? Ding, ding, ding, Competition Committee is your answer here. It reviews the competitive aspects of the game, including rules. Football is back, and there`s a whole new look in the NFL this year regarding the kickoff. I played nine years in the NFL. Let me tell you, kickoff was one of the most violent plays. I have a titanium plate and four screws on my neck to prove it. But the new dynamic kickoff in the NFL is aimed at making the game safer by having players line up just five yards apart. And the NFL isn`t the only league making changes to kickoff rules in hopes of making the game safer. Our Sanjay Gupta has more, including one school that made a drastic change to that phase of the game. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. ALLEN SILLS, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, NFL:  It`s space and speed. So if you think about where we`re standing here, you`ve got players that are lined up, in this case, maybe 50, 60 yards away from where we are. They`re running down the field as fast as they can possibly run. So coming down the field at speed and then having collisions obviously is a driver for injury. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The NFL says last season concussions occurred four times more often on a kickoff than any other play. It`s exactly why Riverdale Country School in the Bronx wants to change the game.",

So we made a decision to cancel our last game. But when that season ended, we had to figure out how we were going to manage the next football season. GUPTA (voice-over):  So together with the Concussion Legacy Foundation, they proposed something pretty radical. Getting rid of the sport`s most iconic play. No more kickoffs. No more returns. The beginning of their games now look like this. Play just starts at the 35-yard line. And so far, Pizzi says they`ve seen a 33% decrease in concussions across the league. And importantly, an 18% increase in participation. Parents certainly like the idea. And it turns out, so do the players, like team captain Tristan Cornell.",

Lots of speed, lots of space. This season, only the kicker is back here, while the opposing teams are lined up all the way over here, separated by just five yards. And none of those players can move until the ball has been caught by the receiving team or it hits the ground. It reduces the speed and the space of the play. It`s what Competition Committee Co-Chairman Rich McKay says is one of the biggest rule changes in 30 years. RICH MCKAY, COMPETITION COMMITTEE CO-CHAIRMAN:  The problem is, is we`re trying to not just make this game better next year. We`re trying to keep the game going for 10, 20, 30, 40. That`s what our legacy is supposed to be. And so you`ve got to look at health and safety and make sure that the numbers, when they tell you something, you do something. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
