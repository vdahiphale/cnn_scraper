Tonight, U.S.Secretary of State Antony Blinken begins his high-level talks in Israel amid a diplomatic push for a ceasefire and hostage deal. More on that and the latest on the hostage rescue as well. Then, a night of drama in Europe as the far-right makes significant gains in the European parliamentary elections. And French President Emmanuel Macron calls for a snap election. Plus, closing arguments begin in Hunter Biden's gun trial, leaving the fate of the president's son in the hands of 12 jurors. That and much more ahead. All right, just days after just a dramatic Israeli operation rescued four hostages in Gaza, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is bringing a message to the region the best way to bring all remaining hostages back home is through a ceasefire proposal that is on the table now. Blinken has just wrapped up a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv after an earlier stop in Egypt. He's urging Hamas to accept the ceasefire plan outlined by the U.S. President. Blinken says Israel has already accepted it, although, we have not heard that from the government in Israel itself. Also, today, we're learning new details about that raid that freed four hostages who had spent eight months in captivity. Joyous and really emotional family reunions are dominating the airwaves right now in Israel, but for Palestinians, the operation in a crowded refugee camp marked one of the deadliest days of the war so far. Gaza officials say that more than 270 people were killed including children, Israel says the number is actually below 100. CNN right now is unable to verify the casualty figures. Let's get more now from our Paula Hancocks and Kylie Atwood, they're both in Tel Aviv tonight. Paula, let me begin with you because we actually just heard from the doctor who is treating the four hostages in Gaza who were released over the weekend. What is he saying about the level of physical and psychological and essentially emotional abuse as well that these released hostages experienced over the past eight months?",

Obviously, he's in Israel right now, but prior to Israel, he was in Egypt, he's going to be going to Qatar. And part of his job is really to essentially put pressure on Egyptian officials, on Qatari officials, to make sure that they put pressure on Hamas to accept the deal that's currently on the table. Take us through it. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: That's exactly right. He's trying to get everyone to a yes here, which is an incredibly challenging task, Zain. He just wrapped up about a two-hour meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, we're just getting the readout of that meeting from the spokesperson, Matt  Miller, where he said that Blinken urged Netanyahu, reminded him, reiterated that the U.S. and other world leaders are firmly standing behind that outlined proposal that President Biden laid out about ten days ago, that the U.S. has said that Israelis have signed off on. And he also made the point to emphasize the importance of preventing this conflict from spreading, and said that, that proposal that was laid out ten days ago would quote, \"unlock the possibility of calm along the northern border\". So, that is really significant language as U.S. officials have watched that tension along the northern border with Lebanon increase over the last few weeks. Coming into these meetings here in Israel, the Secretary of State made the point that he believes the most effective way to get all of the hostages out of Hamas, including of course, those American hostages, is to go forth with this proposal that is on the table. He also reiterated those calls for Hamas to accept the deal. He would not entertain questions as to if the raid over the weekend that released those four Israeli hostages, and of course, left upwards of 100 people dead in that operation would impact -- potentially negatively impact how Hamas responds to this proposal. But he did say that those Egyptians who he met with earlier today before coming here to Israel had had contact with Hamas just in recent hours. Listen to what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, according to the Israeli military, this information is coming from -- they say that the hostages were being held in two separate residential apartment blocks. They were about 200 meters from each other, and we heard from an eyewitness on the ground in fact, saying that they saw the Israeli soldiers dressed like Hamas fighters, and also dressed like civilians to stay under the radar just before this operation took place. And we know that there were Apache helicopters involved, we know there were significant airstrikes. The Israeli military says that there were fierce gun battles between Hamas fighters and themselves, but provided no evidence for that claim. But we have seen there was significant gunfire, and you can see the aftermath of this operation in the area, this densely-populated area of Nuseirat. I mean, the devastation is significant, the death toll is significant. And we understand that there weren't helicopters waiting just on the beach for the hostages. Once they had been extracted from these apartment blocks, and they were taken into the helicopters and brought to Israeli soil. Now, these two apartment blocks themselves, according to the military, they had built models of these apartment blocks beforehand. The Intelligence they had, this had been weeks in the planning according to them. So, they wanted to give the troops that were involved, training, to try and get inside and extract the hostages. We understand from the Israeli military that the three men were locked in one apartment and then the other apartment, 200 meters away was where the female hostage was being held. Zain?",

Similar things happened in Germany where there is a lot of unease towards the current governing coalition of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

So, we already heard from prosecutors -- and look, I was in there earlier this morning, it's a tightly-packed courtroom, particularly on the defense side, you had the first lady of the United States, you had Hunter's wife, you had his half- sister. You had so many people crammed in to show their support. And it's interesting because that is exactly where prosecutors started their case. They pointed directly to the gallery where the first lady is sitting, and said, look, those people, they're not evidence, that they don't matter. It's clear that they are concerned potentially about the jury being distracted by the presence of the first lady and his family members. And they reiterated that the focus here should be on the evidence, and they believe that the evidence here, it is personal, it is ugly, but they say it is overwhelming that Hunter Biden knew that he was either using drugs or addicted to them when he filled out the form to buy this gun. Now, they had a chance to go for about an hour to close their case, and then it was the defense attorney, Abbe Lowell, who was up, and he warned the jury not to improperly convict his clients. He reminded them that there is no direct evidence. There's no one who says that they saw Hunter Biden using drugs during the time he owned this gun. Now, he also emphasized the fact that most of the prosecutors case is based on circumstantial evidence, and he even compared their prosecution to a magician trying to do a trick in front of the jury. We expect that he will wrap up any moment. Then the judge is going to have some additional instructions for the jurors, and then it's going to be up to them to decide Hunter Biden's fate on these three counts.

Now, he faces three counts, for example, if he's only convicted on one count, the sentence would be even last. But he is a first-time offender, that would likely be taken into consideration here.

There are those in Israel, especially the far right in Netanyahu's government who want Israel to fully occupy Gaza and basically set up some kind of some military rule over there. I don't think the majority of the Israeli public is there. And I know for certain that none of Israel's allies abroad and, of course, are very important allies in the region support. On top of that, you then have the people who are saying, OK, let's look for another solution, something like some kind of reformed Palestinian authority, some kind of, you know, Arab multinational force, but Netanyahu's coalition partners oppose that and they are completely shutting down any kind of discussion on this issue. And that also impacts the situation with the hostage negotiation because Hamas doesn't feel that it's got some kind of future to worry about. They don't feel like they've got Their backs against the wall and that they're about to be replaced by some kind of a different regime in Gaza, so they're taking their time and this is really tragic because in the result, we're losing here on all fronts. You know, we have soldiers on the ground who are doing incredible things, like what you saw on Saturday, this rescue operation. But on the strategic level, many Israelis are asking what are we doing right now? What is leading this war? What are the goals? And we're not getting clear answers.",

Now, a few days ago, the north said, you know what, we consider these deliveries to be garbage so in return, we're going to send balloons of our garbage from the north over to South Korea. So in response to that over the weekend, South Korea began loudspeaker propaganda broadcast. North Korea, there may be indications, according to the South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff, that North Korea may be ready to begin its own propaganda broadcast as well. So this leaves the leader of South Korea's opposition, Lee Jae-myung, saying, you know, this is a game of chicken, and this has got to stop. Listen to what he said earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO) LEE JAE-MYUNG, SOUTH KOREAN OPPOSITION LEADER (through translator): What started as a leaflet could escalate into a local conflict or war. Looking at these two sides' responses, I wonder whether the authorities in North and South Korea are considering the safety of the people and the community. (END VIDEO)",
