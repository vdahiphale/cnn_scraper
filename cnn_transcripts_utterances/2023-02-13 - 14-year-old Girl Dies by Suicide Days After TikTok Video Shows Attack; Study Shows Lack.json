So I would imagine that health professionals do see this as a growing problem. I guess the question is, is there an answer to it? Are there the resources? ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. The answer is going to be so tough, Erica. So we all know that when you're treating someone for a mental health issue they need to have ongoing treatment. A visit to the emergency room is not enough so these researchers looked at nearly 30,000 children who had a visit to the emergency room for a mental health issues. A lot of times it was depression, sometimes it was a trauma related mental health disorder. And what they found was it didn't -- the follow-up did not go so well. What they found is that seven days after only about 31 percent in that week following the E.R. discharged only 31 percent of them had some kind of a follow-up visit. And if you take a look at a month later, so in other words lots and lots of time to have a follow-up visit, only 56 percent of them did. How in the world are we expecting to treat our children with mental health disorders? And we know that the number of children with mental health issues is rising all the time. How can we treat them if we can't get them care? So there are several issues going on, one is just poor access to care. There aren't enough people out there to treat the children or the adults for that matter who need help with mental health disorders. Also this study found something really disturbing but not surprising. Black children had a much harder time getting that follow-up care -- Erica, Jim.",

He's saying right now that the parts that will be made public include the special grand jury's introduction, their conclusion, and also some of the discussion that the special grand jury put in writing that they had concern that witnesses may have been lying to them under oath. That doesn't indicate that there are any people specifically that could be named in that report. So there's not specific names right now that appear to be released or about to be released, but the judge is going to bring some transparency quite early after this special grand jury concluded their report. Now the reason that the rest of the report isn't going to be public at this time is because this criminal investigation still is ongoing in the state of Georgia. Now that the special grand jury has made its findings, another grand jury comes in to decide on potential charges along with the district attorney, and there is still an expectation later down the road the rest of the report could be made public -- Jim and Erica.",

The state law that created this program said that it was for moving migrants from Florida to other parts of the country. Now Texas is certainly not in Florida. So what this legislature decided to do is say, OK, look, we're just going to lift that restriction and hopefully that legal hurdle is gone and now the governor can move people as he sees fits. [10:45:06] Now there are still a lot of questions about the legality of this program and the humaneness of this program. There are questions about whether or not the governor's office and the people on the ground who are arranging these missions, you know, lied to this people or misled them when they sent them to Martha's Vineyard, and what authority does the state have to get involved in immigration matters. But at the end of the day, the governor's office has said that this is a priority for them going forward and that this legal restriction that has essentially kept these flights from taking off ever since those Martha Vineyard's flights, now that that's gone, there is a good chance that we're going to see migrants being moved from Texas, maybe Arizona and other parts of the border to these so-called sanctuary jurisdictions mostly in Democratic parts of the country.",

And despite an injured ankle, the Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw for three touchdowns, and with the game tied on their final drive, he took off for the longest run of the season for him, pushing the Chiefs deep in Eagles' territory. And then came a play that Eagles fans will not soon forget. A defensive holding call. That set them up further down in towards the end zone there. After that later James Bradberry admitted that it was a good call. It was Harrison Butker kicking the game-winning field goal with just seconds ago for Kansas City.
