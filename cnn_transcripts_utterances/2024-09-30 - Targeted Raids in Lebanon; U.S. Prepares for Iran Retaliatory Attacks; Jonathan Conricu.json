So, one can say that those operations have already begun. And keep in mind what the Israeli goal here is, as stated publicly. We're not guessing about this. Israel's goal, as officials have described, is to move Hezbollah back from the border. And to do that, they - they seem to be making it clear, they don't just intend to do damage to Hezbollah forces along the border, but push them back. The typical dividing line is the Litani River, about ten miles back from the border. So that when you have the Israeli defense minister go speak to Israeli forces now massing on the northern border and use this phrase, \"we will employ all the capabilities at our disposal,\" that's quite clear public signaling about what may very well be the next step. And I think you could see these - these special operations raids, as well as the bombing and the strikes we've seen in recent days as part of that same ground operation.",

That is something that the administration has feared and really tried to work to prevent for the past year.Now, a U.S. official tells CNN that one major area of concern right now is the possibility that Iran could be planning an attack in the wake of Israel's killing of Hamas leader Hassan Nasrallah just last Friday. So, the U.S. is working with Israel on its defenses, this U.S. official said, hoping that a joint defense and a change in the U.S. military posture in the region could potentially ward off a potential attack. Now, this official did not outline what an Iranian attack would look like or specify the exact moves that the U.S. could take. But the Pentagon, in a statement on Sunday, did stress that if Iran tries to - or any of its partners or proxies tries to use this moment to target either American personnel or American interests, that the U.S. would respond to defend the American people. The Pentagon has noted that they have significant capabilities in the region, including a carrier strike group. And they are also working to increase the readiness of U.S. troops who could mobilize to the region. Now, President Biden, on Saturday, convened a meeting of his national security team, along with Vice President Kamala Harris, to assess the situation in the Middle East, and also talk about the readiness of U.S. military forces. And just yesterday he stressed to reporters that he believes an all- out war must be avoided. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, that's the end situation that Israel needs to achieve. How do we get there? Do we get there by a ceasefire agreement or by military action? That's very much up to Hezbollah and their Iranian masters.  They could, you know, understand the situation and they could understand that Israel is very serious about getting its people home. But at the end of the day, I don't think that Iranian masters are going to allow that to happen, and I think that they are going to push Lebanon over the abyss. I think that they are going to tell Hezbollah that there's no option but to push forward and to escalate this into war.I, as an Israeli, would hope to see a different situation where it's not necessary and Israelis can go back to their homes without having Israeli ground troops in Lebanon.
