Second, the U.S. doesn't want to be seen as involved in this in any way. So for the U.S. right now monitoring it from the White House, the State Department, the Pentagon. But no public comments we have seen to this point.The U.S. of course has history with Ebrahim Raisi, going back to at least when he was a big name, 2019. That's when he was put under sanctions. He was the head of the judiciary at that point and oversaw, according to the State Department, the execution of juveniles. And then when he became the president of Iran several years later, it made him the first elected president of Iran to be under U.S. sanctions. Since then, he has taken a much more hardline position than his predecessor, Hassan Rouhani, who was viewed as much more of a moderate. Raisi has more of an anti-West, anti-U.S. position. And we've certainly seen him grow closer to Russia over the course of the past couple of years since the beginning of the Ukraine war. He's also considered very close to Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei. Even viewed as a possible successor to the current supreme leader of Iran. So that tells you where his positions are. Now, it was at the beginning of the Biden administration as they tried to get back into and restart the Iran nuclear deal, the JCPOA, that they viewed Raisi's coming in and inauguration as a bad sign because of his hardline positions. And ultimately those negotiations fell apart. And yet it's worth pointing out that less than a year ago, last September, Iran's government and the U.S. were able to reach an agreement to secure the release of five American hostages in exchange for the unfreezing of $6 billion of Iranian funds. That was viewed as a major breakthrough. Quiet negotiations leading to that point. And yet, Fredricka, it hasn't led to some major thaw. The relations between the U.S. and Iran indirect, because of course they don't have any diplomatic relations, still incredibly ice and cold.",

And he also tried to talk about what his administration has done to try to secure a ceasefire deal in Gaza. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: What's happening in Gaza and Israel is heartbreaking. Hamas's vicious attack on Israel, killing innocent lives and holding people hostage. Innocent Palestinians caught in the middle of all this. Men, women, and children killed or displaced, in desperate need of water, food, and medicine. It's a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

The president talked about efforts to try to fight back against white supremacy and racism in this country, while also calling out extremist actions, extremist views that have taken hold among some in the country.

Two other potential defense witnesses to take the stand include a Federal Election Commission expert witness and Michael Cohen's former attorney, Bob Costello, who repeatedly attacked Cohen's testimony under oath. CNN reporter Marshall Cohen is joining me right now. Marshall, what else can we expect tomorrow? MARSHALL COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Fred. Well, the end is near where you can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel for this historic trial of former president Donald Trump. So as you mentioned, Michael Cohen, he'll be back on the witness stand tomorrow morning. The defense is in the middle of its cross-examination, trying to undermine his credibility, trying to convince the jury not to believe a word he said. After the defense has done questioning Cohen the prosecutors, they'll get another bite at the apple. They can pose some friendlier questions to him and then after that, we think that the prosecution is going to rest. They've said that they don't have any other witnesses to call. It's been five weeks. They put on a lot of testimony and they are ready to wrap things up. After that, Fred, the defense, they can put on a case, but remember, they don't have to. The burden is on the government to prove its case. The defense does not have to put any witnesses on the stand. And by the way, they have not yet definitively ruled out whether or not Trump is going to testify, though it's kind of hard to see that actually happening. And the judge has signaled that once that's all done, closing arguments might be happening as soon as Tuesday. What this means, Fred, is that we might see some jury deliberations this week. It's another three-day workweek so the exact scheduling is not super clear. We'll have to see how it shakes out. But this thing is coming to a close -- Fred.",

They are -- I know the E.U. and other entities have been helping with surveillance for the Iranians to try to find the helicopter in the news that we just got. And the third, and I think most important thing at least at this stage, is to remain quiet so that whatever is going to unfold can be de-escalated. It's interesting to me, and I'd be curious, Jonathan, that the Iranians have really sort of lean forward on the fog and the weather, that there's not a lot of sort of state-sponsored conspiracy theories about what this is.

The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is 85, really has all the coercive elements of the state under his control. Raisi serves him, as does the foreign minister who's also on the plane, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.What I think is really significant here is that, first, you have a very unpopular government. The last I heard from a Western investor in Iran is maybe 10 percent of the population supports the government, but with Khamenei, 85 and reportedly ailing, Raisi was thought as a potential person who power would go to. So he was not powerful but could inherit power. If he's not able to inherit power, you could see some shifts within the Iranian power structure. You could see people trying to move to seize power. I think I agree with Juliette, you don't want to make it seem like this was a U.S. plot, but I think you also, from the U.S. government perspective, have to be aware that this may be a week, two weeks a month where things are starting to shift and there are opportunities for things to capitalize on changes in Iran that will lead to greater security in Iran and in the region.",

As you mentioned, Jake Sullivan met with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman yesterday and we know from the Saudi side of things at least that they discussed a pathway toward a two-state solution.And the U.S. has long tried to normalize relations between the Israelis and the Saudis. But since the war began in October, the Saudis have made abundantly clear that that will not happen unless there is a credible irreversible path toward a Palestinian state. And yet just as recently as this weekend, you had the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu making very clear that he does not support the creation of a Palestinian state. Today, Sullivan was in Israel. He met with the Israeli president. He met with the Prime Minister Netanyahu as well, and we have just gotten an update at least from the Israeli side about some of the things that they discussed. The situation on the northern border with Lebanon, the situation in Rafah, where of course we know that the U.S. has been urging the Israelis not to expand their campaign on the ground there, where you've had 800,000 or so people leaving the city already with very few good options of places to go. They discussed humanitarian aid and they discussed the hostage situation as well, and getting a ceasefire deal. But at the moment, it does not appear that there's any kind of at least public facing talks happening. At last word, the Israeli had rejected Hamas's offer which was essentially a 12-weeks ceasefire. The Israelis, though, were only willing to agree to six and this seems to be one of the big sticking points here because Hamas does not want to agree to a deal that is anything less than a permanent ceasefire. Three months is pretty close to that because the Israeli side felt that if there was a pause for that long, it would make it very difficult for them to go back to the battlefield after three months away -- Fredricka.",
