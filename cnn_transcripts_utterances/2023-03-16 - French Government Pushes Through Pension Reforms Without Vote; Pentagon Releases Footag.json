Tonight,protesters are on the streets of France this hour, after the government used special powers to push through controversial pension reforms. Their new video shows that mid-air confrontation between a Russian jet and a U.S. drone. Plus, Poland says it will be the first NATO country to send Ukraine desperately-needed jets. A live report from Ukraine just ahead. Well, we begin with major developments in France over President Emmanuel Macron's controversial pension reform bill. The government has pushed the bill through without a vote from the lower house of parliament by invoking special constitutional powers. Here, you see some opposition lawmakers booing as Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne made the announcement. Opposition parties say, they will request a vote of no confidence in the government. CNN Jim Bittermann joins me now live from Paris with more on what has become a pivotal day in France. And Jim, in forcing this bill through, it might seem like the easiest option for President Macron, but it's also extremely risky. And we have been seeing in the past few hours, protesters already amassing, once again, on the streets of Paris. So Jim, what's going to be the fallout here?",

And here's a little bit of how she tried to justify that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELISABETH BORNE, PRIME MINISTER, FRANCE (through translator):  We cannot bet on the future of our pensions.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  We are with some dozens of protesters across Israel, another massive day of disruption. Israelis taking to the streets in the tens of thousands, protesting against this massive judicial overhaul planned by Benjamin Netanyahu's government. We are here actually at a student protest, this is the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and many of these students -- what they see is the beginning of the end of Israeli democracy if this overhaul goes through. At its core, this overhaul would not only allow the Israeli parliament to overturn Supreme Court's decisions, it would also drastically change how judges are appointed in Israel. But supporters of the reform say that it's sorely needed, that it's been lacking for a long time, that will help re- balance the branches of the Israeli government. Last night, the Israeli President Isaac Herzog put out his own compromise proposal, warning that if a proposal -- if a compromise is not reached, then the country could be on a brink of a civil war. ISAAC HERZOG, PRESIDENT, ISRAEL (through translator):  I'm going to use a phrase I haven't used before. An expression that there is no Israeli who is not horrified when he hears it. Whoever thinks that the real civil war of human lives is a limit that we will not reach, has no idea. Precisely now, in the 75th year of the state of Israel, that this is within touching distance.",

It simply doesn't happen all that often that thePentagon released this video from a spy drone operating over the Black Sea, so close to a war zone. So, let's talk about the two different parts of this video. There are two separate passes from Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jets against an MQ-9 Reaper drone. In the first one, you see as the jet approaches, starts to jump jet -- dump jet fuel, and then passes by the drone itself. You also then see back, you see the fuel vapor essentially hanging in the air and the propeller itself functioning, that is, spinning. In the second part of the video, you see another pass. Again, the same dumping of jet fuel, and then, this is the crucial moment. When the video itself freezes or pixelates a little bit, that's a result of the collision here, and then you see the impact of the collision damaging the propeller. It is that damage to the propeller that forced the U.S. drone operators to bring the drone down some 70 miles southwest of the Crimean Peninsula in international waters. During that process, CNN has learned that the drone operators wiped the sensitive software, essentially the sensitive memory and capabilities off of the drone itself before it crashed into the water. CNN has also learned that the Russians reached the crash site, U.S. made it clear that it wouldn't be able to recover it itself in all likelihood because there are no Navy ships in the Black Sea. But there certainly are Russian ships, and they made clear that they would try to make an effort to recover it. Even if they can't recover any sort of sensitive data, information or Intel, it is still a propaganda victory for Russia, if they're able to pick up some of those pieces off the water.",

The decision to wipe the memory would have come after this. How do we know that? It's a very difficult thing to be able to prove. That's from the Pentagon here and from officials here that, that was the measure taken to make sure there was no sensitive information falling to the Russians. We have heard General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, as well as John Kirby, from the National Security Council, say the U.S. did take steps in mitigating measures to make sure that there was nothing sensitive that fell into Russian or other hands.",

So one can assume that it could be imminently -- no, I don't think necessarily, these four MiG jets which were holdovers from the former east Germany and then sourced by Poland, will necessarily turn the tide of this war. But I think it's important in two ways. It does break a psychological barrier of some kind, I would say, of NATO country supplying fighter jets, and clearly, an attack asset to Ukrainians, something Zelenskyy has asked for, for some time as you say. And also, that they will open the door, potentially again, for other countries to follow suit.

There's some indication that Ukrainian pilots are already getting some kind of testing and training on those systems. In the short term, there may be more Soviet-era airplanes that could come to Ukraine. So it's important from the Ukrainian perspective. I think what is perhaps more pressing are the nuts and bolts need of the groups on the ground in the eastern front for artillery pieces and artillery shells. Just today, the chancellor of Germany say they need to accelerate the supply of Ukraine's military on the ground, particularly in the east for the very intense shelling that is ongoing there, and the fact that at least for more than a month now, we're hearing that the -- if not running very low, certainly running short of this kind of ammunition, which actually gets the job done on the ground during this conflict.

A source familiar with them confirms to CNN that big banks are in talks to provide a lifeline to First Republic, which is a San Francisco-based regional bank. Now, the big banks include a consortium that includes JPMorgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Truist. And the source familiar with the matter says that this would be structured as deposits, that the big banks would be transferring deposits to the smaller banks in an effort to try to give it some more financial firepower here to meet customer withdrawals.

These two nations have had a difficult past, and now they're trying to move forward amid some sheer(ph) stress in the region. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says Tokyo and Seoul have agreed to resume shuttle diplomacy to open a new chapter in relations in a joint statement with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. President Yoon saying, quote, \"we agree today that the people of the two countries have suffered direct or indirect damage, due to the pros in bilateral relations, and agree to restore and develop Korea-Japan relations as soon as possible. President Yoon also agreed to completely normalize its military Intelligence-sharing agreement with Japan. Relations between the two nations have been difficult in recent years, soured over several issues, including a wartime labor dispute that had emotional, economic and political implications. No start date has been set to resume shuttle diplomacy, but this is happening in the face of North Korean nuclear and missile threats. In addition, we're already seeing the thaw before this meeting, Japan's trade ministry said it would lift export controls on three South Korean products including one critical for the production of semiconductors. Seoul entered, agreed to lift its complaints with the World Trade Organization. Both leaders hope exchanges between the two countries will expand to politics, economics and culture.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Ukrainian military footage of a drone strike at a Russian rocket launcher. The bloody war between Russia and Ukraine is being fought on the ground and in the sky using drones and unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs, some of which were never intended for military use. This is one of the weapons in this war, a drone that could fly far behind the front lines carrying a powerful bomb rigged to hurl deadly pieces of shrapnel like this.
