He's trying to win the hearts of the American people, unite our country, and start steering us towards the strongest, most powerful, prosperous future we could have. So I give him a lot of credit and going to places where Republicans have not gone before. If we're going to win this election cycle, we must go where we're not invited.

But if you're really concerned about racial justice in America, let's not forget, Joe Biden is the guy that talked about racial jungles as a result of desegregation. Let's not forget the fact that Joe Biden is the president who said, if you don't vote for me, you can't be black, an old white dude telling me I can't be black if I don't vote for him. This is the president who said that if -- that the Republican Party wants to put you back in chains. The only person I have seen restraining black folks economically is the Joe Biden economy. So, I find it quite insulting to suggest that Joe Biden does not have serious concerns, when his own vice president, Kamala Harris, said he supported segregation.

He was there because there is a threat that the third-party challengers like RFK Jr. bring to him and to the current president. What do you think RFK's candidacy does? And who do you think it hurts more, Trump or Biden? GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN):  Well, thanks for having me. Well, I think probably Trump, because I think most Democratic voters and most voters out there who had to live through COVID understand the dangerous rhetoric from RFK Jr. is simply unacceptable. But I find it ironic he was at the Libertarian Convention, and no one has been more restrictive, whether it's women's reproductive rights or the rights to vote. This certainly hasn't been a Libertarian lean in terms of liberty. So I think we're always concerned. Third-party votes -- look, Minnesota is a very independent state. But I think the difference is, is that President Biden is making a case that their lives are improved, that the status of the United States in the global community is at stake, and that that's the choice they should make.

It seems like the campaign is spending a lot of money on ads to kind of see what sticks. What do you think the core message of the Biden campaign is? WALZ:  Yes, and I would say, too, Dana, what they're doing simultaneously -- we had a briefing, myself, our senators, some of the leadership out here. Look, we have got 18 field offices up and running. We have got a ground game that is going to be bigger than anything we have ever run out here. The Republican Party, in contrast, last time they filed, had $52 out here. And there's no offices for Trump. And I think the issue is, is being organized. And the message you take to this is, again, this is about protection of democracy. This is about, when Donald Trump was president, governors like myself were in Hunger Game battles with other governors to get ventilators to keep our people alive because he did nothing. The issue is going to be competency. When Joe Biden comes to Minnesota, he brings jobs, money, investments, and a positive message. When Donald Trump comes, it's grievances and revenge. So I think the issues will start to clarify themselves. Voters are concerned this time of year. School is about out. They're worrying about summer. But we're starting to see prices start to moderate. We're seeing inflationary pressures go down. And then we can start to focus on those real issues that impact folks. So I think the message is going to be very personal (AUDIO GAP) an ability to deliver this. That's why I'm out there.

And when I think about the future for my children, they're still in dilapidated schools where the educational system is deplorable. That's the Democratic message, in my perspective.
