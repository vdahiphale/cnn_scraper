And as we headed to the shelter here, which is the staircase, we heard the interceptions, tough to get an exact number, eight, nine, ten, right in that range.And Israel police warning the public to watch out in this area for shrapnel from the rocket launches, certainly keeping an eye out to see if there are more and where those might be targeted, as we keep working throughout the day. Also at this moment, the Israeli military has opened up a humanitarian corridor in Gaza. You saw some video of that there, thousands of Palestinians leaving Northern Gaza along Salah al-Din, one of the main north/south corridors there, and moving south. Israel and the U.N. say tens of thousands have gone in the past couple of days. The way these work is that Israel announces them on a daily basis. So far, they seem to line up in the same general time range, in the same general direction, although it doesn't appear that there's a promise that that will be consistent. President Joe Biden says this is something he has been pushing for for some time now and said he hoped it would come earlier.

We're waiting right now to see what Mike Johnson's plan even is at this point, Phil.And he's been meeting with members across the ideological spectrum all week long trying to take under advisement suggestions. But the problem for this speaker is that he has the same issues that Kevin McCarthy dealt with, and that is he has members of his conference who see the path forward very distinctly different in the months and weeks ahead when it comes to spending. And, you know, one of the things that you're hearing from a lot of veteran appropriators is let's not have a huge showdown over a short- term government funding bill. Let's just get this done, make it as clean as possible. Tom Cole, who is the Rules Committee chairman, someone who has worked in appropriations for a long time, he said, that's what I've been trying to tell the conference is our best path forward. And yet you have members of the Freedom Caucus who are pushing for this two-step approach where there would be different government offices that would shut down at various dates, basically trying to maximize their leverage to have multiple deadlines. And you're hearing from Senate Republicans, that's not going to fly in the United States Senate either. And so I think that there's just a lot of concern right now that Mike Johnson is hearing from so many different voices. And at the end of the day, he's the one who's going to have to make the final, and you hear this a lot from Republican members of his conference, the final play call, that he's the coach right now, he's the one who's got to make the final decision on the path forward. But so far, he just hasn't said what he's going to do. We asked him repeatedly yesterday. He did not want to comment in the hallways. But we're going to get a better sense maybe today, maybe tomorrow. That's really the deadline. Because if Republicans want to go to the floor by Tuesday, Phil, they need to unveil that plan by tomorrow so that members have 72 hours to read the legislation.",
