      "sentences": "Hello everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching a very busy ONEWORLD. We begin with a major decision by the Supreme Court in the final days before its summer recess. One that essentially amounts to a stinging rebuke of the U.S. Justice Department. The high court has just dramatically limited obstruction charges against January 6th rioters at the U.S. Capitol. That 6-3 vote could force prosecutors to reopen some of those cases. The court ruled the DOJ overstepped when it charged hundreds of people with obstruction. But we'll have to wait until Monday for what could be one of the high court's most significant rulings and that is a decision on Donald Trump's claim of presidential immunity. Let's bring in CNN's Jessica Schneider with more on what we heard today. Jessica, let's begin with the obstruction charge against the January 6th rioters. How does this impact the hundreds of rioters facing this specific charge? We know dozens have already been convicted.",

      "sentences": "The U.S. Attorney and the Attorney General Merrick Garland, they've actually said that it's not goingto directly impact that many. In fact, the U.S. Attorney sent out a statement saying that while there are these 250 cases still open where the rioter is charged under this particular obstruction statute, none of these rioters are charged with just obstruction. There's a multitude of charges against them, including assault, not obeying an officer, that sort of thing. So, their cases will move forward regardless, even if it means that prosecutors have to drop this obstruction charge that the Supreme Court ruled on today. It really, though, could create some question and maybe opportunity for rioters who have already been convicted or sentenced to challenge their sentences or ask for retrials. Since the Supreme Court did say today that in order to be charged with this particular obstruction statute, you need to not only have stormed the Capitol, but you also needed to have directly interfered with the counting of electoral ballots that day. So, a lot of these cases, Bianna, will need to be evaluated. And when it comes to Donald Trump, he might even challenge that particular charge because he is charged with at least one count of obstruction in this case if, of course, his case moves forward, which we're waiting to hear when the Supreme Court issues its final day of opinions. That will be on Monday, and we will get the immunity case on Monday.",

I want to get to the Chevron case, which has huge implications, and I know maybe doesn't get the glamorous headline attention that the January 6th rioters case has gotten, obviously the presidential immunity case, as well. But let me ask you your response to that, that the court essentially overturning 40 years of precedent, really deferring to the federal government here and agencies, instead giving more deference to the courts itself. Chevron is one of the most cited in American law. There have been 70 Supreme Court decisions relying on Chevron. What are the implications here?",

I'd like to read for you what Justice Elena Kagan wrote in dissent. She was joined by two other liberals in saying that \"The overturning of the Chevron precedent was a rule of judicial humility giving way to a rule of judicial hubris. In one fell swoop, the majority today gives itself executive power over every open issue, no matter how expertise-driven or policy-laden involving the meaning of regulatory law. As if it did not need and have enough on its plate, the majority turns itself into the country's administrative czar.\" Really not mincing words here.

She said, now it's upto these nine justices to decide climate change. That's scary, was the word that she used, because she basically says, we judges don't have any special expertise in these scientific and policy matters. That's exactly why we elect executive officials. And it's incredibly hubristic for judges to think that they know the right answer. Interestingly, Justice Scalia, the conservative justice, used to favor deference and humility, and he was one of Chevron's biggest champions. But as Justice Gorsuch noted in his long concurring opinion, Justice Scalia shifted, and the entire conservative project moved from one of judicial deference and humility and letting other officials make decisions to one where judges presumed to make them themselves. And the result of that is to hugely empower the Supreme Court and to make them the last word on every single regulation that gets passed. It seems, as Justice Kagan said, the opposite of what conservatives promised when they said that policy should be made in the political arena rather than in the courts.",

But cases like it and future efforts to regulate abortion or anything else will be dramatically affected by this case only in the sense that this continues a trend that the conservatives had already begun.

There's two charges, bothconspiracy to obstruct and obstruction. And Trump's lawyers will now argue since he didn't destroy or alter documents, those two charges at the core of his January 6th indictment should be thrown out. Jack Smith counters, well, by encouraging the creation of new election certificates, he was essentially altering documents. But this might well go up to the Supreme Court next year. It can't be heard immediately. And once again, you could well have the conservative justices saying, no, you need to destroy documents, not create them. And therefore, it's possible that this means that at least two of the four charges at the heart of the Jack Smith indictment will be thrown out, even if the judges find that he's not immune. So, you can see what an incredibly uphill battle Jack Smith has in charging Trump in January 6th cases after the decision this morning.",

It is at its lowest level of public confidence in -- since polling began. And this is only going to drop it further. You know, I'll defer to Asa on the real -- I have a bunch of law books behind me. I'm actually a lawyer, but Asa is a real one. And he was a prosecutor. And I do know this as a politician. Had a bunch of left-wing protesters stormed the Supreme Court, do you think they'd make that same ruling today? I don't. I mean, this is clearly a partisan thing.

And that is the fact thatthis decision specifically related to the obstruction charge was not decided along ideological lines. In fact, you had the chief justice, John Roberts, writing for the majority. But Justice Jackson concurred with this decision, as well, on this specific charge. The reminder that hundreds of other rioters are charged on separate charges. But this is related to the obstruction charge that dates back to the Enron scandal. Governor? ASA HUTCHINSON (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Well, you're right on that point. And you mentioned the concurring opinion of Justice Jackson. But you also have the dissenting opinion of Justice Barrett, a Trump appointee, who believe that the statute does apply. And so here, you have the United States Supreme Court engaged in very nuanced statutory construction. And they divided not along party lines. And so, if you read the decision, you don't see politics written all over it. You see substantive legal discussions that, I think, certainly has political impact. And that's where Paul and I probably agree that Trump's had a trifecta. I mean, he did well in the debate last night, certainly. But here, he had this decision that the court ruled on substantive legal issues that he will spin in a political context that this is a slap of the Justice Department. They were overreaching. And he will use that to justify his arguments of weaponization of the Justice Department. And so, he's had a win there. And, of course, even the Chevron decision, which struck down much of the administrative state's authority, is a victory on the conservative side as well. So, you're going to see this having a great political impact, as well as an impact on the individual defendants who had a victory here.",

So, why all of the sudden, after 40 years of precedent and really deferring to expertise, is this now being handed back to the courts, in your view? Why do you view that as a positive, if you do?

So, that's how radical the court has become. This is actually an opportunity for the Democrats. All of my life, Republicans have run against the Supreme Court. Ever since Brown v. Board and then the school prayer case, the abortion case, the contraception case, Republicans have run against the Supreme Court, and they've done well doing it. Finally now, because of Dobbs, Democrats are winning races running against the Supreme Court. And if I were still advising Democrats, I would tell them run against the Supreme Court. People hate it. It's one of the few things everybody agrees on. It's probably about 25 percent approval. And this is a political opportunity. For those of us -- and I'm weird this way, I like breathing. I like drinking clean water. You know, the things that we kind of take for granted that our government protects us on are going to be at risk right now.

They've given us an 81-year-old man who cannot communicate effectively and make his points in a debate. And they've given us a convicted felon. Those are the two options of the voters. And the third parties didn't arise to the occasion. And so, this is where we are. And the other challenge is that it's going to be hard to change it.

But I don't see anybody in the wings that would take our country in a different direction than Joe Biden. And that's not the right direction for Republicans to go. So, I think they're going to stick with Donald Trump. And he's not wavering.",

You're looking live at the Biden campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Let's bring in CNN's Priscilla Alvarez with more. And yesterday, Priscilla, after the debate, the president was asked point blank how he thought he did. He said he thought he did well and followed up by saying it's difficult to debate with a liar. But he had ample opportunity to counter some of the lies that we heard from Donald Trump. And yet missed a lot of them. How is the campaign feeling today?",

Biden advisers saying that they're frustrated that President Bidenhad to respond and fact check to former President Donald Trump's falsehoods over the course of the debate. But there is no doubt that people within the president's own party are criticizing his lackluster performance. And this was a really important moment for the president. It comes at a time when voters have expressed deep concern over the president's age and mental acuity. And if you recall, during the State of the Union, he had a similar task, which was trying to convince voters that he was up to the job. And so, a lot of folks that I was talking to ahead of the debate were hoping that that was the Biden that they would see on that debate stage. And they didn't get that. He fell short of expectations. And over the last several hours, what we've also heard from advisers and campaign surrogates is that, yes, it wasn't his best performance. They acknowledge that Vice President Kamala Harris hitting the airwaves last night, including on CNN, saying that the debate was off to a slow start, then arguing that it had a strong finish. And trying to remind voters of the last three years of President Biden's record. And that's sort of how they are building out their argument today. Like, they are saying it's time to move on from the debate, that it is about the two candidates and their records, and that one is a better president, that one, in the campaign's view, being President Biden. But the panic has certainly sent in among Democrats and the president's allies, including on some policies. I was texting with allies last night who said, for example, on immigration, they hope the president would be able to deliver a tight and concise message, especially after they wrote out so many immigration executive actions over the last several weeks. And knowing that former President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized him on this, and yet he still didn't deliver on that. Same occurred with abortion, which has been a galvanizing issue for the Biden campaign and for Democrats. So, there's certainly a lot of concern in the hours after this debate about the president, about his performance, and what that means moving forward. But at least when asked about this, advisers are sticking to what they've said before, that the president is in this until September, he's not dropping out, and that he still remains committed to debating in September.

      "sentences": "Well, I think it was a historic night, perhaps for all the wrong reasons. You know, thequestion of age was one going into this debate that everyone wanted to talk about. There have been lots of strategists and opinion writers and scholars who have said that the Biden campaign needed to address the age issue head on. He would be the oldest candidate, but also that Donald Trump would be the second-oldest candidate. And that the issue had to be put out to pasture, essentially, that it had to be put to rest. And instead, what happened is it made it even more of a central issue to the presidential campaign, so much so that it distracted from the really alarming performance of Donald Trump and the very alarming agenda that Donald Trump strayed out. In fact, the day after the debate, the only thing that people can talk about is Joe Biden's age and his performance. So, I think in the grand scheme of things, in this larger historical trajectory, this will be the moment that we begin factoring in age in a negative way, perhaps, into how the American public thinks about the democratic process and about the general election. Traditionally, age has been seen as a boon. It's seen as something that conveys experience. But what we know now is that audiences are watching this, and they are essentially saying, we have two white men rematching -- two elderly white men rematching, and this is not what democracy is about.",

We know that its approval rating among Americans has taken quite a dip, and there's internal friction among the justices, the likes that I don't think we've seen in the past, despite differences in political ideology. That's always been the case of the Supreme Court and the justices here. Put that into perspective, where things are now historically with regards to the highest court in the land.",

So, we know that the conservative bent of the Court right now -- the conservative activist bent of the Court right now, is a direct result of Donald Trump being president and being allowed to appoint multiple people to the court. The same way -- the reason we know -- the same way that we know that Ketanji Brown Jackson being on the Supreme Court is a progressive pick is a result of Joe Biden being president of the United States. It also means that whoever is the next president may have the opportunity, as we've seen in the past, to appoint several more members of the Supreme Court, which ultimately determines the outcomes of these various cases that we are seeing. The other thing I think here is that we've seen a number, this Supreme Court, more so than any other in recent memory, has handed down a number of paradigm-shifting decisions. That includes today, where several decisions were handed down. And of course, this is what voters should be thinking about. They shouldn't be thinking about the Supreme Court operating in a vacuum, but instead, what is the political connection of the Supreme Court and these decisions handed down? For example, the Chevron case, which affects federal agencies and how federal agencies are or are not allowed to administer and make decisions with states. These kinds of things matter. They have impact. And I think part of what we're seeing, too, here, is the effect of this conservative transformation of the Supreme Court over the last 15 years or so.",

It also gives the Democratic Party and Joe Biden an opportunity to recoup. One of the things we've seen that the Democratic Party has been particularly strong on is this issue of abortion, particularly in the post-Dobbs landscape.
