First up, these international news headlines. A first responder is calling injuries from twin explosions in Jerusalem very tragic, something we haven't seen in a very long time. These two blasts killed at least one person, a teenage boy, and injured 18 others. The first happened at a bus right by the entrance of the city, the second at another bus station not far from there, about a half hour later. Hadas Gold is following developments for you from Jerusalem this hour. Hadas, what are police saying about possible suspects and motive?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Becky. I'm at the scene of the first of those two explosions. This is a bus stop along the mainartery in and out of this city and this attack took place just after 7 am at the height of morning rush hour. Now police say the first bomb took place here. A package, a bag of some sort, was placed at this bus stop. It exploded and, just about 30 minutes later, another explosion just down the hill from here, not far away, also exploded. Now police say this was a coordinated, almost a professional attack. They say the bags were packed with shrapnel, with things like nuts and bolts, things that could cause maximum damage. I want to show you how much of an impact this was. I'll have my cameraman show. Just where these people are standing, behind them, there is the impact site. You can see a fence, a stone wall was blown up and the shrapnel went so far, it went all across the sidewalk. You can see a bus station sign with impact marks. And actually, we got here in the morning. We saw debris all the way across this three-lane street here, almost reaching the median of this highway. It just goes to show you the blast radius here, how strong a blast this was. Authorities say one person, a 16 year old Canadian Israeli student, was killed in this attack. At least 14 others were injured. Now this has already been, as we've been talking about for months, a deadly and violent year in this region. But this sort of attack, this sort of bombing, this level of coordination and planning is not something that Jerusalem or Israel has seen in years. It's bringing back, for many people, memories of the Second Intifada when suicide bombings and bombs placed at bus stations or at restaurants became a common occurrence. But in the last few years, people have not been used to this. This is not the sort of attacks they are used to seeing. Police still have not identified any sort of suspect and no militant group has claimed responsibility. Groups like Hamas have celebrated what they call an operation. I want to play this clip from the soon outgoing prime minister, Yair Lapid. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YAIR LAPID, ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator):  I want to say to the citizens of Israel, we will find them. They can run. They can. Hide it won't help them. The security forces will reach them. If they resist, they will be eliminated. If not, we will punish them to the fullest extent of the law. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The city's water supply has been suspended. This wave of attacks follows a Russian strike in the Zaporizhzhya region, where authorities say a maternity ward was hit and a newborn baby was killed. The Kremlin says Russian president Vladimir Putin will meet this week with the mothers of reservist soldiers called to fight in Ukraine. This comes as complaints have been flooding in from Russian soldiers on the front line. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Stark images from what many believe to be the second strongest military in the world. This video posted on social media purports to show new Russian recruits, camped out in the snow and cold, with little more than tarps for shelter, some trying to warm up by fires. CNN cannot independently verify its authenticity but those posting it say the soldiers even have to buy their own food to survive. Problems during training, problems on the battlefield, these recruits vent their anger at the Russian military. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  We were abandoned without equipment, without everything. Where are the tanks? Where are the armored personnel carriers? Come on, bring it or I'll come for you. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Dilapidated barracks, horrendous sanitary conditions, poor food:  the list of complaints, often documented in social media posts like this, runs long since Russia says it has mobilized more than 300,000 men for the war in Ukraine since September, with more than 50,000 allegedly already on the battlefield, the Kremlin says. Some relatives, especially mothers, complaining about the treatment of their loved ones. This group in southwestern Russia saying their husbands and sons have been sent to the front line without adequate training or gear. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  The commander who gave the order that our men should hold the defense ignored the decree of the supreme commander in chief that the newly mobilized should not be sent to the first line of contact. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Even in the areas of Ukraine that Russia has annexed, mothers are taking a stand. \"Return students to their studies,\" this sign in Donetsk says. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  Vladimir Vladimirovich, please return our children. There are many dead, many captured. The rest of the children are physically and morally decimated. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Soldiers' mothers traditionally carry a lot of sway in Russia. And Russian president Vladimir Putin seems eager to show he's not tone-deaf to their plight, recently visiting what the military says were new recruits, firing a sniper rifle himself, trying to convey he cares about the new recruits. VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator):  About our country, of course, we have costs. Most notably regarding losses in the special military operation. I think about it all the time. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  But many mobilized Russians and their relatives seem to feel left out in the cold after their country called them up to serve in a war that was never supposed to last this long -- Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.

It's one of the areas that's beenvery badly affected by the Russian missile strikes on energy infrastructure, targets and (INAUDIBLE) behind me. The city is almost in complete darkness. People have generators, of course, and they are providing their own electricity as much as they can. But in general, it is a very dark city, which is sort of bracing itself for further attacks in the future. There's been a wave of missile strikes just over the course of the past few hours, not just in this region but across the country. You mentioned the Kyiv region around the capital being struck as well, with 3 people killed there, causing damage to missile strikes to a residential area on the outskirts of the Russian capital. But also in central Ukraine as well, a horrific attack by a Russian missile on a maternity clinic or a hospital, in which a small child, a small baby, was killed just a couple of days old. The mother and the doctor were pulled out of the rubble alive but the child lost their life. Another indication of just how grim and brutal and full of blood this conflict has become. It all comes, of course, amid that concerted campaign by Russia to target Russia -- target Ukrainian -- sorry -- infrastructure systems to really plunge the country into darkness and into cold. This as the temperatures really start to plunge as well. In the beginning of the winter, here, the first snows have settled over much of the country. It's when energy requirements are at their highest. So it is looking at this point, even though authorities are doing all they can to restore energy connections, it's looking like the prospect of a very cold, dark winter in the months ahead, Becky.",

And it's also the fact that both sides have kind of minimumconditions, if you like, for peace talks to take place. But neither side are willing to meet those conditions of the other. Ukraine, at this point, feels it has been taking territory in significant quantities from the Russian occupying forces and it is in no mood to make compromises when it comes to territory. For their part, the Russians, they feel they haven't started or completed things they set out to do in the first place. So my guess is the conditions are not there at the moment. And the political will is not there at the moment for a serious peace negotiation.",

At this hour, the search for survivors continues. More than 270 people lost their lives in West Java, when a magnitude 5.6 quake struck. Officials there said at least 150 people are still missing, as crews dig through rubble, looking for any signs of life. Aftershocks and landslides are making that job an awful lot harder. Let's get you up to speed on some of the other stories on our radar this hour. Aftershocks also rippling through northwestern Turkiye, following a strong earthquake that was felt as far away as Istanbul. That happened in the northwestern Duzce province on Wednesday. At least 50 people were injured. Local media report the quake was a magnitude 5.9. You are looking at social media video of workers protesting a Foxconn iPhone factory in central China. They are confronting police in hazmat suits. The plant is in Zhengzhou and it's one of Apple's largest suppliers. It has been wrestling with a major disruption since mid October, due to a COVID-19 outbreak. CNN has learned more than 3,000 tickets were sold for access to a suspension bridge on the day it collapsed in India's Gujarat state; 135 people were killed. Authorities say some 200 people were on the newly renovated bridge when it gave way last month. That is far higher than the capacity allowed.
