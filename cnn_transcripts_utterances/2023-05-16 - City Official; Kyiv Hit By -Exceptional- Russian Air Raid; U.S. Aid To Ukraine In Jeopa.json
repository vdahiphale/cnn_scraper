That was during a Russian air raid.The head of the Kyiv city administration said it was a complex assault from multiple directions simultaneously, and that the attack was exceptional in its density. The official added that most were detected and destroyed. This is the eighth attack on Kyiv that has happened just since the beginning of this month. The commander in chief of the armed forces of Ukraine has also said that overnight, Russia attacked Ukraine with 18 missiles and various types all across the country that were intercepted by air defense forces. We are now also told from the Russian Defense Ministry claiming they have destroyed one of those American Patriot missile systems. We'll see, of course, what the U.S. says about that.

Perhaps most significant, six of them launched from aircraft were hypersonically superfast missiles that are very hard to intercept -- all of them intercepted.The cruise missiles that were fired from ships in the Black Sea to the south of Ukraine -- all of those intercepted or neutralized. And there were three of the large Iskander land-based missile systems fired, it seems, from Russian territory towards Kyiv -- those intercepted. We've heard from Ukrainian officials recently that the Russians are trying to penetrate -- trying to find a way to penetrate the air defenses in Kyiv. And I think what we're witnessing here is the fact that the Ukrainians, at least in their capital, have substantial air defenses. It's a whole lot different down here close to the front lines in the east of Ukraine. There are air defenses. There aren't as many and they're not as effective and not as sophisticated. A town near to here was hit overnight -- an apartment building crushed there. The fight inside the town of Bakhmut still continues. The Wagner mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin claims that an American fighter was killed. There is no evidence yet to back this up. He says he will be -- the body will be returned and repatriated to the United States. Prigozhin, though, has very little credibility and it's all about propaganda.

If anything, if Trump had won a second term and done what I think he intended to do, which is get out of NATO, Putin would have just waited and let him do it.

BOLTON:  Well, I think there's a lot of question exactly how far Erdogan went to try and fix the first round -- steal the election. Let's be blunt about it. And I think really, international attention has got to focused on the next two weeks to see if he steals the second round. I'm afraid if he wins that there will be real damage done to the NATO alliance and I think we need to consider whether to suspend or even expel Turkey. If Erdogan is defeated, however, I think there's every reason to think that Turkey will return to being a more normal NATO member -- not necessarily in every respect. But it would be a significant plus not only in Europe where we face the Ukraine situation but in the Middle East where Erdogan has what can only be described as neo-Ottomanist aspirations to recreate a greater Turkey.

I think it's an outstanding institution. I think 99 percent of the people in the FBI are patriotic Americans really -- salt of the earth. But there are a number of them over the years who think they walk on water and I think a lot of those people were involved in the Hillary Clinton investigation in 2016 and in the Trump investigation.

She had this lifestyle empire in the '90s. She's now Snoop Dogg's BFF and swimsuit cover model.",
