He's the second vice president of the Southwest Pilots Association. Tom, thank you for your time. Look, we've all tried to get our heads around what's actually happening here. Almost striking when you read what southwest executives have acknowledged in terms of this being a, largely a southwest problem, other airlines are getting back to normal, but this is something they should have been prepared for to some degree. Is that a fair assessment? TOM NEKOUEI, CAPTAIN &amp; SECOND VP, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES PILOT ASSOCIATION:  Thanks, Phil. Thank you for having me on. And absolutely. It's interesting that our CEO and COO acknowledged that today, because just a few days ago, in an internal memo, the vice president of flight ops said this was a industry problem. So, I can tell you, dating back to 2016, that we sounded the alarms on the lack of IT infrastructure and there's documentation, communication between us and the company dating back to 2016, where we raised these alarms, and nobody's ever listened. If you notice that our meltdowns are getting more severe and it takes longer and longer to recover from them. It's all, like -- listening to Mike Santoro earlier, he said the catalyst was weather. There's always a catalyst, whether it's air traffic control in Florida or weather, but if you look at our competitors, I'll take you United Airlines for, example, how they recovered right here in Denver from this, number one, they didn't have the cancellations we did. And then the recovery was extremely expedited. We're still recovering from that and canceling flights. Right now, north of 15,000 flights have been canceled. It is absolutely an IT infrastructure issue and what we call reassignments. The software they use for that scheduling that reassigns pilots and flight attendants and the execution of getting those pilots and flight attendants to those airplanes is where this software and the company fails all the time.",

Now, we don't know where this is headed next, litigation is ongoing, but the administration has been preparing for weeks, if not months now, for when this policy would end. Meaning when they would have to process my grants the way we used to for decades. Whether it be releasing them during their immigration proceedings, detaining them, or removing them to their native country. So, the administration was putting all of that in place.

He actually wrote this dissent in conjunction with Ketanji Brown Jackson.This has been -- and Justice Gorsuch touches on just how contentious of an issue this has been because this has been winding its way through the courts for many months now. And at the last minute, the 11th hour here, these Republican-led states have sought to intervene. They did it just a couple weeks ago when they didn't like a decision from the D.C. Circuit and the D.C. District Court in Washington and they immediately went to the Supreme Court. And Justice Gorsuch here is saying that the states really shouldn't be allowed to intervene here. This was a policy, Title 42, that was put in place because of COVID in early 2020. It has sort of run its course. And Justice Gorsuch is saying here that, you know, the states here contend that they face an immigration crisis at the border and that's why Title 42 should remain in effect. All the while, Justice Gorsuch is stressing Title 42 was only put into effect because of COVID. And at the end here, Justice Gorsuch says, and courts should not be this the business of perpetuating administrative edicts designed for one emergency only because elected officials have failed to address a different emergency, saying that, they put this in place because of COVID and then in the meantime, administrative, state, all officials have failed to address the immigration crisis, and he contends that's the only reason Republican-led states are stepping in now, because nothing has been done about the immigration crisis and the courts shouldn't be used in this way. So, very interesting, Phil, that that very conservative justice, Neil Gorsuch, is in joining in this dissent with Ketanji Brown Jackson. He would have denied this application, as with the three other liberal justices here. But the bottom line is that Title 42 will stay into effect.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The world's harsh quarantine is no more, as COVID sweeps through China, the country is scrapping quarantine for inbound travelers from January 8, and promising to gradually restore outbound tourism. Since the start of the pandemic, China has severely limited who can go in and out of the country, drastically cutting the number of flights and cutting arrivals into government facilities. I went through multiple quarantines in China this year, lasting as long as 21 days. There is no choice where you go or what room you get. Once the doors close, you can only open them for COVID tests and food pickups. Workers sprayed disinfectant in the hallways every few hours. Food delivery is not allowed. But breakfast, lunch and dinner are part of quarantine fees. All of that is soon going away. It a huge relief for Chinese nationals living overseas like this woman in New York City.",
