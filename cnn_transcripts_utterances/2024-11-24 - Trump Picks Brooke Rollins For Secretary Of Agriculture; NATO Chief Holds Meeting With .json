Not just the Rockies but all the way back to the West Coast, because we have several systems that are going to be making their way through that area in the next 48 hours. But from there, they then continue to go all across the entire country, impacting pretty much most states. So, for today, the concern is going to be the heavy rain along the coast, especially as we head into Monday too. And then also look at all of these alerts, half a dozen states looking at those winter weather alerts for some pretty impactful snow late today and especially into the day on Monday, Tuesday. Let's fast forward to Monday. Here's those next systems coming into the West Coast. But that first one now starting to impact portions of the Midwest and Ohio Valley. Mostly, going to be some light rain, snow up into the northern areas where you've got those cooler temperatures. Now, we fast forward into early Tuesday. That front continues to form here. Again, you can see bringing some rain down into portions of the southeast cities like Atlanta, Chattanooga and Knoxville. Then by Wednesday, it continues to make its way all across the country Wednesday night, and then even into Thursday morning where were going to have some issues on Thanksgiving day itself especially in the East. WALKER: All right. Allison Chinchar, thank you. Turning to Ukraine now and air defense systems shot down dozens of Russian drones overnight.

I'm sorry. And then he heads on to the New York area, where he will host a Friendsgiving dinner with troops. We expect the Biden family also to travel to Nantucket for their annual Thanksgiving holiday. But I want to serve up some presidential history here. Rumors of the first turkey pardon date back to the Lincoln administration, as you mentioned, when the president's young son asked his father to spare his pet turkey from the Thanksgiving table. And then in 1920, during the Wilson administration, there was a battle royale of a pair of turkeys that came from Kentucky and Texas. And then we saw the first documented presidential turkey pardon during the Kennedy administration in 1963.
