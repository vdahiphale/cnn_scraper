      "sentences": "One step closer. I Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.On Friday, the third-party group No Labels ended months of speculation about whether it would feel a unity ticket for the presidential race. In a virtual convention more than 800 delegates from all 50 states voted to move forward with the process. And on the heels of that news, several outlets are reporting there's a particular candidate now under consideration, Geoff Duncan, 48-year-old was a Republican Lieutenant Governor of Georgia under Brian Kemp from 2019 to early 2023. He's a conservative Republican and also a vocal critic of Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Duncan recently wrote an op-ed in the Atlanta Journal Constitution titled \"End doesn't justify the means on Trump\" about why he won't support Trump for president. Writing quote, \"Trump has become incapable of leading in a respectable or mature way until more of us are willing to acknowledge that hard truth. We will be on the outside looking in. The news came the day after President Biden State of the Union address which calmed the nerves of many in his own party about his capacity and vigor for the campaign and the job. It's too soon to know if Biden's performance will dent the polling that for months has been finding many Americans unhappy with the rematch of the 2020 rivals. Last fall, a Fox News poll found that 50 percent of registered voters would dread a Biden Trump rematch as primary voting began this year and the inevitability gained momentum. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 70 percent of respondents said Biden should not seek reelection including about half of Democrats, 56 percent said Trump should not run including about a third of Republicans. And most Americans don't identify as Republicans or Democrats. The most recent Gallup poll on party affiliation finds 42 percent now say they are Independent. A recent Wall Street Journal poll including third-party candidates broke down this way, Trump at 40, Biden a 35, Kennedy at nine with a few points among Cornel West, Jill Stein and libertarian Lars Mapstead and 12 percent still undecided. Complicating the No Labels bid, several names including Senator Joe Manchin, former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, even Nikki Haley have already said they will not run as No Label candidates. There's also the issue as to whether a Haley or Dean Phillips, for that matter, would run afoul of state sore loser laws which bar candidates who sought and failed to win a party's nomination from then running in the general as an Independent or for another party. Joining me now is the chair of the No Labels convention, Mike Rawlings. He's also the former mayor of Dallas, Texas and former CEO of Pizza Hut. Mayor, nice to see you again. The Wall Street Journal and ABC both saying that there have been these meetings between No Labels and former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, is there truth to that?",

In 2016, Donald Trump got 46 percent of the national vote, and third parties in that race got 5 percent of the vote. That elected Donald Trump. In 2020, he got 46 percent of the vote, but the third parties only got 2 percent of the vote. And that allowed Joe Biden to win a razor thin majority over Donald Trump.Now, let's look at some history. In 1992, Ross Perot entered the race late, he got 19 percent of the vote, he got no electoral votes, not one. To get an electoral vote, you have to win a plurality of a state. And that is what we do not believe No Labels or any of these others are going to be able to do. And I've seen a recent poll that says that, Nikki -- if Nikki Haley is the No Labels candidate in this race, she gets 11 percent of the vote, and she would not get one electoral vote.

Should a court have overturned it?Two New Jersey high school boys basketball teams will face off today at noon in a championship game after a controversial courtside ruling. On Tuesday, the Camden Panthers were leading the Manasquan Big Blue Warriors scores 46-45 during the semifinal game. Three seconds on the clock, Manasquan player misses a three pointer from the wing. His teammate Griffin Linstra was there, grabs the rebound, put the shot back in for what the team thought was the game winning basket. The buzzer beater secured Manasquan spot in the state championship or so it seemed while the fans rushed onto the court to celebrate the referees decided to reverse the original call, resulting in a victory for Camden. This despite the fact that several videos showed that the shot clearly should have counted, there was time on the clock. The next day, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association admitted the referees made the wrong call, even going as far as to apologize for the error. And despite the overwhelming evidence from the video, the tournament rules prohibit the use of videos in reversing a game officials' decision. Even New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy weighed in on the controversial call saying that he felt badly for the players, the coaches, the families that had a victory snatched from them. But ultimately he said he couldn't do anything to change the outcome. The Manasquan school board, the board of education ask a county Superior Court Judge to delay today's championship game between the Camden Panthers and the Arts High School Jaguars, but their request was denied. And then yesterday Friday, the New Jersey Commissioner of Education declined to hear the board's appeal, citing that quote, \"The commissioner cannot find that the officials' decision regarding the basket was anything other than a judgment call. And the NJSIAA rules clearly state that once an official has made a judgment call, no appeals will be honored. Even if the official decision was not correct, under the clear and explicit bylaws, it is not removed reviewable.\" Plus, the Appellate Division for the superior court in New Jersey also denied Manasquan's appeal.

You know, it's funny because this one goes against my libertarian priors, which is I actually think the courts and the governor of New Jersey got this right. How are you going to do this, right? How are you going to, at this slight slim margin, make a decision just on the basis of the final shot? I mean, any shot throughout that whole game would have changed that outcome. So, I kind of -- I feel for the parents, I feel for the school. You know, my son played varsity basketball this year, and so, I've been a parent on the sidelines, cheering for my son and getting angry about bad calls.
