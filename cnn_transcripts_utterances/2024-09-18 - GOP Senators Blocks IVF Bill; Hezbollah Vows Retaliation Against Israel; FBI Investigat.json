All but two GOP senators voted against it, and while on the campaign trail yesterday, Vice Presidential Candidate J. D. Vance slammed the bill.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I think we have to be careful here because the Senate did not block an IVF bill. The Senate blocked a ridiculous show vote bill that had no chance of passing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I do want to ask you, since you're on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, about these hundreds of pagers in Lebanon that simultaneously exploded yesterday. Israel has refused to comment publicly on the explosions. But CNN has learned the attack was an Israeli operation. The White House says it has -- it had no heads up or involvement in it. What was your response to that? What did you make of that?",

      "sentences": "Well, obviously, Israel sent a strong message to Hezbollah. And, you know, ultimately, Hezbollah was obviously using pagers as a means around what they thought was Israel's ability to track their intentions and movements. And I think given Hezbollah's commitment to eradicating the State of Israel, given Hezbollah's commitment to doing the bidding of Iran you know, and utilizing pagers as a vehicle by which to act, you know, I think, obviously, Israel sent a strong message.Israel is under threat and I think it is imperative that the United States continue to stand by them and show strong support. There can be no equivocating here. There is no moral equivalency. Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other terrorist networks are clear in their objectives. They want to eradicate the State of Israel. They want to kill Jews, period, because they are Jews. And I think that is something that Israel has to contend with, and the United States needs to be very cleareyed. When Kamala Harris says that she's open to an arms embargo, that is disconcerting to me, when the administration lifts sanctions on Iran and allows the illicit oil trade between Iran and China to the tune of a hundred billion dollars, which is being used to fund not only their nuclear program, but Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, that is disconcerting. It's why I fought to get the SHIP Act and the Iran- China Energy Sanctions Act as part of the supplemental aid package. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have thus far refused to implement the SHIP Act and crack down on that illicit oil trade. It needs to happen immediately, because that is what is funding Hezbollah. And the threat from the north is significant.",

And you have people like Chuck Schumer calling for regime change on the floor of the United States Senate. That does not help our ally as they're under threat.And when you withhold weapons, when you openly consider an arms embargo, as Kamala Harris has stated, when you don't crack down on the illicit oil trade between China and Iran, then you are undermining Israel's ability to not only defend itself but, obviously, you are emboldening their enemies.",

And now, women are dying. These are the consequences of Donald Trump's actions.\" What do you think? I mean, Georgia is just going to come down to the wire. It's going to be so close.

And women are paying attention, but not just women. Men who have women in their lives who you don't know what care they're going to need. This young woman went to get abortion care the week that the law -- Trump's abortion ban went into effect in Georgia. She had to travel to North Carolina, four hours away from home, just to get abortion care. And then came home and needed to have DNC, which is a routine complication that could have been treated.And here we are, having someone who literally died because of Trump's abortion ban. Trump bragged about overturning Roe v. Wade. So, this is on him, square and center, and we need to hold him accountable, and we can do that at the ballot box. On November 5th, people need to show up, in force, to make sure that their voices are heard, because women should not be dying in this country from complications of a routine medical procedure.",
