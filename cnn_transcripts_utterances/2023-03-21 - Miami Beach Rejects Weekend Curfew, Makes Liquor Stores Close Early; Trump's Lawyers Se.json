It's like feast or famine here, Kaitlan, for real.As you can see, it's really windy out here this morning and that's part of the issue. They're saying that the wind gusts could be up to 75 miles per hour in the mountain ranges and about 50 miles per hour in the lower areas. Right now where I am, by the Cajon Pass, if you were able to go up north of me that would be the area that goes through the mountains and would take you up the 15 into Las Vegas. But right now all of this -- you can't see it yet because it's still so early here, but the San Gabriel Mountains, San Bernardino Mountains are behind me and those are where you've seen those big snow accumulations, and they're bracing for maybe two to five more feet of snow up in those regions. That's why officials have been asking people to have supplies for two weeks just in case they are stranded there for a while. They're asking them to stay off of roads. And then on top of that there is a threat level of flooding that is now three out of four because of this much rain. Think about all of the precipitation that has fallen here in California. The ground is saturated. That means the water runs off quickly and that could lead to flooding. So there are some communities in California that are already being evacuated before this storm comes in, but this is just the beginning of this system, Kaitlan.",

So basically spray sulfur particles way high in the sky like where the Chinese balloon was and then buy us time. If you can just turn down the sun by a degree or two for a couple of years, the argument is that gives time for humanity to decarbonize as well. Some scientists say it's such a dangerous idea because it could throw off weather patterns, create monsoons -- all unintended consequences. They say it shouldn't be studied at all. But you're going to hear more of this -- the longer it takes for the big fossil fuel interests to get on board. That's where the help is needed.
