President Joe Biden making an admission of sorts, saying -- quote -- \"If Trump wasn't running, I'm not sure I'd be running.\" Now, look, we all remember that he entered the race over what happened in Charlottesville, right? Talking about battling for the soul of the nation. It was obvious to everyone then that Trump was the catalyst. But tonight's statements are feeling a little bit different for some reason. Maybe because he was in a room full of donors. Maybe because his campaign has wanted to focus on health care this week and his desire to have another four years to finish the job he started. And the question people are asking tonight when you already have the polling, by the way, that shows that people might not be too thrilled with a rematch between the two of them, is it a lack of enthusiasm on his part or is it just recognizing on his part that Trump represents an ongoing threat to our democracy, which he has alluded to a number of times? Now, in 300 and about 35 days, but who's counting, voters are going to let him know. Well, tonight, they've done a little bit of damage control ever since that quote sneaked out. A little while ago, he was pressed if he would be still running for president if Trump wasn't running for president, to which he said this.

But I think what it does underscore, Laura, is something that I know you've been reporting on, I've been reporting on. I've been reporting on it since before October 7th, but it has exploded since October 7th, which is a growing hostility towards Israel by progressives who genuinely understand and believe in Palestinian rights. That has been going on for a long time. There are some in her own caucus who will not condemn Hamas, who will go off on tangents and say that Israel is engaging in genocide. She is not one of them. She has very, very clearly condemned Hamas, has called it a terror attack, and has also spoken out very forcefully against antisemitism. So, as the caucus chair, she has been trying to walk a line, but I think the situation that she is in speaks to the larger churn that is going on inside the progressive movement about this issue.",

It's no coincidence that this kind of radicalization, this Osama bin Laden letter thing that all these American kids started getting into, happened on a Chinese-built platform. The algorithm encouraged that.But beyond that, on this question about surveilling Americans, you're exactly right. That's why Section 702 in this law actually protects Americans overseas and in the United States against being surveilled by the government under that authority. If you want to surveil an American anywhere in the world, you have to go to a court and get a court order, whether that's from a judge on the FISA court, and by the way, those are regular district judges who just serve on that court, or you have to go to a federal court, a federal judge, and get a warrant like you would in the criminal proceeding. So, the only thing this tool can be used for is for surveilling foreigners located overseas when they're engaged in terrorist activities, intelligence activities or the like. Now, it's true that you might get communication with Americans, right? But that's exactly when you want to know. When these terrorists are talking to Americans or spies are talking to Americans, that's when you want to know. And then if you want to collect on them, got to go get a court order.",

But ATF arson experts have been going through that house. They're taking chemical tests.But here's the operating theory, Laura. James Yu brought police there because he had fired about 50 projectiles, probably flares, in the direction of neighbors' homes. When police got there, they say they were fired on again, so they backed out, and they came back with a BearCat. That's that armored vehicle you see approaching the house just before it explodes. They were talking on the loudspeaker asking him to come out unarmed, and they were going to take him into custody. That's when the house explodes. What they think happened, before they did their arrest warrant and tried to get him out, they cut off the gas line to the house. But by then, they believe, you had filled the house with natural gas by opening all the gas lines inside in the kitchen so that it was permeated, then they believe he may have fired an additional flare inside to cause that spontaneous combustion. But I've seen a lot of gas explosions. I've talked to people on the scene. They think there's something else here. Perhaps additional propane tanks or some kind of accelerant because they said after the gas explosion, the amount of fire, the fact that the flames kept on going, signals to them that he had somehow, as you suggested, rigged the house, booby-trapped it with something more than just the gas.",
