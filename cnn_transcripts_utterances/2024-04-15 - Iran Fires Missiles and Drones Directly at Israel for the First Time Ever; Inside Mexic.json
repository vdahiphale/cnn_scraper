(On camera): It`s gotten so frustrating for these folks in particular that a community got together, wrote a letter to their governor petitioning for more resources. And it`s for that reason that you have, well, you can see right here, members of the Mexican National Guard who are now patrolling neighborhoods like this one to keep migrants from coming through. (Voice-over): Authorities here urge migrants to use the U.S.`s CBP One app rather than to risk crossing with smugglers. Like Mexican officials at this location even help pre-screen up to 500 migrants daily for the U.S. asylum interview process. (On camera): So he`s in communication with U.S. officials, on the other side, and they`re sending documents back and forth to make sure that they have the right information. (Voice-over): While this is a more orderly way to claim asylum, it can take a while to get an appointment. Marta Achila says she`s waited five months for this day. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CULVER (on camera): So I asked why they didn`t go through the smuggling route, which so many choose to do. And she said that, for one, it costs an extreme amount of money. And the other aspect of it for her was they wanted to be able to enter legally through the appointment and try to build a better future there. (Voice-over): The road ahead is uncertain for both the migrants and for those protecting the border. We see that firsthand as we leave the remote border camps. (On camera): The reason we`ve stopped and then pulled over is because there are these spikes that we`ve noticed all along the different dirt roadways that take us to the border wall. (Voice-over): Evidence of a smuggler`s desperate attempt to salvage their profits. There are dozens, if not hundreds of these. (Voice-over): And while it slows them down momentarily, for now they forge ahead in their efforts to curb the flow of a migrant crisis that`s consuming resources on both sides of the border.
