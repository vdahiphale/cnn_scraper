She's an Associate Professor of International History at the University of Leiden, and she joins me now from The Hague, because you're much more of an expert on this than many of us.We're just heading there for Melissa, all eyes now on what -- on how Israel responds to this ruling. I mean, broadly, the ruling is saying that Israel has to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. But it doesn't accept that it is genocide. So, there's still a disconnect here, isn't there? I mean, what will Israel choose to respond to, effectively? ALANNA O'MALLEY, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL HISTORY, LEIDEN UNIVERSITY: Well, the first thing to bear in mind, of course, is that this or these orders are binding. So, Israel is obliged to fulfill the obligations that it has as a member of the international community now and to abide by the court's orders. What Israel chooses, the choices are quite limited here in scope, is that it really must think about the ways in which this military operation has been carried out so far. And now, the whole question and a focus and attention is really on the kind of the -- the court has declared that there's a plausible risk that genocidal acts may be being committed. And there's an urgency so much so around that possibility that they are ordering these provisional measures. So now, there is even greater pressure, even greater public attention on the Israeli actions, and also on Israel to provide the information of what's happening. And that part of the judgment is also very important that one-month deadline, quite a short turnaround, by which time Israel is required by the court to write a report on situation in Gaza and on how it is taking measures to prevent the possible perpetration of genocidal acts. So, I mean, this is really quite a high requirement, and this really should make a difference to the way in which Israel perpetrates its military operation henceforth.",

And so, the courts did not go so far as to adjudicate one of those arguments that South African made about proportionality. And so, it didn't go that far. But what we did see is that they're ordered very clearly to take all measures with immediate effect to prevent the plausible risk of genocidal acts being perpetrated. And so, the court really also stressed the urgency of the problem. And they really found that the rights requested for protection by South Africa really are linked clearly to the provisional measures sought. And that's very important, because it means that really what the South African case was quite persuasive on a lot of grounds to the court to show that these rights are being or could possibly be violated under the rights under the Genocide Convention, and that Israel has an obligation as a party to the convention to itself abide by those rights and prevent the perpetration of anything that might violate the rights of people under the Genocide Convention.

So firstly, you have that pressure, because it's now an order from the court. Four weeks is a short time, even though, of course, Israel has sufficient access to everything it needs to examine in Gaza to answer that request. But the other thing, of course, is that this creates a huge amount of public pressure on Israel and on Israel's allies, including the Western Powers, of course, including the United States. And that's kind of a publicity. And we've -- this is an important part of this crisis as well. That tension is really now kind of ratcheted up another notch.

She says that the South Africans weren't -- couldn't stand idly by and they are indicating that the mechanisms that the world currently runs on at the United Nations, including the UN Security Council and others, is not set up to actually bring these kinds of cases for people to be held to account from the South African perspective. So, they said they took that significant step to go to the ICJ to ask the court to make these provisions and to investigate whether Israel is committing genocide in its campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, something, of course, Israel has repeatedly denied. I think the South Africans will see this as a victory. She reiterated several times that the key for the South Africans and for others is that the situation for Palestinians on the ground is improved, that humanitarian aid gets in the equip more quickly. And towards the end of the statement saying this is about the Palestinian people and the conditions that they are living in.

I'm not going to read the whole statement here, but try to give you some of the highlights as we just go through it.The charge of genocide, he says, leveled against Israel, not only false, it's outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it. Of course, this is something Prime Minister Netanyahu has said. [08:30:00] And I think to get at the idea of how Israel is going to react and respond on this call for the protection of lives, protection of injury both physical and mental, and the improvement of the humanitarian situation inside of Gaza. The prime minister in this statement says, we will continue to facilitate humanitarian assistance, and do our utmost to keep civilians out of harm's way, even has as Hamas uses civilians as human shields. We will continue to do what is necessary to defend our country and defend our people. So he's not, in any way, saying there that he is going to go along lock, stock and barrel with everything that the ICJ has just said. He has really, I think, restating Israel's position. And as we know, Israel does continue to say that it is providing humanitarian assistance. So though, the objective reality as recorded by UN officials and the Palestinian people themselves in Gaza witness, the situation in Gaza is utterly appalling, that people are running out of food, the conditions are terrible, the hospitals are closing and collapsing. All of those things we heard -- read out of the ICJ. So how is -- so this begs the question, therefore, how is Israel going to respond over the coming days and weeks ahead, the letter in a month -- the report in a month at the ICJ has called for, the Prime Minister hasn't rejected sending in that report. It does feel here that this statement from the prime minister is a reiteration of the previous position, not a rejection of what the court is saying. Essentially saying, well, we were doing these things all ready. I think overall, the pressure will continue to mount on is -- from Israel's friends like the United States, albeit maybe not publicly but behind the scenes. The pressure will continue to mount.

And that it should provide -- allow for the provision of basic urgently needed services in Gaza for. All of those things to actually happen, it could, in a sense, result in at least a lessening of some of the military activity in Gaza. But really, the devils in the details, how is it going to be implemented? And of course, we heard Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, essentially saying we are already providing basic services or urgently needed items to the Palestinians by allowing limited amounts of humanitarian aid to go in Gaza. He said, we're already trying to minimize civilian casualties. Now, since the ICJ had its first session, it's worth noting that 2,500 people have been killed in Gaza. As of today, the death toll now exceeds 26,000. So already, as this court has been sitting and deliberating, hundreds and hundreds of people have been killed. So symbolically, I think many people see, certainly there's a silver lining and simply the listing of all, for instance, the statements by UN officials who have stressed time and time again, about how dire the situation is in Gaza. And also listing the variety of statements by senior Israeli officials, certainly calling for extreme measures, shall we say, against the people of Gaza. But at the end of the day, in the absence of an immediate ceasefire, it certainly leaves a lot to be desired for the people of Gaza, Max.",

Klopp says he loves the team but this is a decision that he is \"convinced\" he has to make. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Liverpool are currently at the top of the Premier League table, which is why it's such a shock that he's going at this point, but it seems like a heartfelt reason.Now, the International Court of Justice has imposed emergency measures in the genocide case against Israel. It's ordering Israel to ensure its forces don't commit genocide, punish those who violate the Convention on genocide, and improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza. South Africa brought the case before the ICJ in hopes that Israel will be forced to pause the conflict in Gaza. That didn't happen. But the court has rejected Israel's request to throw out the case, and acknowledge that Palestinians in Gaza constitute a protected group. This is not a verdict that genocide has been committed. Any verdicts on that issue could be years away. Let's bring in CNN's Nic Robertson in Tel Aviv. I mean, a very -- well, a typically bombastic, I guess, appearance of the prime minister. But there are many parts of this report or this finding that it, you know, is worrying for Israel, frankly, even though it hasn't been asked for a ceasefire or directly at this point being accused of genocide.",

It would have shown them that the international pressure would have really ramped up. This is something that could have gone to the UN Security Council and put its biggest partner, its biggest ally and back as the United States in a very difficult position.Because remember, United States has really been a defender of Israel through the past number of months. And previously, of course, but particularly now, Israel feels that most keenly at the UN Security Council by blocking sanctions against Israel. And had there been a ruling for a ceasefire at the next UN Security Council meeting, where a potentially a resolution around this had been bought up. The United States would have had a very, very difficult decision to take one that it's not had to take so far. So I think in those terms, Israel, this could have been worse.",
