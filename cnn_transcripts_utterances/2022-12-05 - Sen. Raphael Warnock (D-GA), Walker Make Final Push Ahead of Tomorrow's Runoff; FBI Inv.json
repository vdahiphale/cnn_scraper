Meaning they voted for Brian Kemp, the Republican but then they did not vote for Herschel Walker. 200,000, that's quite a lot and could be the margin of victory.Is his appeal to those people, as he's trying to target them, is he trying to find them geographically and ideology, I think that is really going to tell the story when the dust settles after tomorrow.",

I mean, that has enormous implications going forward. Can you explain the change?

There is also a lot of other things that have to do with demographics.Now, one thing to note about South Carolina, because of their role with Biden, because of Jim Clyburn and his role with getting Biden where he is, it does have a lot of clout, but this isn't without risk. I think Politico made a good point today saying South Carolina was a place where you got to kind of watch how things were handled in Nevada and Iowa and in New Hampshire, and they were seeing, as the ones that are picking the winner, not necessarily the ones who were calling the huge field of candidates. Now, that is assuming that the role is going to be the same and it is going to be handled the same as it has been for years, as far as like whether that is a calling state or not.

And what that means is it will advantage anybody who has the wherewithal, the backing, the logistics, the legal support to almost simultaneously pull off primary and caucus efforts in South Carolina and in Nevada and in New Hampshire.And so the days of like a Jimmy Carter in 1976 kind of quietly building up some support and developing some momentum, the days of an under-funded Barack Obama in 2007 kind of quietly laying some groundwork, those days will be over. You have got to be able to sort of effectively run a national campaign from day one, and that means underfunded first time candidates or long shot candidates, I think, are going to be at a serious disadvantage.",

Authorities are calling this an intentional attack after finding two electrical substations, you could see them there, were damaged by gunfire.

What law enforcement has said at this press conference yesterday, when they were going through some of the details and some of the information that they've been watching, is that there had been chatter on social media that this was somehow connected to a drag show that was scheduled to take place around the same time that the power went out in Moore County. The drag show, again, in Moore County.But law enforcement not prepared to say that hose two events are connected. They have no evidence to suggest that this was a reaction to that or was an attempt to try to shut that down. So, that remains an open question a. At this point, simply nothing more than social media rumors. But as you point out, the FBI is involved, the state bureau of investigation. This is really an all-hands-on-deck situation here, as many law enforcement locally, as they can get, to try to investigate why someone would go this and how they committed this crime. So, what law enforcement is prepared to say at this point is that, yes, someone did open fire on these two substations and that one of those substations, it appears that a gate was taken off the hinge, so perhaps someone got close enough to one of these substations to open fire. That is still an open question at the other substation. But the reality is they were able to cause millions of dollars worth of damage. And this is going to be a long process to restore customers. At this point, a spokesman for Duke Energy tells me that the good news is they've been able to get power back to around 7,000 people, that was overnight. So, now that number of people out of power hovers around 33,000, which is good news because before it had been more than 40,000. So, it seems to be ticking down a little bit. However, Jim and Erica, the problem here is that power is not going to be restored for the majority of customers until Thursday. Back to you.",

And there is a lot of businesses like this, people who are arguably creative, who do things that do implicate speech and, frankly, just about everyone can say that doing a business is problematic with respect to their religious rights.

So, literally, there would be no check on that.But the theory goes potentially even more broad than that. I mean, this notion that a state legislature can't be checked by the state court system, when if the legislature decided on a different slate of electors than the voters have chosen. There is no way to check that in the state system.
