This morning, new reports that first billionaire Elon Musk is kind of pissing off some Trump advisers.During a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Axios reports, \"At one point during what the sources described as a 'massive blowup,' Musk accused Trump adviser and attorney Boris Epshteyn of leaking details of Trump's transition, including personnel picks to the media. Epshteyn responded by telling Musk that he didn't know what he was talking about.\" So there's that plus the complications and workarounds that Trump has for getting people confirmed. CNN's Zachary Wolf, the author of CNN's \"What Matters\" newsletter, is here with that. Good morning, sir.",

      "sentences": "Good morning.You know, usually, presidents end up getting their nominees or the ones that they want. Every president has one or two that end up having to withdraw, so they don't get those. But you have to go all the way back to the '80s -- to 1989 to John Tower, a former senator, to find somebody who was actually defeated on the Senate floor. So sometimes they will withdraw. It's really rare for somebody to actually be defeated. And it was kind of an interesting story for him because he was accused of drinking, and they called it back then womanizing. We would call it sexual harassment today. But he was undone because the senators who were to confirm him had been drinking with him. Interesting story. But especially when you think of Matt Gaetz today and some of the frustrations with him from people who are now in the Senate. It's a process that really, the senators are supposed to have input. So Trump wants to get around that. He's talked about this idea of recess appointments. If you look for somebody who has done recess appointments, there were the in the last -- since 1900 for cabinet-level positions. Bill Clinton did one for a short time, George W. Bush, and Lyndon Johnson. Other than that, nobody's ever done this. Plus, if you start looking at the mechanics of this the Senate would have to take a full 10 days off, and so would the House, in order for Trump to get these recess appointments. So basically, all work in Washington would have to stop in order for the Senate to give up its constitutional right to have advice and consent. All of this means it's kind of hard to see a recess appointment system working out because senators -- you know, Republicans and Democrats like to fight with each other. Senators don't like to give up power and they would have to do that in a very big way for recess appointments -- John.",

      "sentences": "All right, joining me now, CNN political commentator Karen Finney, and CNN senior political commentator Scott Jennings to discuss some of this.Scott, I want to talk about some of these nominations. You have ranked those who could possibly see some serious pushback from Republicans in the Senate, from Gaetz to Hegseth to Gabbard. But in reality, just how many times do you think Republicans may not confirm a Trump nomination? SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:  Well, we'll have to find out. Gaetz is the one I put in a separate category. He seems to have the most opposition. And you have to remember some of these senators are simply not threatenable or as susceptible to Trump's influence as the others. Some of them are retiring. Some of them have an image of fighting with Trump publicly that serves them well back in their home states. And in the case of Gaetz, some of them have had some longstanding problems with him that predates their time in the Senate. So there's a group of senators here, obviously, that would be more than the required number to defeat a nomination on the floor. But I think he's a separate category. Then my next one was RFK. He has some problems. And I do think some conservatives, particularly people who are pro-life, are going to have some issues with this nomination. Gabbard and Hegseth I think come next. She's going to have some worldview issues with some of the more national security hawks in the Senate. And Hegseth I still think, of that group, has the biggest -- best chance to make it. I think there is a lot of merit in his nomination, and I think a Secretary of Defense who is somewhat closer to the enlisted ranks than we've ever had might be just what the Pentagon needs. But going from four to one, that's how I rank them. And I know it doesn't happen very often, but I think if Gaetz and RFK get to the floor it's going to be dicey on the votes. But again, I think a president deserves the chance to build the government he wants to build, and I also think the Senate deserves a chance to vet those people and perform their constitutional duties as well.",

Then again, the American people did vote for Donald Trump and he's a convicted felon.So I hope there would be the transparency.

It strikes me that it's likely to come out -- either the report itself or the information that's contained in the report is likely to come out one way or the other.I do wonder if the chambers could strike a compromise where the people on the committee that will be reviewing the confirmation could maybe look at it in private and that way they have access to the information, which then protects Gaetz from having it released publicly. I -- you know, I don't know what could be worked out. My general view is whatever is in there, if the Senate wanted to it could probably go find it themselves and make it a part of the confirmation hearings overall. But I do think when someone is nominated for a key post like this -- I mean, your life and everything you've done, and all the -- all the actions you've undertaken are fair game. I mean, that's the nature of these confirmation hearings and that's what the process is for. So if I were Mr. Gaetz, I don't think I would count on that remaining a secret.

Now part of the reason the Biden administration finally made this decision is because they view the deployment of up to 10,000 or more North Korean troops into Russia as an escalation -- one that merited some sort of response. And this, at least in part, is that response allowing Ukraine to do what they have wanted to do for months now.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, when he was here back in September, even presented President Joe Biden with a list of targets that he wanted to hit with long-range ATACMS missiles that have about a 200 or so mile range, allowing them to strike deeper inside Russia. Biden didn't dismiss it. He didn't reject the idea. But the agreement was effectively to keep on talking about it. Well, now that decision has been made. Of course, the timing can't be ignored here. The U.S. is preparing for the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump who has said he would end the war and he's the only one who can bring the sides together. The U.S. here trying to make sure that if it comes to negotiations, and when it comes to negotiations, Ukraine is in -- is in as strong a position as possible here.

I don't think there are really enough of these ATACMS -- longer-range missiles -- to suddenly overnight change Ukraine's pretty dire fortunes on the front line at the moment.Now, they are more precise, and they could potentially, as Oren was suggesting, hit North Korean troops building up around Kursk. But remember, too, Ukraine has had longer-range drones and have hit deeper inside Russia than the ATACMS can indeed go but are way cheaper and potentially more effective. What I think this announcement does do though, particularly after months of President Joe Biden delaying -- essentially, it's a no until you say yes -- delaying granting this particular permission despite saying it will be escalatory if he did it, it shows that this White House in its closing two to three months is essentially trying to raise the stakes here in what's been a proxy conflict with the Kremlin. They are less afraid, it seems, to allow this move, which Vladimir Putin has suggested if Ukraine was firing U.S.-supplied missiles it would essentially be NATO joining the conflict in full. So we'll wait to see what the Kremlin's full response here, indeed, is. But it shows I think President Joe Biden wanting to give Ukraine an upper hand on the battlefield as we see them losing in multiple directions across the eastern front here, potentially ahead of peace talks when Trump gets into power but also to complicate the U.S.' position here to make them more of an aggravation towards the Kremlin ahead of what we think is likely to be a softer approach from the incoming Trump administration -- Kate.",
