And we have reached out to the Walker campaign and have not heard back.So, joining us now is op-ed columnist for \"The Los Angeles Times\" and the host of the podcast \"Life Out Loud,\" LZ Granderson. LZ, thanks so much for joining. Appreciate it. We're going to talk about the whole thing in general, right, what's happening - what happened in Colorado Springs, the LGBTQ sentiment in the country and the hate and the danger and the violence that members face. But what do you think about that ad and the timing there? LZ GRANDERSON, OP-ED COLUMNIST, \"THE LOS ANGELES TIMES\": Well, I - I'm confused to be quite honest with you because when you look at the exit polls, the issues that are on voters' minds, number one, obviously, was the economy. How do you put food on the table. Paying for gas. The inflation. Number two was abortion. Following down from that are issues regarding security, and safety, education. I did not see very many voters stress confusion or anxiety regarding trans-athletes competing in sports, in high school or in college. And so this seems to be a manufactured issue from Herschel Walker, who had nowhere else to turn because he has no credibility when it comes to discussing the economy because we understand his business dealings. He's surrounded by controversy regarding abortion. So, where else is he going to turn? Hate. And that's what this ad is, hate. But here's the important thing to remember, trans-athletes are already banned in Georgia. That was signed into law earlier. I'm not saying that to celebrate, I'm saying that to say, what exactly is this ad supposed to do for Georgian voters? It's already abandoned in the state. So why -- what is the purpose of this ad? Only to spew hate. That's it.",

And as a queer person, you know, you and I both know, we've been targeted multiple times.I can remember shaking in my office in New York City when the Bush campaign was trying to get re-elected and targeting queer people by trying to pass an amendment in the Constitution banning same-sex marriages.

So, I think about rhetoric all the time. I think about violence against my community all the time because I could have very well been a victim as well.And to the politicians who are utilizing this rhetoric just to get re- elected, you know, you can't duck the fact that this blood is on your hands when you're - because you're contributing to the mentality that allows for this to happen. When you allow slurs to exist, when you allow certain attitudes that are - that are really harmful to exist in your space, or, worse yet, use it in campaign ads, what you're doing is giving permission for people who have really nefarious intentions to go through with those intentions. And we've seen it time and time again. It's not antidotal. There are other groups that are also suffering in the exact same way. We've experienced this globally. So, I just really encourage, you know, particularly Republicans who, you know, are prone to have these kind of ads, I'd just ask you just to be really cautious in terms of how you engage in these conversations because whether you believe it or not, this blood is on your hands because you're contributing to this echo chamber that is leading to all this violence.",

DR. CHRIS T.

Normally, if you're 65 or older, about 2 percent of persons of that age group will develop Alzheimer's in the year. If you have one copy of that gene, that risk triples.
