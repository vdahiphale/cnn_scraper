      "sentences": "The biggest investment most people ever make is their home. And after nine interest rate hikesfrom the Fed, it`s a tale of two housing markets today in America, where the bubble appears to have popped in the West Coast tech hubs and the pandemic boom towns but holding up rather well out east. All real estate is local, of course, but the trends are revealing Redfin measures pending home sales. Price drops and supply and found Austin, Texas is the fastest cooling metro area in the country. It was once the pandemic relocation magnet of course, Seattle is next. Then Phoenix, Tacoma, Denver, Vegas and four California cities round out the top 10. But head east and upper Midwest and northeast towns are cooling much more slowly, and home price is out east still rising. Case Shiller shows home prices in these cities up year over year. They`re not skyrocketing like the last 10 years, but they`re holding in. Travel to the southeast and it is a boom time in real estate. Miami home prices in January up nearly 14% from a year ago. Tampa up 10.5%, Atlanta, 8.4% and Charlotte up 8.1%. You can clearly see sellers have the upper hand in the Sun Belt, a sharp contrast to the home prices in the tech hubs out west, where prices are falling sharply, led by San Francisco, where prices fell almost 8% in January compared with last year. This is, of course, after years of runaway price gains in those tech hubs. Call it a real estate reckoning out west, tech company pink slips, bank jitters, low inventory and mortgage rates that have almost doubled. Higher rates make the same home a year ago a lot more expensive to finance today. A $400,000 mortgage taken out at today`s mortgage rates would cost almost $400 more a month in the extra interest.

Accordingto the Airports Council International, the U.S. actually had half of the 10 busiest airports in the world last year. Atlanta`s Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International took the title for a second consecutive year as the world`s busiest airport in terms of passenger volume. Coming in second was Dallas-Fort Worth. Then it was followed by Denver, then Chicago O`Hare. Los Angeles came in 6th on the list. The other five airports in the top 10 were cities abroad., Dubai, Istanbul, Heathrow Airport in London, New Delhi and Paris. The airport`s Council International also expects strong travel recovery this year for global passenger traffic and a full recovery by next year that we haven`t seen since 2019. Ten second trivia. In Greek mythology, who was Apollo`s twin sister and the goddess of the moon? Artemis, Luna, Athena or Diana? Artemis is your answer here. And she also served as the goddess of the hunt and wild animals. Artemis is also connected to space exploration. And that`s where our next story takes us. It has been 50 years since astronauts returned to the moon, but NASA just announced its team for its next moon mission. These four astronauts, three Americans and one Canadian will make their journey to outer space on Artemis 2 in November of 2024. This will also be an historic mission as it will be the first time a woman and a person of color will be on a lunar flight. Our Ed Lavandera sat down with the newly named crew. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
