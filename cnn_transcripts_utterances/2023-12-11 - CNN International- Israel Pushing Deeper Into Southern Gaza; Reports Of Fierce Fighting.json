      "sentences": "That's right. And the situation on the ground is growing increasingly desperate, whether you listen to doctors on the ground or international humanitarian organizations, the Secretary General of the United Nations, all of them warning that the situation is growing more dire by the day, and that is in part, because even as Israeli forces are making more efforts to direct civilians to evacuate from areas that are going to be the scenes of heavy fighting between Israel and Hamas, many of these civilians either don't have the ability to move to where they're being told to go, or when they do get to where they're told to go, what they are finding is areas where the shelters are overcrowded. They are under resource. Thousands of people flooding in daily to the city of Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza.And not only are they facing a lack of resources there, but they are also still facing bombing from the Israeli Military in that area as well. We have seen as there have been efforts to ramp up the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza as well. Israeli officials days ago said that they would open up the Kerem Shalom crossing between Gaza and Israel, which also has a gate to go from Egypt into Israel for the inspection, at least of humanitarian aid trucks, the security inspection, that would double the capacity of the Israelis to inspect the trucks which they inspect before they go into Gaza. We were expecting that that crossing might open today. But, it appears not to be the case, in part because Egyptian officials were clearing that Rafah crossing for a VIP visit into Gaza today. So, some questions about when exactly that will open. But, the United States, for its part, is continuing to pressure the Israeli government to do more to not only open up those humanitarian aid routes and deconfliction times with humanitarian aid agencies to allow for the flow of goods, but also to do more to protect civilians. And even the Secretary of State Tony Blinken saying that even as he believes that Israel has the intent to protect civilians, that there is still a big gap between that intent and what's actually happening on the ground.",

And in Lebanon, according to the National News Agency, government institutions and schools are closed. Now, Ukraine says its air defenses destroyed eight ballistic missiles launched by Russia towards Kyiv. An all clear has been issued for the city after air raid sirens went off earlier on Monday morning. Authorities say falling rocket fragments caused a fire at an unfinished building. So far, at least four injuries have been reported but no deaths. Ukraine's President heading to the U.S. this week, his third trip to Washington since Russia invaded his country nearly two years ago. A statement from Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office says he'll meet with U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday about \"further defense cooperation\". His visit comes at a critical moment, as negotiations over billions of dollars in additional aid for Ukraine's war effort remain stalled in the U.S. Congress. Donald Trump has been there, done that, and he is not coming back. The former U.S. President posted on social media he will not testify in his civil fraud case, saying he has testified already and has nothing more to say. He was scheduled to take the stand later this morning. Trump and his sons are accused of falsifying financial documents to get better terms on loans. They risk losing their rights to do business in New York State. The trial therefore resumes on Tuesday. There is a fierce debate across American universities about where free speech ends and antisemitism begins. Three of the country's most prestigious schools are at the epicenter of that debate, Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania. U.S. lawmakers grilled their leaders last week. And as you may recall, things didn't go very well for them. So bad in fact that Penn's President has already resigned this weekend. However, at Harvard, some 600 faculty members signed a petition to resist the calls for its president to step down, and MIT's governing board vows to stand behind its school's president. CNN Jason Carroll joins us from Cambridge, Massachusetts, home of Harvard and MIT, and these are very well known around the world. It does - many people asking the question, how can MIT and Harvard's presidents stay when Penn's was forced out? JASON CARROLL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Certainly, that is the question that some folks here at Harvard are raising, some of the people that we've spoken to. It's very clear to them that even though we heard apologies from Harvard President Claudine Gay after she made those remarks as just -- after she testified to Congress last week, that the apology simply was not enough. The feeling after speaking to a number of students here on campus here at Harvard is that while you have some people who say, look, this is a woman who should step aside, there are some who say she should be allowed to stay. And that is a decision they say that should be made not by outside forces, not by politicians, not by the media, and not by critics. But, that's a decision that should remain within the university. So, that's just sort of the back and forth that we're getting here. What's also interesting, Max, is how many people we spoke to who didn't want to talk about this subject matter at all. It's not that they didn't have an opinion about the subject matter. But, the feeling was that no matter what you say, it's going to be taken in the wrong way, or no matter what you say, it's going to hurt someone on the other side. And so, that was fascinating as well, how many people had opinions, but just didn't feel like this was the environment that they were able to express it.",

One tornado hit Madison, nearby Hendersonville, with peak winds of 125 miles an hour, according to a preliminary survey by the weather service, and another tornado devastated Clarksville over, an 11-mile path where officials say nearly 100 military families lost their homes.

      "sentences": "The two governments, and surprisingly, blamed each other as the culprit for the latest incidents over the weekend. But, the root cause, of course, is this long-running territorial dispute between Beijing and many of its neighbors, including the Philippines, because China claimed sovereignty over almost the entirety of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea. But, there are strategic and tactical reasons why we are hearing more about these dramatic encounters, because the Philippine government under President Marcos has been increasingly publicizing them, obviously trying to draw global attention to but also presumably more international support for the Philippines because they do have that sense of urgency.Part of what the Philippines has done was back in 1999, they deliberately ran ashore a World War Two era vessel on the Second Thomas Shoal that's part of the Spratly's to stake its claim. And ever since then, they have been that ship as a military outpost, and mostly able to rotate their Marines in and out and resupplying it with civilian ships. But, that has changed since Chinese leader Xi Jinping took power with China's foreign policy and military operations in the region becoming more assertive, and some will say more aggressive. Now, with the Filipino ship being so old that they need to urgently repair it. Otherwise, the fear is it's going to be rusting away and being washed away by waters, and that would allow the Chinese to just swoop in and take control of that reef, and potentially militarizing it as they have done too many other previously uninhabited reefs and islands in the South China Sea. That's why strategically President Marcos has been deepening and broadening cooperation with the U.S. Military by giving additional access to Filipino bases to the U.S. Military and also restarting joint air and sea patrols with the U.S. And all of that, of course, in the eyes of the Beijing, is the Philippines doing the U.S. bidding to stir troubles in the region to challenge China's interests and the supremacy in the region. That's why the U.S. is very much seen as part of this growing saga despite the recent thaw in U.S.-China relations. So, that's why these latest incidents are worrisome to many analysts because it doesn't really bode well for where the situation is headed with regional and global implications.
