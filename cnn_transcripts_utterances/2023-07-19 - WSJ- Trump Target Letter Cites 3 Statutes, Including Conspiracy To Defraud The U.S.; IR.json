I'm Jake Tapper.And we start with our law and justice lead, and what could be an unprecedented third criminal indictment and second federal criminal indictment against former President Donald Trump for his unprecedented actions. Today, Trump's lawyers and advisers are scrambling to try to figure out what possible evidence and what possible witnesses might be part of special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into efforts to over turn the 2020 election. Now sources say that the letter that Trump received on Sunday, informing him that he was a target of investigation, and giving him until tomorrow to appear before the grand jury, that letter laid out a bigger possible case than the Trump team was expecting, given the evidence and testimony they were aware. This is one of the many legal challenges Donald Trump is facing, of course, as special counsel has already charged Trump on the federal level in the classified documents case. In New York, Trump also faces charges in the hush money case. And also on the state level, but this time in Georgia, prosecutors are also weighing whether to charge Trump with trying to overturn the election results in Georgia. CNN's Evan Perez joins me. And, Evan, we know the grand jury is scheduled to hear more testimony tomorrow. How soon could be learn about possible charges or a possible indictment and arrest?",

This is something that could be very perfunctory and frankly, the special counsel team is not necessarily expecting Trump to actually respond. They don't have to respond. It's an invitation for him to come to the grand jury and/or present some evidence. The Trump team also has not indicated whether they are even going to respond.The last time that he got a target letter, there was about three weeks, that span that time between the time he got the target letter and the time that we learned of the indictment. This time, you know, obviously, we don't expect him to ask for a meeting with the attorney general and expect the other things that happened in the Mar-a-Lago case to happen in this one. And we know that the three crimes that, according to \"The Wall Street Journal\" and others that have reported on the contents of the target letter, the three crimes that he is at least being informed of, the three statutes, one of them is deprivation of rights. Another one is conspiracy to commit an offense or defraud the United States. That's a very common charge that we've seen a lot in the last few years. And then, of course, there is a tampering charge. That could be the statute that governs that could be related to obstruction of the congressional proceeding which is, again, a very common charge that we've seen in January 6 cases.",

They few that things have heated up when they learned that Jared Kushner had gone before the grand jury and it seemed there was a downturn in events. So the time was one of things that they were caught off guard by.But the other was exactly what was in the target letter. These potential charges seem to indicate that the special prosecutor had a much bigger case than they had anticipated. So what they're looking for now and trying to figure out if there is any evidence that Jack Smith might have or any extra witnesses that went in, that they just didn't know about, that they were unprepared for. And the thing to keep in mind here is that they were watching this very closely. And so many of the witnesses that came before the January 6 grand jury were represented by lawyers who were paid for by Trump world, which was giving them the opportunity to really have increased insight into what was going on in that investigation. But, again, they're now looking for that evidence trying to see if there is anything there. A lot of conversations going on around us, and while we're hearing from the advisers would say it is business as usual, they're going forward with the campaign and Trump is hosting a event at Bedminster down the street later tonight. We also know that there is always concern from allies that as the legal issues mount, that is going to be more complicated for the former president to continue his third bid for the White House.",

First of all, could you explain the deprivation of rights charge? TOM DUPREE, FORMER PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, G.W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION: Sure. That's a federal criminal statute, Jake, that basically penalizes with criminal sanctions anyone who under color of law, which means that basically imbued with official action deprived someone of their constitutional rights. My best guess is what the special counsel is getting at, that right that was deprived is the right to vote. That's my best guess as to where the special counsel is going with this.

It is more conservative and the statute that the special counsel appears poised to charge under something is fairly charged often. So judges will be more familiar with it.

One are the state officials that the president and his colleagues were pressuring to change the results.

Or if it is answered, it's very sporadically.And so, what we believe is that likely, there are informal conversations happening. We do believe that this American is likely being quarantined at the moment because they are worried about COVID- 19. He will likely be questioned by the North Koreans about what happened when he was here in South Korea. Of course, we've now learned that he spent 50 days in detention for some sort of a fight, some sort of a brawl. He was supposed to be sent back to Texas to be officially separated from the Army. That's why he decided to come here and make a run for it, Jake. But his current condition and current status is still unknown because the North Koreans have not publicized anything at this stage.",

Really, it seems, though, with all Western intelligence capabilities, remember they got the invasion, they predicted that pretty accurately.

A new study from John Hopkins medicine estimates that 795,000 people here in the United States die or become permanently disabled every year because a disease or medical condition was misdiagnosed. Viewers know that my daughter Alice who's now great nearly died in 2021 from a medical problem that was entirely preventable, a misdiagnosed perforated appendix. She went into sepsis almost because of that and thankfully, she is stronger than ever now.But there are thousands more who share similar stories or far, far worse. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us now. And, Sanjay, Dr. Newman-Toker who led the study is he's one of the folks who did an after action report looking into why Alice's case went so wrong. What did he find in this study? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, he found these big numbers, first of all, and he's talking about misdiagnosis, which could mean the wrong diagnosis or it could mean missed diagnosis, missed the diagnosis, which is sort of what happened with Alice. They just missed the diagnosis. The numbers are big. I think this is what got everyone's attention, 370,000 people who die annually because of these missed or misdiagnosis, 424,000 who have these disabilities. I do want to be clear just so we are not frightening people, overall, going to the hospital going to a clinic visit, less than 0.1 percent chance of the average person having some sort of severe outcome as a result of these misdiagnoses. But there was some categories, Jake, which were the biggest culprits for misdiagnosis: sepsis -- what you just mentioned Alice almost went into -- stroke, pneumonia, blood clots, lung cancer. These were the ones that are most likely to account for those severe outcomes and where they focus their attention and study.",

People think, okay, you got weakness, you got difficulty speaking, that's stroke. But what if somebody comes in with dizziness or headache or fatigue, less -- less sort of clear. People might miss that. Cardiac stuff, heart stuff, you know, classic left sided chest pain. That's what people typically think of. But what if it's more generalized chest pain or weakness or shortness of breath?
