Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"Good evening. We're going to get to all of those stories in just a moment, but we are going to begin tonight with a potential break in one of the greatest mysteries in all of American history. I'm talking about the hunt for the true identity of D.B. Cooper. Now he is the infamous airplane hijacker who jumped out of a plane back in 1971 with $200,000 in cash never to be seen again. His identity is a mystery to this very day. But tonight, my next guest says that he has found that parachute that D.B. Cooper used, and that it could actually end the mystery once and for all.

Now he has always been a rumored longtime suspect and was killed in 1974 after pulling off a similar heist but there has never been any proof linking him. Now bits of money have been recovered in the past. There have been literally hundreds of tips and leads over the years that have gone exactly nowhere.But according to my next guest, his discovery of the parachute caught the attention of the FBI, who then visited the home and took the parachute into custody. Now we asked the FBI about this, and they wouldn't confirm nor deny. Hmm. They would only point us to a 2016 statement that basically says they've stopped wasting resources on this because they've gotten nowhere. But they say something very interesting at the end of that 2016 statement. Quote -- \"Although the FBI will no longer actively investigate this case, should specific physical evidence emerge -- related specifically to the parachutes or the money taken by the hijacker -- individuals with those materials are asked to contact their local FBI field office.\" Well, joining me now is the man who helped uncover the parachute, Dan Gryder. He is a retired pilot, a YouTuber, and a D.B. Cooper sleuth. Dan, great to have you here tonight. Tell me about how you found that piece of evidence and why you believe that that belonged to D.B.

I tried like crazy to get these kids to talk to me, and they would not talk to me until both their mother and their grandmother died. Their mother, Karen McCoy, was an accomplice in both hijackings.And what most people don't know is that there were actually two hijackings. There was a first one, the D.B. Cooper one. And then the same guy, Richard Floyd McCoy, he went back and did the exact same thing five months later, April of '72. It's the same guy. But none of the kids would ever talk to me about this until they were both dead, and then they felt relieved that their mother was no longer in danger of going to prison as an accomplice in the D.B. Cooper heist. COATES: That's incredible to think about, that they may have, according to you, believe that their family was somehow connected to any of this.

So, he logged 39 previous static line jumps, and then eight practice free fall jumps in -- in anticipation of doing this hijacking, and then nothing until right before April '72. He went back and did one more practice jump prior to his April '72 parachute jump, and he logged that one. All those jumps are in there.
