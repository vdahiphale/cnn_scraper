Twenty- five percent say it does not matter. We're going to start with New York Times senior political correspondent and CNN political analyst Maggie Haberman.And Maggie, here are just some of Trump's legal problems front and center. Just an incomplete list, but just to bring our audience up to speed. This week, the U.S. Supreme Court is going to hear oral arguments in these case on whether or not he can be on the ballot. Today, his legal team filed a brief accusing his challengers in the case of pursuing a, quote, \"anti-democratic case against him.\" So that's today. Also, we're waiting on the Federal Appeals Court to rule on Trump's claims to presidential immunity. Then there's also, we're waiting for a ruling in the civil fraud trial against Trump in New York, his sons and Trump organization also on the hook there. And this comes after Trump was ordered to pay E. Jean Carroll $83 million after her defamation suit last month. Can you take us inside Trump's mind right now? What must he be thinking? I mean, we know he's a man who embraces grievance, but this is a lot.",

We know that it is a huge amount of money he doesn't want to have to pay. And he will have to pay some of it, even as he's appealing it. Some of this is going to have to go forward.We know that he is waiting for the ruling in the New York Attorney General civil fraud case against his company. The Colorado ballot case, his team actually feels pretty good about its chances at the Supreme Court and they see that as helping them politically, which is why you saw something like that filing today.

Isn't getting something done, something that, by the way, the border police, the Border Patrol Union, which is pretty conservative, supports, isn't that better than nothing?REP. TIMOTHY BURCHETT (R-TN):  Well, I think we're starting off with nothing. You're saying that you're going to allow 5,000 people in a day. I mean, obviously, you're saying that something that's illegal, you're making it legal. You know, $60 billion for Ukraine. The single largest expenditure in this thing is directly to Ukraine. They should have just called it Ukraine, right? But let's -- I think everybody's trying to pick a fight. What we should be doing is individually passing these bills. There's aid in here for Israel. Speaker Johnson is -- we're moving forward with something that this week. And Ukraine, I believe there would be enough money for Ukraine, but everybody wants to fight. I wouldn't vote for the money for Ukraine, but I think there'd be enough to pass it. I think that all the other money would probably pass in some form or another, but they're going to lump it all together. And I just don't see it happening. I'm not going to vote for something that allows 5,000 illegal folks a day, but I'll tell you what I really think whose fingerprints are on this, if I could go a little deeper. I think it's these national chambers of commerce, you know. They want free or cheap labor. They want people that won't have insurance. They won't have any representation.

So, they're saying it's a trigger. It doesn't let in 5,000.

Former Democratic Congressman Max Rose, Haley's called for mental competency test for politicians over 75. But in her SNL appearance this weekend, she turned her attack line on Trump and Biden's age into a punchline. Do you think that, I mean, do you think it's ageism and do you think it will hurt her? MAX ROSE, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, NEW YORK:  It doesn't really matter. Her campaign's over. I mean, statistically speaking, she's gonna lose South Carolina by 20, 30 points. And right now, she's being funded by an array of anti-Trump forces, obviously of which I consider myself one. What's fascinating though, about the overarching dynamic, is this is actually quite helpful for Donald Trump. You know, people are forgetting the disastrous four years that was the Trump presidency. And that's why you're seeing an uptick in his general election numbers. The sooner that this primary is over, the sooner that people can understand this election is a very simple binary choice between crazy and normalcy.

COLEMAN HUGHES, AUTHOR, \"THE END OF RACE POLITICS\":  Yeah, so colorblindness used to be the standard liberal philosophy. For a moment in the 60s when we passed the Civil Rights Act the idea was that we are going to get race out of public policy and we're going to deal with the legacy of slavery with racial inequality by an intense anti-poverty program that would benefit the black poor and the white poor alike, but would disproportionately benefit the black and Hispanic poor because blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately likely to be poor.",

In the past 50 years, there have been a group of scholars, and especially in the past 10 years, it's become much more popular with the rise of critical race theory and so forth to say that actually color blindness is not the right way to go. It's a Trojan horse for white supremacy. All it does is allow racial inequality to persist. So, what we have to do is aggressively put race into every public policy, including even COVID emergency policies that prioritized emergency aid based on race.I argue that actually the civil rights movement had it right. If you go back, you read Martin Luther King's book, \"Why We Can't Wait.\" He says, yes, we have to address the legacy of slavery. Yes, we have to do something special in order to repay the debt to black Americans, but that something should be socioeconomic class-based policy, doesn't discriminate against anyone on the basis of skin color and still tackles poverty.

REUVEN HAZAN, HEBREW UNIVERSITY DEPT. OF POLITICAL SCIENCE: The pressure is everywhere he turns. This is an extremely difficult time for him politically.

Gantz's right hand man, Gadi Eisenkot, going so far as to call for new elections in the coming months, citing a lack of trust in Netanyahu.
