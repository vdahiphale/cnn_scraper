And this all started earlier today when Biden kind of threw down a gauntlet here. He challenged Trump to two pre-election showdowns. Here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then, he hasn't shown up for debate. Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal. I'll even do it twice. So let's pick the dates, Donald. I hear you're free on Wednesdays. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, as Kristen knows, by going to rallies, he's been traveling with an empty podium next to him, saying anytime, anyplace. So really, the only missing piece of this puzzle was President Biden. Biden, was he going to accept this or not? And behind the scenes, we've heard from Biden advisors for weeks and more than that, a couple of months, actually, that they knew that they had to debate. Look, he's not in the strongest position in all these battleground states, as we know. So they came to that conclusion.They thought the idea of not debating would be the story for the rest of the campaign. So they came to that conclusion. And on a Wednesday, when they could sort of own the news a little bit today, they decided to come out early this morning with that taunting video and then followed it up with accepting these debates. Which, of course, all the networks had, you know, thrown out there. Because, again, the only wild card was, was President Biden, when would he do it? Because the Trump campaign has been making no secret about the fact that they wanted to debate. So it came fast, yes. And I think even more important, these will be the earliest debates ever in the history of televised presidential debates. (CROSSTALK)",

And look what happened with the State of the Union. He gave a great speech, an energetic speech. And what was their response? Donald Trump said, well, I want him drug tested for the debates because I think he was on cocaine. What else would explain it? So I think they have to be careful. And that was at play 2022. You know - excuse me, in 2020. One of the moments that I remember is people always say Joe Biden is not a great debater. But one of the moments that stuck out was when Donald Trump said about the Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. And that was a really searing moment.That wasn't because Lester Holt asked the question. That was because when Lester Holt said, are you something about white nationalists? Donald Trump said, well, who are you talking about? Joe Biden interjected and said the Proud Boys. And that's what got Donald Trump to say stand back and stand by. Joe Biden knows what he's doing. And what you're saying about this morning, that Joe Biden is great. The feisty Joe Biden that feels it in his gut, that knows that this is an existential threat. That guy is itching to get into the ring with Donald Trump. But look, I have friends this morning who said, I hate this mano a mano macho stuff from Joe Biden. But that brings out the absolute best in him. I think they could debate 10 times and Joe Biden would win seven, eight or nine times. I think, you know, Donald Trump is not a good debater because he's not focused. All he does is complain about everyone picking on him. That's not what people want to hear.

So he really has to explain why that is. And I think that that's something that Todd Blanche should go into much more detail on, on cross-examination, getting a lot more deep than just simply saying, you know, that I was very loyal to him, and then I said that with my family and I changed my mind.

And I think that that is, you know, one of the key pieces of Michael Cohen's testimony that's not corroborated. So do you really need Donald Trump to get on to say, I didn't know that, you know, is that really going to help him, especially on balance of all the potential negative and unpredictable effects of him doing that? So if I were there, I would be telling him, please do not testify.KEILARL Yeah. I think we'll all be, be very surprised if it does happen, but sometimes with Donald Trump, anything can happen.
