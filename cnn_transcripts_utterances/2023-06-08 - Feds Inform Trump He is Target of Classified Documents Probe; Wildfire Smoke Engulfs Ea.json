In any federal investigation, a person can really have one of three statuses. Best case scenario, you're a witness, meaning, you just happen to see something, no reason to think you did anything wrong. The middle ground is you could be a subject, meaning, you're within the purview of what the grand jury is looking at. Worst case scenario is you are a target. Now, let me show you exactly what it means to be a target. If you look at the justice manual, now, this is a book on every federal prosecutor's desk, it binds federal prosecutors around the country, here is the actual definition. It means two important things. It means that prosecutors have substantial evidence linking the person to the commission of the crime, and who in the judgment of a prosecutor is a putative defendant. That is the word of the day. It's a lawyer word because it can mean different things to different people. It means an assumed defendant, a likely defendant. Not a necessarily a certain defendant. So, that means different things to different people. In my experience, Phil and Poppy, when a person gets a target letter, it's quite likely, not certain, but quite likely that they will get indicted.",

Those meetings are naturally going to happen only at the very end of a proceeding. That meeting happened on Monday. We are now on Thursday. So, everyone is saying, when, when, when?Important to keep in mind, we don't know. This is up to DOJ.

If feels like we've had many of them over the course of the last several years, but the target letter. What is your read on what this means? And if you take a step back for a minute, what does this tell you about what is potentially about to happen to a former president of the United States? DAVID SCHOEN, TRUMP'S DEFENSE LAWYER DURING SECOND IMPEACHMENT TRIAL: Well, Elie Honig is exactly right in his description of what a target means. It is based on -- it's a term used in the Department of Justice manual. It means substantial evidence linking a person, a putative defendant to a crime. I don't know that it tells us much about the timing, although I would credit some of the pundits who have been saying something may be imminent. But, you know, you can get a target letter at the beginning of a long investigation or right at the end before an indictment. And you're right also, it is unprecedented.",

It is Department of Justice policy to allow a defendant who's gotten a target letter to testify if he or she requests it. I can't imagine in this case it would be in President Trump's interest to testify. I think that there's an agenda here, one way or the other, and I think decisions have been made. That's the way I would read the situation.An interesting element of this is what charge would be considered. There is a lot of speculation. Several of the charges to be considered wouldn't revolve around the idea of there being classified documents. I do think, though, while this is unprecedented, that it would hold a great danger to President Biden if they were to charge him -- charge President Trump under 18 USC 793E, which is one of the charges they talked about. Now, that's the retention of government documents. I think there is a real danger there given the document were found with President Biden because this just requires them to show that the information was national defense information broadly construed and that the person knew he or she did something wrong by retaining it. President Biden has got a great deal of experience in government. Much President Trump was a businessman.",

First of all, a lawyer cannot be in the room with the client. The grand jury is really run by the prosecutor. It's a very dangerous situation, even for an innocent person. So, that's sort of, I guess, the second part.By an agenda, I mean that this thing is pretty well along right now, this investigation had been going on quite some time. I'll tell you what concerns me, to be perfectly frank. I don't like the specter of having folks like Andrew Weissmann, Norm Eisen and others who have made a career now over the last couple of years of going after Donald Trump, writing a memo, for example, to the Justice Department, to Lisa Monaco, advising her on how you could prosecute President Trump.

And we're going to show you just how bad it's getting.Our photojournalist, Steve Williams, as I step out of the shot here, he's going to train his camera down Pennsylvania Avenue here toward the U.S. Capitol. Now, on any normal day, even if it's raining, you can see the Capitol really clearly down Pennsylvania Avenue. But take a look. Steve is going to go in as tightly as he can, but even then, you can barely make it out. Take a look at that. It's really extraordinary. When I was driving in here from across the river in Virginia, you could also barely make out the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial coming across the bridge. And if Steve, you know, trains his camera down to street level, you can also kind of see what pedestrians and tourists and commuters are up against. The visibility is not great. We've seen a couple of joggers come through here and bicyclists. That's what you're not supposed to do. It's just dangerous to be out here. I can also tell you what it feels like physically. It feels -- it gets into your lungs. It gets into your eyes. It's very irritating. We've seen people donning K-95 masks to the old COVID masks that they've had during the pandemic. They're breaking those out again just to get to work. Now, here's what officials are telling people at this code red air quality alert. They're telling people avoid exercise and any strenuous activity outside for people who are older, 65 and older, also children, people who -- pregnant women, people who have pulmonary issues. You really have to stay inside is what they're saying today. Keep your windows and doors closed. You can run your A.C., but keep the outdoor air intake valves closed so that smoky air from the outside does not get inside. Also, make sure your filters are clean. Those are warnings from D.C. and Maryland and Virginia officials to all local residents this morning. What we also can tell you is that Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore, they told CNN yesterday they had double the number of patients that they usually have coming in with pulmonary issues.

Children, families would have been out there. It's really hot in France right now. And what we understand is that this young man, who's now in police custody, went on the rampage with a knife, hurting two adults.But more troublingly, I think, for the entire country, as we watch this unfold, four very small children are now understood to be in critical condition. And when I say very young, we're looking at preschool aged children at this stage. Phil, a fairly frenzied attack. He was unusually in these cases, not neutralized as the French tend to do, but taken into custody. So, we do hope to find more about what his motives may have been. For the time being, I think I should say that the anti-terror unit has not been seized of this. They are keeping an eye, but there is no suggestion this is part of a terror plot. We await more details even as France starts to come to the terms with something that is very unusual in this country and that is an attack on small children, Phil.",

Ukraine's military says about 1,500 residents have been evacuated from that region so far, with more than 230 square miles flooded. I mean look at that video. Look at all the flooding. These are entire communities that remain underwater this morning. And the flooding has also spurred fears of an ecological catastrophe. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the area on Wednesday. He met with rescue workers. He also urged the international community to come forward with a really swift humanitarian response.",

In the 1980s, he mortgaged part of the farmland he inherited to invest in a software company, then became that company's CEO and sold it for a billion dollars to Microsoft in 2001.In 2016, he pulled off a major political upset when he won the Republican primary for governor. The question is, of course, can he do it again and on the biggest stage? And, oh, by the way, he's running against the former president and at least eight other major candidates. Well, we're going to ask him. Joining us now to answer that question is the candidate himself, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Governor, thanks so much for your time. I do want to start there, though. I don't think there's any equivocation with your record in North Dakota, both from a conservative perspective, also from a results perspective to some degree. But Rob Port is a political writer in the state who I've followed pretty regularly since 2016 during your race, wrote something in the Grand Forks  Herald. He said, Burgum has to do something to address his obscurity problem. He needs a hook that will get him attention. He didn't provide one today, talking about your announcement. He's going to have to soon. Rob is a very astute observer of these things, and I think he makes a good point. People don't know necessarily who you are nationwide. How do you change that? And tied to that, how much money are you willing to spend to ensure that change happens?",

We're heading to Iowa today and tomorrow will be in New Hampshire this weekend. But we've got a great story to tell.North Dakota has been thriving. Our state is growing and getting younger, where our economy has become so diverse, we're on our way to having the highest GDP in the nation. And one of the things that we think is missing in this race is people actually talking about the issues that are the most important issues to the most number of people, and, of course, that is the economy. Inflation is cutting into every single family in their budgets across the nation. Gas prices are too high. That directly relates to energy policy. And, of course, there's a lot of concern about the future because, from a national security standpoint, these are all interrelated. I mean, Putin never invades Ukraine if he doesn't have Western Europe entirely dependent on his energy sources. We're looking at the possibility of the same things --",
