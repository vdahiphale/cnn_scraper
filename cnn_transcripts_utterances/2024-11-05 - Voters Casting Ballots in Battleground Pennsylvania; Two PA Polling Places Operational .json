But just a short time ago, both Harris and Trump had a message for voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We got to get it done. Today is voting day, and people need to get out and be active.

And one key question, and they say they just don't know the answer to this yet, is when and if he will leave his Mar-a-Lago Resort, that is where he's going to be watching some of this election night coverage and head over to the convention center to address the press.Now, when I talked to them, they said that they recognize that the election is likely to be very close. It will not be called tonight. But they do have a sense that some critical swing states will be called tonight, and that is the question of whether or not Trump will actually go out there and talk to people reminiscent of what we saw back in 2020. One source said that there have been discussions on Trump coming out to speak after some of these critical battleground states are called. Another source told me it's still a question, even if he comes out there at all to address the press. Now, one thing is, we did just see Donald Trump moments ago vote here in Palm Beach with his wife, Former First Lady, Melania Trump. A reporter asked him, do you plan to declare victory this evening? This is what Trump said. He said, quote, yeah. I mean, I'm hearing the same things that you're hearing. I'm hearing states where I'm up by a lot, but they won't -- long time. He essentially said, I don't know if something happens. I don't know what's going to happen in terms of declaring victory, but in normal times, I would go over to the convention center, let's say at 10 o'clock. Normal times, meaning he was railing against that it's not just paper ballots and in person voting, but kind of criticizing the process of mail-in voting and noting that this is going to have to take a much longer time. Now, one thing I do want to be very clear about and discussing all of this Wolf is to remember what happened in 2020 when Donald Trump went out there the morning, late into the morning, right after the election, and preemptively and falsely declared victory, despite us not knowing the election results yet, and also him ultimately not winning. That is the key question that I think a lot of people have anxiety about is whether or not he will do that this evening.

She concluded that yesterday, crisscrossing the battleground State of Pennsylvania.But she is participating in a spate of radio interviews where she is continuing to press for people to vote and also outlining her own vision, especially targeting those people who may still be on the fence as to who they're going to vote for. And in doing so, she's also previewing a little bit about how her day is going to go. She says that she has a tradition of having dinner with family on election night, so that is exactly what she plans on doing later tonight. But behind the scenes, Harris advisor certainly working around the clock to try to bring in as many votes as they can, especially working with the ground game infrastructure that they have been so bullish on over the last year. Now, of course, tonight is also a test of many strategies that they put into play over the last several weeks, which was building out their coalition. It wasn't just locking in their base, but it was also trying to reach those disaffected Republicans, those who were fatigued by foreign President Donald Trump. And also using issues like reproductive rights to really galvanize voters. And over the course of the morning, they, like us, have heard from voters who have continued to cite reproductive rights, so they're hoping that that strategy of using that issue and leaning in on it could pay off for them in the end. But the Harris team has also said that they recognize it could be a lengthy process as these votes come in later tonight, they said that they are going to remain, quote, calm and confident as that happens. But certainly, they are not letting their foot off the gas as they contribute -- continue to mobilize voters who are still heading to the polls, Wolf.",

So that was a big thing, but I think Michigan is going to be good. They were all looking really good. Susie, I can't think of anything. What do you think of Susie? Would you say good? Well, we just wanted to come over. Paris, Texas is really great. And we're going to see it tonight, and hopefully they'll be able to get these expensive computers going. You know, the reason you use computers is to make time so that it's like, fast you don't use them, so that you have to come up with an answer three days later. And that's a little scary. when they say, what are they doing? You use a computer because it calculates quickly, and you use paper because you save costs, but the paper turns out to be much quicker than the computer. There's something wrong with that, so we don't like that. But there are a lot of things that are happening in our country that have to be changed, and we'll do it, and we'll do what's right for the country. And I think that's why we're doing well, but let's see if we can close it out. But it would be -- I just asked about it. Wouldn't it be nice if, after spending billions of dollars that they could have a computer give an answer by like, 10 o'clock? It doesn't make sense, does it? It doesn't really make sense.
