And then we started reaching out to people to pick on Steven Spielberg's idea, by the way.He saw the list in the New Republic last summer, and he thought this would be a good piece for TCM. And we reached out to CNN, and we heard very quickly that you were interested. And I was going to ask you. I mean, you're the one. You had a lot of movies to choose from.

But it's also about how this kind of, let's call it collusion between the FBI and the Chicago police and a false narrative wasn't a conspiracy at the time. It turned out to be true.And I wonder if you think that there is anything about this film that can help us understand the origins of conspiracies about assassinations. There were so many of them in the 1960s. There are conspiracies right now about the assassination attempts against Donald Trump.",

So, you can hear me and Abby talk about the movie. You can watch \"The Murder of Fred Hampton\" at midnight Eastern, at nine o'clock Pacific.We have conversations before and after the movie. So, there's a lot to learn from this. You know, I worked, I was a journalist, you're a journalist. You know, the narrative that police give you on anything instantly becomes the dominant narrative involving a crime. There is no more powerful authority than having the police tell you how a circumstance, especially a violent crime, something that scares people, went down. And people were scared of Fred Hampton, right? The powers that be in Chicago were afraid of him, even though, as you see in the documentary, this was a -- this was a gentle man who cared deeply about really important issues. I also think it's really worth seeing because you'll never see another movie like this. I mean, they were making a movie about Fred Hampton, right? And the Black Panther Party. And then he was murdered in the middle of production. And the filmmakers went to the crime scene the next day. And they're just there walking around because nobody roped it off because the cops thought, well, they're not going to be an investigation. We've already told you what happened.",
