Let me tell you, three people died here, including a child; about 70 miles northwest of here in Clarksville, another three people died including a minor.

We have new tornado watches in effect.Here is a look at what is left behind, a little bit of a map, and you can see where the storms really blew up yesterday. So far we have 28 reported tornadoes and that number is climbing as they comb through the damage. They have to confirm those tornadoes on the ground, 73 reports there of hail. Looking at the radar, you can see the showers stretching from New York down to the Big Bend of Florida. No active warnings right now, but you do have very intense rain and lightning in Florida. We have two areas to watch today, the Big Bend of Florida here, tornado watch until 5:00. Another tornado watch until 8:00 this evening for eastern North Carolina, headed up to Virginia, including places like Raleigh where we could find additional spin-off tornadoes as we go through the afternoon and evening. So putting this in motion, you could see showers and storms still fire up. You could see from Wilmington, up the Outer Banks into Norfolk, we could find some of these showers and storms rotating and we could find a few more tornadoes. Some pinks showing up where we have cold that comes in behind it. That's going to blast some snow from the mid-Atlantic up into the northeast. So multi-hazard system with heavy rain going into New England. And some of that heavy snow in the interior New England for upstate New York and Vermont as well. The flooding is becoming a big issue for the northeast. You see that little red bull's eye there, along the I-95 corridor from New York into Boston, some heavy rain threats today and again tomorrow. Some of these rain totals could be up to two to four inches, some widespread flooding possible. And then the snow totals up to a foot possible in some locations. So multiple hazards for sure.",

So unless the judge is going to actually enforce that order, unless that order is going to have some teeth, it is not worth the paper that it is written on. All right. So let's shift gears if we can, you know, to Trump's former attorney and New York's former mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is also in court tomorrow. Giuliani is on trial to determine how much he will have to pay to Georgia election workers he lied about after the 2020 presidential race.

And like Alex Jones, I fully expect him to get hit with a seven or eight figure judgment.But Giuliani is looking towards the court of appeals. He's not putting on a substantive defense in this case. He can't because Judge Howell said that he didn't contest the charges and more importantly, he didn't comply with his discovery obligations. But I think Giuliani thinks that maybe if he gets to that D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, maybe he'll win a First Amendment challenge and this whole defamation case will go away.",

And then in the most recent speaker election in the case of trying to remove Kevin McCarthy, I didn't see Donald Trump do anything to try to persuade those eight holdouts, you know, to vote with Kevin McCarthy. So Trump's loyalty has really been much more of a one-way street, which is usually the case with Donald Trump. He expects loyalty, but then doesn't return that loyalty.

These two sides appear no closer to an agreement as we enter this critical week and, remember, Fredricka, President Biden has asked for this major $100 billion supplemental assistance package for Israel, Ukraine and also money for the border and Republicans have used that as leverage to try and put forward new rules, tough new rules on tightening immigration in the United States. The White House has argued and it warning that aid is quick running out for Ukraine. It could dry up by the end of the year and they warn that that could have dire effects on the battlefield in Ukraine if Ukraine isn't able to replenish its war chests.But those warnings seems to be falling on deaf ears so far. They have not broken the logjam and this morning, we did hear from the Republican and the Democrat who are sort of leading these discussions on Capitol Hill, talking about their positions, but it did not appear as if they were making much progress. Listen to some of what Chris Murphy, the Democrat, and James Lankford, the Republican said this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): This is one of the most dangerous moments I've ever faced in American politics and I wish Republicans weren't holding Israel aid and aid to Ukraine hostage to the resolution of immigration reform.",

We are measuring it by the amount of enemy combatants that we're able to take off the battlefield, by the amount of enemy infrastructure, on rocket launchers and weapons stockpiles that we're able to find and take out of commission. And we are also measuring it based on the amount of Hamas terrorists and other affiliated that are surrendering to us.
