They would just say, there are friends, there are aides, there are colleagues. We pay them. Is there anything wrong with it just to have them still on the payroll as their witnesses?

And we think they'll be friendly in terms of their mindset.So it's a pretty good plan to sort of keep the wall there. The ethics line, though, is very clear. The lawyer can't tell the witness, this is what we need you to say. Can't suggest, oh, wouldn't be a very good idea if you said these things. And we saw that issue come up with Cassidy Hutchinson.",

It's not just about, is there, you know, wire fraud or something around Save America PAC and related to January 6 fundraising? It did. There's also this question of the lawyering and who's in the fold. How are they being kept in the fold in the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation? WU: Yes. I do think the question of the PAC money is actually a real lurking presence here because you're looking at whether that money was gotten through false advertising, basically trying to solicit those funds.

He says, \"It's extraordinary, it's heartbreaking, and it's infuriating. Every Republican that's thrown their hat in the ring to run for president is showing up this weekend to pledge their undying loyalty to the NRA and the gun lobby, literally days after patrons at banks and little kids at elementary schools were gunned down in cold blood.\" The Democrats believe this will help them.

So we have seen this before, and I think right now, the candidates who are running or thinking about running on the Republican ticket are calculating, much like the abortion issue as well and maybe not so much.But this is a safe audience for them and right now in our politics, the hard right and the gun rights culture seem to be synonymous, and they know that this is a base that they want, at least for the primary. Now, what's going to be interesting, you know, we've had a rash of mass shootings in the last two weeks, in the last few months and a year. If this continues, will their stance on guns match public sentiment? Right now, it looks like public sentiment is that there should be gun regulations, and that's also among those who own guns. So it's going to be interesting to see how they continue to talk about guns as we move forward in the primary.",

We have seen this generation that has been impacted by Parkland, by Sandy Hook, really rise to the occasion, leading to scenes like we saw in Nashville with the political uproar that happened there.But I do think that this NRA convention and the fact that, you know, NRA holds convention days after mass shooting is essentially an evergreen headline at this point, really speaks to the -- embodies this debate that we're having. That the state of this gun debate in the country, and the fact that ultimately these mass shootings are happening not only with increasing frequency, but that Republicans still feel beholden to that base.

That's engagement.That's pulling over soft Republicans in the suburbs, but that's getting people active and animated. You mentioned the scenes in Tennessee. Tennessee is a Republican state. It's going to stay a red state. You know, but you see those young black members of the Tennessee House and the protests around them. Can you carry that into other places? Because if you have the combination of suburban women, young voters, African Americans, that's the Democratic constituency if you can keep them active and engaged on those issues.",

And she said to me, there are no guns in heaven. And I found that very striking in terms of this anger that I was hearing from her and others, young voters saying, we're coming up, we're next.

You know, they have repeatedly touted the record setting pace at which they have been able to confirm judicial nominees faster than the last three presidents in President Biden's first two years.And so it's important to look at this moment in time not only the narrow majority in the Senate, which makes this issue of judicial nominees notable, but also because that's basically all this White House can get done right now through Congress, is getting judicial nominees nominated and confirmed. So there are some real substantive concerns here, but also, clearly, some politics at play. When you look at, for example, Congressman Ro Khanna, chairman of Congresswoman Barbara Lee's campaign, she's the black woman who is -- a black woman who is running for Senate. Governor Newsom of California has said he will nominate a point a black woman to the Senate if Senator Feinstein resigns. So, again, some real concerns, but also some politics, as always.",
