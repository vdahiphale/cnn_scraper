Just ahead, President Joe Biden calls Israel's military operation in Gaza \"over the top\" as concerns over the IDF's anticipated move into Rafah are growing. Then, we're live in Pakistan where officials are still counting votes in a tense and widely-watched election. Plus, the Year of the Dragon is almost upon us. We'll take a look and what may lie ahead this year for some of the world's leading personalities. No war could be allowed in a gigantic refugee camp. But, the Norwegian Refugee Council and other aid groups are warning of a potential bloodbath if the Israeli military expands ground operations into Gaza's Rafah. More than a million displaced Palestinians have fled to the city close to Egypt's border to escape fighting elsewhere in Gaza. They're crammed into overcrowded shelters or living in tents. U.S. President Joe Biden also expressed his concern. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, if we look back a couple of months to mid-December when the ground operation into Khan Younis was just getting underway, President Biden called Israel's bombings \"indiscriminate\". It didn't really have a big impact on the ground. Civilian casualties have been counted in over the hundreds every day since there has been a struggle to get humanitarian aid in, and the situation now, according to the UNRWA chief, is that a lot of people within Gaza are now on the edge of famine in some parts of it, particularly in the north. So, it's hard to see how President Biden's comments alone will make a difference.We know that when he was here, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spent time meeting with not only the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, but he met with Herzi Halevi, the IDF Chief of Staff, and with the Mossad chief here as well, to get an idea of how they were going to handle a push into Rafah, which is what Prime Minister Netanyahu has said the IDF is on the verge of doing. There was a phone call today between U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and the Minister of Defense here, Yoav Gallant, again where they discussed the ongoing situation in Gaza, and one can expect the Secretary of Defense to have again gone over the same portions that Antony Blinken will have done. But, these have been conversations that have been had in the past. But, of course in Rafah, the stakes are so much higher. As you said, it's about 1.5 -- close to 1.5 million people there, about 300,000 were living there before, about a million displaced people are there in very flimsy shelters with not many options of places to go, and this is a concern for the Egyptians too. They're right on the border with Egypt, and the Egyptian Foreign Minister just yesterday said they have a real concern that if there is a military ground operation that goes into Rafah, and as we've seen in Khan Younis, these can be extended and lasts for over -- well over a month. The Egyptians are concerned people will get so desperate in Rafah, they'll try to get across the border into Egypt. And this then takes on a wholly new proportion. So, will President Biden's comments alone make a difference? The past evidence has shown that perhaps they weren't.",

      "sentences": "Hello, Bianca. We know that for some time now there have been intense discussions and negotiations behind the scenes, particularly, of course, when it comes to Egyptian, U.S. and Qatari officials who have been pushing hard to broker some sort of truce, some sort of ceasefire agreement. We have that confirmation yesterday from Hamas that a senior delegation had been sent to and have arrived in Cairo yesterday morning, led by a senior leader, Khalil Al-Hayya, arriving here for focus -- on discussions focused around a potential truce agreement.Of course, this comes after that counterproposal was issued by Hamas earlier in the week, focusing, looking at a prolonged phased truce agreement that would see potentially three phases, each, again, lasting 45 days, to see the gradual withdrawal under the framework proposed by Hamas of Israeli troops from Gaza, the gradual release of hostages held captive by Hamas as well as a push for greater humanitarian response effort and, of course, a long-term rebuild effort. And that has suddenly been the focus. We know that international partners have also been pushing for some sort of agreement to come to the fore. We heard from Saudi officials confirming that on Thursday that the Saudi Foreign Minister met with counterparts from Qatar, from Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and of course, from Egypt as well, as officials from the Palestinian Authority, again, focusing on the developments in Gaza, but also on calls for a ceasefire, a lasting ceasefire, and also on calls for further humanitarian aid to be brought into the Gaza Strip. Now, of course, we know that this is a primary concern for many in the international community, not least in the United States. We did hear from President Joe Biden yesterday. He has said that he is pushing hard and working tirelessly for some sort of ceasefire agreement. The hope, according to U.S. officials, is that a prolonged pause in fighting, a prolonged truce, as has been the proposal put forward, at best could allow the space for further diplomatic discussions around a lasting ceasefire. Of course, that counterproposal put forward by Hamas was not a call for a ceasefire, but rather it will be under the framework of that truce for a ceasefire which took place. As we know, Israeli officials, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have so far dismissed this proposal. Netanyahu describing the proposal as \"delusional\", affirming that Israel intends to seek what is being characterized as a full victory in Gaza, namely the complete destruction of Hamas. But, clearly, there will be a lot of focus today on what happens in terms of these talks between Hamas and Egyptian officials, and of course, what may come from that. We might see some movement around the exact terms and the framework of this proposed truce agreement.",

The government also shut down mobile internet services for more than 12 hours. Sophia Saifi joins us now from Islamabad with the details on that.

All of their candidates were running as independents. And most people, most analysts were not very optimistic that they would do well at all in this election. And what we've seen overnight, again, this is a very delayed result, very slowly are results trickling in. Polls closed over 24 hours ago. People are frustrated. People are annoyed that this has taken so long. They're angry because last night on local credible television channels, it was showing that Imran Khan's party was in the lead, and then suddenly there was nothing, nothing from the Election Commission of Pakistan. At least in about five in the morning, there are no results at all. Those have now come out.But again, this has already become a very tainted result to begin with. Both parties are claiming that they have won, but again, very neck to neck. The independents who are backed by Imran Han, who is currently sitting in jail, barred from contesting in these elections, is immensely popular amongst the youth of this country. There was a huge hullabaloo that this was the fifth largest democracy in the country -- in the world. 128 million voters expected to come out, and these voters are young, and they are now waiting to see what the results are going to be. So, the issue is that because of this delay, because of the crackdown on Khan's supporters in the lead up to this election, there have been many fingers pointed at the authorities, at the military. The military has denied that it's responsible for a crackdown on Khan's supporters. But again, this continued delay, no final result yet, is going to raise many more questions about rigging, about what lies ahead for the future of this nuclear-armed nation. Bianca.",

Former President Donald Trump has won the Nevada Republican caucuses, taking him one step closer to gaining that Republican nomination. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court justices seem likely to back Trump's arguments against the state of Colorado. State leaders disqualified Trump from the presidential ballot for his ties to the January 6 riot. Trump got a gift from the U.S. Special Counsel who has decided against prosecuting Joe Biden for document mishandling. Robert Hur citing concerns over Biden's age and mental fitness, though. Now, it's a campaign issue despite Biden insisting his memory is fine.CNN's Kristen Holmes joins me now live in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Kristen, how much of a boost were these last 24 hours for Trump's campaign for reelection? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it really comes to what you view as a boost. We don't know if it led to any sort of fundraising or any sort of supporters coming over. But, it is arguably the best 24 hours that Donald Trump has had since he announced his candidacy for the White House back in November of 2022. As you noted, it started with those Supreme Court arguments, Donald Trump watching them like we all were. I'm told that he told his advisor that he was pleased with his lawyer, and then he came to the same conclusion that many of our legal experts did, that he was poised for a victory. Now, shortly after reveling in those arguments, he was given, as you said, nothing short of a political gift with that special counsel report on Joe Biden's handling -- or mishandling of classified documents. Donald Trump seizing on that almost immediately, trying to link his case, the special counsel case into his handling of classified documents with that case of Joe Biden, saying that it was unfair that he was being prosecuted, and that Joe Biden wasn't being prosecuted, really trying to blur the lines there. Although we should note that these cases are two very different cases. For one, Donald Trump did not cooperate at all to the point where the FBI had to issue a search warrant on his Mar-a-Lago home to receive some of those documents. But, the day did end with him winning the caucuses in Nevada, a state where the GOP party has really become the party of Donald Trump. So, all in all, it was a day of victory for the campaign.",
