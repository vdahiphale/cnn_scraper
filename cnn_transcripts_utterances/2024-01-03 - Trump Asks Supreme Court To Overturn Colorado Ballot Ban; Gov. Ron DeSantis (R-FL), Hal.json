I'm Abby Phillip in New York. And tonight, a question of paramount importance to your vote lands at the feet of nine justices. Donald Trump wants the United States Supreme Court to answer two questions once and for all. One, did he engage in an insurrection? And, two, is he ineligible to run for president of the United States? Trump's lawyers say that the answer to question one is clear and unequivocal, no. Their filing submitted today asserts that what the world witnessed on January 6th was, quote, not insurrection. And President Trump in no way engaged in insurrection. His lawyers write, in the context of the history of violent American political protests, January 6th was not an insurrection. Now, read through the document, and it almost sounds like the lawyers lawyered by basically lifting from their own client. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: They were there with love in their heart. That was an unbelievable, and it was a beautiful day. And what I was asked to do, I wasn't involved in it very much. I was asked to come in, would I make a speech. I made a speech. I said, walk peacefully and patriotically, many different things.

Well, his lawyers answer, without a doubt, the answer is yes. They assert that the president is not an officer of the United States. Now, is that logic or is it logic-bending? The Supreme Court now gets to answer that question. And there is a huge need for speed here. Colorado votes on March 5th. In just moments, Chris Wallace will join me on the political impact of all of this. But, first, joining me now for her first interview since Trump filed his appeal to the Supreme Court is Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold. Thank you very much for staying up for us tonight, Secretary of State Griswold. Can you first walk us through what this means for the state of Colorado? If we don't get a ruling by January 5th, in just a couple of days, does that mean Trump remains on the ballot in Colorado, basically, no matter what? SEC. OF STATE JENA GRISWOLD (D-CO): Well, first off, thank you for having me. And don't you worry, it's not too late in Colorado. So, still plenty of time to talk about this crucial case. The Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump engaged in insurrection and because of that, he was disqualified from the ballot. But they put a caveat into their ruling, saying that if the case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court, Trump would be on the ballot until the Supreme Court acted in some way. So, as of today, he is on the ballot. I certify the ballot. So, basically tell the counties which candidates will be on so that they can print the ballots. But our elections get going pretty quickly overseas and military ballots actually go out this month. We have early voting vote by mail in Colorado. So, Coloradans will be voting pretty soon.",

But even if he did, it's okay. He can still be president again. I disagree with that. Two Colorado courts have already found that he did engage in insurrection. I think it's very clear from the actions around January 6th, before and after his role in that violent insurrection. But regardless of my sentiments, this is a big case in front of the United States Supreme Court. And I do believe that the United States Supreme Court should tell the American people whether a president can engage in insurrection and then again run for that office.",

So, for example, if a lot of voters wanted to vote for Arnold Schwarzenegger, they wouldn't be able to do so, because he is disqualified from running for president under the United States Constitution. I think this case is very similar. If the Supreme Court finds him unqualified or otherwise affirms the Colorado Supreme Court or declines to review the case, we would consider him not qualified, just like Arnold Schwarzenegger or someone who was too young to be on the ballot.",

Somehow, we've been able to avert a government shutdown two times before, but we do have two more looming deadlines over our head. And it's not been the Republicans that have governed.I mean, most news media outlets have covered the fact that this has been the most unproductive Congress that we have ever had. And so, the idea that these unproductive people somehow are going to solve one of our largest crises, when I think back to the fact that a year ago today, this was the day that I was supposed to swear into Congress, and we couldn't get that done because they couldn't decide that they wanted Kevin McCarthy. It took them 15 rounds in three days, and now Kevin McCarthy isn't even in the House. So let me tell you, I don't trust these guys to be serious about this. They are nothing more than a bunch of arsonists that are now wanting to have this hero complex and act as if they are also the firefighters. We need to do what is smart on border protection. We need to make sure that those that absolutely need asylum are actually having their cases heard. And if they shouldn't be granted asylum, then they should be able to go back to where they came from. But when we don't fund these people, when we tell those that are trying to work at the border, hey, we're going to shut the government down. I've got news for you, Andy Biggs. That means that you're not going to pay the people that you claim to be supporting. That means that people are going to start calling in. That means that we may actually end up with an even larger shortage when it comes to the people that we need on the border. So let me tell you what's not smart is shutting down the government.",

In fact, you hear the majority of the people that talk about the border crisis, about the fact that most people can't even read English that are coming into our country. They're not studying whatever thousand-page bill is going to come out. All they know is that this is supposed to be the land of opportunity and the land of the free. And so, they're trying to get in. And honestly, they're doing it the way that you're supposed to. People don't understand that these people are presenting themselves at ports of entry, which is what our law says they're supposed to do. They are going and saying, hey, I'm here seeking asylum. You know, they continue to talk about an invasion, but here it is, you see that the speaker was being interviewed. I didn't see invaders behind him. You know, we've seen an invasion at the border and that isn't what this looks like. This looks like people that are in dire straits and we should be leading in the world to make sure that wherever it is that they're coming from, that we can help to stabilize those communities so they don't need to come to the United States, but instead they can stay at home where they really would probably prefer to be.",

So, there is some question about her work on campus, not necessarily her testimony. So, her testimony, she admitted was flawed. And when I read it as someone who had done communications for a long time for a lot of people, what I heard and saw is, this is the problem with the lawyers. The lawyers all got out of whack, and they had too much power in the preparation. Because any communications professional would have had those statements when she said, I find these genocidal statements to be abhorrent, which she said earlier in her testimony. You do those at the same time that you talk about the legalistic problem of the Harvard code of conduct. So, I just think there are a lot of different issues happening here at the same time. But what's the most, the most abhorrent to me after we talk about October 7th and how bad that was the attacks on Jewish citizens that everybody is recoiled by is that there are these people who hijacked anti-Semitism. These conservative activists, Chris Rufo -- Russo, who wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal talking about how he wanted to use this issue to squeeze Claudine Gay out of that job because he thought she was unqualified.
