And at this point, this is where the story gets really, really strange, because Pelosi - DePape standing there basically over Pelosi who was sleeping in his bed and Pelosi was somehow able to basically talk him down from a violent attack. Pelosi went into the bathroom, somehow called 911, and apparently according to this affidavit, DePape knew that, but chose not to leave. And then a few minutes later, San Francisco police were able to get to the home, Pelosi somehow and DePape both make their way downstairs. Paul Pelosi opening this door and when police arrive, they see both David DePape and Paul Pelosi holding on to a hammer. And it was in that moment that DePape pulled the hammer away from Pelosi and was able to strike him in the head, Pelosi falling to the ground unconscious, back to you.",

It's absolutely inexcusable.And hearing the details, I'm astounded at the impressive and brave presence of mind that Paul Pelosi had to fight off this attacker. I'm impressed with the swift law enforcement action. And I'm grateful that the legal community has taken such a swift and quick pursuit for justice in this case, and really pushing the limits in terms of the law that can be imposed against this person. Look, you might not agree with Nancy Pelosi's politics and what she fights for and advocates for, but instead of taking out acts of violence, people and elected officials in elected office should be respected. They should not be victims of violence and certainly not members of their family. And I think more than anything, the fact that he has advocated and talked about the suspect that he wants to try and prohibit Nancy Pelosi from engaging in further political activity, in my mind, I hope this causes her to even a double down in her commitment to what she's doing to serve the people of her party and the people of California. I certainly hope and pray this doesn't deter her, but more than anything, this is a call for lowering the temperature across the aisle on both sides with regard to political rhetoric and political violence that does land in the minds and hands of deranged individuals that engage in activity like this, but we need to lower the temperature. And what we need to not do, we don't need to broaden the strike zone with acceptance of divisive political rhetoric. We need to bring that down across the board and encourage people to - if they have problems with elected officials, they need to go to the ballot box and not take it out in violence - violent ways.",

But it's hard not to conclude that the reason somebody here is armed with both the ideas and the conviction to go forward to hammer on an 82-year-old man and it's a miracle he survived, his skull is fractured.It's very hard to disconnect that from the really incendiary, nasty, violent political rhetoric that we've had steady diets of and I was not at all surprised. I think no one in law enforcement was that this guy would have revealed this hateful - not just hateful, but familiar, taken from the usual suspects kind of pattern in his social media and in his interview with the officers.",

Again, he said to have doctors even before surgery said that he would make a full recovery as we know he's still in the ICU.Ronald Brownstein, let me come to you on the point that Juliette was just making and control room ready the Glenn Youngkin sound, because there was a time when there was something - I don't even know if there's something like this in recent history that to which we can compare it, but there would be a reconsideration of rhetoric or a pulling of ads after something like this. This is a Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin hours after the attack on Paul Pelosi. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GLENN YOUNGKIN (R-VA): Speaker Pelosi's husband had a break-in last night in their house and he was assaulted. There's no room for violence anywhere, but we're going to send her back to be with him in California. That's what we're going to go do. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Wear a mask. How many lives would be saved?Right now, if the former President were to come out and beyond offering condolences and saying it was terrible and awful, would say, this has to stop. And instead of blaming it on crime in San Francisco, as a lot of Republicans are doing in anticipation of what he would say, what difference would that make to people? I think it would make a huge difference, but I don't hold out any hope that that's going to happen even after we read exactly what happened from the police department. And so this is going to continue, we're close to an election. Now you have ads up with people shooting guns, you have - it's just rampant.

It's chilling to see these images and hear these stories and this makes this a tremendous national security issue. And again, this is about political rhetoric that has led to political violence and that goes on both sides of the aisle. Juliette hinted at the fact that it happens - it does happen on both sides and I'm - I think it's really important for us to remember that you look at Chuck Schumer in March of this year, when there was hints of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, he said that that would unleash a whirlwind, and he would hate to see what would happen at that point and who knows what would hit them.Three months later, a man was arrested outside of Justice Kavanaugh's home with a gun, with burglary tools and arrested for trying to assassinate a Supreme Court justice. So it's important to remember, this happens on both sides of the aisle. It's incumbent on Republicans and Democrats to lower the temperature on divisive rhetoric.",

But - and so police still continue to be very reluctant to assign specifically a motive here. But there's lot more information here that makes it difficult to extract the idea that this wasn't politically motivated.Although, Chief Bill Scott, the Chief of the San Francisco Police Department did tell Ana Cabrera on CNN earlier today that they believe they do have a motive, they just have not told us publicly exactly what they think it is yet. But let's go back specifically to the charges. He's accused now of assault on the immediate family member of a federal official, attempted kidnapping of a federal official. If those two crimes bear the weight of the full sentence, the maximum sentence and they were to run consecutive 120, 130, he could face up to 50 years in federal prison. That doesn't even include the list of local charges that he is very likely to face. Further, another piece of information that we're getting from this affidavit is what police found upon searching where he was living, which was apparently a garage somewhere in this area. Police finding two more hammers, a sword, a pair of rubber and cloth gloves. Again, as Juliette points out, when you combine that with the list of other things he carried, it's pretty clear that at least based on what he had on him, that this was well pre planned and now, again, if he's convicted of these crimes could face a maximum of 50 years.

Authorities say there were no guidelines for crowd control with this outdoor Halloween festival. Look at this, no clear organizer for this event.Two Americans are among the dead: Steven Blesi, he was a college student from Georgia, his father said that he was studying international business; and Anne Gieske, she was a University of Kentucky nursing students who was studying abroad. Well, my next guest is an American doctor who was at the Halloween festival, just 30 minutes before the surge happened. This is her video. Imagine being in this crowd and she was later asked by officers to help those who had been hurt in the chaos. Let me bring in now Dr. Sophia Akhiyat. She joins me now from Itaewon, the district there in Seoul where this happened. Dr. Akhiyat, thank you for being with me. Let me start just at the beginning, you were there 30 minutes before the crush. This was your video. We can play it again here. Tell me what it was like and what it felt like. DR. SOPHIA AKHIYAT, WITNESSED CROWD SURGE AND ASSISTED POLICE: Yes. So Itaewon is a really popular neighborhood among foreigners. Halloween is actually not a holiday that's celebrated in Korea, though it is in Itaewon, because it's such an eclectic cultural mixing pot and it's really popular among Korean youths as well to enjoy. So it wasn't actually a festival or a gathering. It was just - it's a street of bars, restaurants and clubs where people like to frequent and the activity is to wear your costume and go out for a night of celebration. So this year, by my understanding was filled with way more people than normal, because COVID pandemic restrictions had been lifted and everyone wanted to partake in this. People even flew into Seoul to visit Itaewon for this experience. And I was there for dinner and was trying to leave through the same alleyway where this incident occurred about half an hour before it occurred. And in this video, I remember I took it because I never saw that many people around me before and as I tried to walk through the crowd, I couldn't walk, it was standstill foot traffic and I was getting squeezed. So I had to lean against the wall and guide my way out in order to exit and the reason why I was leaving was because my friend Patrick had called me to a different area in Itaewon and I wanted to go see him. Otherwise, if he didn't call me I could have been involved in the crush myself.",
