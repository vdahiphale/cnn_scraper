      "sentences": "All right, the breaking news, the world's number one golfer, Scottie Scheffler, is out of custody after he was detained early this morning and charged with four crimes, including felony assault of a police officer. This is all happening in Kentucky where Scheffler is playing in the PGA championship, one of golf's majors. This is one of golf's biggest moments of the year. An ESPN reporter was there when Scheffler was being placed in handcuffs. ESPN reports Scheffler was driving on the median around police vehicles when he was stopped.CNN's Carolyn Manno back with us with new details. Carolyn, what are you learning now?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, he's been released on his own recognizance and he's arrived back to the clubhouse. All signs at the moment would point to him playing today just after 10But these charges, most notably the felony for second-degree assault on an officer, runs so counter to everything that we know about the world's number one golfer. I mean Scheffler is clean cut, not easily rattled, a stand-up guy. His attorney called this a miscommunication just a short time ago. These are the first public comments that we've heard from his side. He said that Scheffler had the right credentials. He was proceeding as he had been instructed to do to enter the premises. You mentioned ESPN's Jeff Darlington, who reported all of this. He says that Scheffler attempted to drive past police officers this morning into Valhalla Golf Club and that one of the police officers attached himself to the vehicle at one point in an effort to get Scheffler to stop, and that Scheffler proceeded about another ten yards when he did finally stopped. Darlington said that Scheffler exited the vehicle. The police officer shoved him against the car, immediately placed him in handcuffs. And you saw that video showing him walking slowly, cooperating with officers when he was handcuffed to be detained. And just for context, I know you guys have gone over this already. There was that serious and separate incident at 5:00 a.m. this morning that caused PGA championship organizers to delay the start of the second round. A man was killed in the early morning hours near the course. He was struck by a shuttle bus. So that incident impacted traffic. It increased police presence. And then this incident involving Scheffler occurred about an hour after that. That happened at five. Scheffler was arrested at six. So, it does stand to reason that that disturbance ultimately affected his ability to get where he was going. But the public shuttles through the course have resumed play. Play has also resumed. There is significant rain in the area. That could impact things. But, like you mentioned, Scheffler's original tee times scheduled for 8:48. It was moved to just after 10:00 a.m. So now, in total, he's facing these four charges following his arrest. You have the felony, which is the big one, and then these lesser charges of third degree criminal mischief, reckless driving, disregarding signals from officers directing traffic. Now we wait, John, to see whether or not he's going to tee off within the next 45 minutes or so. And remember, this does seemingly standard to reason that this was something of a physical altercation here with him being detained and placed in cuffs. So, we'll see how he's feeling mentally and also physically.",

What happened last night? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): Well, I mean, it was like - it was, you know, Oversight after dark, Oversight unplugged. We - we're a little bit better at 11 in the morning. But, you know, at 8:00 p.m. I guess just we can't - all hell breaks loose. I mean, listen, you know why the hearing was moved. They moved the hearing so members could go to New York and snuggle with Donald Trump in the courtroom to keep him warm, because he's very chilly in the courtroom. They're keeping it cold and purpose. And so they literally moved this hearing to hold Merrick Garland in contempt for what? They turned over the transcript, which is what they asked for. They turned over all the corresponding documents for what they asked for. Robert Hur, the special prosecutor, came here, testified. He said there was no interference from DOJ or Merrick Garland. And now they want an audio tape, which they know, by the way, is against DOJ policy. We're still waiting for the audio tape from Dick Cheney in the Valerie Plame case because the DOJ doesn't release audio tapes, OK? And this is just a distraction from their failed impeachment of Joe Biden, which isn't going to happen. But look, you know, you know, Marjorie Taylor Greene, you know, miss motion to vacate. How's that going, Marj, if you're watching? I mean she's just here, obviously, to do this stuff. She raises money off of it. This is why gerrymandering is bad. If you want to know why gerrymandering is bad, just watch last night. She's the most unproductive member of Congress. We wouldn't let her name a post office. She has no friends here. And to go and attack Jasmine Crockett like that is totally out of order, was uncalled for. But she does it on purpose.",

But my - my main purpose for voting for the bill is what I said earlier when the president decided to hold back that particular weapon, which is, I want to get to a ceasefire. I want to get more humanitarian aid in there and I want to get the hostages back. And the only way we're going to do that is to get Hamas to agree to a ceasefire. Right now the reason we don't have a ceasefire, Israel agreed to the ceasefires proposed by the Egyptians. And then Hamas added additional terms. And that, unfortunately, blew up the ceasefire deal. So, we don't have a ceasefire because Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, who's buried in a tunnel, will not release the hostages and will not agree to a ceasefire, which puts these innocent Palestinians in peril. And so without that pressure, right, it's not going to happen. So, that's why I disagreed with the president last week because I looked at that as removing pressure from Hamas.",
