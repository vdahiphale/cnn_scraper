The National Broadcaster reporting that the passenger train at some point changed lanes traveling on the same line as the cargo train. Going at high speeds and then colliding head-on. The two first carriages caught light, major efforts to try to put out those fires. The third carriage is where most of the fatalities occurred. There are 66 people that are hospitalized. Seven of whom are currently in intensive care. From what we also know, authorities are saying difficult to identify the victims of this crash. What we also know is that there are many people lining up to donate blood to assist those injured. There was a three day holiday period in Greece, a lot of the university students that would be traveling were said to be on the passenger train.
