We are live for you in Kyiv. We're going to start this hour in Gaza, with Israel's military under increasing pressure to provide evidence at the enclaves largest hospital seen here is in fact, also a command center for Hamas, like it has claimed. Well, it is yet to offer any solid proof of Hamas tunnels allegedly in under the complex, but it says evidence will come in the days ahead. Meantime, there is international condemnation over the raid, but that outrage is not coming from the United States. On Wednesday, the U.S. President said he was absolutely confident, Hamas was running a command center under the hospital and called that a \"War Crime\". The Israeli military says its raid on the hospital is complicated and will and I quote them here \"Take time\". CNN's Nic Robertson takes a closer look at the operation and what has and has not been found. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Inside Al- Shifa hospital, Israeli forces are facing their biggest credibility test in Gaza so far, after weeks of claiming its basement is a network of Hamas bunkers. The IDF moved in, in the early hours of Wednesday morning. But 24 hours later, no evidence of Hamas's subterranean network here has been presented.",

So it is clear that children in particular suffer. So the Security Council resolution put a particular emphasis on this and reminded everyone that there are specific obligations for children. It goes beyond it because it asks for humanitarian pauses. And not just for a couple of hours, but actually to be able to deliver humanitarian assistance.

They already had prepared they have ambulances at the border at Rafah and still no news. No word whether they have actually left Al-Shifa. President Sisi today also put out a statement saying that he's instructing all people responsible to be prepared and ready to take in these babies.

(END VIDEOTAPE) GIOKOS (on camera): Becky, as you can see, it's not just the physical trauma where you see multiple doctors that need to intervene to deal with shrapnel with burns with broken bones. It's also the emotional trauma. The Egyptian government has intervened as well to assist them on the path to the recovery. Look, Egyptians can handle around 40 to 50 patients every single day. They're not getting that number. They talk about a very long and difficult process in terms of assisting injured Palestinians to pass through into the country. And over and above that they know that politics and issues are at play on the sidelines. For them it's just focusing on how they can help people increase capacity in the country as well.

This was a term that he had used earlier this summer. And he answered in the affirmative, he said, yes, but that is just the reality of the different kinds of government that they have in China. And this wasn't taken well by the Chinese. The Chinese Foreign Ministry, saying overnight that these comments from President Biden were extremely erroneous, and an irresponsible political maneuver, making clear, of course, that this is a label that Chinese officials, as you point out, are very sensitive to. But I think that comment aside, you're right to that both Washington and Beijing were pretty eager to point to what they said was real progress made on their shared goal of trying to really take the tension down in U.S. China relations. And one incredibly notable deliverable and really one of the few deliverables that we saw come out of that summit was that restoration of military to military communications between the two countries. That of course, had been severed last year when there were tensions and conflicts over issues like China, like Taiwan rather. And so that is something that both sides are pointing to as a sign that the two countries even though they are competitors, even though they have a lot of areas of disagreement, that they can sort of work together to, to shore up their communications and make sure that they're basically practicing more diplomacy.",

I mean, the United States andChina have profound views about how the world should look and how government should manage. And in fact, President Xi is getting a lot of praise in state media here in China, for making that point to Joe Biden, that the United States should really not interfere or perhaps make judgment about how domestic operations, domestic politics in China are taking place. In fact, as we've discussed before, Xi Jinping is really trying to lead this broader global effort to create almost a new world order kind of the anti-U.S., anti-West way of doing things. And he's very unapologetic about it. Even so, despite some of those firm words from Xi Jinping to President Biden along those lines, this is in China being perceived as a very optimistic meeting. I mean, some of the words that we're hearing are both positive and comprehensive. In fact, CCTV which is the state broadcaster is almost highlighting a moment of warmth and goodwill when Xi Jinping and Joe Biden wrapped up. They were kind of walking through the wooded area where this discussion took place. Joe Biden walking him to his car, you know, saying goodbye. So I think that the framework is built for this positive relationship moving forward. That's not to say there aren't some stark differences between these two nations, but they are very now explicit, Becky.",

You know, it wasn't long ago at the outset of this conflict that Recep Tayyip Erdogan,the President of Turkey was positioning himself as a potential peace broker here. But at this stage of the game, I don't suggest holding your breath on that for very long. That is because last month Erdogan made headlines when he said that Hamas is not a terror group, but a liberation group. Now he says that it is actually the State of Israel that is the terror state. In his speech yesterday that he gave here in Turkey, he said, \"Israel is implementing a strategy of total annihilation of a city and its people. I say very clearly and frankly, that Israel is a terrorist state\". Now he went on to say that Turkey intends to take whatever steps it needs to, to hold Israeli leadership and Israeli both political and military accountable in international courts for what he views as war crimes. This though did not go unchallenged by Israel, despite the fact that Erdogan has previously said that he's cutting off communication with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu managed to get in touch anyways through Twitter or X as they're calling it now. And he said that it's actually Turkey that supporting the terrorists in supporting Hamas. Now, what's amazing here Becky, is that you know, throughout Israel's history, Turkey has actually been OK with Israel. It was one of the first Muslim countries to actually recognize the State of Israel. But the Palestinian issue has always gotten in the way of closer ties. Things really fell off a cliff edge back in 2010, when 10 Turks were killed in an Israeli raid of a flotilla trying to breach the naval blockade in Gaza. And it was six years before the Israeli Ambassador to Turkey was actually allowed back ties have slowly warmed up since then. And it was actually just in September that Netanyahu and Erdogan met face to face at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. They shook hands. They had a meeting. They talked about developing closer economic ties and other ties. They pledged to visit each other's countries. And then when the war started, Erdogan quickly decided to cancel his planned trip to Israel. And here we are less than two months later, we go from handshake to now Erdogan calling for Israel to be prosecuted in international courts and calling it a terrorist state, Becky.",
