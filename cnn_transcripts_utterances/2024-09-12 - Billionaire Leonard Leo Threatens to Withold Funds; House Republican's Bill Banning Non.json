Hans, I know you broke this story and I do want to ask you what this letter says, but if you can put it into context for us and why it's significant that Leonard Leo is saying this.",

He's sort of known for start -- not starting, but making the federal society such a powerful force in the federal judiciary reshaping laws. So, he's very important in the conservative world. And this is essentially putting all the groups that he funds on notice that they're going to have to justify how they're spending the money that he really controls.And just to put a price tag on it, it's close to a billion dollars. How much? Remember he got this $1.6 billion grant a couple of years ago. So, he has a big piggy bank to spend. There are a lot of conservative groups that listen very closely to what Leonard Leo wants and what he's signaling. And he's clearly signaling a change. And he wants fewer seminars, more campaigns. He doesn't want this to be ivory tower. He wants this to be brass knuckled politics. And I think that what you and I will both be focused on in the next couple of weeks is just what conservative groups get the message and which ones don't.",

And I think the most interesting thing about the letter, and we linked to it in our story, I'm sure you guys have it well by now, is that there's admiration from Leonard Leo on what left- wing nonprofit groups has done.He plainly admires, and he sees them having great success and taking over institutions. And he wants to replicate and recreate that success on the conservative movement. And that's his challenge. That's what he's telling the groups he wants to do. And he's got the money to back it up. It's still going to be difficult. And I think they are -- they're clear eyed within the conservative movement about that. But that's the gauntlet, and that's what he wants to do.",

We prosecute anyone we find breaking the law, not just in that, but in other ways. And we also track the data. You can't register to vote in Michigan or get a driver's license without showing some documentation, which reveals whether you're a citizen or not and protects us against, you know, unwittingly registering people who aren't citizens.So, our processes are secure, and you'll find that across the country. The real impact of these allegations is to harm people's confidence in our election system and make them distrust the process. And that's the point I tried to make to Congress yesterday.",

If in the very rare circumstance, that person stays on the rolls and they vote, then we will prosecute. And that's the same all across the country. We're very serious about doing that.And so, the suggestion yesterday, or in many ways that we're not, is really, frankly offensive because our jobs every day are to show up and make sure the integrity of our elections is paramount.",

We -- when we see someone who's not eligible to vote for any reason, registered to vote, we remove them from the rolls and we work within the confines of the law to do that.And again, I walked through -- I tried to walk through that yesterday before the hearing and also make the case that when these unsubstantiated claims of noncitizens voting proliferate, it harms not just the public's faith in our elections, but it translates into threats to election workers themselves and they need to know that.",

It was not a very high-profile job. These are the really dedicated citizens who go out there and make sure that our elections are safe and secure and so on.Obviously, election workers like yourself, people like Brad Raffensperger down in Georgia, have been thrust into the political process. And a Michigan State lawmaker posted on social media this week that you will be prosecuted if Trump wins. Trump has said he'll prosecute election officials as well. We saw that over the weekend in this Truth Social post. He says that if they cheat in the 2020 -- that cheated in the 2020 election, and if they cheat in this election, they're going to be prosecuted.

And that's not going to work with me, and many of us, we are committed to doing our jobs. And when we get threats like these, one, we know the integrity of our work, it's sound. We know the truth and the law is on our side.And so, we're not going to back down. We're going to continue to refuse to be intimidated and double down on our efforts to make sure every citizen, no matter who they are or who they vote for, is able to vote and have confidence in our elections.",

And that is unnerving. It is a reminder of what we're up against and how low people will be willing to go in response to some of the false rhetoric that they're hearing.And again, I think everyone needs to realize those consequences of these words right now. There's a direct line from the hateful rhetoric to potential violent threats against not just me, but, you know, election workers, clerks who don't necessarily, you know, want to step into the fray, but will do so if it means protecting our elections.

We've passed laws in Michigan to make it a crime to threaten an election official, for example, in their line of work.So, we've put more protections in place, built partnerships with law enforcement and have actually done scenario planning with local law enforcement and first responders to be prepared for every contingency. So, we'll be ready. We're also trying to communicate to people, you know, don't try to disrupt our elections process. It's not going to work and there will be legal consequences.",

CNN Stephanie Elam joins me now live from Wrightwood, California. Stephanie, I can see that smoke behind you. Obviously, you're very close to an area.

As you look out behind me, you can see that most of the vegetation here is now gone. You see that one hot spot out there as well. That's one of the concerns. And this is why you see firefighters roving around, because most the fire can get down into the roots of trees, of brush, of scrub brush here and just continue to burn. And so, they have to make sure they come back, watch them, and put those out because those can then turn into another big blaze.We're talking about more than 100,000 acres that have burned in Southern California so far. This blaze, the Bridge Fire, where I'm standing, is close to 50,000 acres on its own. It's the largest active fire in California right now, and it is exploded in size from Sunday to Monday. We some heat, we saw a lot of low humidity. That makes it very ripe along with the winds (INAUDIBLE) these fires to grow. What we're seeing now though is that it has started to cooldown here. And the humidity has come up. So, that's helping. Still, when you look at this air quality, this is part of the issue that they're having from battling these fires from above because it is so smoky that it's hard to see where they need to drop it. On top of it, you have those other two large fires in Southern California that are requiring resources. So, they're having to share aircraft to drop fire retardant, to drop water. All of that making it very difficult as they're taxing the resources here to battle these three blazes. One here -- this one is on the Los Angeles and San Bernardino County, then one in Riverside in Orange County and then another in Orange County, Jim. Just massive amount of acreage that has been up in flames with some houses lost, but luckily no lives.",
