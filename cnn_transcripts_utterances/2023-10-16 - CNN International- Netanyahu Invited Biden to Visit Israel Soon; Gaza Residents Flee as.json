Now it's unclear how advance these conversations are and if this will happen when it would happen. But in a statement to CNN, the White House said that there are no new travel plans to announce.Now the two leaders did talk over the weekend to talk about ongoing military support by the U.S. and the conflict at large. And if this visit were to happen by President Biden, it would come on the heels of high stakes diplomacy by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Who has been meeting with regional partners and his counterparts in diplomacy to avoid this conflict from spreading or widening any further. And in an interview with 60 Minutes, President Biden said that while Israel needs to respond, it would be, quote, a big mistake for there to be an occupation of Gaza. Take a listen.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so it might be helpful just to take a quick look at the map. So basically, Israel has said that basically the top third of the Gaza Strip should be evacuated. It's about 1.1 million people they've told to move south. And the difficulty though, is that the air strikes that we saw over the weekend, the IDF says that there were 250 of them yesterday alone on military targets they say. They say that most of them were in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, but some of them were also south. So remember, these are places that people have evacuated to.And we've got video in from a place called Deir al-Balah. Again, sort of in the central part of Gaza, where there were at least two air strikes over the weekend and there was horrifying video of the aftermath of people sort of scrambling around wondering what to do. Obviously, people looking through the rubble and also children showing up at hospitals as well. And then even just this morning -- we don't have video from this -- but there was another air strike in Khan Younis, which is even further south -- even farther south, where the local hospital -- a doctor at the local hospital, says that 10 people were killed, 23 people injured. So again, no where it seems, is really safe in Gaza, obviously safer in the south, but still far from a place that you'd want to be.",

      "sentences": "And I was listening intently to the question that you asked the IDF spokesperson about, you know, can you give some assurances that these trucks won't be targeted? And he said, look, we're going to leave the diplomacy to the diplomats and that you know, if we're told to cease-fire, then then we can cease-fire.But obviously there's still a lot of danger there. There's obviously pockmarked roads, making it difficult for things to get around. And you know, the U.N., other aid groups have been basically shouting as loud as they can to whoever will listen just about how dire the situation is. And basically, it's, you know, it's life or death. You had the World Food Program saying that if they cannot help people and they are running out of food, that people will die. You know, the U.N. saying that you're looking at a potentially thousands of people dying as a result of the situation, MSF, Doctors Without Borders, they have been perhaps the starkest of all of them, about the situation. They've called the Israeli strikes indiscriminate. They say that hospitals, ambulances have also been caught in the crossfire. And they say that look, they are struggling to find water. Food obviously is in short supply. And the Director in France said this, quote: Hospitals are overwhelmed. There are no more painkillers now. Our staff tells us about the wounded screaming in pain. The injured, the sick who cannot get to the hospital. And also keep in mind as well, that look, this evacuation order coming from Israel also impacts about 22 healthcare facilities north of the line. But one of those hospitals -- at least one of those hospitals, put out a video yesterday trying to explain why this wasn't possible. And in that video, you see, you know, newborn babies in incubators. You see children on ventilators, and obviously they can't go anywhere because where on Earth would they go? And the other difficulty that the MSF -- or that the aid organizations say that that they're running into in some cases is, people turning up to the hospital, not necessarily because they're hurt or need medical attention, but because they need shelter. And they figure that in all of the chaos happening in Gaza, that hospitals are still probably one of the safest bets.",
