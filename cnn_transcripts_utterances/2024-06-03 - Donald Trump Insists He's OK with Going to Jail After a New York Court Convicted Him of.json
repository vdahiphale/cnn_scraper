Hunter Biden facing felony gun charges and about to become the first child of a sitting president to go on trial. And Mexico makes history by electing its first female president.All right, 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, a live look at New York City on this Monday morning. Good morning, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's wonderful to have you with us. Donald Trump claims he's fine with jail time, but he warns that his supporters might not be. The former president faces a possible prison sentence or house arrest after a New York jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records last week. His sentencing is scheduled for July 11th. Trump talked about that prospect over the weekend in an interview with \"Fox\". (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, that is one message they are putting out, but certainly, you know, Republicans are really arguing that this is going to galvanize Trump supporters.

All leaders, regardless of party must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship.\" Chris LaCivita; the Trump campaign manager said, you just ended your campaign.

It was met on the right-wing in Israel with threats to basically bring down the coalition government of Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu's office was much more measured, and how, you know, they responded. They said, well, we're going to continue with the party line of -- we want to eliminate Hamas and get our hostages back before we'll end this war.

So, you've got the Finance Minister, the National Security Minister as well, both saying they will resign from the government if he signs it.And then you've got the opposition leader saying he will support Netanyahu signing it. So, it's those three constituencies combined with this massive pressure, obviously, from the families of the hostages, really wanting a peace deal as well, so they can just get those hostages home. So, he's in this trap. You know, if those right-wing ministers do resign, he's weakened in government, his position becomes, you know, not necessarily untenable, but very weak indeed. He might not keep his position. So, we've got to see how he's going to get through that. And as you say, his normal -- his usual argument is just destroying Hamas.
