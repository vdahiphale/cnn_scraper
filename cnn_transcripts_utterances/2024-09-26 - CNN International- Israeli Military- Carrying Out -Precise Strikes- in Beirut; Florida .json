Also coming up hurricane Helene barreling towards the Southeastern United States. It's now a powerful category two storm, and is expected to get stronger. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on Capitol Hill trying to shore up support as Republicans give him the cold shoulder. And New York Mayor Eric Adams is facing criminal charges in a federal corruption investigation. Well, Israel says it is carrying out strikes on the Lebanese capital as we are waiting for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to arrive in New York as Israel readies for a possible ground invasion into Lebanon. Sources tell CNN, the U.S. and France are working feverishly on a ceasefire plan between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah. Mr. Netanyahu dismissing suggestions a ceasefire could be imminent, his message for the IDF, keep fighting. Both sides are doing just that, launching dozens more attacks across the border overnight. Now those precise strikes as Israel describes them in Beirut. Take a listen to the spokesperson for the Israeli government. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Qatar, one of the Arab states who has signed up to it. We've heard from the Qataris earlier today. They, of course, have been hugely involved in trying to mediate a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. This is how the spokesman responded to what is going on in New York, and the news we have of this proposal stand by. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJED AL-ANSARI, SPOKESPERSON OF QATARI FOREIGN MINISTRY: I think there is a general sense in the international community that everybody is working together in order to ensure this is why happening in Lebanon. I don't think we can now say that there's a formal mediation track, rather than all channels of communication remain open, and that all of us are doing all that we can -- not only Qatar, I think all parties who are interested in a ceasefire right there are working on this.

Of course, thosenegotiations between Hezbollah, through proxies, of course, and Israel and the shuttle diplomacy that Amos Hochstein, the U.S. negotiator on that has been trying to pull off for the past year, have rewarded results that we see publicly. So, I think trying to do it in a shortened time frame, despite the international attention, despite the high death toll, despite the need, despite the desire to avoid more civilian casualties, more destruction, it does seem to be pushing into the wind. The messaging, both by Hezbollah today, the missiles that they fired by Israel, the missiles that it's fired, the targeted what appears to be -- the moment, absent more details. But what appears to be another targeted assassination of a senior Hezbollah official. We don't know that, but it appears to be in Beirut. The fact that the military's, the IDF is releasing more video of more troops doing more rehearsals and more training and terrain close to the border is really messaging the pressure from the Israeli side that they think that this isn't the time to pull back the pressure, military pressure off of Hezbollah, because they would regroup. And right now, they're relying on the fact they're not regrouping to stop Hezbollah actually having a stronger response. And politically, the prime minister here has taken a huge hammering from the right-wing members of his cabinet and others, not to mention some residents in the north who are criticizing any maneuver and move he may take towards a 21-day truce. So, it just doesn't feel as if the mood music is there, and to try to latch a Lebanon ceasefire to a completely stalled out Gaza ceasefire seems hugely improbable, albeit nobly ambitious, just improbable, Becky.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it certainly is, Becky. And President Biden is trying to do what he can while he was is in officeto ensure that Ukraine has the aid that they need to continue their war against Russia. Today, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy will make that personal appeal to President Biden for more assistance when they meet in the oval office this afternoon. Zelenskyy expected to present a victory plan outlining the ways that he believes Ukraine can still win and how exactly USAID, Western aid, can help in that effort. Ahead of the meeting, President Biden did roll out a new surge of aid for Ukraine that includes calling on the Department of Defense to use the $5.5 billion in presidential drawdown authority that Congress has already authorized to provide further assistance to Ukraine in Biden's waning months in office. There's also the Defense Department has another $2.4 billion they can provide through the Ukraine Security Initiative. And just last night, they rolled out 375 billion million dollars in additional aid. Biden, in a statement today, say that there is still more work to do for Ukraine as they continue this fight. He talked about how they are going to provide more long-range weapons, more Patriot missiles to Ukraine, as well as providing more training to their forces on fighter jets that they can use in this war effort. But a big question on the table for President Biden and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy today is the question over whether Ukraine can use western made long range weapons deep into Russia. That is something that Zelenskyy has said is central to their victory plan. But so far, President Biden has not shown any signs of budging, though he has expressed some openness to it. So, we will see where those conversations go today. There's also an expectation that Zelenskyy could try to seek some type of long-term security guarantees, basically to make sure that the American support for Ukraine can continue past this election. There is the question right now of whether Zelenskyy would be working with Vice President Kamala Harris as president, who has said that she would continue President Biden's foreign policy objectives, including in the space of Ukraine, or whether he will be working with Former President Donald Trump, who just this week was saying that criticizing Zelenskyy, saying that he is not willing to reach a deal with Russia to try to end this war. So, a lot of questions going forward for Zelenskyy and for Ukraine about what that American support can look like. But for President Biden, while he remains in office, he's trying to ensure that they can get as much aid as possible to the war-torn country. And really, this war between Russia and Ukraine has been a key focus for Biden's foreign policy agenda. He has sought to rally Western allies around Ukraine throughout this war, and so this is something he wants to try to set up for Ukraine going forward to ensure that they continue to get the assistance they need in their fight.",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, you heard a little bit right there. Vice President Harris is making clear that she still continues to plan toraise taxes on corporations, raise taxes on the wealthy. She has no plans to increase taxes for many other Americans who make under $400,000 a year. She's focusing on trying to make housing more affordable by incentivizing more supply through tax credits for home builders. She's also appealing to some of the frustrated first-time home buyers out there by talking about a $25,000 down payment assistance, although I would note that that's something that's going to actually stimulate demand. So, it's pretty important that the supply comes before the demand incentives there. But there is renewed focus on the Trump economic agenda. There's this new analysis out from the Peterson Institute, and it's painting a very dark picture about what some of these Trump campaign proposals would actually do if they were put into place. It's the most comprehensive analysis to date, focusing on three key areas here, Trump's plans for massive tariffs, massive deportations, and influencing Federal Reserve policy on interest rates. Now he's held up those ideas as a way to boost the economy, but these researchers may find this would actually damage the economy. Looking at just the jobs impact here, they found that even in a low scenario where many workers are deported, but not all of the undocumented workers, and where other countries decide not to retaliate against Trump tariffs, even in that low scenario, employment would be almost 3 percent lower by the end of Trump's term. And in a high scenario where other countries do retaliate and all the undocumented workers in America are deported, you would have 9 percent lower employment. So again, fewer jobs, not more jobs. But what's really telling is their research here on the inflation side of things, because, again, Trump is promising to address the cost of living and to actually make prices plunge. But the researchers find that even in that low scenario, where other countries don't retaliate, you would have 6 percent inflation in the year 2026 and in the high scenario, you would have 9.3 percent inflation. Remember, you're targeting 2 percent inflation. We've got 2.5 percent inflation, and this means that at that high scenario, you'd have a worse inflation situation than two years ago, I reached out to the Trump campaign have not heard back. In the past, they've argued that some of the so-called experts and economists got it wrong during the first Trump Administration, and they'll get it wrong again here. But Becky, I do think this brings us to one of the great ironies here, right. Voters say economy is the number one issue. They say they trust Trump over Harris, and yet some of these experts fear that Trump's policies would actually make inflation worse, Becky.",
