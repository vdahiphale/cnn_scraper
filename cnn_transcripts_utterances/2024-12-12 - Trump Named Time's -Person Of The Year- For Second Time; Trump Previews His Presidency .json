Donald Trump is getting the recognition he craves, while revealing crucial details about what America's health programs, justice system and foreign policy will look like when he takes the oath of office just 39 days from now.Plus, a Democrat with an open mind, Senator John Fetterman says, his party can't quote, freak out about everything Trump does. Today, he'll sit down with the president-elect's controversial choice to lead the Pentagon, the first Democrat to meet with any of Trump's cabinet picks. And bowing out. I'll talk to a top Democrat about the FBI director's decision to step aside, so Donald Trump can dramatically reshape the bureau in his image. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, a New York moment. You see Donald Trump getting to ring the bell of the New York Stock Exchange, after being recognized by Time Magazine as its Person of the Year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL- ELECT: I have to say Time Magazine getting this honor for the second time. I think I like it better this time, actually. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Kristen Holmes is in West Palm Beach. Kristen, you covered a lot of ground in this interview. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENTBut let's get to the interview. So, there's a lot of ground covered here. One of the things that we heard him say was that he vehemently opposed Biden's new missile policy in Ukraine, essentially providing Ukraine with missiles so that they could strike in Russia. He also said something we've heard before. But again, reiterating it now that he is in -- he's going to be president of the United States, saying that he would use military to help with mask deportations. The other thing I want to point out is he said that he would study that the link between vaccines and autism diagnoses, even though, of course, as we have reported multiple times. There is no link that has been found in multiple studies. But there's one thing I want to point out, and that was what he talked about when it comes to January 6, because we've really been trying to figure out what these pardons are going to look like. And here's what he said about pardoning individuals involved. He said, we're going to look at each individual case, and we're going to do it very quickly, and it's going to start the first hour that I get into office. And a vast majority of them should not be in jail. I'll be looking at J6 early on, maybe the first nine minutes. We are still trying to get an idea of what exactly this looks like, in terms of how he's going to do these pardons. We've heard him. We've heard a spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, say that it's going to be a case-by-case basis. But we've also heard a lot of Donald Trump's allies outside, who advise him, who talk to him on a daily or weekly basis, saying they believe it should be blanket pardons. And as of now, we still don't have the insight into how this is going to work, particularly on day one. But one thing to make clear, Donald Trump made a lot of promises on the campaign trail. And this was one of the very significant promises he made to these people who are in jail, to their families. So, one of the reasons why we're so invested in trying to figure out how he's going to do this is because it was something he focused so heavily on during the campaign,",

He said where - he, Trump said, we're going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it.Question, do you think it's linked to vaccines? No, I'm going to be listening to Bobby, who I've gotten along with great, and I have a lot of respect for having to do with food and having to do with vaccines. I just want to say for the record, which we're going to have to continue saying over and over again, there is no evidence. Despite lengthy, longitudinal, widespread studies, trying to figure out if there is a link from vaccines to autism. The answer is, resoundingly scientifically, no. Now that doesn't mean that he's not going to listen to Bobby on that. So, I'm wondering your view, given how much you've covered Donald Trump?

And we've seen him sort of change his rhetoric on a number of issues and just this broader theme of making America healthy again and incorporating some of Bobby Kennedy Jr.'s views, some of them very controversial in this case, like the vaccine issue.
