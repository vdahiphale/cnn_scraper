This is a moment that the man pulled his mask down -- one of the few moments he's seen pulling his mask down while he was flirting with a female employee of the hostel.Still, he clearly has not been found and he clearly has not been identified yet now 48 hours after he went on the run. Joining us right now is a private investigator with 20 -- over 20 years of law enforcement experience. Brittney Blair is joining me now. Brittney, thanks for jumping on. Forty-eight hours in now, where should the most energy be placed in this investigation do you think? BRITTNEY BLAIR, RETIRED LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADER, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, K2 (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, Kate, I mean, I say this all the time. Unfortunately, investigations like this don't -- they take a lot of physical and manual activity. It's not -- there's no magic button that you can press that's just going to immediately identify this guy and track him. So right now I'm sure that all of the resources that NYPD and the federal agencies have are being thrown at both tracking and identifying every movement and every bit of this man's background so that they can -- they can get to him.",

And when he leaves Central Park, he does not have it.How important is that backpack? BLAIR:  I mean, the backpack is a critical element. It is an identifier and I'm sure that a lot of resources are being placed into trying to recover it because you have no idea what was in that backpack. Likely, a murder weapon, additional identifying details, DNA samples. All of that plays into an investigation like this.",

What are people saying? What are they talking about? Are they talking about your company? It's not always just your top executives. There's many levels in the C-suite and all of them can be targeted online. And if you are not gathering that intel and paying attention to inform your security posture, you're way behind the curve.

Are there other allegations that surface? Some of these members had positive meetings with Pete Hegseth this week, including Sen. Mike Rounds, who said that he could potentially, at some point, get to yes on Hegseth. Yes, he thought Hegseth had more work to do. But the confirmation right is going to be one that takes some time and it's going to center around how Pete Hegseth does in a confirmation hearing. That'll happen in a public setting. A lot of these meetings -- you know, senators are asking sensitive questions behind closed doors. That all changes when you move to more of a public setting. Once again, all eyes are on Sen. Joni Ernst, a Republican from Iowa who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee and is someone who has been very outspoken about believing that women should be allowed to be in combat -- something that Pete Hegseth has made comments about, saying that he didn't believe that they should be. I think that those kinds of questions are going to be really central to the days and weeks ahead. But here's what Sen. Ernst said about her vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JONI ERNST (R-IA):  We will continue with the vetting process. I think that is incredibly important. BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR, \"AMERICA'S NEWSROOM\":  It doesn't sound on your answer that you've gotten to a yes. If I'm wrong about that, correct me.

That clearly didn't happen in that sound bite we just heard right there. And then there's this from The Washington Post, Paul. This says, \"Hegseth has been told not to expect Trump to apply pressure to Republican senators to get him over the finish line\" -- I think we have a graphic of this -- \"according to two people familiar with the discussions.\" So, Ernst not at a yes; Trump not making calls. What does that spell for you, Paul? PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, it says there's two paths to Mr. Hegseth leading the Pentagon, slim and none. It's not going to happen, OK. Donald Trump is not afraid of a camera. He knows how to make his case. He's not doing it and there's a reason. He's cutting the guy loose.

It morphed into him totally wanting to revamp the opinion pages. He's inviting more conservative voices, saying he wants to bring balance and bring trust back to the newspaper.
