We have video in from just overnight early this morning that shows King arriving back on American soil weeks after he seemingly voluntarily crossed into North Korea. Now that he is safe, a very big question is what happens to him now considering how extraordinary the circumstances were that he ended up in North Korea in the first place.Let's go over to CNN's Oren Liebermann. He has much more on this. Oren, are you hearing anything about what kind of trouble King could be in now and also what is happening with him right now?",

Worth noting the Brooke Army Medical Center is where you're taken if you've been detained overseas.It's where you re-acclimate, where you get a medical evaluation, perhaps a psychiatric evaluation as well. It is for example, where Brittney Griner and Trevor Reed were taken after they were detained in Russia. So, that's where he is now and where he'll stay for at least some time but how long exactly, is unclear. As you point out, the big question is what happens next? Officials had raised the possibility that he fought -- could face further disciplinary action after returning to the U.S. right? He was absent without leave after the officials here at the Pentagon said he willfully and intentionally crossed into North Korea, an adversary state. But the army pushing off that question right now saying, look, we're going to deal with administrative actions later. Right now, it's a focus on making sure he recovers. But it's a difficult situation either way. He has just spent some 70 days in North Korean detention. And the question of whether to bring charges against him under the Uniform Code of Military Justice is not a simple one. At the same time, Kate, you certainly don't want to tell the president that there is no consequence for going absent without leave. But this is a decision the army has to make and probably has to make soon.",

But of course, him being on the loose given what he was accused of doing scared this community for four days at this point. Of course, he's suspected of killing 26-year-old Baltimore tech CEO Pava LaPere. And in that particular case, he was reported missing early Monday, and then her body was found later on after that.

And this one, we're still waiting to hear from the police how he may have or may have not known his particular -- this particular victim as well.But obviously, a lot of details. And as police were looking for LaPere -- for excuse me, Billingsley -- Jason Billingsley is the suspect here, there's also a vigil being held for the 26-year-old LaPere where her father was leading people in who she was. Someone who he said her presence will never leave the city of Baltimore and someone who transitioned from being basically going to -- transitioning him from being someone who's just a father to essentially being the father of a girl boss because of how much she was able to achieve. But at the end of the day, while we're still learning new details, this suspect is behind bars. And the last thing I'll say is he was sentenced to 30 years in prison back in 2015. But as we just learned, the -- about a lot of the sentence was taken out or suspended based on what was handed down at sentencing. So, he really only got 14 years. And then based on the sentencing guidelines and the law in Maryland, he was able to get out on some good behavior.
