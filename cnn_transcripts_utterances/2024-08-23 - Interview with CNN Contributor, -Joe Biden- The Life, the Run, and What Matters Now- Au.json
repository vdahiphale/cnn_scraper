So, what did last night's speech teach us about how the rest of this story -- this short campaign will play out and what do the Republicans need to do to recapture the momentum? Let's get some insight from Evan Osnos who wrote an acclaimed biography of President Joe Biden. Welcome to the program from Chicago, Evan. It is good to see you. You know, we had our show meeting this morning and we all joked, but I think there's some seriousness to this, that this has been a year that actually has been just a month. I mean, it has been insane what has happened in just the course of four weeks. I'm wondering if you've ever experienced something quite like this in your career. EVAN OSNOS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR, AUTHOR, \"JOE BIDEN: THE LIFE, THE RUN, AND WHAT MATTERS NOW\" AND STAFF WRITER, THE NEW YORKER:  No, we're doing politics and history at light speed at this point, Bianna. I mean, it's -- it is really just sort of staggering to think how different this convention might have been had Joe Biden still been the nominee. I think you saw at the beginning of the week, a tremendous outpouring of gratitude to him, not only for the foundation upon which now Kamala Harris is building this last 70 days of the campaign. But also, let's be honest, it's also for him stepping aside for making that rarest of political choices to give up power. And just the sheer pace of that transformation and everything that it implies about how you run against Republicans, how Donald Trump will respond, it has all been turned upside down.",

      "sentences": "It was very noticeable, Bianna, that essentially, the portrait that she was presenting of herself and of the party was in stark contrast towhat is increasingly a set of policy positions that Trump and J. D. Vance hold that are just wildly out of step with where Americans are. Take last night the way she talked about abortion and reproductive rights, the idea that Republicans would come in and institute the plans they've talked about that would require a child, a victim of rape or sexual abuse to have to carry a child's term because of where they live and things like that, it just strikes people as offensive to how we perceive our system to work. And I think the subtle subtext, and in some cases, the explicit goal was to say to people, I have lived a life like yours, I live a life like yours today, I have a blended family. We are a story of America that is relatable and that we are not operating in some esoteric world of ideology and policy that feels that feels unapproachable. And, you know, I think that you -- there was a powerful clip that you ran earlier, just a moment ago, about how she said, together we will turn a page to write, essentially, a new chapter in the American story. That's three big ideas. Together, one, is a very unifying concept. She's not just speaking to Democrats. In fact, she never mentioned the Democratic Party in her speech. She talked about America over and over again. She also said this is an American story, reclaiming, in a sense, the idea that a Democratic candidate can speak on behalf of America and patriotic values. And then, of course, the key idea is a new chapter. You know, this is not only just a reference to Donald Trump as sort of a return to the experience we all had four years ago, but also, a recognition that by supplanting Joe Biden on the ticket, that she has really begun this process of a new generation stepping in.",

It seemsthat Kamala Harris is more focused on freedom and specifically reproductive rights for women. And that's -- the way she characterized Donald Trump, not necessarily as a threat to democracy. she called him an unserious man who could do serious harm to the country, given some of his policies, specifically as it relates to freedoms, including freedoms for women and reproductive rights.

In fact, if you go back and you listen to the very first word in the first ad that Joe Biden ran in this campaign, the first word was freedom. There was this feeling among his political advisers that this was an opportunity for Democrats because of these kinds of intrusions into private life that Americans were seeing from Republicans. But the truth is, and this is -- gets to the core of the political moment we're in now, the messenger matters as much as the message. And when it comes from Kamala Harris, the way in which she can talk about abortion with a full-throated sense of credibility on the question, in a way that Joe Biden frankly could not, it is more powerful, and it has just landed very differently with the public. And, you know, I think it is not as much about raising the sense of alarm about Donald Trump, that is still very much a part of her message, but she's actually saying to Americans that it is OK to laugh at this man. It is OK to say that he's not normal to say that he's weird, to use the term we've all been hearing for weeks now. That has turned out to be very powerful combination to point out both the unseriousness of the person and the seriousness of the consequences.",

I had a conversation with somebody on the sidelines of the convention who islooking at voter attitudes, studying focus groups, doing polls. And what she said was that there was this reservoir of energy of people particularly out in these suburban areas who felt as if patriotism had been taken from them, there was a monopoly on it. The language of patriotism on the right. And instead of being able to fly an American flag at your house and saying, look, I am doing this on behalf of a centrist position or a center left position, it had almost been sort of weaponized by the Trump MAGA Republican movement. That's how it was being described. And so, there was this effort to reach out and say, we can turn how that feels. And, you know, you're hearing from Republicans, and you saw some of them up on the stage during the Democratic Convention, these are Republicans like Adam Kinzinger who, after all, has spent, you know, 12 years in Congress as a Republican saying out -- reaching out explicitly to his fellow Republicans and saying to vote for a Democrat this year is not to betray your values. It is, in fact, to cement your values and to do an act of patriotism. That's a theme that it turns out to have been available but hasn't been taken up until just now and is proving powerful.",

I mean, as one of his -- somebody who's very close to him said to me, the truth is, he's still sort of flummoxed about how things turned out the way they did. And that goes back to something we talked about at the very beginning, which is how fast this is all transpired. Remember two months ago, of course, he was going to be the nominee and they were all planning for that. So, he is still at this moment trying to come to terms with it. He is aware of the idea that perhaps people think that he's angry, they're pushing back a bit against that. Somebody described him to me as disappointed, but not depressed. And I think that is, in some ways, the combination of experiences and it'll take time, as he knows from having lost in his life, to be able to begin to see this with some perspective.",

I mean, you take a look at women in this country. For the first time in 50 years, women don't have the freedom to control their own bodies all across this country. You know, I'm 48, and all of my life, up until just a few years ago, we've been gaining more freedoms in this country. You know, folks gaining the right to vote, because all of us did not always have it. My grandparents did not always have it. Women gaining the right to control their own bodies. And for the first time, because of Donald Trump and the people that he appointed to the Supreme Court, and because of the Roberts Supreme Court, those freedoms have been ripped away. The Voting Rights Act gutted under Roberts. Roe versus Wade destroyed under Roberts. And then, you hear in the dictum of some of these opinions from folks like Clarence Thomas that said, we're not done in terms of going after other freedoms. And that's why we had to -- Democrats had to move forward in terms of marriage equality. Because Clarence Thomas and his yoke were talking about going right at that particular freedom that has been gained over the course of the past few years. So, freedom is a really, really, important component. And it doesn't matter if you're a Democrat, Republican or independent. America is built on freedom. And we need -- and somebody has to protect it. We don't see that protection coming from the Republicans that we see an assault on and Democrats are going to be those joyful warriors, those hopeful warriors that will do everything within our power to protect America's freedom.",

That he's OK with ignoring and sometimes pushing off the constitution of these United States. Joe Biden said this also clearly, you can't just love this country only when you win. This is about loving America all the time. And the Democratic Party looks like America. We represent the diversity and the strength and the values of this country. We believe that everybody, everybody, regardless of your race, your religion, who you love, how you love, how you identify yourself, should live, be able to live their American dream. I can't say that for the other side. You look at Donald Trump, look at that convention where you saw -- our convention, where you saw such unity, some happiness, and joy. I mean, it was like a big family reunion, right? People are dancing, they're crying, they're hugging. You look at the Republican Convention, these people had signs chanting for mass deportation.

You know, we were online via COVID. They didn't get the traditional inauguration. They actually didn't have all the pomp and circumstance for an inauguration. And so, we went into this convention, one looking for a host city that could help tell their story and the story of this administration and the achievements, but most importantly, we went into this convention thinking about how do we tell the story of Joe Biden, of Kamala Harris. And so, when the switch happened, we knew that we were already preparing to tell the story of Kamala Harris, but now, we also needed to be able to tell the story of Governor Tim Walz, and then shift how we told Joe Biden's story, not as the nominee, but as the transformational president that he has been. I will go down saying that Joe Biden is the most transformational president of my lifetime. When you look at his legislative achievements, it is hard to find any comparison outside of Lyndon Baines Johnson, in terms of the sheer number and volume and impact of those legislative achievements. And what gives him even a little notch more is he did it with the 50/50 Senate on a good day and a less than five-seat majority, the same majority that Republicans have.

So, I'm excited to be having this conversation with you.Max, we'll get to where this concept came from, but let's jump into the plot and Sydney's character, Jane, her life is really shattered as a content moderator at a Facebook like social media company. I'm wondering if you personally had any type of life altering or experiences with content that stood out to you as disturbing online. MAX WOLF FRIEDLICH, WRITER, \"JOB\":  Nothing directly. I'm a chronically online person and someone raised on the internet. So, I think a lot of horrible things normalized to me very quickly from a very young age. And it wasn't until years later that I sort of was able to realize that those were strange things to have seen. And I'm not an outlier. I think a lot of people grow up that way in the modern world. But I had a very strange tech job when I first graduated from college where I worked for this company that built fictional influencers. So, that was my most direct related experience to what Jane goes through, where I wasn't looking at awful content on the internet, but I was living life as this like fake famous person called Lil Miquela. And so, I was getting sent, you know, messages about how much people loved me and how much they hated me. And that was more disturbing than anything I had ever seen. And that was the most direct sort of inspiration for the play.",

It really speaks to the present moment, and it leaves people grappling with a lot of things that are maybe the underbelly of tech or the internet, but that are true.

So, I think that whether it's good or bad isn't really for me to say, but we need to start understanding it on a deeper level, and we need to start modeling what a healthy relationship with it looks like. And you can see it repeating itself with A.I. now, where people are still having this conversation of whether we should use it or not, it's too good a technology for people not to use it, and that's not an opinion. We're going to use it.

We don't think of it as being as, you know, cloud storage, as being like real servers that actually exist and need cooling and have an energy expenditure. And I think off of that, like content moderation, there's a human labor cost to us mindlessly scrolling on TikTok, and that's so fascinating to me that we do this thing that gets sort of portrayed as being without thought.

It's not really true that, you know, the studio is an interesting place, but it's a place that you plant yourself in and you -- almost like fishing or something, you're like waiting to catch something and you're trying all these different things. I think the reason why that video has such a big life is because it's one of the few videos I've ever seen and I happen to be in it, but that really captured the moment when two people get the idea for a thing. And I don't know why she was recording that, but she was. And it's the only video I've ever been a part of where I'm like, yes, that was really the moment. That was it. When we put this together and this, and it speaks to that one plus one equaling a billion. You see two people kind of one upping each other.
