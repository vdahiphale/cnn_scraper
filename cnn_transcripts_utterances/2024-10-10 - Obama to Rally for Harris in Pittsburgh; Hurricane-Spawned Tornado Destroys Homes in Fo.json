      "sentences": "Back out here live on Treasure Island, Florida. We are continuing to monitor the latest developments with Hurricane Milton and the extent of damage caused by this very powerful storm.Again, going back to last weekend, we were talking about a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico. It wound up becoming a powerful Category 5 storm. One of the top 10 most powerful storms ever recorded in the Atlantic Basin as it got closer and closer to Florida's coast. It did slightly lessen in wind speed, but it still packed a very powerful punch, especially considering storm surge. And this was an area that just two weeks ago had been hard hit by Hurricane Helene, a Category 4 storm that left damage from the Big Bend region all the way down to the southwestern part of the state. One that, as of two years ago, had to be rebuilding because of a powerful storm, Hurricane Ian, which decimated some areas, including where we will head to next. Let's go live now to Carlos Suarez, who's in Fort Myers Beach for us. Carlos, you had been showing us damage there that had been caused not only by Hurricane Milton, but by Hurricane Ian years ago. Some adjustments that had been made to that community that now were again destroyed.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right, Boris. So we are in the town of Fort Myers Beach, which just reopened to residents a few hours ago. A day after a 5 to 6 foot storm surge just pushed in from the Gulf of Mexico.Piles of sand and debris really covered the area out here. And of course, a number of businesses were damaged by all of this, including this one right here. You can see this outdoor refrigerator where it came to a stop at the entrance of this restaurant. The owner of the place tells me that they got about a half a foot of flooding inside the restaurant, but that they're otherwise in pretty good shape. Boris, the more intense, dramatic damage that we've seen in Lee County was in Fort Myers, where two hurricanes hit yesterday afternoon. We were in one neighborhood earlier today where we saw just home after home that had their roof torn apart, their windows blown out. The good news at that location is that no one that we talked to, at least, was seriously hurt. That second hurricane, that second tornado, touched down in north Fort Myers, and there was some damage there. But as you were talking about, Boris, this part of Fort Myers Beach, really, the folks here are breathing somewhat of a sigh of relief because two years ago, when Hurricane Ian made landfall here in southwest Florida, the storm surge was north of 10 feet. And so folks were really concerned going into yesterday that we were going to see that kind of flooding. Remember that the initial forecast was calling for anywhere between 8 to 12 feet of a storm surge. That would have brought the flooding out here to the same levels that we saw two years ago. And Boris, as you also made a reference, a lot of Fort Myers Beach remains untouched two years after Hurricane Ian because folks are still in the process of trying to rebuild out here, and now they're dealing with yet another hurricane, and they've got to figure out exactly what they want to do next -- Boris.",

Now, Diddy was in court today. He entered the courtroom wearing a jail-issued outfit, a khaki long-sleeved shirt, pants. He was also shackled at the ankles.His family members were in the courtroom, his mother and most of his children. He had waved to them, blew a kiss to his mother, and one of his sons had raised and flexed his arm, his bicep, as though to show a sign of strength. Now this hearing was mostly about procedural issues, working through some of the evidence in the case. Prosecutors said they collected 96 devices back in that March search of Combs' homes in Los Angeles and Miami, and when they searched him on his person, they said he'd begun going through them, encrypting some of them, and giving them back to the defense. That will take some time. You know, there are going to be some motions in this case. One of those was addressed today. Now, if the judge does not need them back in court, the next time we will see Combs back in court will be in December -- Brianna.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that was one of the issues that was teed up yesterday for this hearing today, and that's what they spent a lot of time on in the courtroom. Combs' attorneys had asked for an investigation into leaks, saying that they believe the government alerted the press, not only of the video, but also of the searches at his homes in March. But this video is something that prosecution said that there's no need for this.They have said that they did not obtain this video until after CNN has aired it. Obviously, we're CNN. We have declined to comment on these allegations, but the prosecution said that they did not have this until after it was already made public by us, and that there's no need for an investigation. They said this is just an attempt to try to keep a damning piece of evidence out of this case. Now the judge said he is not going to decide today on whether they should have a hearing. He's going to let the sides file their legal briefs and their legal arguments on this. But one thing that Combs' lawyers did ask for is what they called a gag order. They want the prosecution to be stopped from talking about any grand jury evidence in this case or any non-public evidence. Now prosecutors never really discussed that publicly before a trial, and the judge said, in fact, that because that is the rule, he said, is there any harm in imposing this? The prosecutor had asked us to make it reciprocal to stop Combs' lawyers from saying anything more about any of the evidence in this case. They cited an interview that Combs' lawyer had given to TMZ in which he suggested that the government was trying to -- he accuse the government of making a takedown of a successful Black man. They said they wanted him to stop talking about that. Combs' lawyer said that if this does go into place, these restrictions on statements, he would abide by it. So the judge asked him to draft what this order would be, send it to him, and he would sign it. So we will learn in the coming days exactly the contours of what they're prevented from saying -- Brianna.",
