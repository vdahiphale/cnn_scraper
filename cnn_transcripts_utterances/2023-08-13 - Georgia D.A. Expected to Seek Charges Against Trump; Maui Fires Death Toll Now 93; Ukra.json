I'm Fredricka Whitfield in Washington, D.C.And we begin this hour with exclusive new reporting on the investigation into Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Sources tell CNN that Georgia prosecutors now have text messages and emails directly connecting Trump's legal team to a voting system breach in Coffee County, Georgia in January 2021. This comes as the district attorney investigating Trump in Georgia appears to be close to an indictment. Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis is expected to seek charges against more than a dozen people. And if she brings charges against the former president, it would be the fourth indictment of Trump since being voted out of office. We have coverage of these new developments. Isabel Rosales is outside the Fulton County court where security preparations are under way. And we have CNN's Zachary Cohen on these stunning new developments linking Trump's legal team to a voting system breach in a rural Georgia County. Zach, let's begin with you. Tell us more about what you're learning and this new evidence.",

But the texts show that in the days leading up to that breach, the Trump attorneys and these operatives were discussing ways to get access and specifically trying to secure a written invitation from an elections official in Coffee County that they would basically use as an excuse or validation that they could go in and get access to voting systems that they did not have the right to access. Now these texts link various Trump attorneys to this breach including Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and also his former attorney Sidney Powell who we know was instrumental in helping fund this effort to get access to voting systems, not just in Coffee County, Georgia but other states as well. And that's something we've also reported that Fani Willis who's the D.A. here is investigating as part of the broader investigation into overturning the election.",

As far as those text messages are concerned, I immediately reached out to Clint Rucker, who is a former Fulton County executive assistant D.A. This morning. And I asked him how important this latest development is in the grand scheme of things, being that this indictment is pending. And he frankly said that this potentially, Fredricka, could be a smoking gun. And the reason is pretty elementary, as your reporter Zach said. Rucker says that now you have something in writing, right, that allows prosecutors to make a direct link to those in the Trump inner circle regarding the interference of election results. And he says those text messages can be perceived as a confession. And that is pretty powerful. And you know, you have all these messages floating around here in Georgia and all across the nation, around in the public domain. And now for the first time you have something really solid in writing. And in his words, Clint Rucker who has worked for Fulton D.A. for 25- plus years, he says this is big. How big, he says it's going to take a lot of time to sort through this information this week, you know, especially since there's so much fraud being alleged in this case. And so while many are anticipating a grand jury decision this week, Rucker predicts it may not come down until the following week. So there's a lot to sort through here.

But also of course, indicting more people creates more potential cooperatives for the government.And you know, it's easy for Donald Trump to sit back and say, I'm going to raise money off of this and maybe it helps him in the polls. But for some random Republican operative who is a defendant here, it's a very different story. This is their lives, this is their life at stake. And ultimately they've got to figure out how to hire lawyers. They're not cheap, I'll tell you from firsthand experience.

I'm assuming they're going to want to delay all four. But there may be one they'll delay a lot than the others potentially. But I think the think the prosecutors are going to have conversation because ultimately at the end of the day Trump can't be in four different courtrooms at the same time. And so, you know, he's going to need time to prepare. So that is going to be part of the conversation. It's going to be very interesting to see.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Kherson in the south of Ukraine has been the regular targets of Russian artillery, hitting it seems civilian areas regularly over the past month. Remember it was liberated in November of last year.And so, there's been the occasional Ukrainian military buildup around the area. And possibly Russian responses to their losses in the southern part of Ukraine along the counteroffensive front line. It may occasionally involved firing artillery. But still, this particularly ghastly incident involves, as you say, a 23-day-old baby girl called, Sophia. Her 12-year-old brother, Artium (ph), they were killed alongside their mother and father when shelling hit their home. As you say, four of seven people who died in that one incident. But I should point out, children now repeatedly the people were talking about in terms of Ukrainian civilian life being lost. Startling, someone so young could be killed by something so indiscriminate are as artillery fire. You also mentioned Kupiansk, different part of Ukraine the northeast near the city of Kharkiv, close to the Russian border to some degree. We've seen over the past days a mandatory evacuation for children because the intensity of shell fire against that particular city liberated like Kherson was as well, but being repeatedly hit. At one point in one day by over 500 shells -- say Ukrainian officials. At the same time, Russia itself suggesting that Belgorod and Kursk regions are being attacked by unmanned aerial vehicles fired by Ukraine, but also intercepted, too. They've also just yesterday been dealing with the aftermath of what they say was a foiled Ukrainian missile attack on the Kerch bridge, billion dollar piece of instructive that links the mainland to occupied Crimea peninsula, but legally it's part of Ukraine. Russia's launches here are very much about drones or missiles being -- losses about children, some as young as just over three weeks old being killed by indiscriminate Russian artillery fire -- Fredricka.",

Former President Donald Trump didn't spend a whole lot of time on the ground. But it was long enough to get some digs in on a certain rival. That's next.

Yesterday, the former president was met with cheers at the legendary Iowa state fair with an entourage of congressmen from Florida who have endorsed Trump over their own Governor DeSantis. And this comes on the heels of several bad weeks for DeSantis -- of campaign shake ups, low fund raising estimates, and sinking poll numbers.CNN's Steve Contorno joining me right now with more on all this. Steve, so Trump was only at the fair for a short time. DeSantis was there for hours working the crowd. Didn't give him a boost, DeSantis that is with Iowa voters?",

And everything you mentioned is accurate about the problems his campaign has had over the past month, but they are very encouraged by what they saw this weekend and they still think there's plenty of between now and January when these caucusgoers really start organizing for who they're going to support in Iowa.So, yes, there have been troubles, but there's also a lot to take away from this weekend. He pressed a lot of flesh. He was very visible with his young family. That's a dynamic that they're going to continue to play up that he has the generational argument between him and the former president. And he had an opportunity to spend some time with the state's very popular Republican governor. He's going to be spending a lot of time in Iowa trying to convince these Iowa caucus-goers to get behind him. But then as you mentioned, Donald Trump reminded a lot of people about why he remains the front runner in this race. He had a very large crowd there to see him speak. Yes, he only spent a little bit of time in Iowa for this event. But when he was there he was very well- received. And he was also bracketing his campaign, bracketing DeSantis's events so that when DeSantis was speaking, he was often getting heckled, there was a plane flying overhead with a banner that said, be likable, Ron. I think this is the dynamic you're going to see going forward, where you're going to have DeSantis recognizing that he's going to have to grind out a victory if he is going to win. He's going to have to make a lot of appearances and these states. [14:45:04] And his campaign says they're prepared to do just that. They're building a grassroots operation that can support him through the summer and the fall, and into when people are actually voting. And Trump in the meantime when he's not --when his calendars not clogged up with all his legal challenges, you're going to see him sort of swooping into the states from time to time, reminding voters why they still like him, why he remains so dynamic in such a powerful figure in the GOP. So, as much as there was a lot for both sides to take away from this weekend, I'm sure they're going to look back at it and say, this is a good start, this is good for us to build going forward into the debates, and the fall, I think what we really saw is the table getting set for what we're going to see between these two candidates, these two front runners in the race going forward, Fredricka.",

It's about 60 miles north of Wichita, where you will find that it not only violates federal law but also the First Amendment. Eric Meyer, who spoke to CNN, he's the owner of this publication, and he tells us that the Marion County Police Department raided both his home and his publication's office last week. He added that police also seized computers, cell phones, also other materials as part of this investigation. Meyer suggesting that this was partially triggered by a story that he published last week. And in it, it mentioned Kari Newell, the owner of a local coffee shop. Mayer explained that he and his colleague received a tip about her allegedly driving without a valid driver's license. In his story last week, Meyer reported that after consulting with an attorney, they -- instead of publishing, they notified local law enforcement that the newspaper had, in fact, received some sensitive information about Newell. So, for that report, police then notified Newell. And so, what eventually followed that was the issuing of a search warrant that alleged violations of identity theft and authorized a seizure of documents or any material pertaining to Newell. Newell, for her part, telling CNN that she was, quote, flabbergasted when she learned about the raid and that she denied knowing that it was even in the works. Meyer, for his part, claiming that law enforcement did not provide an explanation about the reason for the search and only handed him a copy of the warrant. And during the search, we should note that Meyer's 98- year-old mother, a co-owner of the record, was home. Over the weekend, Meyer telling our colleagues that she died this weekend and he believes it was from of the stress that was brought on by the raid, though the cause of death has not yet been confirmed. The Marion County police chief has not provided any details to CNN, only saying that he was confident that the judicial system that's being questioned through the investigation will be, quote, vindicated, he said. CNN has also reached out to the Marion County magistrate who actually signed that search warrant, in question, Fred. We're still waiting to hear back. But, really, the essence of the story is that this small Kansas town now become the focal point when it comes to the conversation about the First Amendment.",
