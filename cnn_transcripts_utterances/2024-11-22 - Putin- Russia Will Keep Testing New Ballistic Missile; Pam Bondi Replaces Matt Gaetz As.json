Just the NASDAQ underperforming. Still got NVIDIA under a bit of pressure today. Those are the markets, and these are the main events. Vladimir Putin says Russia will continue to test its new hypersonic ballistic missile, ahead of a hotly anticipated IPO. The Klarna CEO joins me to talk about adding Google and Apple Pay to the service. And saying goodbye to a true pioneer of budget travel. A tribute to Arthur Frommer. Live from New York, it is Friday, November 22nd. I am Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And a good evening once more. We begin with the war in Ukraine, and a stark message coming from Russia. President Vladimir Putin says Moscow will continue testing a new hypersonic ballistic missile in combat. The weapon was fired on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Thursday. It has been a week of dangerous escalation. Kyiv says its air defenses shot down 64 Russian drones today alone. The nation's parliament did not meet today due to the risk of missile strikes. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine is now discussing new air defense systems with its allies. Nick Paton Walsh is in Kyiv for us. Nick, Vladimir Putin threatening anyone who allows Ukraine to fire their weaponry at and into Russia, that means the United States, the UK and France, but at the same time saying they can continue to develop these hypersonic ballistic weaponry that they say at least these defenses cant contain.",

From Thursday's Russian launch of a new weapon to their growing use of purloined North Korean missiles, the global reach of this war grows. (END VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (on camera): I should point, it isn't just those ballistic missiles that North Korea is contributing as troops, of course, as well. And we have been hearing today indications that in Mariupol, the southern port city occupied by Russia, a Ukrainian security source tells us that they say they have evidence that there are North Korean personnel there in Russian uniform, not infantry, but potentially technological advisers. And there separately are indications from Ukrainian military sources they believe there are North Korean troops in the Kharkiv region, too. A sign, as I said there, of the increasing global scope of this war and is important to remind ourselves that literally a week ago, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz rang Vladimir Putin trying to break a two-year isolation of the Kremlin head from major western leaders with a phone call suggesting diplomacy. And in literally a week, we are now seeing US supplied weapons fired by Ukraine into Russia and Russia firing back essentially what they consider to be a high tech weapon, normally of a design you consider to use a nuclear payload to send a strong message to Washington, and even required a 30-minute heads up via a phone call that Russia still has tools it can reach to in its arsenal that might upset what I think NATO consider to be their superiority here.",

Brilliant reporting, questions certainly need to be asked. Nick Paton Walsh in Kyiv, thank you. Now, sources say Donald Trump is expected to offer Kelly Loeffler, the Secretary of Agriculture job. Loeffler briefly represented the state of Georgia in the US Senate. She was also a major fundraiser for Trump's presidential campaign. Meanwhile, Matt Gaetz says he won't return to Congress after a short-lived bid to become US Attorney General. Gaetz said the likely confirmation battle had become a \"distraction\" and praised the president-elect's new choice, Pam Bondi. She is the former attorney general of Florida and she also advised Donald Trump during his first impeachment trial. Tom Foreman is in Washington for us tonight. Tom, good to have you with us. Attention has clearly shifted from Matt Gaetz to his replacement and perhaps some of the other picks that could face and are facing difficult questions. But what remains quite fascinating to me about what we have heard now since over the Matt Gaetz choice, is the fact that it seems that the president- elect said to him, look, you're going to have a problem in the Senate, so there is an element of pragmatism to be applied here. Look, these are our picks, but we will find a backup very quickly if it doesn't work.",

Although, in some ways, there is a question if some of them might put their thumb too much on the scales of letting billionaire big business do whatever it wants to do. But I agree with you, Julia, it is very important position. The question is, what will he come up with? And notably, at least one of the candidates he is looking at here, kind of has backed things that Trump would not agree with, being sort of like anti- tariff for example. And Trump says, oh, tariffs are the key to everything. We are going to do it all with tariffs, so it will be very interesting to see where he comes down on that.

As you say, the main supporters of Israel, the main armed supporters, the United States will continue to send weapons. Absolutely. Because they reject what the ICC is saying, and I don't think that was ever in doubt. They had always indicated that when this first came up in May, earlier on in the year, and of course, the country sort of rallying around not everyone, of course, but mostly around the prime minister and this idea of national self-defense and that's undermined by the ICC rallying around that. But, you know, there is a nuance when we listen to, say, the Germans as you mentioned, they say that they will continue to supply weapons, but if the prime minister was due to go visit Germany, then they would have to address that issue then, so that it is sort of diplomatic. But these European Union outlier, Hungary, Viktor Orban, the prime minister there, actually went out of his way to invite Prime Minister Netanyahu to visit Hungary, to which the Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked him greatly. The reality is, though, setting foot in Europe is going to be hard. The British have said that they would turn him over. The French have said that they would turn Prime Minister Netanyahu over and the former Defense minister, but there has been a repercussion already for France because France was involved in the ceasefire talks, or they were part of the formula around the ceasefire talks between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and now Israeli officials are saying, well, we don't want France to be part of that equation now because they're clearly biased against us.

The judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial has postponed sentencing indefinitely. Judge Juan Merchan agreed to consider a motion to dismiss the case. The Manhattan D.A.'s office has a week to respond. It said the President-elect's conviction should stand. He was found guilty of falsifying business records. Now that's MMA fighter Conor McGregor leaving a Dublin courtroom after a civil jury found that he did commit sexual assault back in 2018. The jury awarded the woman more than $250,000. Police investigated the woman's complaint, but prosecutors declined to bring charges, saying there was insufficient evidence that a conviction was unlikely. McGregor has maintained his innocence, testifying sex was consensual. Music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was back in a New York courtroom asking a game to be released on bail. His attorneys claimed prosecutors altered a video of him attacking then girlfriend, Cassie Ventura in 2016. Combs has been in the New York jail for 10 weeks awaiting his trial on sex trafficking charges. He's pleaded not guilty. And U.S. markets closing higher to finish out the week. The major averages all as you can see there in the green, the Dow led the way up more than 400 points. We're talking around one percent. Wall Street shows little sign of slowing down as a strong year already draws to a close. It's no wonder European firms like FinTech giant Klarna may want to go public here in the United States. They're known for Buy Now, Pay Later technology and recently filed the paperwork to go public. Klarna could be valued in the tens of billions of dollars.

But also think to speak to this fact, I mean, McKinsey did this report already back in '15 that a lot of credit card companies missed. And it spoke about this large group of U.S. consumers that you called self- aware avoiders. These are the people that have been disappointed by the credit cards that were fooled into, you know, revolving into building two big balances by being constantly promoting their credit limit. And these people are simply, you know, very hesitant. They want to avoid credit cards. They like using debit but with the additional element of Buy Now, Pay Later or if interest fee installments, installments are fixed, they, you know, you pay them off. And it just leads to a healthier outcome for these consumers. And that's 25 percent of the U.S.-credit card -- potential credit card customers. So, it's a huge market that has been heavily overlooked by bankers who sit in their offices and think everyone is just looking for loyalty points, because that's people working at bank, but that's not everyone, right?

And those companies will get the opportunity to, you know, really accelerate their businesses. And when I look at what we do internally, take customer service as one example where, you know, we have reduced the number of human agents by 70 percent this year as a consequence of being able to use A.I. together with OpenAI in such a fashion, that is obviously a huge reason for the profit increase that you mentioned and -- but we see it across the board.
