Something that has caused some concerns within the ranks. There are other concessions too that Kevin McCarthy has agreed to including capping overall spending levels in this coming year, something that could potentially lead to a cut on defense programs as well as raising the national debt ceiling, tying that to spending cuts. All of those latter two provisions have not been publicly released but will be part of the policies going forward. And in talking to Republicans today, some are still trying to figure out what it means for the majority and are offering some concerns. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAVID JOYCE, (R-OH): I'm not the speaker, so you know it sure concerns Kevin more than it concerns me. But you know, look, that's just ticket back the way it was originally.

Some of these relate to the rules, like vacating the chair, others are just side deals. I think this is a big mistake.If I were a rational, pragmatic, or moderate Republican, I would push back hard. And I would not vote for this rules package -- with that rule to vacate the chair with one vote, I would push back hard. And frankly, that would be doing Kevin McCarthy a huge favor. He doesn't want it. He agreed to it reluctantly and basically those guys put the -- you know, figuratively speaking, put the gun to his head for that change.

So, we're not playing games here. So, if I -- look, I think this is going to only lead to more difficulty in terms of governance, on all sorts of issues, for example, capping the spending at 2022 levels. Well, you know, we have something called the United States Senate. They will have a say in this too, as well. President Biden. Plus, there are plenty of House Republicans who don't agree with that on defense. So, that's one deal. It's going to go out the window. Same with the -- same with the debt ceiling, you're not going to get it -- you're going to end up having something close to a clean debt ceiling enacted. That's what will have to happen. So that will disappoint those hardliners. So, Kevin McCarthy in the end is going to have to disappoint those folks.

He says he does believe in monarchy, but of course, you can't have a monarchy without having a spare heir. So, some confusion about how he really feels about the monarchy. But his main issue is this relationship as he sees it between the British press and the palace, a complicit relationship, which didn't work for him. And he actually reveals that Camilla leaked stories about William and conversations she'd have with William in a campaign as he describes a dangerous campaign to marry Charles, and then subsequently become queen. Now, behind the scenes here, there's a lot of upset about that because it didn't play out like that and Camilla wouldn't do that.
