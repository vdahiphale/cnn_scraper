Welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Amara Walker. This is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Just ahead, an Israeli operation in the West Bank leaves many Palestinians dead. We are live in Tel Aviv with the details. Donald Trump indicted all over again in his election subversion case as the prosecutor tries to work around a supreme court on presidential immunity. And footage obtained by CNN shows Nancy Pelosi evacuating the Capitol on January 6th, 2021. We'll tell you what she had to say amid the chaos of that day. Israel is launching large-scale military operation in the Occupied West Bank as the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza drags on now for nearly 11 months. Palestinian Authorities say at least nine people have been killed in the West Bank operation. Video obtained by CNN shows bulldozers like this one tearing up a street in Tulkarem and military vehicles outside a hospital in Jenin. The Palestinian ministry of health says Israeli forces blocked roads leading to the government hospital. Also, footage released by the IDF shows a strike on what Israel says is a militant operations room in a refugee camp. Israel says it is targeting \"Islamic Iranian terrorist infrastructure.\" The Israeli foreign minister accuses Iran of funding and arming terrorists and smuggling advanced weapons via Jordan. For more now, let's turn to Jim Sciutto, who is joining us now from Tel Aviv with more. Jim, what do we know about this operation and its significance? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, it is the largest Israeli military operation in the West Bank since the October 7th attacks, it is significant. The death toll at this point stands at nine and it is quite a sensitive area, no question, because the West Bank certainly viewed differently from Gaza. It is not controlled by Hamas, so the operations there are seen far more sensitively by the Palestinian population. Now, Israel is justifying this saying that they are taking apart terror infrastructure, which they described as Islamic Iranian terror infrastructure. The IDF saying that weapons are coming into the West Bank via Iran, facilitated -- funded by Iran and that they are -- these Israeli forces are addressing that. Now, they're not making a connection to a failed suicide -- well, suicide bombing that took place in Tel Aviv little more than a week ago that only killed the suicide bomber, but they do mention that to highlight what they say is the nature of the terror threat. But, Hamas reacting by saying it is calling for a mobilization of Hamas supporters and fighters in the West Bank which, of course, would be an escalation. So it's quite a sensitive time, especially given you have these ongoing ceasefire negotiations for Gaza going on and this is quite a significant operation.",

Certainly, the nature of the connection to operatives or fighters in the West Bank less clear, but they are claiming that Iran is able to get funding and weapons into the West Bank to arm fighters and terrorists there. That would be significant. It's also notable to hear the Israeli foreign minister calling for operations in the West Bank like those underway in Gaza.And of course, Amara, you know, the scale of the military operations in Gaza since October 7, we are nearly a year into that war, the level of destruction there, the number of civilian casualties as well. We are not at that point yet, certainly, in terms of the operations we've seen today, but they are the biggest we've seen since October 7th. And if Israel is planning something even bigger, even approaching the scale of what you've seen in Gaza, that would be, again, a significant escalation.",

      "sentences": "So, let's begin with the context around this. As you mentioned, it was this week that President Zelenskyy said that Russia launched its largest, its most massive air assault at Ukraine since the beginning of this conflict. He was on stage -- President Zelenskyy was on stage Tuesday speaking to journalists and very much trying to convey strength, trying to assert control even in the face of this assault. He laid out what he called a 'victory plan'. I know we have those four steps up there. The first he said is going into Kursk -- crossing into Kursk and tick, we've already done that is what President Zelenskyy said.The second thing is Ukraine's strategic place in the world's security infrastructure. I believe that's a reference to Ukraine's bid to join NATO. Thirdly, he wanted to speak on diplomacy. So, how can you bring Russia to the negotiating table? We've heard Kursk spoken of in this context that the more land -- Russian land Ukraine is able to grab, the more powerful its position will be in any future peace talks, in any future negotiations. And finally, economic pressure on Russia, this is something that President Zelenskyy has on and on about. He very much wants to see sanctions tightened ever more on Russia and he wants to see that pressure continue financially on the country as well. He says he wants to take -- I will call this more of an outline than a plan. Of course, he's not revealing too many details here. He wants to take this to President Biden in September around the U.N. General Assembly, and he also wants to take to him what he sees as victories with the use of Western weapons. Take a listen to how he says Ukraine used F-16s provided by NATO. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we need to do wider training mission again, et cetera. We have propositions to the United States. It depends on their permission. They have to be positive on it.

We also want more, it's not enough. So President Zelenskyy very much trying to say, yes, there is a mixed battlefield picture here. There are places where Russia is making gains. There are places where Ukraine is pushing forward, but we have the upper hand and we will keep having that upper hand, Zelenskyy says, if we get that support from the U.S. and NATO.WALKER, I mean, obviously, there's a difference between hoping and expecting. And when Zelenskyy and Biden meet at the UNGA, what is the expectation from Zelenskyy, I mean, as we heard there, it sounds like he's going to ask for more weapons.",

But President Zelenskyy desperately wants is for restrictions to be lifted on the use of long-range missiles. So, he has long-range missiles that have been provided to him by his Western partners, but there are rules as to how far he can use them. And what he wants to do, is strike deep into the heart of Russia, to hit the military infrastructure that belongs to Moscow at its source, on its territory. He also wants to be able to use air defense systems, air defense capabilities right up near Russian airspace.Now, of course, this is something that will make White House officials concerned. They do not want to escalate this conflict with President Putin, at least that's the rhetoric we keep hearing. But throughout this conflict, as you know, the sliding scale of that red line keeps shifting. At the beginning of this conflict, the U.S. wasn't even willing to provide tanks, much less F-16s. So President Zelenskyy is going to capitalize that. He's going to hope that he can keep pushing Biden further with those red lines.",

So what the Justice Department is doing is they went back to the grand jury in Washington, D.C., a different grand jury then before, talked to those citizens about this new set of allegations against Trump. So same charges, but the narrative of what the probable causes to bring the case against Trump, that's what they presented to the grand jury and the grand jury approved as an indictment. And so now, those allegations will get to move forward as they head to trial. The way they did it is cut out a lot of things that Donald Trump was doing while he was president, talking to the Justice Department, talking to senior aides and advisers in the Oval Office, talking to or learning things about the election from Intel agencies. Those were part of the indictment before. No more, but there are still a lot of things in the indictment about Donald Trump as candidate, wanting to block the certification of the electoral vote on January 6, and what he was doing with fake electors and private advisers in various states across the country.So now, the Justice Department has this new version of the indictment in court and they are going to be talking to the judge quite a lot in the coming months about how to get this case to trial. And the courts are going to have to look very closely at whether this version of the indictment passes muster and does separate the protection around the presidency versus what Donald Trump can be held potentially criminally liable for in court.",

Thank you.Well, for the first time since her convention coronation, Kamala Harris is back on the campaign trail. Harris and her VP pick, Tim Walz, are embarking on a two-day tour of Georgia by bus, culminating in a rally in Savannah on Thursday evening. Polls a month ago showed a small but significant lead for Donald Trump in Georgia, but that has changed since Harris replaced Biden on the ticket and Harris clearly now feels she has a decent chance with the state. Our U.S. Politics Correspondent Eva McKend is tracking the Harris campaign. Hi there, Eva, I mean, obviously that sends a huge message that Harris' team is picking Georgia for their first joint campaign after the Democratic National Convention. EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: It does Amara, and you know, when you speak to Democratic strategists and organizers in Georgia, they often lament that candidates do not spend enough time outside of metro Atlanta. So, they are speaking directly to those concerns. Keep in mind, they don't have to win some of these rural counties outright. But even if they diminish Republican margins, that portends well for their campaign in their estimation. They've got 24 field offices across the state. Of those 24 field offices, seven of them are in southern Georgia. And then another part of this bus tour is aimed at sort of testing Governor Walz and how he does in appealing to rural voters in these pockets of the state. He, of course, saw grew up with a rural background himself. And so, they are sort of testing him out there. Does he connect with those voters? Can they deploy him separate from the vice president in the crucial weeks ahead? WALKER: And the Harris campaign, Eva, has unveiled a new ad today that talks about Trump's ties, which he denies, to Project 2025. Let's take a look at it really quick. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Donald Trump may try to deny it, but those are Donald Trump's plans. DONALD TRUMP, (R) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, revenge does take time, I will say that. And sometimes revenge can be justified.

And we know from sports, a superstar can either carry a team or bring it down. Now, everything has been going in one direction, straight up, for Nvidia. Look at that share price spike, this is a meteoric rise, almost 3,000 percent increase in the share price in the last five years alone. That's because Nvidia makes the AI chips that power this AI revolution.And this rise has made the company one of the most valuable on the planet. Even though Nvidia is not a household name, it is now worth $3.2 trillion, more than Microsoft, more but Alphabet, more than Amazon, more than Saudi Aramco, and just behind Apple for the number one spot here. It's been absolutely incredible. But look, the bar has been set very high for Nvidia to justify that valuation and Wall Street analysts are expecting meteoric growth to be revealed in today's earnings report, triple-digit growth across the board for profit, for revenue, for free cash flow. So whether or not this company can live up to those expectations is a huge deal because the higher the share price goes, the bigger impact it has on the overall stock market.

Very important reporting.Well, the Russian government is trying to calm fears that the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov in France could upend the messaging platform. The Kremlin spokesperson says calls to users to delete sensitive Telegram messages are baseless. French officials say Durov's arrest is part of a broad criminal investigation involving serious abuses on the app. But many in Russia say it is an attack against them. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has the latest.

It was kidnapping, basically a hostage taking, direct political and economic aggression against Russia.PLEITGEN (voice-over): Pavel Durov remains in French custody. This video posted on Telegram purporting to show Durov and some associates, the caption saying they were having breakfast in Azerbaijan before flying to Paris. French prosecutors say Durov is the subject of a cyber crimes investigation and alleging Telegram was complicit in, among other things, illicit transactions, spreading child pornography, and fraud by failing to moderate the content shared on the platform. Telegram says Durov has nothing to hide, but Russia's foreign minister now insinuating that the arrest may be politically motivated, even though France's president denied politics were involved. SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): Apparently, someone is hoping to somehow gain access to encryption codes. Now, this is already been proven by the actions of the French that Telegram is a truly reliable and popular network. PLEITGEN (voice-over): The 39-year-old Durov often referred to as the Russian Mark Zuckerberg, is one of the world's most well-known social media moguls, cultivating a playboy like image, often posting shirtless pictures of himself on social media, and even claiming he has fathered more than 100 children. He's the co-founder not just of Telegram used by hundreds of millions worldwide, but also a Russian platform similar to Facebook called the VKontakte. Durov rejects any regulation and moderation on his platforms, as he told CNN in an interview in 2015.",
