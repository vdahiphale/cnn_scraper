Police are out in force on patrol and Shanghai authorities there have been setting up these big blue barriers on Wulumuqi Street, which was the scene of those dramatically defiant protests over the weekend.And CNN has also learned that protestors have been rounded up. In fact, one protestor who is detained and later released in Shanghai said that Shanghai police detained 80 to 110 protestors after a protest took place on Saturday. The protestor also told CNN that the Shanghai police collected biometric data of those who were detained, including their fingerprints, their photographs, their retinal scans as well. It's unclear if these individuals remain in detention. On Monday, in Beijing and Shanghai, no signs of major protests, but there were protests elsewhere. In fact, we have video to share a protest that took place last night, Monday in Hangzhou where there was a tense confrontation between protestors and police there in a shopping center in this major economic and e-commerce hub. CNN has verified that there have been 20 COVID related protests in 15 different cities across the country. Let's show the map to you so you can have an understanding of the reach of these anti-zero COVID protests that had been taking place in Hangzhou, in Beijing, in Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Urumqi, Xian, Wuhan and elsewhere. There was also an extremely rare protest that took place last night here in Hong Kong. Very rare in the wake of the national security law being opposed here on the territory, and some protestors that took place in that vigil were holding white sheets of paper, a symbol of censorship, which has become a symbol of these protests. A lot of pressure is on China right now to unwind and find a way out of its zero COVID policy. Experts that we've been talking to say that it requires a change in medical capacity, a change in medical messaging about the virus, and also, higher vaccination rates. What we've been monitoring a National Health Commission press conference that just took place in China, and they've just announced plans to boost the COVID-19 vaccination rate among the elderly. And an NHC spokesperson also said that the lockdowns should be lifted, quote, \"as quickly as possible to reduce inconvenience for the people.\" A very significant step forward in the wake of these protests.

Thanks to their earlier win over Serbia, they're now guaranteed to qualify for the knockout round alongside the holders France. One of the games of the tournament played out elsewhere in group G, Serbia came from behind to take a three-one lead against Cameroon. Aleksandar Mitrovic seemed to have given his side an unassailable advantage, but the indomitable Lions fought back with two goals in just four minutes. Vincent Aboubakar and Jean-Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting secured a thrilling draw for Cameroon. They still have it all to do though. In order to stay in the tournament, Cameroon will have to beat the favorites Brazil and hope that the other game goes in their favor. If Switzerland avoid losing to Serbia, they're through. In group H, another thrilling game involving in African side Ghana threw away a two-nil lead against South Korea. Re-equalize with a thundering header from Cho Gue-sung, but the black stars weren't rattled and kudos to Mohammed Kudus, who secured a famous win for his team. Portugal won the late game of the day against Uruguay. It looked as though Cristiano Ronaldo had put them ahead, but his head mustn't have actually touched the ball because his former Man-U teammate, Bruno Fernandez was credited with the score and he later made the game safe with a penalty. So, Portugal also joined Brazil and France in the knockout round. The other three teams in this group still have a chance, and next up it's a grudge match between Ghana and Uruguay.

But that changed in their second game. We saw team members singing the national anthem, albeit quietly and facing cheers and boos from some supporters in the stands, many of whom of course, wearing shirts carrying the name of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini or the slogan women, life, freedom, which has come to characterize this protest movement. Now we are learning from a source working closely on the security of the games that the Iranian national football team players and their loved ones and family members at home have faced threats from the Iranian regime, that if the team members take part in any form of protest or refuse to sing the national anthem ahead of today's game against the United States, that their loved ones back home could face persecution at the hands of the Iranian regime, and in particular, violence, torture and imprisonment. Now, according to this source, the players were called into a meeting with representatives of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard corps, in which they were warned that if they do take part in any movement and their family members back home could face violence or imprisonment. And according to this source, there has been an uptick in the number of Iranian security officials overseeing and monitoring the squad as they participate in the World Cup Games. According to this source, and the team members are facing severe restrictions, unable to mingle or discuss anything with members of players outside of the squad. And while we have heard from Iran's, head coach Carlos Queiroz speaking to members of the press just yesterday, saying that his team members stand in solidarity with all human rights causes across the globe. He didn't directly address the protest movement at home in Iran. But he did has previously said that his players are free to protest in any way they wish, providing that their actions fall within FIFA regulations. But of course, there is concern over the safety of the players and their loved ones. This is rhetoric we've heard before from the Iranian regime, of course, in relation to athletes competing overseas. According to this source, Queiroz himself was called into a meeting with a representative of the IRGC where the contents of that conversation is still unclear. Rosemary?",

Because Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is a major strategic asset for the Russians. At its peak, it supplies 20 percent of the power of the electrical power into the Ukrainian energy structures, those very structures that have been under relentless attack by Russian cruise missiles for the last month resulting, for example, in the city of Kyiv, the capital having to reduce its energy consumption, they hope by 60 percent just to keep the essential service functioning. So, it's very unlikely that the Russians would give that up. On top of that, it is an important military base for them. They've been using it and its environment to shell against Ukrainian positions, Ukrainian civilian towns on the other side of the Dnipro River. And if they were to evacuate it, it would become a bridgehead for any kind of future Ukrainian operations to try to recapture more of the southern territory with the ultimate eye on the Crimean Peninsula, which of course Russia illegally annexed back in 2014, 2015.

And I guess that's their real problem because they can get people off the street and that, you know, they're well prepared for these kind of things. They've got a vast security apparatus. But the root cause of this is really the harsh enforcement of COVID zero over a long period of time. And underlying that, you know, the all-powerful party in Xi Jinping. And you might be able to solve the protests in the short term. You can't solve the COVID zero issue nearly so easily.",

I suspect they won't do it in winter, and we are going into winter in Beijing. I suspect it won't happen before March. That's when we have the National People's Congress and a new cabinet will be appointed. They're all important events, which will have an impact on this.And also, you know, China has vast, you know, state powers, if you like, but they haven't been put to application for vaccines. And it's not just that the Chinese vaccines aren't as effective at protecting people from the virus. It's also that the -- they haven't been ramped up. I mean, there's about 32 million people in China are over 80. Only about 40 percent are properly vaccinated according to WHO standards. So, there's a lot of vulnerable people in China. And until you fix that up, you know, is the country is unlikely to open because, you know, a lot of people could get infected and vulnerable people could die. And I don't think Xi Jinping wants to allow that to happen. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

What's been going on in the U.K. is right now we have a double impact. We have a tightening taking place in the fiscal side. So, there are tax increases rather than decreases. We had a short period where that was going on, but that's been reversed when we changed our prime minister just recently, for the third time, which is really quite interesting.So, what has been going on as a result of this upheaval that we saw in the markets when we had a bit of an unstable political situation is that this government right now is increasing taxes and, also, of course, interest rates are going up. So, we have a double hit to the economy. Quite a lot of other countries are not doing that, so I think we are one exception really by comparison to what is going on elsewhere. And that is hitting, consumers and of course serious concern about public spending cuts that may be happening over which the number of people are beginning to protest as well. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
