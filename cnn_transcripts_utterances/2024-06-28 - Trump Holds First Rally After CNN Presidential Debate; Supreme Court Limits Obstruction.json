Remember why Donald Trump thinks that last night was a win? It is not just about President Biden's performance, it is actually also about his own. Donald Trump is often not out there staying on message. What his team had told him to do was to go and focus on policy, to not get into the personal attacks, and that aggressive almost badgering that we saw in 2020 during that debate with Joe Biden. So it is very interesting to see now, he appears to actually trying to stay on this path. Obviously, with Donald Trump that could change at any time, but he is heeding the advice of the people around him that in order to win this election, he needs to try and stay on message.",

Thank you. Voters in France head to the polls this weekend on the first round of parliamentary elections on Sunday, the second round takes place the following week, July the 7th. Now, a candidate needs to get more than 50 percent of the vote to win outright in the first round; if no one wins a majority, and that is not expected, then those would 12.5 percent of the vote advance to round two. Some may drop out to give allies a better chance of victory. Whoever gets the most votes in the second round wins. The issue here, the far right in France has been gaining momentum in recent weeks. Our Paris correspondent is Melissa Bell and brings us this report from Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It was for France's national rally, a historic win. The European elections marked the first time the hard-right had won a poll nationally. Now, the party is campaigning for seats in France's Parliament and a shot at government. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Paris was long demonized, but that's the work that Marine Le Pen and her team have managed to do, to show that we are a party capable of governing and a party that is democratic. BELL (voice over): No mean feat for a woman who inherited the party from her father, the Holocaust denier Jean-Marie Le Pen who founded the National Rally or National Front as it was known, with former French members, with Hitler's SS, a history steeped in fascism that was credited with long keeping the party from power, even when it got close. France is a country after all, heavily marked by the horrors of Nazi Germany. BELL (on camera): Amongst those atrocities, what happened here at Oradour- sur-Glane 80 years ago when an entire village was rounded up by the SS and killed in cold blood. BELL (voice over): The village, frozen in time, left exactly as it was on that fateful day 80 years ago in order for the world to remember. But in the new village, rebuilt after the war, the European elections saw the National Rally comes first here, too. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Yes, the National Rally did a big score like in other rural communities. Times have changed. The means of communication are no longer the same. Societal issues have evolved, too, and there has been a detoxification of the extremes of the far right? BELL (voice over): The key also for the National Rally, the young who voted massively in favor of a party that few in the past would have admitted voting for, but that has now gained something that long eluded it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Legitimacy, that's it. We are no longer ostracized, we are taken seriously. They said that 30 percent of French voted for us. French people who loved the country, who don't want to see change and get eaten by globalization. BELL (voice over): A message that looks set to resonate in a parliamentary poll that could see the National Rally gain not just legitimacy, but power itself. Melissa Bell, CNN, Oradour-sur-Glane.
