Hamas rockets continue to be fired toward Israel and the civilian toll of - the death toll is coming into greater view. The toll of horror and atrocity is coming into view.The Israeli prime minister's office has confirmed that soldiers discovered, Israeli soldiers discovered decapitated babies in Kfar Aza. We heard about this for the first time yesterday. That was cited as one of the worst Hamas attacks over the weekend. Hamas denies it attacked children, but the unprecedented slaughter of hundreds of Israeli civilians has led to a fierce response. And we know children have been killed in many locations here in Israel by Hamas. Air strikes have pounded Hamas targets in Gaza for days. Gaza's only power station is inoperable and hospitals are running out of fuel to power generators as the territory remains under a blockade. Among those dead in Gaza at least 11 U.N. workers. Right now, there are behind-the-scenes talks underway, as we talked about in our last hour, on a number of fronts. One, to try and free and locate dozens of hostages held by Hamas, including Americans. We don't know how many Americans. And to allow somehow civilians and U.S. citizens to leave Gaza through Egypt ahead of a potential Israeli ground operation. Those talks are underway. We don't know how they will resolve. CNN's Nic Robertson is posted in Sderot, Israel, for us. Nic, in our last hour, there were - we saw Iron Dome interceptor rockets going up to knock out rockets coming from Gaza and there was firefighting on the ground. Talk about what has been going on.",

These are those big - they're big like tank- like vehicles, huge, heavy, massive tracks, but the gun on the front of them, unlike a tank, the gun can go up really high.And what that means is it can fire so much further. So these heavy artillery guns, the defense forces can really range them over a large part of Gaza with a high degree of accuracy. And again, I think what we understand is they're being used to take out, try to take out or prevent the use of some of the launch sites.

Do you have a sense at this stage of, I mean, she was saying out of 300 or 400 people who lived in near Oz before Saturday, about one fourth of them have been killed in this attack. Is that - are those kind of the numbers you are hearing as well? LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Yes, hello. Thank you for having me on. Those are unfortunately also the numbers that I have. It varies from community to community.

But I can say that I think they have signed something close to their own death warrant and an Israeli general said the - in just a few hours after the attack started and we understood what they were doing, he said that Hamas has opened the floodgates of hell on Gaza. And I think that is - it's proportionate because what Hamas has done is an unprecedented level of brutality, something that Israel has never seen and I don't think that any other sovereign country has seen this level of brutality, definitely not a western democracy. So what Hamas has done is beyond a comparison to anything else. We are going to deal with it and it will be our job to make sure that Hamas will never ever have the ability to do this again.",

Steve Scalise can only afford to lose four Republican votes, already more than four, saying that either they're not going to vote for him or they're not willing to vote for him. So it shows you how Scalise will have to get some of those members in line.But in a key step, Jim Jordan, who he ran against for the speakership in that closed door meeting this afternoon, has indicated that he will nominate Steve Scalise for speaker and is trying to encourage his supporters also to vote for Scalise on the floor. But as you can hear there, Boris, from one of his supporters there, Marjorie Taylor Greene, simply not willing to vote for Steve Scalise, others not willing as well. And one Republican member also told me that Steve Scalise will never get the 217 votes to be elected speaker. So we'll see if that prediction bears out, but shows you the work ahead and also points to the challenge that Kevin McCarthy had, keeping his conference in line, ensuring he can limit those defections and those defections ultimately pushing him out of the speakership. Can Scalise avoid all those traps in the days ahead? Big question for him as he tries to become the next Speaker of the House. Boris?

But this is a significant comment that she's making, given the fact that he has virtually no margin for error if he wants to be elected Speaker of the House. And if she does not come off that position, if others don't as well, he could have a math problem on the floor, much like Kevin McCarthy did.

So I think that continues to this day. There isn't really a whole lot they tell you in those meetings that you didn't already know or you didn't suspect. I've - I'm always disappointed in our State Department and their abilities and they did not disappoint me in that regard at all this time. I'm still disappointed in their abilities and their grasp on world issues and the people that we allow to make these decisions, and that they try to legislate from behind a desk, and they're not legislators. They don't have a vote, so - and I'm not worried about Israel, because they're on auto check to get about $3.4 billion from America.The President did the right thing. He sent the Gerald R. Ford, the largest carrier, I guess, in the world, maybe sending more, and that shows a huge amount of support, and he can free up aid if he sees fit, just like he did for Ukraine without congressional support. And really, Congress is going to write a strong resolution, and I don't know that Hamas would actually read that. So unless we declare war or there's some additional aid that I don't know about that isn't on auto check, I think they're going to be just fine and they probably would like America to mind our own business and let them handle it. And I think they're getting - as I stated before, you're going to see some very Old Testament kind of judgment come down on a lot of mean people and they deserve it. Killing babies, that reminds me of my dad telling me about the Second World War and the Japanese and Nanjing, China in I think '38 and just what they did to those poor civilians on Okinawa.
