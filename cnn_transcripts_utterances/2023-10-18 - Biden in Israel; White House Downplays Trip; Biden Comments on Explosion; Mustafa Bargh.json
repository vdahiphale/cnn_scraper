We do know a lot of people are dead, hundreds of people. No yet firm number. But it is heartbreaking and horrible. And there was horrible injury and death after that blast. And so many of those people, people who had sought refuge. That is the reality of the situation.And that blast is also sparking mass anti-Israel protests across the Middle East today, starting last night in Jordan, and continuing through the day today. In Jordan, local security forces were seen using tear gas to try to disperse huge crowds near the Israeli embassy in Amman. And I want to go to our own Nada Bashir, who is in Amman, Jordan, with more. And, Neda, I want to just - you know, the context here, of course, is that the president of the United States was going to be going there, right? And it gives people the context of what happened when this hospital strike occurred, that immediate outpouring in the street in a city where the president was going to go. The anger is -- has boiled over.",

So, obviously, the White House now downplaying expectations for the trip, but it is clear they had hoped for much more. That's the reality. They thought they were getting to talk to Arab states, as well as the Jewish state, but that's not happening. What do you think the number one thing is that Biden has to accomplish today given the reality of the changed schedule of this trip?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think with the -- all the deaths at the hospital overnight, the stakes, obviously, went up almost when President Biden was in the air and the fact that his meetings with the Egyptian president, the king of Jordan, the Palestinian Authority president, that was canceled is clearly -- undermines some of what he wanted to achieve. But the big thing that he wanted to achieve was to send a very clear and strong message, as he has since the beginning, that the United States stands with Israel. And that was a message that was designed to signal to Israel's enemies in the region, be they Hezbollah, be they - be they elements in Syria, be they the Iranian leadership, whoever they are, to stay out of the fight. That's been the verbal message and that was - that was the importance of his message here.And I think because of what happened in the hospital last night, and the perceptions around it, that message is needed even more loudly. And that's the one that President Biden has delivered here, very publicly, standing with Prime Minister Netanyahu. There's another sort of important part of the context I think when we consider the reaction. The reaction on the streets around the region is a worry for Israel, but it will be a worry for the king of Jordan. It will be a worry for the president of Egypt, because outrage support of Palestinians on their streets is destabilizing for them. And these are both two countries, two leaders who depend very heavily on financial support from the United States. And, in a way, their populations know that, but ignore it. But it puts them in a difficult position as well when they have to choose the steps that they take, there is the reaction on the street in those countries and then there is what the political leaders do. And I think the bottom line that we've heard signaled from President Biden today is, last night was horrendous, horrific, everyone knows it, the pictures are just awful. However, it changes little in the calculus. Israel's enemies must hold back. And I think it still leaves a door open for what Israel wants to do in terms of taking on Hamas. And that's a critical point, which may very well be, it seems to me, that the possibility of a ground incursion remains an open option.",

The White House already downplaying expectations for the president's war zone visit. Let's get straight to our senior White House correspondent Kayla Tausche. The big question is what changed from when Biden left Washington, when the White House said they were continuing to investigate who launched what caused this blast, to what Biden saying with Netanyahu, saying, it appears it was done by the other team?

And without that face-to-face conversation, we know the president believes that phone and Zoom are no stand-ins for that personal diplomacy.

We've seen protests throughout the region. Certainly, a volatile moment in the wake of the explosion at the hospital. How would you describe how people are feeling, how they're reacting right now where you are? DR. MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI, PALESTINIAN LEGISLATOR: People are very angry, and, of course, nothing can be more embarrassing than a deliberate war crime of an Israeli air strike killing civilians and killing innocent children and women. Five hundred victims and hundreds of others injured who could die at any moment. And let me tell you that what we - what we believe is that we urge you to remember that the Israeli military lied to the world on many occasions before changing their stories many times. A very good example of that was their denial of killing Shireen -- the American Palestinian journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh, and changing their story four times. Today they already changed their story three times. But the world doesn't notice that. The first time they said that they strike the hospital because there were militants, Hamas militants hiding there. Then they said that Hamas is taking Palestinian civilians as shields, human shields. Then they said that it was jihad and it was a rocket of jihad. I do not believe any of this nonsense because there are many facts here. One fact is that 57 strikes have already taken place against health facilities, hospitals and clinics in Gaza. This cannot be denied. Another fact is that they warned the hospital, the Baptist hospital, run by the Anglican Church, they warned them that they should leave and evacuate. And they couldn't do that because they couldn't leave their patients to die. They also attacked and killed no less than 18 Palestinian first aid providers. They also destroyed 23 ambulances with their air strikes.",
