Right now, it's moving generally in a Westerly direction, well North of the Leeward Islands, and North of Puerto Rico.But look at day four and day five. This cone of uncertainty from the National Hurricane Center expands considerably, because we expect this forward movement of the storm to slow down significantly. So why this cone of uncertainty? Why do we have so much uncertainty going forward in that turn and the strength as we look towards day four and five? We have to look at how the National Hurricane Center operates. Its cone, it actually builds out these circles with this cone of uncertainty. Five days out, they know their average error spread. That was roughly about 230 miles either direction. So that means as you go forward in time, the spread and error possibilities increases. And in fact, if you look outside of five days, the spaghetti model we often show on TV, just the general consensus, it goes out in all directions, kind of fans out. And that shows you the uncertainty that we have currently with Lee. Because we just don't know when it will make that turn. But there are a few factors we're paying close attention to. And that is it will be moving over cooler water, so it will be a weaker storm once it approaches that part of the Western Atlantic. But one thing is for sure. It is a powerful monster that is currently in beast mode. It is the strongest storm in the Atlantic basin since 2019 with Hurricane Dorian. And it has more than double the criteria for rapid intensification. So at the very least, Poppy, we will see large swells and large waves along the Atlantic Seaboard starting Sunday right through next week. But this thing literally blew up overnight.",

MURRAY: You know, it's hard to say if he is going to have a stronger chance than Mark Meadows or not. On the one hand, Donald Trump is the ultimate federal official, right, because he was the former president of the United States. But Mark Meadows can, you know, essentially say anything he was doing, he was doing because he needed to offer his advice to the former president. And that's one of the things that his attorneys argued when they went before this judge. I think what we saw from Donald Trump's team and his attorney, Steven Sadow, yesterday is sort of preserving the opportunity to move to federal court, while sort of hedging and waiting to see how this plays out for Mark Meadows. They didn't put forward their fulsome arguments before a federal court for why they think Trump should maybe move there.

Now, I talked to a number of Trump advisers who pushed back at this notion that he's not helping the former mayor and his long-time ally, pointing to these fundraisers. Also pointing to the fact that, at one point, the Save America PAC, the leadership PAC that pays legal bills, did pay about $300,000 in Giuliani's debts. But as you noted, again, millions of dollars in legal debt. And even if he was able to raise from this fundraiser more than a million dollars, there's still a long way to go.

And you know, typically these spending fights, as you guys well know, is Democrats versus Republicans. This time, much different. It's Republicans versus Republicans, in a large part Senate Republicans vs. House Republicans. There, of course, is the end of the month deadline here. And there are two big things that are hanging that are -- that are making things very complicated. One is how to fund the government at large, the entire federal government for the full year. Earlier this year, Senate Republicans and House Republicans and the Democrats all thought they had a deal on overall spending levels for the government. Then Kevin McCarthy backed away from that deal that he cut as part of raising the national debt limit because of pressure from his conservative hardliners to cut spending even more. So now, as a result, the House and the Senate Republicans and the two chambers are about $150 billion apart in overall spending. Now, they're not going to be able to resolve that by the end of the month. So they've to figure out a way to keep the government open, at least for a couple more months, to avoid a disastrous shutdown. Now, that's where things also get complicated, because even that short-term stopgap bill is unclear how they get that done. In large part, because of that $24 billion in aid to Ukraine. The White House, along with Senate Republicans for the most part, want to include all of that in that short-term stopgap bill. Kevin McCarthy is suggesting that they could separate that out and just pass the stopgap bill. But that's not going over well with some Senate Republicans, including Senator Thom Tillis. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC): The deal we thought was going to be the foundation for funding the government, now we have to understand what the House members need and whether or not we can get sufficient votes in the Senate for it. I think right now, they need to get to the table and negotiate. If there is a lapse in the Western world support for Ukraine, that's a win for Russia; it's a win for China. SEN.
