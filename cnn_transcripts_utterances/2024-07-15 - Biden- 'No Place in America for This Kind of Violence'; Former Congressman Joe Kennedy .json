A live look at the Fiserv Forum, the home of the Republican National Convention, where later on this week, Donald Trump will accept the Republican nomination for president of the United States. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It is wonderful to have you with us as we, as a nation, are grappling with something awful. A candidate, a convention, and a campaign all fundamentally shaken by a senseless act of violence. Donald Trump will wake up this morning here in Milwaukee for the opening of the Republican National Convention. And for the third time, Donald Trump will become the Republican presidential nominee, less than two days after he narrowly escaped death.

      "sentences": "That's right. I think this is a foreboding moment for the country. Things can go a number of ways.The trauma of an assassination attempt against a presidential candidate is something that we haven't had to deal with for 40 years or so. None of us, obviously, remember the -- the trauma of the 1960s, the political assassinations. But I think I'm beginning to understand a little bit now about how that throws the country off its axis and opens potential paths to a dark future. I think the -- the most important line of the president's speech from the Oval Office last night was when he talked about how the founders provided a framework for reason to triumph over brute force. I think that's the choice now before the country. A lot is going to depend on its leaders. In particular, how former President Trump responds to this moment. He's at a crossroads, personally, politically, in his life. And the country is looking for stability and not a path that begets more violence. And I think that is the backdrop of this convention right now. HUNT: The reality, Shane, is that Donald Trump does have a chance to unify the country. He said so himself in some of these -- and he did these two interviews, \"The Washington Examiner\" and \"The New York Post.\" There are going to be people now who are going to be willing to watch his speech at the RNC, who maybe weren't watching it before. And, you know, Peggy Noonan wrote about that moment, as well, for him. That became an iconic photo. She says this, quote: \"When they trundled him off, and he threw up his fist, pumped it at the crowd and shouted, 'Fight,' my relatives\" -- she's called a relative to talk about it. The relatives says, \"'Well, that's over,' meaning the election, meaning you don't give America an image like that and go on to lose. You give America an image like that, and it enters political mythology forever. It was epic.\" She writes, \"Whatever you feel about and whatever your stand, grant him one of the greatest gangsta [SIC] moves of American political history.\" She then goes on to call a journalist to talk about, about President Biden. But the reality is, I mean, this is a remarkable political moment for so many reasons. SHANE GOLDMACHER, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Yes. I think we're going to learn a lot about Trump even before he takes the stage this week. And we are going to see what kind of convention he's going to hold. And they've said it's going on as usual, but there are definitely going to be some changes here. And you've seen just in the rhetoric that he's taken, the fundraising messages that he's sent out, he's using the word \"unity.\" This is not a word that has defined the Trump 2024 campaign. He's running on a whole set of different issues, but unity certainly hasn't been one of them. And so, it's a real question, what -- what he's going to do this week. Because that's not -- that has not been the tenor of the Trump candidacy. Right? He has been a divisive figure since his emergence on the national stage, and he has painted a dark picture of America. And so, he has a chance as people are going to be looking at it, renewed, to change that picture a little bit. I think it's really interesting to see just how many times Joe Biden has come out in the last two days to speak to the country about this. He spoke in Delaware that evening. He spoke again from the White House in the middle of the day, and he doesn't give a lot of Oval Office addresses, and he did so again on Sunday night.",

I will say he didn't shy away in his address last night from saying he's going to continue to contrast his plan for the future with Donald Trump's plan for the future.

One thing that -- you know, I think that is different from some of the eras that -- that Bakari Sellers was referencing. Yes. Voters remember Martin Luther King. But the speed with which information moves in our era, the fragmentation of the way people think about it. And the \"Wall Street\" editorial -- \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial board has -- has a message out this morning that I thought was interesting coming from them. I think it's also correct. They write, \"You'd like to thank members of Congress know enough to not indulge in conspiracy theories without evidence, but then democracy doesn't always produce the brightest bulbs.\" OK. \"The latest, though, to meet the public's lowest expectation for our supposed leaders is Rep. Mike Collins, a Republican from Georgia's 10th District, who sent a tweet on Saturday that Joe Biden sent the orders. It is hard to imagine a more incendiary message in the wake of an assassination attempt.\" And he goes on -- they go on to say, \"It's hard to imagine more incendiary -- Mr. Collins was retweeting and amplifying a tweet that quoted President Biden's remark last week, 'I have one job. That's to beat Donald Trump.' And he, of course, used the word 'bulls-eye.' Mr. Biden,\" \"The Journal\" says, \"was employing a metaphor, however inept given our political -- current, political distemper. He wasn't giving orders to anyone to shoot Mr. Trump. And if he wanted to do so, he wouldn't do it in public. Mr. Collins is among those who think Mr. Biden lacks the mental acuity to be president, but then he accuses him of masterminding a conspiracy.\" Now they also go on to say, people on the left also should not engage in political conspiracies.

And what I can say is, over the last several days and particularly, well, the last 48 hours, we have seen a completely new convention platform, right?And the direction that came down from Trump is, this is his convention. So that kind of speak (ph) from Mike Collins is not -- hopefully is not what we're going to see on the stage over the next four days. The scripts are being written as we speak. They've been thrown out and redone. And folks are going to get onstage, and they're going to talk about unity. They're going to talk about the vision that Trump has moving forward. And I think Trump's talks yesterday or his interviews yesterday set the stage for, hopefully, what we'll see for the next three, four months, right? I don't think you're going to see a lot of the Mike Collins type rhetoric that comes out there. Or if you do, you're going to have a lot of folks tamping it down and dismissing -- dismissing it. Whereas two weeks ago, you may not have. MATT GORMAN, FORMER ADVISOR TO TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: I think it's a rare moment where each Biden and Trump, it's their -- both of their political interests to do what they're doing right now. Biden being the kind of consoler, if you will, having the national leadership role, consolidating his part on the -- as the left, the Democratic nominee, which is -- was in doubt for quite a while now. And for Trump, who's winning this race, ostensibly, being the uniter. You don't have to throw a hail Marys. You're up three or so points nationally in a lot of swing states. You can be a little bit more conciliatory.",

And you mentioned the lessons that we, as a country, learned throughout that period in history.

I'm not sure that the sympathy vote that individuals think exists in this country actually does. But even more so, when we're having these discussions about how we move forward, I'm not sure that looking to Washington, D.C., I was listening to that -- you recall and recite \"The Wall Street Journal: op-ed piece. I'm not sure looking to \"Wall Street\" -- to Washington, D.C., or to state capitals is where you should actually look. Most of this leadership is going to come from within our own communities. It's going to come from the barbers and the beauticians. It's going to come from the people who pick up your trash, the teachers of the day. Because we realized that there is no world where we take lessons from people like J.D. Vance, who tweeted just nonsense yesterday. Or Marjorie Taylor Greene, who did the same thing. Or Mark Robinson, who's speaking at the RNC, who said that people really need to be killed sometimes. And so, I would ask viewers, particularly during this moment, to find that leadership within yourself, to find that love within yourself, to find that light within yourself. Because if you're looking to pick it up from those individuals you see on TV or Washington, D.C., or whatever state capital you may reside in, my fear is that we'll continue to go down this path of disdain.

He identified a few different issues where there is discourse in this -- in this country about different issues are clearly defined lines that folks on the Republican side and Democratic side have disagreed.
