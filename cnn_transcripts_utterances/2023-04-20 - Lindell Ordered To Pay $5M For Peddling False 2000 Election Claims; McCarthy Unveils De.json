The White House is not budging in the ongoing game of chicken over this nation's debt limit.President Biden has rejected House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's new proposal to raise the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion, but in exchange for, really, a demand for big spending cuts desired by Republicans. The White House -- and we should note, many leading economists, argue that the full faith and credit of the United States should never be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations such as this. That's because a default could trigger a slew of economic troubles in this country and around the world. a recession, potentially, a downgrade of the nation's debt, job losses, federal workers losing crucial benefits. It is also worth noting the facts here, that the debt ceiling has been raised 78 times by Congress, 29 times under a Democratic president, 49 times, nearly twice as much, under a Republican president. That includes three times under former President Trump. President Biden so far has raised the debt ceiling just once. CNN's Manu Raju, he's at Capitol Hill. So, Manu, we know the White House, they're refusing to negotiate on this. They feel they shouldn't have to negotiate with the nation's credit kind of being held over their heads here. But we also know some Republicans are not on board for this plan. So where does it stand? Is it dead on arrival?",

Meaning, he cannot lose more than four Republican votes on this plan, which has been negotiated behind the scenes for months, was revealed yesterday. It would raise the national debt limit by $1.5 trillion or by next March, whatever comes first. [13:35:07] And also through the range of spending costs and also Republican priorities, including blocking Biden student loan forgiveness plan. That's one element of this proposal. In addition, it would impose new work requirements for the Medicaid program and other social welfare programs. Also it would kill new IRS funding that is -- was part of the Inflation Reduction Act that Democrats passed along party lines in the last Congress. And also clawing back already enacted relief aid for the Covid 19 pandemic. It also proposes a slew of cuts across the board on domestic programs as well. Democrats call these cuts draconian and don't want this part of any sort of debt limit discussion. But Republicans I talked to today still are not sold on this idea, and some are not certain they're going to vote for it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

A ruling on the most widely used method of abortion, specifically on the most widely used abortion pill, Mifepristone, could come at any time between now and midnight tomorrow.The justices extended their self-imposed deadline yesterday while we were on the air. And what that did was, it gave them more time to decide if this drug that's been used by millions of women to terminate pregnancies but also to treat miscarriages since it was approved in 2000, should stay on the market here in the U.S. The battle over the abortion pill comes after a Texas judge abruptly revoked the FDA approval of the medication. Joining us now to talk more about this is Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal of Washington state. She is the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Thank you so much for taking time to be with us today. I just want to ask you, if the Supreme Court does allow restrictions on this pill to go into effect, what can you do? And what, if anything, will be done? Do you or -- pardon me? What, if anything, will you be wishing Congress had done when Democrats had the majority? REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Well, Brianna, it's great to see you. I mean, I think in terms of what Democrats have done, we did our job in the House. We passed the Women's Health Protection Act that codified abortion rights. We actually passed it a couple of times. But as you know, it ran into the filibuster in the Senate. This ridiculous idea that 40 Senators get to block something that the majority of the country wants. So we were never able to finish it and pass it in the Senate. And so this is a really difficult time. If the Supreme Court rules in a way that restricts Mifepristone, it would have enormous consequences for women across the country. It's why some states, including my governor, has already stockpiled some supplies of Mifepristone, so that, for a couple of years, we will be able to continue to provide for our residents in Washington state and those who come into the state. But it is going to be a massive problem for people across the country. And it's going to throw our entire FDA process into chaos, which I think people don't understand. That means that your cancer drug at any time could be revoked. If somebody suddenly decides they don't like it, or your diabetes drug or whatever it is. And it means that actually getting companies to invest in drug therapies, knowing that when the FDA goes through a scientific process, it is done and nobody is going to challenge it, I think is going to become more difficult, too. So it would be a terrible ruling. And I'm really hoping that the Supreme Court doesn't go there.",

So we are going to continue to work to get the majority that we need that we can do that in the Senate. And at the same time, I think you're seeing states pushing back. I mean, look at the result of the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. Americans, Republicans, Independents and Democrats are saying we do not want abortion banned in our state. We do not want a Supreme Court justice in our bedrooms telling us what to do or some Texas judge in our bedroom, telling us what to do. And I wish that the Republican Party would listen to their own constituents. People across this country understand and what abortion to be safe and legal.",

And what Republicans are trying to do is putting forward a plan that is cruel, extreme and unworkable, that would hold the American people hostage. It would create millions of lost jobs. It would create, you know, millions of dollars of lost pensions. It would cut some of the basic safety net services that Americans depend on. And so I think we have to just be clear that if you want to have a discussion about the budget, then we should have a discussion about the budget as part of the appropriations process. But first, we need to have a clean debt ceiling raise. That is what Democratic and Republicans have done in the past. And this is -- this is really unbelievably irresponsible. Secondly, if you want to talk about appropriations, I mean, I'm just going to point out that the first bill Republicans passed was to take away the money that we gave to the IRS to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. Instead they want to take away money from regular Americans. So I think this is the -- you know, this is what we're going to have to discuss.
