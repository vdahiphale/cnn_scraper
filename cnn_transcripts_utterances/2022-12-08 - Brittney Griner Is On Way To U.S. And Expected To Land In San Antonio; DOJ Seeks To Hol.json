You know, you work tirelessly also to use this platform to highlight stories that needed to be told and it's been a long road, but I am -- I woke up in tears this morning as many other people did. I was just so thrilled and relieved to hear that BG was coming home. We are incredibly grateful to President Biden and the entire Biden- Harris administration for their work to get BG home, and on behalf of all the players. You know, we as women athletes, we do our best to stick together. When we move, we don't leave anyone behind, and we work with intention.

But she remains resilient and her courage and integrity. And hopefully also the joy that's being expressed overwhelmingly for BG's return will also be a part of the reason why we continue to highlight why the next Americans need to come home. That's something that we've always prided ourselves on. The WNBC is -- we learned through experience. We come ready because we link arms. We may not always know exactly what to do, but we lean on the experts, we lean on those like you who give us platforms for us to educate ourselves, to do better for everyone. And we're hoping that in support of BG that we can continue to advocate for the return of all Americans because that is the first priority. Using Americans as hostages -- what type of social status they have is not right. It is a moral issue. And we have to focus on that as opposed to reasons why some or others shouldn't come.
