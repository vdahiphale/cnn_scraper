And the whole point of this speech was to really drive home his message on the economy.Now, when I talked to Donald Trump's senior advisers, they said that was really the goal for this entire week, that they wanted him to really drive a contrast between his economic policy and that which of his record when he was in office and compare that to what Harris is going to propose on Friday in North Carolina. Now, he had a series of props around him, a bunch of different groceries. And really, the point for him was to try and argue that Kamala Harris is responsible for the crunch that many Americans are feeling on their wallets. They also want to tie her to the Biden administration's economic policy. Part of that is because they know that Donald Trump pulled higher than Joe Biden when it came to that issue, and they believe that is a winning issue for him in November. Now, it was really interesting because Donald Trump really stuck to the script. He brought out a binder with him for these remarks. He put it on the podium and then he read it line by line. However, once he started taking questions from the from the press, that restraint went out the window. And you really saw Donald Trump revert back to his well-worn playbook. I asked him specifically, you know, you have a lot of allies who are pressuring you both privately and publicly to stop with the personal attacks on Kamala Harris and focus on a more disciplined message, particularly when it comes to the issues like the economy, but also immigration and crime.

But there is hope, I would be loath to say optimism, but there is hope that this time perhaps they could get things over the line. And certainly we kind of know where we stand. We know the pressure isperhaps greater than it has ever been at any point in the past nine months to try to get a deal, mainly because there is the hope that if a deal is done, it could forestall an expected attack by Iran and or its proxy Hezbollah for the assassination of Hezbollah's top military commander in Beirut and the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's political bureau, who was assassinated in a guest house in Tehran. Now, we heard from Hamas's political bureau on Thursday stating where its position was, and it says that an agreement in its words, must achieve a comprehensive ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from Gaza of Israeli forces, the return of displaced persons, reconstruction in addition to a prisoner exchange deal in exchange for the release of hostages who were kidnapped on October the 7th. Israel, for its part, has got a few conditions of its own, and this, according to a regional diplomat, is where some of the stumbling blocks lie, namely that Israel doesn't -- Israel wants to have the ability to screen Palestinians moving north to the Gaza Strip to prevent armed men from moving north and then reconstituting themselves as a fighting force. It wants to have a veto over the identities of some of the Palestinian prisoners being released in exchange for Israeli hostages. And it also wants to maintain control of the so-called Philadelphia corridor between Rafah in the south of Gaza and the Egyptian border, because Israel sees that as the kind of main conduit for weapons and other materials that go towards supporting Hamas. On top of that, Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly said that the war will not end until there is, in his words, total victory, something that his own defense minister publicly described as total nonsense. So there's obviously divisions within the Israeli side, but the Israelis are there in Doha. Hamas is not, but it's speaking with the Egyptian and Qatari mediators. And I suppose another reason why there may be a window of opportunity right now is that Israel's parliament or Knesset is on recess until October. And that means that Netanyahu's far-right coalition members who have threatened to bolt the coalition if Netanyahu signs a ceasefire agreement, they may not be able to recall parliament to hold some kind of no confidence vote to bring down the government in this window. And that could, of course, give Netanyahu time to placate them in some way to prevent them from bolting the coalition. So that's another reason, Kim, why right now, although it may not be now or never, is certainly seen as the best chance of getting some kind of ceasefire agreement than there has been at any point in the past nine months.",

It's also remarkable the freedom with which the Ukrainian military are moving around here. They simply aren't afraid of the drones that have hampered their every move for the past months. That says the border service of the FSB, the Russian security services of Russia. There's a bullet hole above the rules and bullet holes in the rules themselves. Now, this is what's so startling about this offensive, the volume of Western supplied armor that we're seeing passing back and forth. Their passage through here, up into Russia, unimpeded in time.

And you get a real sense of the euphoria. But ultimately, too, the enduring question is, what is all this for? What is the end game? Yes, it's a huge embarrassment for Vladimir Putin, but they're sending some of their best equipment deep into Russia. And I'm sure in the back of the minds of these troops is the question of what ultimately are we going to achieve? And we still don't know the answer to that. Ukraine has also said that they've had an extraordinary number of prisoners of war that they've captured as they advance, particularly into one Russian military base, saying that they captured in one day alone 102 replenishing what they refer to as the exchange funds that they're going to use these Russian prisoners to exchange them for Ukrainians caught by Russia. A remarkable development, though. You saw at that border the confidence and the ease in which Ukrainian forces are pushing up into Russia. And I've got to tell you, after all the months of seeing drones holding Ukraine back, the fact that they're not a threat suggests some extraordinary technological advantage, frankly, on the battlefield.
