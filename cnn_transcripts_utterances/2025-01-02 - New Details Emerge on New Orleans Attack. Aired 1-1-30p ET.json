Boris Sanchez is on assignment.And we are following breaking developments out of New Orleans, where we're getting some new details from federal and local officials about their investigation into the deadly New Year's Day terror attack. The FBI says it now believes the Army veteran from Texas who they say intentionally plowed a truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street acted alone, 14 people killed in this, among the victims, Kareem Badawi, a student at the University of Alabama, also 27-year-old Tiger Bech, a Lafayette, Louisiana, native and former Princeton football player. And we're also learning that Hubert Gauthreaux lost his life, along with 37-year-old Reggie Hunter. He was a father from Baton Rouge who wished his family happy new year moments after midnight in a text to their group chat that would be among the last that he sent. Hunter's cousin spoke to CNN earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I received a call yesterday morning around 6:26 from his sister saying that her brother was involved in the incident that took place on Bourbon Street yesterday early morning. And we immediately rushed to the hospital in New Orleans to meet her there to see exactly what had taken place in and what was his status. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That had been a concern because of the other explosive devices that had been found. The FBI confirmed, they say two explosive devices were found, one about two blocks actually from where I'm standing in that direction. The attack actually ended about several blocks down in that direction. We're just overlooking Bourbon Street now. We expect Bourbon Street actually to reopen officially about 2.5 hours from now, though there may be some sort of opening ceremony shortly. We will obviously bring that to you when we can. But the headline coming out of that press conference is -- as we were talking about, is that the FBI says they believe this man acted alone. They have pored over all of his posts that he made on the -- New Year's Eve as he was driving to New Orleans from Houston, where he picked up that vehicle on the previous day, on December 30, according to the FBI. They said he made a number of statements in those videos. But I just want to play a little bit of what we heard from the FBI a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But this is a city used to hosting multiple events going on, large- scale events. There are -- according to the FBI, they said that there were as many as 1,000 -- I believe it was the governor -- said there's many as 1,000 law enforcement agents, officers working on this investigation trying to follow all the clues, all the leads that may be coming in. And then they also have a very large security operation involving hundreds of law enforcement personnel to provide security for the game that's going to be taking place. There's more than 50 bomb-detecting dogs, according to authorities, around the Superdome. So they're really trying not to take any chances. And, obviously, the issue of upgrading security at live events in New Orleans and probably in a lot of places throughout the country is very much on the topic for officials here and elsewhere.",

And the thing that I don't understand is, if he went through all the -- all the problem -- or all the -- he went through all the trouble to have the bombs made, put them in his vehicle, load them up and drive to New Orleans. Why would he use his vehicle as a weapon, and not even attempt to place the bombs or set them off or whatever? It's almost as if he didn't want to use them. I don't know. I'm not in his head.

Whatever happened with the FBI, they got sort of strong-armed by whatever this political narrative is. People want these attacks to reflect their beliefs and the way the world is. And we have to follow the facts to be able to protect the American public. And what never made sense out of yesterday, as you will remember, is, how are you having a Sugar Bowl tonight and telling people there might be a bunch of people out there trying to kill them? It always seemed to me that the idea that there were co-conspirators was probably not true, that we would be able to get to a lone wolf story. Of course, there's an ISIS connection. He has -- he felt like he was part of this group, but there's something very different for safety and security purposes between ISIS-directed and ISIS group and some guy who wakes up a couple months ago and wants meaning out of his violence. And we have to -- we have to understand that, because the American public is facing very different risks based on that. The FBI, I will say, also came in strong today, brought in someone from D.C. to -- essentially took over the communication strategy and is getting this thing right-sized, because the narrative is -- got out of hand.",

He said that, when Sham, as they called him, Shamsud-Din, went into the Army and he went into the Air Force, they ended up getting back in touch about five or six years ago. And what he thought was interesting was that the conversation the part of his friend would always come back to his Muslim faith, but he also felt that it was a very respectful conversation. So talk to us a little bit about how this happens, because there is sometimes a formula to how someone can be radicalized. What do you see here? MALCOLM NANCE, FORMER U.S. NAVAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER:  Well, there's definitely a formula. And we have actually experienced this over the last two decades to a very large extent. You might recall the radicalization of Major Nidal Hasan back in 2009 in Fort Hood, and who went in, an Army psychiatrist who shot his fellow service members to death after a short period of radicalization. The reason that we're surprised by this right now -- and Juliette made a very, very good point -- is that, are we seeing a self-starting, self-radicalized person who went back and decided to align himself with ISIS, or is this an ISIS-directed attack, where ISIS had its recruiters, the way they were doing in a very large scale back in 2014 through 2017, reaching out to people, finding people, Muslims who were having a very, very hard time in their personal lives, and giving them a new sense of meaning by making them the batal, as they say in Arabic, the hero, who will take positive action in their radicalized cultlike version of Islam? If it was directed, then we have an external problem that finds these disaffected young men, gives them this belief that they're going to be these heroes, and that they must do a positive act and then end in their own death. And they always do the same thing. They always make a video. They always make a will about their martyrdom, so that they can popularize the cause from ISIS. I really think that we're going to -- we're probably going to find that at some point he touched base with one of these martyrdom recruiters out there, and then went through the radicalization process himself. But he's very, very much like every other attacker that we had in the mid-2000s.",

We have found that those pathways are -- generally have been intercepted and that law enforcement has the ability to circumvent these people's radicalization. But when you have a self-starter who may have just been inspired by one conversation or a few texts, there's very little you can do, I mean, except see whether that snowball turns into an avalanche of him spouting his radicalized beliefs. This guy didn't until the actual last night of his attack. But he had to do a lot of logistics, get the weapons together, rent that vehicle, get these explosive devices together. But if it's going on in his head, it's very hard to stop a determined attacker. It's -- we really get them when they have links going out and try to get co- conspirators.",
