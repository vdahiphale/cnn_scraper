You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington. There's some live pictures now of the White House Rose Garden. Any minute, as I noted, President Biden will address the nation for the first time since his party's stinging defeat at the polls this week. Biden spoke with president-elect Donald Trump yesterday to congratulate him and invite him to the White House. The president's speech comes as Democrats grapple with the future of the party and as many of Kamala Harris' allies place some of the blame on Biden for not dropping out sooner, lots of finger-pointing here this morning. As we await the president's speech, I'm joined by Arlette Saenz, Alayna Treene, Jeff Zeleny and David Chalian. Arlette, I spoke to a source this morning who tells me President Biden's message is going to be pretty straightforward. Tell us more about what we're expecting to hear.",

      "sentences": "Well, Pam, this will be the first time President Biden is speaking publicly since voters decided to send Donald Trump back to the White House. He is expected to reflect on the election results and talk about the country coming together in this moment. But President Biden also will be talking about the transition. Advisers to Biden have insisted that he wants to ensure that there is a peaceful transfer of power.That is something that was not afforded to Biden back in 2020, when Trump had put up roadblocks through the transition process and did not concede this election. So President Biden yesterday did place that phone call to president-elect Trump to congratulate him and invite him here to the White House. Sources say that that meeting could potentially happen as early as next week. But one big question facing President Biden heading into this speech is whether he will address what went wrong for Democrats in this election. There's been a lot of soul-searching within the Democratic Party over the last 48 hours, a lot of questions about messaging and strategy. And many Democrats are placing the blame directly at President Biden's feet, as some have expressed concerned about the fact that even decided to seek reelection at the beginning and then, when he did drop out of this race, left the Democratic nominee with little time to mount their campaign against Trump. So these are all key pieces of the arguments within the Democratic Party right now. And they very well could shape how Biden is remembered going forward. But, today, he is facing this new reality that the man that he had defeated in 2020 will be returning to the White House today. And we will hear directly -- or next year -- and, today, we will hear directly from President Biden about how he feels about these election results and how the country should proceed going forward.",

We have no idea. All the evidence at the time suggested he didn't really have a path to defeat him if he had stayed the candidate. But we know from reporting that Joe Biden has often made the point to people around him that he is the only one that actually had defeated Donald Trump.

This too will now be a big part of Joe Biden's legacy. As Jeff said, his decision to run for reelection, despite his age and the concerns voters clearly had about it and do all systems go, rather than saying to his party, I'm going to pass the torch, I'm a one-term guy, and you guys have an open, engaged primary process to figure out the best path forward and have the whole party weigh in on that, he chose not to do that.

The answer on Tuesday was a resounding no. She is not able to jump that hurdle. That was too high of a hurdle, and it's not clear that any other Democrat could have done so.

But, first, Latino men delivered big for Donald Trump this election cycle, favoring the president-elect by double digits. Latino women still favored Kamala Harris, but by smaller margins than they supported Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. One Democratic lawmaker called the loss of Latino voters -- quote -- \"nothing short of catastrophic for the party.\" Let's bring in Republican Congressman Carlos Gimenez of Florida. Congressman, thank you for coming on. You are on the House Homeland Security Committee. As you well know, Trump has made any promises for a second term, one of them being mass deportations once he is back in the White House. Realistically, how do you see that taking shape, given the logistical and financial complexities at play with an operation like that? REP. CARLOS GIMENEZ (R-FL):  I agree it's going to be a very, very big task. And my hope is and I expect that we will just simply follow the law. We will probably have to hire many more additional hearing officers to give the folks that have come in under the Biden/Harris administration and the millions that have come in under the Biden administration their hearing in court, I mean, look, what's supposed to happen at the border is, if you come in seeking asylum, you're supposed to either be held in a third country or you're supposed to be held inside the United States. That didn't happen. And then you're supposed to get a hearing to determine whether your claim of asylum is actually valid. It turns out that about 80 percent of those claims are not valid and those people, those folks are deported back to their country. That's the way that it's supposed to happen. Everybody has due process here in the United States. And so I believe that that's the way it'll happen. We will have more hearings and it'll be done quicker. The people who get their hearing, those that are found to have not a valid claim will be deported back to their country and those that have a valid claim will be allowed to stay in the United States, because that's what the law says.",

      "speaker": "BROWN",
      "sentences": "So let's look at this a little bit deeper, because as you well know, this election, if anything, shows that voters have not been happy with inflation.And economists saying mass deportations could actually add to inflation and really hurt the economy, not to mention the cost here. The average cost of deporting just one person -- and this is from 2016 from ICE -- was $11,000. And you multiply that with what Trump is vowing to do, it's expensive. I know you are concerned about the deficit and where is money going to come from. What do you say to that, to that concern among economists about what this could do to the economy and to inflation?",

We just have to follow the law. If the current administration had just simply followed the law, we wouldn't be in this pickle. We wouldn't have millions and millions of immigrants that maybe did not really have a valid claim to enter the United States. You wouldn't have had that massing of people at the border, because, as soon as the Biden/Harris administration got -- they took power, everybody knew, hey, come on in, they want open borders, you can get in. Under Trump, that didn't happen. And so this is all -- that all falls at the feet of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And so, yes, we just have to follow the law. That's really what the American people want. That's what Hispanics want. We just want you to follow the law.",

Look, somebody born here in the United States, they have birthright citizenship, right? And so they're going to stay here. We will get to those issues as they come.

I didn't have that number at the ready, but my producer is just double-checking that.I do want to ask you, because Trump did get a ton more support among Latino voters. And I'm wondering why you think that is. I mean, as you know, a lot of his rhetoric on the campaign trail was demeaning and insulting illegal immigrants, right? Why do you think Latino men have really come to him in larger numbers this time around? GIMENEZ:  Look, President Trump was railing against and is against the criminals that were allowed to come into the United States through the immigrant criminals that are in the United States, one of them being Tren de Aragua, which is actually here in Miami too, all right? And so we have a lot of criminals that were allowed to come into the United States that should not have been allowed to come into the United States. That's what he's really against. We understand and I understand that many, the majority of the people coming through the border are just seeking a better life here in the United States. I do. I understand that very well. I'm an immigrant myself. We believe in legal immigration. That's what Hispanics believe in, like I believe most Americans believe in legal immigration. We don't believe in illegal immigration. Why are Hispanics going to the Democrat -- I mean, to the Republican Party? Well, because I think that -- I know that our values are more aligned with Hispanics than the Democrat Party. The Democrat Party is going way to the left, to the extreme left. Many of us came here fleeing communism, fleeing socialism, and we look at the Democrat Party getting closer and closer to socialism and that's being rejected. And so we're a party of faith. We're a party of family. We're a party of hard work. And Hispanic men and women are people of faith, people of hard work, people of family. And so, though -- our values are aligning, and so I look at it it's simply that the Hispanics are coming home to their natural home, which is the Republican Party.",
