      "sentences": "I'm Jim Sciutto, live from outside the Manhattan Criminal Court. Former Chief Executive of American Media DavidPecker, owner of course of the \"National Enquirer\", is on the stand right now in the case against former U.S. President Donald Trump. This is CNN's special coverage of the Hush Money trial. The testimony has resumed now on day two of Donald Trump's historic criminal trial in New York, and already there's been plenty of drama. Right now, former \"National Enquire\" publisher David Pecker is back on the stand. Prosecutors say Pecker helped Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign by killing negative stories about him and attacking his rivals. Earlier, a hearing was held to determine whether Trump should be held in contempt of court for, prosecutors allege, violating a gag order that prohibits him from publicly attacking witnesses and jurors. The judge repeatedly scolded Trump's attorneys, told them, quote, \"You're losing all credibility.\" He did not, however, immediately rule on that motion. On the left side of your screen, you will see key updates from the trial. There are no cameras allowed in the proceedings, but CNN does have reporters inside the court keeping us up to date on what's going on. Everything they see and hear is going to appear on that side panel. CNN's Brynn Gingras joins me now. And Brynn, I wonder if we could begin with the first events of the morning, which was a quite contentious hearing over whether Trump violated this gag order. Prosecutors allege he did so repeatedly, and the judge clearly was not entertaining any of the answers from prosecutors, sorry, from his defense attorneys very well. BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, the defense argument was essentially all these posts that are in question. He's trying -- the former president is trying to defend himself against other attacks that are coming at him. And the judge repeatedly asked the defense, well, show me those receipts, show me the text messages. What are you arguing against? And the defense really wasn't bringing anything up. And he said, I've been asking you eight or nine times to answer my question and you're not. And so, that's when it really did get contentious. And we really, you know, there really was no defense at that point by Trump's team.",

And, oh, by the way, the next day there was a jury member who was seated who said, I don't want to be on this jury anymore. So, that's a real threat.

They shared this -- Pecker had the \"National Enquirer,\" Trump was a celebrity who wanted attention. Boy, did they feed off of each other. Headlines and photographs and ratings from shows -- all sorts of things. He said they talked all the time. He is the one now who is describing in court how he agreed to be the eyes and ears of the campaign to suss out problematic stories out there. And more importantly, to exercise this catch and kill option, meaning when he saw a problematic story, for example, a woman who was saying, I had a relationship with Donald Trump, he would catch it by buying the exclusive rights to the story, and then he would kill it by putting it on the shelf where it could never be seen again. That is the role that he plays as the first prong in this attack, by establishing for the prosecution that as an old friend of Donald Trump's, he knew what was going on and this really was happening. Of course, second prong will be like Michael Cohen saying, yes, and there was this illegal activity and all that. Third prong will be the law saying, yeah, that is illegal. You can't do it. That's what they're trying to get to with the jury. But right now, this old friend, David Pecker, who Donald Trump worked with for years and years and years, is standing up there facing down his old friend and saying through his immunity deal, yeah, he did some things here.",

And then they also pointed to a post on Truth Social about jurors and the prosecutor said they were quite concerned about juror intimidation. The judge needed to make Donald Trump stop doing this and enforce the gag order by holding him in contempt, potentially fining him or making some other decision there. The judge had harsh questions for Donald Trump's counsel, Todd Blanch, saying at one point that he was losing credibility with the court because of the arguments that he was making and also trying to clarify exactly why Donald Trump was doing these things and that Trump himself was personally not just amplifying what others on the Internet were saying, but was typing quotes around things that he heard, such as on Fox News about the jury, accusing them on April 17th of being liberal activists, which did ultimately result in a lot of concern over the jury. And one juror after that post, we don't know if it was connected directly, but after that post, a juror said they were no longer uncomfortable. They had heard from friends and family who was able to identify that juror and was excused. Where that leaves us, we're still waiting.

This is a situation where the prosecutors are questioning and then the defense comes back and questions, and then the prosecutors get another crack, if they so choose. Right now, the prosecutors have gotten David Pecker to get to the heart of things pretty quickly, establish his closeness in Donald Trump, his understanding of how Trump was so motivated to protect himself and also was very closely watching money. And then, on top of that, has already testified that they had mutual agreements, the sort of agreements between friends, including that David Pecker and Trump knew that the \"National Enquirer\" and this former chairman of the publishing company could be the eyes and ears of the campaign, protect Donald Trump from stories where women might want to come forward and allege affairs with him while he was running for president. And the way he would do that is have positive stories in his publication about Donald Trump, negative stories about his opponents, and get in contact with Michael Cohen. This is according to the testimony already. Get in contact with Michael Cohen if something came up where a woman had a story to tell. They would find a way to let Michael Cohen know on the Trump campaign and get that story buried. And that is the prosecutor's allegation, is that it was not an isolated affair. It was part of a pattern, part of a strategy carried out multiple times. Katelyn Polantz, thanks so much, as always. So, for some legal perspective on this, let's speak now to Attorney Areva Martin.

It's clear to me that the lawyer has lost complete control, if he ever had any control, over Donald Trump, and Donald Trump is not listening either to the judge or the attorney. So, it was very clear from that statement from the judge that the judge is, in fact, frustrated with Donald Trump and his attorney, and with respect to the attorney trying to constantly spin and in some ways distort what Donald Trump is doing in violation of that gag order.",

But he is making the best of it, coming out to speak to the press before and after court, traveling when court is not in session. Jeff Zeleny joins us now from Washington with what's at stake politically for Donald Trump. And Jeff, it's become a familiar argument. Trump, pretty much every time he walks into that building behind me and when he leaves, will say it's unfair that I'm here. I should be on the road campaigning. How has he managed to keep campaigning even in the midst of this trial schedule? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Look, Jim, this is something that really has been a choice of the former president up until this point. In fact, he used many of his illegal proceedings both in New York, in Atlanta, in Florida, various jurisdictions as a campaign stop, if you will, during the primary. He could have been campaigning when he wasn't. It's Tuesday today. I can't recall a Tuesday that Donald Trump has had a campaign rally or he's actually visited a campaign state. So yes, this certainly has encumbered him, but it absolutely is something that it's not new. He has chosen to not be on the campaign trail nearly as much here. But Jim, what we are seeing today is really such a fascinating look into why Donald Trump ran for president in the first place and the help that the National Enquirer gave him when he was deciding whether to run for president One of the most interesting things I think we have learned overall this morning was a poll in the \"National Enquirer\" said that some 80 percent of its viewers or readers said that Donald Trump should run for president and that helped inform his decision to run. So, regardless of the impact that this has on the 2024 election, we don't know what the politics will be. It is a fascinating window into what essentially drew Trump in to run for president in the first place.",

And that, of course, is the Supreme Court Dobbs decision effectively overturning Roe v. Wade. Florida now is ground zero again for this because of two reasons. One, there is a six-week abortion ban in place. And two, voters in November in Florida will be asked the question of whether to enshrine the protection of abortion rights in the state's constitution. That is something that we have seen in state after state after state passed. Now, there's a high threshold in Florida. Sixty percent of Florida voters have to vote to protect this. So the question here is the president traveling to Florida to draw attention to this. They're tiptoeing a little bit into are they going to campaign in Florida? Could that be a battleground state again? Of course, it used to be a central battleground state. Democrats have not won this in a presidential race since Barack Obama did in 2012. But President Biden going to Florida to keep the attention and spotlight shined on abortion rights, they believe that is the central element to potentially winning this presidential campaign.

Areva Martin, back as well, civil rights attorney, legal affairs commentator. Areva, first to you. What we're hearing from prosecutors now is they're laying out just the depth and breadth of the strategy, which was not only to catch and kill a story like the Stormy Daniels alleged affair, but also to run positive stories about Trump to help his campaign and notably negative stories about his rivals at the time, a negative story about Ben Carson, a negative story about Ted Cruz, Republicans then running against Trump legally.

They're trying to lay out that this was a scheme, a scheme designed by Pecker, by MichaelCohen, by Donald Trump to create this chaos in some ways with respect to the election and to suppress votes for Donald Trump's opposition and to increase support for Donald Trump. They wanted Donald Trump to be painted in a positive light so that he could sway more jurors to vote for him. They wanted to suppress, as you said, those negative stories, stories that might cause voters to vote against Donald Trump. And the more that the prosecution can demonstrate what those stories were, who those individuals were. Let's not forget Hillary Clinton. She is also one of the opponents that Pecker liked to talk about in the \"National Enquirer,\" like to run negative stories about Hillary Clinton supporting Bill Clinton, who was characterized as a womanizer. So, I think the more evidence that's presented to this jury about the elaborate nature of this scheme and the efforts to suppress votes and to increase, suppress votes of the opponents and increase votes for Donald Trump, the more the jurors are going to be convinced of the case brought on by the prosecution. Prosecutors just noted in the courtroom that Michael Cohen was actually sent PDFs of the stories before they ended up in the paper, which substantiates this idea that they were, well, they were working together on this.

Here's the problem. They have this scheme and the scheme involves them paying money to this adult film actress. But where is the money coming from? So obviously, Donald Trump is concerned about writing a check directly from his own account to Stormy Daniels. So, they hatched the scheme where Michael Cohen is going to pay her and then he's going to pay Michael back and make it appear as if he's paying for legal fees. Now, one of the things that the said in their opening statement is that they're going to prove that these were payments for legal fees.

What is the remedy? I think he is going to impose a fine. I do not think he's going to incarcerate to defend Mr. Trump, although if it were Donald Smith, he would be incarcerated. So I think what the judge is going to do is give both sides, both the attorney and Mr. Trump, a tongue lashing, make it very clear that if it gets any worse and it continues, that he will be incarcerated.

One is that a lot of the messaging around him beingstuck in court while, yes, he is required to attend court four days out of the week. It's also a messaging tactic for him. It's something that they recognize plays well with Donald Trump supporters, even though I mean, I've covered Donald Trump throughout his entire 2024 campaign and for many other years. And he often did -- not would not hold more than two campaign events in a week. And under the current trial schedule, he's still able to do that. So, I just want you to keep that in mind here. But as for events that are happening in the courtroom, I think it's very clear how angry and frustrated Donald Trump feels. I think the novelty of the first week of being in court has started to wear off. He is very visibly agitated by this. And that's what you're also hearing when he addresses the cameras. And I do just want to quickly read for you what Donald Trump posted on Truth Social about the current gag order as his team was having a hearing on this this morning. It said, quote, \"Highly conflicted, to put it mildly. Judge Juan Merchan has taken away my constitutional right to free speech. Everybody is allowed to talk and lie about me, but I am not allowed to defend myself.\" He went on to call it a kangaroo court. But look, this is the type of messaging, again, that on one hand, Donald Trump thinks plays very well with his supporters. But it's also clearly a big point of frustration for him, too. He really does believe that it is unfair that he is not able to attack witnesses, specifically Michael Cohen, which is what his attorneys were arguing this morning. Jim.",

Mark, it's going to be some time before we have hard data as to how this trial is affecting Trump's support either way.

You know, he has been under investigation for several years. We knew these cases were going to come. So, in many ways, people have already made up their minds. And this is playing very well with Trump's base, where the concern is, though, ironically today as -- as the primaries are taking place in Pennsylvania, where this does hurt him is it hurts him with women who live in the suburbs that color these cities in some of the most important states, one of them being Pennsylvania, looking at Michigan, as well, and of course, Wisconsin.
