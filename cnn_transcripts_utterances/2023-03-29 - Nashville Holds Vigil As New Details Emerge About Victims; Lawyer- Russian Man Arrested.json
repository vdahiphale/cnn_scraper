So she actually did her due diligence so much that she came and sat in on our training at another school first to make sure it was what she wanted for her staff. And then we worked very closely together to customize that training program for this location and advise them on some physical security and teach them what to do in the moment.

I'll also tell you from the walk through that the only victims this shooter was able to get to where victims that we're stuck in some sort of open area or hallway. Everyone else will. Several were able to evacuate safely. The ones that couldn't do that safely did exactly what they were taught and trying to do and that was locked down and fortify their position. They did that.

He was on the run. And we are just learning that right now, he has just been detained. That's all we can tell you right now. But obviously he had been on the run from this sentence in a penal colony, and we can tell you right now has just been detained. So as that story is developing, we want to remind you, his daughter, 13-year-old Masha is in an orphanage. She was taken away from her father, and we've obtained heartbreaking letter that she wrote to him. And in the letter, she says, in part, quote, everything is fine with me. I love you very much, and I know that you are not guilty of anything. Matthew Chance is OUTFRONT in Moscow tonight, talking about the heavy Russian losses on the battlefield we're finding out about and what the Russian private military group Wagner is now doing to challenge Putin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the darkness, Russia's Wagner mercenaries edging their way to the front line. The open ground here in Bakhmut is a killing zone, only it's devastated buildings any kind of cover. Like this destroyed school where Wagner's leader Yevgeny Prigozhin is again visiting his troops. The 61 year old frequently appears near the front lines to see what can be done better, he says. The new plan he informs them is to go forward. Even Prigozhin admits Wagner has been battered by the fighting. The sacrifice, he says in the new audio statement, for a greater cause.",

So, Christo, just this latest reporting that we have here, Alexey Moskalyov, the father of that 13-year-old girl, right? He was sentenced to two years in a penal colony but had fled, right, so that he was on the run. There was a chance that he might have been able to get out of Russia.

You know for him, if your sense to tears and a penal colony and you are then found when you're on the run, what does this mean? CHRISTO GROZEV, LEAD RUSSIA INVESTIGATOR AT BELLINGCAT:  Well, I mean, this is going to exacerbate his situation both legally and from the point of view of Russian security services, having a reason to even extrajudicially. Maybe -- maybe there's something for him because of his -- him embarrassing them, and this was a major embarrassment for him to flee from rest, from detention.

Then it's almost like a trope of the Russians czar that the image that he's trying to project for himself, which is you have to be very austere and very stern and strict, but just at the same time. So in this case, he's going against the Kremlin there -- against what the courts in Putin's Russia are doing. He's saying, well, we have to be nice to the people who haven't committed a major crime, and this girl is the sort of embodiment of that -- of that innocence. So we have to be nice to her.

I don't think even he is trying to make the claim that abortion would be paid for which again is what makes this even more outrageous.But the second point is that things have changed dramatically for women serving in our military since the Dobbs decision was reached that overturned Roe versus Wade, and he seems not to understand how complicated the world has become. So I don't think it's a correct statement of the law that, he said. And the second point is that there has -- he is not made an objection. Nor has anybody on the Republican side to the fact that people travel for Lasik, the fact that people travel for bunions, for other elective surgeries. We've never heard any complaint about that, and that's not passed by the U.S. Senate. Those are regulations that the Department of Defense puts in place, just like the regulations they put in this context when it comes to a woman's reproductive health. No one objected on the floor of the Senate or held up every flag officer because people had the right to go get Lasik under a regulation by DOD.

Experts I speak to say we probably won't see anything of that scale, but Beijing is still going to take this seriously.
