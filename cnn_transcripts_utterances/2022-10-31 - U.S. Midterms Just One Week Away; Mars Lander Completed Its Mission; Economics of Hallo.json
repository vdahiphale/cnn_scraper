Yet the president`s party almost always loses seats in midterm elections. The party in the White House has lost seats in Congress in every midterm except for four in the last 150 years. And poll suggests that voters are disappointed in what President Biden and the Democratic majority have accomplished so far, which doesn`t bode well for their 2022 chances. SEN.

Of course, the question now is what is he going to do with the company, with the platform?
