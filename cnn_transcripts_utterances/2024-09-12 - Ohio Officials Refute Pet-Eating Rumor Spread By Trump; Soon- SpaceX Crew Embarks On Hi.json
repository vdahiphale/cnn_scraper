And they're going to be using a spacesuit that's never been worn in space before designed by a private company, and it's the first time that any private company has ever tried to attempt something like this. And a spacewalk is truly, like, one of the riskiest things that you can do in space. I mean, forget about launch and landing. That's, of course, risky. But once you're in orbit this is as risky and as tricky as it gets. So what we're going to see is -- in just about under 25 minutes we're going to see the hatch on the Dragon capsule open up and you're going to see two of the four crew members float outside of the spacecraft. And what they're going to be doing is -- the way it's described is it's going to look like a dance because they said they're going to be moving like caterpillars is the way it looks.

What they're doing is they're testing out how the suit moves, how it works, how it functions in the vacuum of space. And, you know, it -- you think oh, in space you're weightless. Everything is really easy to move. But this is a pressurized suit and so it's actually just doing something like closing your hand into a fist is really, really difficult to do. So that's the purpose of today's spacewalk, to test these suits out for the first time and get the data back to SpaceX engineers on the ground. And then all of this has the ultimate goal of having this be the first generation suit and hopefully, a fourth or fifth generation suit is going to be the ones that the first humans on Mars will wear.",

And one of the riskiest moments of this whole thing is not going to be the spacewalk itself, it's going to be after the spacewalk is over because Kasie, they're going to have to close the hatch. And what happens if you can't close that hatch? And what happens if then, once the hatch is closed, you can't repressurize the spacecraft? Then you're in a situation where it would be very difficult to get back to Earth alive. So the next two hours really fraught with risk but these guys have spent two years training for this. They say they feel really confident in their teams on the ground. And two of the people that are part of this crew -- two of these private astronauts -- they're actually SpaceX employees.

I want to get to those farmer's markets, those VFWs, and hear what people are saying. But I want to remind people -- people know who Donald Trump is. They -- he was the Donald Trump we all know.

Las Vegas beating Indiana for the 14th straight time and they're going to play again tomorrow. All right, to baseball where Shohei Ohtani edged closer to a historic season. The Dodgers' slugger homering in the first inning. That was his 47th of the season. L.A. actually hit four home runs in the first off Cubs starter Jordan Wicks. Then in the second inning, Ohtani would come to the plate again and then he'd get on base, and he'd steal second for his 48th stolen base. He's now three home runs and two stolen bases away from the first-ever 50-50 season in baseball history. The Dodgers beat the Cubs 10-8. All right, week two of the NFL season kicks off tonight with an AFC East showdown in Miami as the Dolphins are going to host the Bills. Both teams winning in week one. The Dolphins -- they haven't won the division since 2008, and one of the reasons is they just can't beat the Bills. Buffalo has won 13 of their last 15 matchups. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
