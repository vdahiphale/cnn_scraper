If you look over there, you can see the mobile command unit.We've seen more reinforcements come in over the last hour or so. They brought in large lights. They brought in more officers. It looks like they're going to be here for quite some time. Over here, we've also seen them searching the wood line and also anything like a dumpster or by the fences. We've seen them even talking to some of the businesses nearby to ask them for their video surveillance to see if someone was moving along their back property line. The reason why is they're desperately searching for something. We've seen these detectives sort of sorting through the trash, going hand through hand through some of these bags. This has been the focus now on the backside of this apartment complex that's right here. That's where the trail is that they found this young university student, Laken Hope Riley who was 22 years old. This community is shock. We were outside her sorority a little earlier. You can see all the tears flowing. There are people dropping off flowers. You understand that this community is so tightly woven. This is one of the premier universities in the state of Georgia. And there's nothing like this has happened in 20 years. This trail, people were still using it today, some of them unaware of this crime. We've walked parts of this trail, you understand people felt pretty safe back there. But all that safety has been broken because of something that happened out there, and there's really been no details about that just yet. Now we're told at 7:00, Jake, that they'll finally have a news conference. And we're hoping to get some of these answers from police and investigators who, from all across the state, have poured into this area, to find out whoever committed this crime. We now know a suspect has been arrested. Don't have a motive yet, don't have any of the details that we're desperately all trying to search.

And then I also feel like that is what I've learned about faith through ups and downs. You know, I think so many people, whether you believe in God, or don't I think we all kind of wrestle with the concept one way or the other. And a lot of people or at least I know I've always wondered all my life. You know, what does God think of me? What does God think of my choices? Have I made mistakes in my life? Am I worthy of love? You know, I grew up in a very kind of religious churchy background, which I love and treasure many aspects of. But I think I felt a lot of guilt and shame and self-doubt. And when I came across this verse, in Ephesians, that was retranslated for a book called \"The Message,\" it changed everything for me. It just reframed how I thought about faith. And the verse was, watch what God does, and you do it to like the way children learn proper behavior from their parents. Mostly what God does is love you. What does God think of my choices? Mostly what God does is love you. It belongs to all of us. And my theory is and my belief and I think what I found is that, if you could really let it in, like if you could really absorb that just for one moment, that God really does love every human heart, and you let it penetrate you. Well, it's transformative. It's profound. And I think that love can't be contained. And I think that's what I'm trying to express. But again, not running away. This isn't happy talk.",

Secretary Austin mentioned in a statement today that multi country coalition. That coalition has, quote, 15 U.S. allies, that as a percentage of GDP, contribute more to Ukraine's capability needs than the United States does.

It is because of congressional inaction that we've seen Ukraine have to make strategic withdrawals from the city of Avdiivka in order to preserve and conserve more resources to continue to hold their defensive lines in the East and the South. So that's why you've seen the Secretary, both very publicly and privately urged Congress to pass that supplemental that we need so much so that we can deliver Ukraine, the military assistance it needs on the battlefield.",

But what they found is that Wayne LaPierre or was the NRA $4.3 million on top of a million dollars that they assess he has already paid back. That's the money he conceded that he owed. The jury also found cause to remove him as head of the NRA even though he resigned just before this trial started.The judge will decide whether to permanently bar him from association with the NRA in a bench trial that will come up after this portion of the case. Wayne LaPierre did secure for himself a job as a basically an outside adviser or consultant to the NRA, a paid roll, which the jury found was not something that made him guilty of self-dealing. But this has been an eye opening case. In the closing remarks, the Assistant Attorney General Monica Connell summed it up by saying, this case is about corruption. Misuse of funds spent on jets, on black cars, five star hotels, hundreds of thousands of dollars in suits, million dollar deals to insiders, payments to local -- to loyal board members and pervasive violations of internal controls. So LaPierre was obviously the key defendant in this civil case brought by the New York State Attorney General because, A, the NRA was founded in New York State 153 years ago as a nonprofit organization. And B, in New York State, the Attorney General has sway over nonprofit organizations in because of the Attorney General's charity bureau. So this was basically the Attorney General of New York, Letitia James, the same attorney general who bought the civil case against Donald Trump and his business empire, calling the NRA onto the carpet and saying that essentially its management had turned the nonprofit organization into a personal piggy bank to use her words.",
