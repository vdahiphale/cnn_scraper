Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump have focused on key battleground states ahead of Tuesday's vote and in the coming hours they will both travel to Pennsylvania for rallies.On Sunday Harris and Trump fanned out hitting other key states like Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina. Already more than 75 million people have cast their ballots for president thanks to early voting. That includes Harris, who announced Sunday that she was dropping off her mail-in ballot. The latest CNN poll of polls shows exactly why both candidates are laser focused on the battleground states. From Arizona to Pennsylvania, the averages of recent polling in each state show there is still no clear leader. But one poll out of Iowa suggests a shift toward Harris in a state that had been considered solidly Republican. Among likely voters in the Des Moines Register-MediaCom poll, Harris is at 47 percent and Trump is at 44 percent. That is within the poll's margin of sampling error, meaning there is no clear leader. That poll, prompting this front-page headline out of Des Moines on Sunday, sources say the results were a gut punch to those within Trump's orbit. His campaign argues the poll is a clear outlier, as Trump has said to be fuming privately over the numbers. On Sunday, he went public with his complaints calling it a fake poll. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: One of my enemies just pushed out a poll. I'm three down. Joni Ernst called me, everyone's called me, they said, you're killing in Iowa. The farmers love me and I love them. They just announced a fake poll. Hey, think of it, right before the election that I'm three points down, I'm not down in Iowa. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Monday night was the first night in the field and I walked into the office and I'd seen overnight I'd seen the unweighted data and it had Harris leading and my assistant said did you see the data and I said I'd like to see weighted data. So the weighting is how we take care of things that make it -- would make our poll unrepresentative. We align things with a known population and we extract from a larger group the people who need our definition of likely voters, and that is people who've already voted and people who say they will definitely vote. So when former President Trump says we interviewed more Democrats, well that's what came out of our data. We did nothing to make that happen. I'm a big believer of keeping my fingers off -- dirty fingers off the data. So we did it the way we did it when he won in our final poll twice in two election cycles, very same method.

And we've got seven remaining yellow toss-up battleground states. And as you know, those battleground states are razor thin.Look at these are a poll of polls in the battleground states. No clear leader in any of them, in any of these battleground states. So this is razor thin. So what is the path to victory for each candidate? Well, the Harris campaign will say that their best, most direct path to 270 electoral votes is through the blue wall. If she were to win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, she'd be at 270 electoral votes and the next president. But what if Donald Trump repeats his 2016 victory in Pennsylvania. Then Harris drops down to 251, and she has to go hunting in the Sun Belt to find some more votes. Certainly, if she were able to flip North Carolina from red to blue this time, that would get her knocking on the door to 270, and then maybe Nevada behaves like it has for Democrats in recent cycles, and that would put Harris over the top in that scenario. What about Donald Trump's path? Well, let's reset the map, seven yellow battleground states. And Donald Trump's most direct path is to hang on to North Carolina. That is the state he won by the narrowest margin four years ago. In fact, it's the only state he won of the seven battleground states. And let's say he flips Georgia back. You'll recall he famously lost it by just fewer than 12,000 votes. So let's say that ends up back in his column. And let's say he does get that Pennsylvania victory repeated from 2016. That's it. He'll be at 270 electoral votes. He doesn't need any of the rest of the battleground states. But what if Harris does pull it out in Pennsylvania? Then, where does Donald Trump go for the next 19 electoral votes? Well, even if he were to win Nevada and Arizona out west, that still would not get him to 270. He would need at least one of the other remaining so-called blue wall states, such as Michigan, and that would do the trick and get him over the top at 283. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And in 2018, he paused military exercises between South Korea and the United States. That pause happened when Trump was negotiating with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, over Kim's nuclear program. But under the Biden-Harris administration, those military exercises between South Korea and the United States have begun once again. In fact, the Biden-Harris White House takes credit for the formation of a new security partnership between Japan, the United States and South Korea forged in part to counter North Korean threats.

One is trade, which actually is everybody really nervous because he insists he loves tariffs. He says it's the best word in the world next to God.And he wants to put 20 percent tariffs on everything coming into the United States and even more 50, 60 percent on anything coming in from China. Now that would raise prices for Americans, but it would also do a lot of damage to allied economies, let alone to China's. And the second thing, of course, is security. I mean, Donald Trump does not like alliances. He thinks alliances weaken America. Kamala Harris thinks alliances strengthen America and Trump has been obsessed about NATO members not spending enough on their own defense. It's not that he's wrong, I think he's correct, particularly given Ukraine. He takes credit for increases. Now, 23 of 32 NATO members spend 2 percent of GDP on defense, but frankly, that's not enough. It should be 2.5 or 3 percent, particularly among big country. So I expect him to jolly that along and he may threaten to do this and do that but it's never very clear. Trump's very unpredictable and he can be talked down sometimes and he can be swung by this idea as Lindsey Graham often says that all has to be about Trump, so if one praises Trump if one says all everything good is due to trump. He's likely to be happy for a while, but he is very unpredictable. And these two themes, I think, will recur without question. So people are anxious.",

I think those are the three biggest foreign policy challenges, as well as climate change, because what's going on obviously requires cooperation all around the world. Now there's China. Everyone talks in America about China. I think the Chinese also have their own timetable, but the next three or four years won't be crucial. I think China's looking a bit beyond that.

I mean, if you look at the polls over many administrations, they love Democrats and mistrust Republicans. And that's been true way back to Ronald Reagan. 85 percent of Germans think Kamala Harris will win, which I think is kind of very hopeful for them. We'll see what happens. But there is anxiety about Trump because Trump really doesn't like Germany. He picks out Germany maybe because of his own grandfather, but he picks out Germany as the country that he believes is freeloading on American largesse for its own security. So the Germans are nervous about that. And don't forget, when he was president last time, toward the end, he tried to pull a lot of American troops out of Germany. So people are worried about Ukraine, they're worried about the U.S. abandoning Europe, but there's a lot of kind of putting their fingers over their eyes and hoping it doesn't happen. In Brussels, the European Union is doing strategy sessions, but it's mostly about trade and tariffs. If Trump imposes big tariffs, the E.U. will be ready with counter tariffs, because the E.U. is largely about trade. But NATO -- we have a new general secretary, Mark Rutte, who knows Trump. Trump likes him. So I think that's a good sign. But people, I think, in Europe generally are just hoping that it will be Harris because it would be just a softer ride for them.",

And you've also been reaching out to young voters online and through phone banking. What are most of these young people saying to you about how they plan to vote and what issues are motivating them to get out and vote?ADAM MET, FOUNDER, PLANET REIMAGINED, U.N. SUSTAINABILITY ADVOCATE, AND PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: It's been an incredible experience seeing students across all different campuses, across all different swing states. The energy is palpable out there right now. One of the most important things that I've seen is that a lot of these schools offer things like early voting and same day registration. And when you go up and you talk to a student that's in a group of friends, if you're talking to one of them, you're talking to all of them. They all start to create these voting plans: going out to the voting booths together, they make it an activity. And historically voting felt like an obligation to a lot of people. It felt like something they had to do. It felt like a responsibility. But now more and more we're seeing voting on these college campuses be something fun. CHURCH: So what are the issues that are making them want to vote?",

We see immigration as a big issue. But I am a climate activist and I work in climate policy.And a lot of the times when I'll talk to these students, I'll talk to them about climate as an everything issue, because climate touches all of the different issues that people care about for this presidential election, whether it is immigration, we're going to see the largest number of climate refugees during this next presidency. Health care is a big one for people. As the planet warms, we see insects and animals start to take up new areas of the United States and around the world, bringing the kinds of diseases that we're not used to. Look at COVID-19. All gun violence is a major issue in this election. And there's a study that came out of Chicago that said for each new degree of warming, there will be a 7 percent increase in gun violence. Climate is the thing that touches everyone. But one of the interesting things is that when I speak to these students on campus, I never use the word climate. I talk to them about the food that ends up on their table. I talk to them about how they get from place to place, about when they flip on a switch to turn on the lights. I talk about climate as an issue that is integrated into your everyday lives, and it impacts so many of these other issues. So everything that people care about, whether it's the economy or immigration, it's actually all climate.",

Every single college that I have been to, the percentage of students voting has gone up significantly from the numbers that we saw in 2020 and in 2022. Some of these campuses are at 140, 150 percent of the students they had voting, which is incredible turnout. That means there's a lot of first time voters.And for those that are undecided it's a great question because a lot of these candidates that they're voting for whether it's the presidential level or down ballot candidates there's so much information out there and there's so much in the media and in the press out there it is surprising to me how many people are still undecided. When I speak to students when I go up to them on campus nine times out of ten they'll tell me they've already voted or they have and the few that are still undecided, I think waffle back and forth because of the people around them. And if we can hit them over and over and over again with the information about what the policy and what the future is going to look like for a certain candidate, then that's going to move them forward. And one of the interesting things that I found out about when I was on the road is traditionally, if you're knocking on doors or talking to people, it takes talking to 11 people to have one voter actually convinced to go out and vote in the polls. 11 to 1. So the number one thing that people can do, getting their friends to do, students can do, is to go out and knock on doors, talk to their friends, send text messages. We want massive voter turnout this election because we want everyone's voice represented.",

And everything that she stands for and everything that the down ballot candidates are standing for who are supporting her are going to move us towards a clean energy future, a new approach to farming, a new approach to waste, a new approach to building things. And this is exactly the work that I do and my organization, Planet Reimagined.

After the end of last month, October 28th, the two bills were passed in the Israeli Parliament that UNRWA is not allowed to operate within Israel itself. And also another bill saying that no Israeli official is able to be in contact with the U.N. agency.So three months from that date, this is when it will come into being. But it has been widely criticized by other humanitarian aid groups on the ground, by the United Nations, and also by a number of countries saying that it could have grave consequences for the work that's being done to try and give food, shelter, water to those in Gaza at this point. We heard from the UNRWA chief who said that this will, quote, \"only deepen the suffering of Palestinians especially in Gaza, where people have been going through more than a year of sheer hell.\" Now it's something that Israel has wanted to do for some time. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, has been quite vocal about this for many years. They believe that some employees of the U.N. agency have affiliations to Hamas, which UNRWA denies. We also have heard allegations from Israel that a small number were involved in the October 7 attacks against Israel. The U.N. investigation found that nine may have been involved and those individuals were fired. But there is a concern about what this changes on the ground. At this point, Palestinians in Gaza are wholly dependent on humanitarian aid groups. The situation is so dire in northern Gaza. For example, a group of 15 heads at the United Nations just last week warned that Northern Gaza, the population, is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence. UNRWA is uniquely placed, we have been hearing from the United States, the Biden administration, to be able to counter the concerns of what is happening in Gaza at the moment. We did hear the U.S. State Department that they play an irreplaceable role right now in Gaza. So the timing really couldn't have been worse for this to happen. Rosemary?",
