Detectives searched it, after officer shot and killed the attacker, and found material, inside, written by Hale. Now, they have posted an image, on social media, of the glass doors that they say the attacker shot through, to enter the building, right? Didn't just open a door, actually, shot into the building. Police say there will be releasing footage, as soon as tonight, of what they encountered, and when they arrived, at the scene, this morning.

Now, earlier today, authorities had said that that's exactly how this 28-year-old shooter was able to get inside of that building. We know that, according to authorities, the shooter was really prepared, for a confrontation, with officers were told that that the shooter showed up, to this school, with two AR-style weapons, as well as a handgun, and that two of those weapons were legally purchased. We're told that the shooter was armed with several rounds of ammunition, and that the shooter had detailed the plan of attack. They say that this entire thing was targeted that there were maps, where the shooter had used, to highlight the entry points, throughout this building. As for that motive, authorities are hoping, to detail, some of that in the coming days. Right now, they are still, in the early stages, of this investigation.

She accused Fox News lawyers, of coercing her, into giving misleading testimony. And she says that testimony gave cover, to network leaders, and talent, who knowingly pushed election lies, and conspiracy theories, about Dominion Voting Systems. Grossberg's latest court filing amends deposition statements that she made, last year, including one, in which she had expressed trust, for Fox producers. And she now wants to change that testimony to this. She now wants to go on the record with this. Quote, \"No, I don't trust all of [the] producers at Fox. They're activists, not journalists, and [they] impose their political agendas on the programming.\" Grossberg also claimed she was subjected to a toxic and sexist work environment, at Fox News. For its part, the network denies wrongdoing, regarding Grossberg, and separately maintains, of course, that it never defamed Dominion. This is one of the biggest lawsuits going on, in the country. And here now to respond is Abby Grossberg's lawyer, Gerry Filippatos. And I really appreciate your taking the time here to explain this.
