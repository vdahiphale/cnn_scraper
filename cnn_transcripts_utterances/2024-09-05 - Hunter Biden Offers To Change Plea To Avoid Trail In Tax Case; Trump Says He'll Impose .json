      "sentences": "Welcome to Inside Politics. I'm Dana Bash. And we are following breaking news on multiple fronts. 61 days from election day. A crucial hearing just wrapped up in the federal case against Donald Trump for trying to overturn the last election.The judge says, she's not ready to set a trial date, but that the election will not factor into her decision making. And any moment now, the former president will unveil a new economic policy. We're going to bring that to you live. But first, major news in Hunter Biden's federal tax evasion case. CNN's Evan Perez has the details from Los Angeles. Evan, what do we know?",

      "sentences": "Well, this was a bit of a surprise gambit that we had in court here just about 20 minutes ago here in Los Angeles, Dana. Hunter Biden's attorneys asked for him to enter an unusual plea. It's called an Alford plea, where Hunter Biden would accept whatever punishment the judge dose out. But he maintains his innocence.Instead of pleading guilty, he's maintaining his or is attempting to maintain his innocence. Of course, as expected, the Justice Department does not -- does not agree with this. They objected in court to this request from Hunter Biden's attorneys. And now, the judge has called for a break for a couple of hours while he considers what steps to take next. Now, this is unusual as you pointed out. As I pointed out today obviously, was the first day of juror selection on this trial. This is a Hunter Biden's second time going on trial. Earlier this year, he was found guilty on gun charges in Delaware, and these charges have to do with tax evasion. And he's facing three felony counts for tax evasion, six misdemeanor counts for failing to file and pay his taxes on time. And of course, this was -- that he's facing a very difficult situation because Hunter Biden had previously agreed to plead guilty to all of these charges in a deal that fell apart last year in federal court there in Delaware. So, we don't know what the judge is going to do next. But I can tell you that, you know, Alfred plea is obviously very, very unusual. Certainly, in the federal system, the Justice Department has a policy against them. They would argue, and they would -- today in court, they're pushing for Hunter Biden to plead guilty to everything. If he wants to resolve this case, he needs to plead guilty to all of these charges. That is the position of the government. So, we will see what Judge Mark Scarsi does when he gets back. Obviously, Dana, big -- a lot of consequences are here for Hunter Biden. He's facing 17 years if he's convicted. We know President Biden has said that he's not going to pardon his son. However, that's back when Hunter -- the president was the candidate for reelection. That is no longer the case. We'll see whether that answer stays the same.",

Keep us posted if you hear anything from what the judge actually says in that hearing behind you, Evan.I want to in the meantime bring in senior legal analyst, Elie Honig. So, Elie, can you just dive deeper into this, so-called Alford plea, which was not on my bingo card for Inside Politics today. But, you know, we're all about learning new things, and this is a new one for me. You've obviously got experience with this being a former federal prosecutor. Explain?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Dana. This is a surprise development. So ordinarily, when a defendant pleads guilty, he goes in front of the judge in court and says, I'm guilty as charge. I did it, and here's what I did. That makes me guilty. Now, this is what's technically called an Alford plea. People may be more familiar with the term you sometimes see on TV of a no-contest, or no low contend, if you want to use the line.Where essentially what Hunter Biden is asking to do is to go into the federal court and say, I'm not admitting my guilt. I'm not admitting that I'm guilty of these charges. Instead, I acknowledge that the prosecution thinks they have the proof. And I'm willing to take your sentence, Judge, based on the indictment as is. It's very, very rare to see this type of plea happen or even an attempt to have this type of plea happen in federal court.",

And you already know because you've already practiced law for so long.Now to the big apple. You are looking at live pictures of the Economic Club of New York, where Donald Trump will speak momentarily about his plans for the economy. Should he win another term in office? We're expecting to hear about some new ideas. A day after Vice President Harris announced some of her own new economic policies. CNN's Kristen Holmes is there. Kristen, I know you've been talking to your sources and the Trump campaign. We do expect some new ideas that people who listen intently, that Elon Musk might found -- might find familiar.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's right. Elon Musk has become such a close adviser of Donald Trump, and we'll see that today on display when he announces some of these new economic proposals.And just to give a little bit of background here, Donald Trump in the last several weeks, particularly since Kamala Harris has been at the top of the ticket, has given these kind of smaller speeches that are supposed to focus on specific issues, like the economy, like immigration. But however, they often veer off and go into attacks on Kamala Harris, on her policies, on her personally. We are told that this is going to be much more specific, not just vague proposals, like no tax on tips or no tax on social security but get into somewhat of the nitty gritty. So here is what is on the agenda from senior advisers. They say this will all be unveiled today in various economic proposals. He's going to talk about tackling government regulation, creating government efficiency commission. That was something that was originally proposed by Elon Musk. It's something that would do essentially a comprehensive look at the government, at fraud, at waste, withdrawing unspent funds from the Biden administration, adding, sweeping tariffs on imports. Obviously, something we've heard Donald Trump talk extensively about, as well as embracing cryptocurrency, which is something he has done in recent months. Now how detailed he gets, that remains to be seen often with these kind of speeches. Donald Trump gives a big blanket but doesn't go into those specifics. But we are told that this is his opportunity to get out there and unveil some of these new policies. As you mentioned, this is coming a day after Kamala Harris unveiled some of her economic policies. And we also know that the economy is a key issue for Donald Trump's campaign. They still believe that they can make Harris the incumbent candidate, that people are still very unhappy with the economy. And as long as Donald Trump continues to stay focused and on message, particularly when it comes to inflation, the prices of groceries, the prices of housing, that they can win this election in November. But of course, Dana, the question is as always, whether or not Donald Trump can stay on message.",

In the meantime, for your great reporting, Kristin, I have other terrific reporters right here with me at the table.CNN's David Chalian, CNN's Alayna Treene, and Jasmine Wright of NOTUS, formally with CNN. Nice to see you all. David Chalian yesterday Kamala Harris gives a speech that talks about the economy bit more moderate, separates herself for the first time really from Joe Biden on one of the key tax issues that people who are paying attention to that, pay attention to.

I also think it's an opportunity to practice some policy lines before the debate in Philadelphia next week.So, I think what you hear today from Donald Trump, if he does indeed read off the prompter as planned, uh, what you heard from Kamala Harris yesterday, I'll be shocked if we don't hear some of that same language on the debate stage next week. It's interesting that you noted on the Harris side, Dana, a little bit of separation from Biden, which is noteworthy and interesting in and of itself from the sitting vice president. But actually, the fact that like she's separated from Biden to put him in a more left progressive area by raising taxes by a larger amount, than she's saying. I don't want to go that far. [12:10:00] You know, it was just five years ago, she was running on the left of Joe Biden. So, it was a very, a big switcheroo there to hear her try and do that. We should also be clear. She's still proposing to raise taxes on these capital gains on high wealthy earners. She's just going to raise taxes by less than Joe Biden is proposing. And here, what I thought was interesting in that graphic that you saw with Kristen, with all the policy proposals that were about to hear from the musk idea of sort of reorganizing government as also a way of potential savings, echoes back to Al Gore, if that's a government.",

I think we're going to actually hear the specifics today. I know the goal for the Trump campaign is to put a sharper focus on it, not talk about it broadly, but really get into what exactly he wants to do.But one of my questions for them, particularly when it comes to no tax on tips, no tax on social security, you know, no changes to entitlement benefits at the same time. How are you going to pay for this? And that is a question I've asked Donald Trump this directly at some of his events that they have yet to answer for. And even today, when I've been asking them about all of these policies, they still have not answered for that. I think one time, when I asked Donald Trump, he said, through growth, through great growth, and that was about the sum of his answer or so.",

When he starts talking about his own plans, we will get back to it as soon as we can.In the meantime, I want to go to Matt Egan, because what we've heard so far requires a lot of fact checking and maybe course correcting for our viewers, when it comes to the real history and context as to what has happened during the Biden administration with regard to the economy.

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, he's clearly painting a very, very dark picture about the current state of affairs in this economy. And no doubt, this economy has some major issues, particularly when it comes to affordability. But he certainly sounds like he's exaggerating the extent of the current situation. For example, just a few moments ago, former President Trump said, this is the worst inflation, perhaps in the history of our country.Now, inflation is nowhere near as high as it was just two years ago, right? We had a much higher inflation than the sub 3 percent, right now it was higher in the 70s and in the 80s. So that one just doesn't add up. He also was championing his 2017 tax cuts, which no doubt were massive, but he described them as the largest tax cuts in American history by far. That is something that former President Trump has repeatedly said, that is not accurate. It's not the biggest tax cut in history, either as a percentage of GDP or on an inflation, inflation adjusted basis. Another point here, though, is what he's saying about the current state of the jobs market. It's really important to remember that unemployment remains relatively low. It has come up recently. But look at this, 4.3 percent unemployment as of July. That's the most recent month we have. That is significantly lower than in January 2021, the former -- the final month that Trump was in office. Of course, the unemployment rate at that point was high because of the COVID crisis, which is a crisis that Trump's critics would argue that he mismanaged. But even if we look at job growth before COVID, right, we just look at the first three months -- three years under Trump. We can see the U.S. economy added a lot of jobs. 6.5 million jobs during the first three years that Trump was in office. But look at that, much more, more than twice as many under Joe Biden as the economy was recovering from COVID. So, you know, again and again in the opening few minutes of this speech, Dana, Trump is painting a much darker picture than what really lives up with reality.",
