But regardless of which entrances Trump and the others arrive at -- CHARLES RAMBO, RETIRED LIEUTENANT, FULTON COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE: They would be pat down, led to the booking office in the rear. From there they probably will have to have ties and shoe strings and all those types of things taken. Then from there the persons would be fingerprinted, given a booking photo. TODD (voice-over): Donald Trump and the other defendants are expected to be photographed for mug shots, but it's unclear when those pictures will be made public. People familiar with the process tell CNN, normally those booked at this jail are searched thoroughly by a jail deputy and at some point, given a medical exam and a pre-trial screening to determine if they can sign out on their own recognizance. But it's not clear if Trump or the other high-profile defendants in this case will go through those steps. For a normal defendant it would take hours to go through those procedures.

The first one actually was back in March to Moscow to see his quote/unquote dear friend Putin. So this kind of dynamic and priority really in a way underscores what David was saying, that despite their vastly different political and economic models, these countries, these leaders are indeed bonded over their shear desire or even some would say grievances against the current global order led by the U.S.So the things David mentioned, the potential expansion of the grouping and the potential reduction on the reliance on U.S. dollars, it's all going to be beneficial to China at a time when tensions remain high between Beijing and Washington. With a lot of talks about decoupling between China and the West. And it's also going to be beneficial to Xi Jinping himself, as he further cements China's leadership position in this grouping. But remember, he also arrived in South Africa at a time when the Chinese economy is facing its strongest head winds in decades. He is facing a myriad of problems here at home. So that's why he may be seeking potential new markets for China exports, but also, he may face more constraints, even compared to just a few years ago in terms of the projects that China is able to finance or invest in the global south, particularly in Africa. That's why some experts say the Beijing leadership is now switching gears to adopt and more low cost, high impact strategy. For example training more African officers, military officers in China and by expanding its soft power across the global south. One thing they are doing, for example, Max, is they are launching a new show called \"Classics\" quoted by Xi Jinping across Africa. I'm sure officials here hope that's going to be a huge hit -- Max.",

But one of them landed in a town just outside of Moscow, just to the west, Krasnogorsk, what we know that the headquarters of the Moscow region government is there.And it was actually, according to the governor, in that same part of that town there was a high rise building that was damaged, cars. It didn't seem like particularly significant damage. That is of course, you know, part of the hallmark of these drone strikes that we're seeing. They're shot down, relatively little damage. But it is in part designed to cause disruption, perhaps anxiety, angst. I think a sort of big picture, stepping back on these drones. You can split them into various categories. We're seeing some in the border regions. And attacks on the border regions of Russia and Ukraine have been part of this conflict from the beginning. Now we're seeing a fairly remarkable number hitting in and around Moscow with airport disruptions, seen their air space closures, things like that. But it seems to be designed to bring anxiety and angst to the Russian people. And then perhaps the most interesting of all, we're seeing also high value military targets as well. There was on Saturday the Russian military said that a plane was damaged at an air base in the Novgorod region near St. Petersburg. And then on Monday, Russia hasn't said anything about this really. But Ukraine says that a plane was damaged at another air base this time in the Kaluga region, west of Moscow. This is an air base that operates long range bombers which Ukraine has previously said have targeted its territory. So there are a lot of different ones, but the volume is striking. And I think as you say, speaks to the expanding, the sort of tactics and scope of this war in general.",

It contains very radioactive substances. It would become a serious problem once it's released into the ocean. We won't be able to eat the fish anymore. COREN (voice-over): Protests have been a constant since Japan announced its plan to release the water two years ago. Many worry about the potential for bioaccumulation of dangerous elements in the ecosystem. While neighboring countries like China have accused Japan of treating the ocean as a dumping ground.

You have to take a decision. COREN (voice-over): Many difficult decisions will need to be made at Fukushima in the coming decades.
