Here, the time is 1 p.m. It's a few hours earlier in Gaza. 11 o'clock, they're two hours behind in Gaza. And IDF helicopters have been seen flying along the Israeli coastline. These are pictures from Ashkelon. Earlier today.Now Ashkelon is only 20 kilometers from Gaza. It is there, of course, the day the IDF says Hamas has been holding 230 hostage. And it is there where Israeli military says it's more than 450 targets in the last day. Israel says it includes Hamas command centers, observation posts and missile launch sites. First, let me update you with events overnight. These are the pictures Israel says it's been targeting Hamas tunnels and underground spaces continues to urge everyone to go further south in Gaza itself. The near total communications blackout apparently is easing. Hospitals remained to meet overwhelmed and basic needs scarce, there is very little international aid that is being allowed in. CNN's Scott McLean joins us from London. What more do we know from overnight?",

Israel says that there were 450 strikes on what it calls terror targets in the past day. It also says that Israeli ground troops are now helping to direct some of those strikes.We also know from a journalist in central Gaza that, he said that the artillery strikes yesterday were, well, in his words did not stop. He also said that there was gunfire hurt in the eastern part of Gaza near that perimeter wall. And many of the people showing up at the hospital in Deir Al Balah don't have injuries from airstrikes, but from artillery strikes instead. Obviously, none of this is helping the humanitarian situation. We have video that was shot yesterday by the AFP showing people in Gaza, desperate people obviously, ransacking a U.N. warehouse and carrying out whatever food supplies the candidate looks like bag -- bags of rice, from what we can tell from the video. But the Israeli leadership is still sort of framing all of this in very binary terms. You have the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, coming out yesterday calling Gaza the fortress of evil, saying anyone who accuses the IDF of war crimes is a hypocritical liar. And then you have the defense minister also warning that this is going to be a long war. He said this quote, \"This will not be a short war. It is a long war that will require us to be strong as individuals as a society as leaders. Above all, our security forces will be strong. This is a war in our home. This is a war we didn't choose. It's either us or them.\" Now, the Israelis have also tried to stress their warning for people in northern Gaza to move farther south saying that they are trying to intensify those efforts. But here's the reality, Richard. We are still seeing airstrikes, artillery strikes in central and southern Gaza as well. So even if people were to flee south, there is no guarantee that there'll be safe. In fact, there have been strikes, where people who fled northern Gaza had been killed in Central or Southern Gaza as well.",

I mean, of course Friends is the thing that everyone thinks of because, again, no one could be a Chandler being friends, wouldn't have been friends without that group of cast. But that really includes him and that's really hard to think of a world that that exists now. TV is very different today. The sitcom world is very different today. And it doesn't exists where people are tuning in every single week to watch a certain group of friends gathered together, and 20 million people turning on their TVs and welcoming him into their living room. It's an important thing to act as it's to note as well. He was of course on film. He was a really, really big TV actor and a thing that comes along with being a TV star is that you really are welcomed into people's homes so people fell in love with him of course, they fell in love with Chandler being but they also fell in love with his character Joe on the West Wing. They fell in love with him on Go On, a short- lived series that was on the many, many things that he popped up in and the odd couple revival. If the list goes on and on, and that really goes back to what an incredible actor he was with such amazing comedic timing. I mean, it's really, really it goes kind of to show that the most famous lines of Friends were a lot of his and that's because of his, the way his cadence in delivering those lines of, could I be more excited. That is what -- you know what Matthew Perry brought to Chandler. That wasn't written in. He created that and that's something that is a really, really nice thing to think about. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, if this is -- if I mean, everyone is joining the dots, what's the practical effect of what you're saying?GOULD-DAVIES: Well, the practical effect is for policymakers in Western countries to understand that you don't have to choose between supporting Ukraine and supporting Israel. It's a little like another larger strategic argument, which has been made in recent months about China. There are voices in the United States that say, well, we don't have enough resources to support Ukraine against Russia, because that means we don't have enough to support Taiwan against China. That's really nonsense strategically, because a weaker Russia means a weaker China, ultimately, because those two countries are now so closely aligned. There's also a point about credibility, which is a sort of global resource. If you make commitments as the West House to Ukraine, and then you withdraw them and scale them back and say, no, it's too difficult. We're not strong enough, we've had to divert our resources elsewhere. That sends a very strong signal to aggressors everywhere, that emboldened them to try to outlast the West in a contest of results. And ultimately, the West collectively is far, far stronger than Russia, which, of course, is at the heart of the Ukraine crisis, and ultimately if one remove lies behind the crisis in the Middle East now. The West collectively has at least 12 times the total economic strength, and therefore potential military support for its allies, as Russia does. During the Cold War, the West had about three times the resources of the old Soviet Union in the Eastern Bloc. The west today is vastly more powerful. So we shouldn't underestimate our underlying capacity to sustain support for our allies on more than one front.",

One would hope surely, that at the very highest level of policymaking, they can compartmentalize when necessary, and what and multitask when required?GOULD-DAVIES: Yeah, compartmentalizing is, I would say, a bureaucratic reflex, understanding their connections is a strategic reflex. And what the nest West needs is proper, deep and sustained strategic thinking based on an understanding of the larger connections between crises across the world. Other countries, the West adversaries are watching very closely at the West reaction.
