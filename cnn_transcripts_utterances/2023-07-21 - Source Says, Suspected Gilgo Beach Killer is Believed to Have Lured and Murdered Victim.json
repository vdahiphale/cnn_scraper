First of all, investigators were able to put together the travel records of his wife during those years, 2009, 2010, and they found that she was out of town every time one of those girls went missing. And so it was believed that -- and it's been a working theory for quite a while now that he committed the murders in the home because they say he would have control there.Remember, they were bound with duct tape and belts in burlap, and he would have the ability to do all of that. It also explains the four from his wife that are found on the victims or on the duct tape, because that is highly unusual right there. Now, they didn't have this ability in 2009, 2010, but there's even more. They were able to find out his burner phone number, his personal cell number and the victims' cell number. And in recent years, they've been able to triangulate through the cell phone tower data those three numbers on the days and before the days, even after the days they went missing. And they found that the burner phones were used to contact victims' phones in New York City and then the burner phones and the victims' phones together with the same cell tower data went to Massapequa where he lived, and that when the girls went missing, their cell phones were in the Massapequa area, and they were triangulating all of this in recent years. And that comes to this working theory. Now, we want you to listen last night with Erin Burnett, the Suffolk County sheriff spoke out on the home and the search they're doing for over a week now for forensics, here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERIFF ERROL D. TOULON JR., SUFFOLK COUNTY, NEW YORK:  Every piece of evidence that could be gathered, whether it's from the storage containers or from his home, could be valuable not only to the murders that he's currently being charged with, but more importantly if we can connect him to other murders, whether they were in New York or other locations.

The below average temperatures evaporate literally before your eyes and get replaced with a lot of oranges and reds, we all know what that means, above average temperatures.So, today, enjoy it while you can. Dallas 94, Oklahoma City, 87. You're below your average high. It's the middle of July, so it's still warm. But the heat returns by the end of the weekend and into the early parts of next week. As long as this very stubborn heat dome that we've been talking about is firmly entrenched across the Deep South and into southwest, we will continue to talk about the record-breaking temperatures. 100 million Americans under some sort of heat alert stretching from Florida all the way to the southwest. Look at the triple-digit heat from Vegas to Bakersfield, Palm Springs and Death Valley and Phoenix, you continue with your record-breaking streak with temperatures above 110. And this extended forecast well into next week calls for above average temperatures. But look where it builds across the upper plains and portions of the Midwest. Now, transitioning to those storms that Phil mentioned a moment ago, check out what happened across middle Tennessee yesterday. Trees knocked down. We had power lines snapped like twigs, and that is amongst several dozen reports of wind that just created a swath of damage across portions of the Southeastern U.S. We have another line of thunderstorms that continues to roll through. We have a thunderstorm watch across Northeastern Oklahoma. But focusing in on what's happening right now throughout Memphis and Southwestern Tennessee, we have a flood warning in place and there's our flood threat for today.

But it is true that this was one of the -- you could just hear it in the sound bite that you played. You could hear the passion understandably and the anger.

The most fascinating relationship in Washington, in my view, at least personally, is the former president and the current speaker of the House.You know, there was some reporting yesterday about what McCarthy may or may not have committed to do related to expunging impeachments. Our amazing Hill team went and basically talked to Republican members yesterday. I want to pull up a full screen where they're saying, you know, Michael Lawler, I don't really see the purpose, Garret Graves, I'm not going to take a petition. Andy Harris, I'm concentrating on appropriations. Chip Roy, this is a new body, so I'd say onward. Tim Burchett, I don't care about that, it doesn't amount to anything. That is a wide array of the ideological sides of that Republican conference, which makes me more interested in the dynamic between McCarthy and Trump, behind the scenes, how it works, how transactional it is.

And then, of course, you have among the most conservative on the right there. And that tells you everything you need to know.They don't want to deal with what happened in the past. Even those who are among the most fervent of supporters of Donald Trump, maybe the most fervent are like, okay, let's do this because it will make him happy. But for the most part, no, and there's so many reasons why they don't want to do it. Not the least of which is it doesn't do anything. You can't -- you both know this, you can't expunge an impeachment. It would just be effectively a sense of Congress, which would be putting everybody on record with their opinion about what happened. And you're putting the moderates in a tough position. And so that's a long way of answering your question, which is that Kevin McCarthy has, from the beginning of Trump and Trumpism, had a very complicated relationship with him, because, certainly, when Donald Trump was president, he needed him very badly when Kevin McCarthy was the minority leader and needed him even more when he was in that 15-vote race to become the speaker of the House. And, you know, he has continued to embrace Donald Trump and they have very much a classic, symbiotic relationship. And at this point, probably it seems as though McCarthy might need Trump even more than the reverse. And that is pretty evident in our reporting about these conversations that they're having.",
