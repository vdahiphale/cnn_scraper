Fears are growing of an escalation in violence. And in the U.S., the police brutality case in Memphis that has a nation on edge. Five police officers were fired and now charged with murder and kidnapping after the death of a man they were trying to arrest. Ukraine is making the case for more western weapons following the latest barrage of Russian missile strikes. Kyiv says dozens of drones and missiles were fired on targets across Ukraine on Thursday killing at least 11 people and leaving 11 others wounded. Ukraine says most of the missiles were shot down, but dozens of buildings and power facilities still took heavy damage from the strikes. Russian attacks came just hours after western allies agreed to send their advance tanks to Ukraine. In response, the Kremlin now accuses the west of direct involvement in the war but the Ukrainian president says Kyiv needs even more firepower. Listen to this.

In total, we have just have over 100 tanks that have been promised. Among them are those 30 Abrams, 31 Abrams to be exact, tanks from the United States. Those could take over a year before they actually arrive in Ukraine. As you heard there, the Leopard tanks arriving sooner. But, this is a lot less than what President Zelenskyy says he needs. He was asking for over 300 tanks. And as I said, just over 100 going into Ukraine. But really, what this is about is the bigger picture here, Kim. This is about the political will of allies to provide tanks. Something that was unimaginable a year ago.

So, Barbie, a fascinating case in so many ways. What more we learning? BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (on camera):  Well, you know, as investigators are trying to interrogate him while he's in prison, they're also trying to unravel his life. They found three hideouts so far and they've given us a look at what they found inside. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (voice-over):  Infamous mafia boss, Matteo Messina Denaro's, arrest has taken Italy storm. Every detail of his life in hiding for the last 30 years, scrutinized to the nth degree. He may have been hiding from the law, but he certainly wasn't hidden away. Moments before his arrest on January 16, Messina Denaro can be seen in police video walking freely and alone into a private health care clinic in Palermo. Raids of three of 60-year-olds hideouts have turned up a collection of high-end sunglasses and other luxury goods. Journalists Roberto Saviano has been living under police protection since 2006 when he wrote his book about the mafia, \"Gomorrah.\" Authorities say that they also found a collection of movie memorabilia, including posters from the \"Joker\" and the \"Godfather.\" Saviano tells us that the \"Godfather\" movie is fundamental in the formation of Mafiosi. They see themselves in the portrayal of the inner conflicts, they live the same realities. But he also knows that the fact that Messina Denaro wasn't handcuffed after his arrest sends a message. Carabinieri wants to show the boss is totally collaborative, he tells us. Messina Denaro chose not to attended first court date last week, which is right under Italian law. His next court date is March 9th for the deadly bombings of two anti-mafia judges in Sicily in 1992. Prior to his arrest, the last time Messina Denaro was thought to have seen in public was a 1993. But it is becoming clear that he led an open life in the small town in Sicily where some of his alleged hideouts were found. And that the Omerta, the code of silence that protects Mafiosi also protected him. (END VIDEOTAPE) (on camera):  And you know, Kim, when you look at that, you know, the \"Godfather,\" \"Joker,\" all of that sort of stuff, is sort of art imitating life, life imitating art. But authorities aren't just focused on the stuff. They're trying to understand who's in charge now. The mafia still exists. It's still powerful, not as powerful perhaps was 30 years ago, but they want to know who's in charge and who's giving orders now, Kim. That is the priority, not necessarily all the movie posters and what they might mean.",

And I really bring that to the fashion industry. And then, from fashion, I feel like I'm really putting myself out there. I'm learning about resilience and I'm learning about confidence. And I can apply that into my school. So, it all goes in a circle. I guess, it's really connected.
