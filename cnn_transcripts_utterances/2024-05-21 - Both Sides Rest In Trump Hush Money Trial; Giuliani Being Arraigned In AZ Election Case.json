      "sentences": "It obviously was a bad decision. Robert Costello did not add anything to the defense and came off as hostile, nasty, combative, and untruthful. Within that though, I think his actual testimony is less important than we might make it out to be just, you know, it's the most recent thing that's happened. So I think we give it a false sense of importance.I think the fundamental problem with Robert Costello as a witness is a problem that infects the entire case here, which is for four and a half weeks, we have heard from grifters and liars and crooks and thieves and just slimy people doing cruddy things, and they are all Donald Trump's people. From, you know, Costello down to Cohen down to Pecker and, you know, you come away with the sense of this is just not how honest people do business. So if the juror says, after this in the course of deliberations, gosh, who would believe that Donald Trump would be associated with this? The answer is, all of these are Donald Trump's people. Prosecution didn't pick any of them. Donald Trump picked every single one.",

It's not supposed to matter if the jury deliberates and decides based on the specific instructions, which will no doubt be about the 34 counts and whether or not on each count, Donald Trump based on what the jury heard is guilty or not guilty.

And what I expect the defense to lay out are all the points that the defense believes that they scored and referring to each of those as reasonable doubts.Here's one, here's another. It's almost like those little cartoons when we were young, you would circle the rabbits on a cartoon page. That I think is what the defense strategy is going to be. Unfortunately, as one judge notably said, a criminal trial is not a search for reasonable doubt. It's a search for the truth. So I don't think the defense did well. I think the prosecution's case went in remarkably smoothly with only a couple of hiccups. And, you know, we'll see obviously what the jury does, what affects us is -- may well not be what affects individual jurors and the jury as a whole.",

But what might very well happen next, especially since Trump's other criminal cases are on pause and Todd Blanche isn't required in any of them, is the judge could schedule a retrial for July (ph). Or he could schedule a retrial for August a while ago in front of Judge Cannon.I believe it was Todd Blanche said he's available August 12th. So that would not be a good thing for Donald Trump or the defense. It's another example of be careful what it is you wish for. It's one thing to hope for a mistrial, it's another to actually want a mistrial.",

This is Rudy's, I believe I'm counting right, second pending indictment.He's indicted in Georgia as well. He's been listed as a co- conspirator, unindicted in Jack Smith's federal case. So Rudy's legal problems just keep piling up. I mean, even moving beyond the criminal world. He's been hit with monstrous civil verdicts, including something $140 million plus for defamation of the two Georgia election workers, Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman. He has still -- he's still a defendant in the defamation cases filed by the voting rights -- or not voting rights, the voting technology company, Smartmatic, Dominion. So he's been -- he's lost his law license, he's got all sorts of problems. I don't know what the end game is here.

Arizona, you're talking about defendants who were charged, all of them, forgery, conspiracy, fraud, all trying to establish that he in fact was victor. He was not. And there is no evidence the contrary to support that he in fact did win. This is so important because when we look at all the people that have had to move, whether it's Michigan or Georgia or even Arizona, there have been some who've already pled guilty to the actions.One person who's a co-defendant in this case now is Election Integrity Council for the RNC. Another person I think is, you know, is involved in the campaign as well in some degree. There's so many people who are still very much active in the political world right now and the consequences of this, extraordinary. At the end of the day, remember, this is the former man who was called America's mayor. This is somebody who, as Elie talked about, is an attorney. People who knew better, people who are taking actions to undermine the allegedly the integrity of our elections and here we had yet another state and an important one, the swing state.

That now is not going to happen of course. The judge also, in this case, Judge McAfee, also going before the voters. So again, a reminder that Georgia law, like many other states, the prosecutors are elected officials and the judges also have to stand for a retention. He was appointed by Republican Governor Brian Kemp. But, look, what this has happened in Georgia, it is still a battleground state. Presidentially speaking, it's not near the top here. It's not one that President Biden has to win to hold on. But we'll be watching that tonight. She is expected to win.

Donald Trump himself is still out there as he did in Minnesota on Friday night lying, saying he won Minnesota. He didn't. Today he did an interview in Pennsylvania, lying, saying he won Pennsylvania in 2020. He didn't. You have these fake electors. You have this case in Georgia where these folks are up for election that are involved in it, but that is about the 2020 race.
