This also happened in 2015 during the Syrian civil war and it seemed to work for a number of years to avoid that possibility again of Russian aircraft and U.S. aircraft colliding potentially over areas of conflict.And it's also important to note that this is not unusual. It is common for U.S. and Russian aircraft to intercept each other over the Black Sea. It has happened several times just in the last few weeks. So, it is concerning of course to U.S. officials and Russian officials that this happened, that this occurred despite these diplomatic channels, despite these communication channels.

And I want to show you this, in Massachusetts, just 14 miles between Paxson and Shrewsbury -- 14 miles -- a 20-inch difference, Paxson 23 inches, 3.1 in Shrewsbury.And we still have snow falling with this area of low pressure off the East Coast. Quite a bit of it falling in parts of northern New England this morning where it is dropping visibilities down now to roughly about 9 miles. But I've seen it as low as 7. So, visibility down, snow falling, slick roadway, travel just not advised out here. Snow continues to fall through the morning and into the afternoon especially across northern New Hampshire and Vermont. These areas will likely pick up through the higher elevations another foot of snow on top of what we've already picked up. Widespread about another 2 to 4 inches. Regardless it is heavy wet snow. And when we factor in the wind gusts of over 50 miles per hour -- just as Derek was mentioning -- more widespread power outages are going to become a big problem because it weighs down the power lines. And also, likely to see some tree limbs breaking off and falling once again. So, keep that in mind too if you have to go out and about. On top of it all -- we have quite a bit to talk about -- we still have that original AR, that atmospheric river, so flooding is still a big problem in areas in red. That's like moderate risk for flash flooding. Well, we have that along the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and down along the southern coastline of California this morning where areas have already picked up inches of rain. Daily records have been broken especially down toward L.A. and San Diego. Flood watches are still in effect as of now. They will slowly start to expire through the morning. There's that heavy rain. A quarter of an inch an hour is expected in places like L.A. and down into San Diego. You will see the yellows, that's a heavy. That is going to be and on- going situation for the rest of the morning and that's when is expected to be at its heaviest. Once we move into the latter part of the morning local time and into the afternoon, that rain really starts to taper back and we watch this system continue to track farther east and all of the moisture here sets up for the threat of severe weather across parts of the southern plains here in the upcoming 24 hours -- Max, Bianca.",

So, there's all that going on.But meanwhile I think what Moody's has done is interesting because it shows that there are despite those emergency actions by the federal government which really did stave off so far at least more bank runs, there is still concern about the health of the banking sector as a whole. And especially as the Fed raises rates which given the inflation data that we got yesterday, despite it being lower for an eighth straight month on an annual basis, it still, in economists words, sticky. It still affects things that people use every day. The core inflation if you strip out food and energy is still -- it actually accelerated on a month by month basis. But there still sort of elements because it's still triple the fed's targets. So that did raise the likelihood certainly in the eyes of the market that the Fed will raise rates next week at least by a quarter percentage point.

Flashing red lights indicating that there is a system that is on the edge of something much worse. You know, there's an expression in aviation, the rules are written in blood. It's kind of a morbid expression, but the idea is that accidents lead to rules which make things safer. Let's hope in this case we're talking about a series of near misses that ultimately lead to making things safer. The bottom line is that on the runway is a difficult place to be, it is a very challenging place to be, it's always been very dangerous. The FAA has focused on it for years. But it appears that people have gotten a little bit lackadaisical. What we don't have the capability of doing in this country is adding concrete, making new runways, making more space for planes to land at these very busy airports.

CNN's Josh Campbell reports.JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Shots fired midday on a California college campus. The start of a rampage by an active shooter as students and teachers flee for safety, responding officers engaged the gunman. Following him into the school library. Police resources flood the campus by air and ground, specially trained S.W.A.T. officers begin arriving on scene. Then the tactical teams in. An officer radios that the threat has been neutralized but the work is far from over. A calvary of firefighters and paramedics staging nearby rush in to triage and administer first aid. This is only an exercise. An empty college campus on spring break turned into a simulated warzone as police and first responders hone their life saving skills. This type of training has become the new normal in an age of endless mass shootings in the United States.",

But other measures pressed for by gun safety advocates remain perpetually stalled. Including national red flag laws, universal background checks and assault weapons ban. Many in law enforcement have long been advocating for a ban including the International Association of Chiefs of Police who say the criminal use of semiautomatic assault weapons pose a grave risk to our officers and the communities they are sworn to protect. A group recommending college campus officers also support as ban on military style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines for civilian use.",
