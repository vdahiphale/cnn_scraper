There is the split, the Dow is off, but the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P are higher, not huge gains, but then after yesterday, I think, taking a chance for a bit of a breather on the upside. The markets as they're trading in the last hour and the events that we are looking at. We aren't apologizing for prioritizing American manufacturing. That's President Biden to President Macron of France. The leaders pledging to find ways to include European allies in American investments. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, SBF says he won't stop talking, despite legal advice telling him to shut up. And Germany is fighting for its World Cup future, but it is complicated. They hopefully you have the mathematics as to how they'll do it. We all live in New York, the last month of the year. Where did it go? For goodness sake. It is Thursday, December 1st, I am Richard Quest and as we head out to December, I mean business. Good evening. It is a unanimous message from the US and French Presidents. They say they are working hand in hand despite a simmering trade disagreement. Joe Biden welcomed Emmanuel Macron to the White House with a full 21-gun salute. In a few hours, they will sit down to a State dinner, buttered lobster and sparkling wine will be on the menu tonight. Behind the warm welcome, there is a disagreement over US subsidies for American-made electric cars, and President Macron says US protectionism could fragment the West. Speaking at the White House, he called for better cooperation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator):\tWe want to succeed together, not one against the other. It has been clear -- this is - - the outcome of our discussions this morning and this is exactly the philosophy that I share and it is the one that we need. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The President did say that he \"makes no apologies\" for this Inflation Reduction Act, which of course, he hastouted as this historic, you know, largest climate investment in United States history. But at the same time, he did try and smooth things over. I do think that there was an effort here to try and take some of the air out of the tensions between the US and France on this issue. The President said that he acknowledged that there were some \"glitches in the law\" and he also said that he believes that there are tweaks that can be made to accommodate Europe and its concerns of being left out of these efforts to transition essentially, to a greener economy. So, there was an effort there, it does seem to try and reduce some of those tensions, acknowledge that there are things that can be changed here, and the French President for his part, he repeatedly talked about resynchronizing, the relationship, particularly on this front. And what he also said was that he believes that while this law will hurt industry in Europe, industries that are trying to move towards green energy, he said that he didn't believe that it was the intention of the Biden administration for that to be the result. So, the question now is, what can they actually do? Because this is enshrined in legislation, there is this working group between the United States and Europe to try and resolve this issue. So, we'll have to see exactly what they're able to do, whether via executive action, or if somehow Congress has to try and take action again.",

And it is asking not just the United States should allow for a level playing field as the world tries to get back to something like business as usual or beyond the war, economies that can flourish once again. But it is also concerned about the fact that it is not being given much help with energy prices. And of course, these are things that have a direct impact on electorates, Richard, poorer economies, people struggling to pay rent, inflation, high energy prices, this is hurting European politicians and worrying them a great deal and I think that's what is behind his going there with such tough words.

(Begin VT) SAM BANKMAN-FRIED, FOUNDER, FTX: I mean, look, I've had a bad month. CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Disgraced FTX founder and ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried speaking out on camera for the first time since he resigned after the implosion of his multibillion dollar empire. BANKMAN-FRIED: I'm down to one working credit card left. I think it might be $100,000.00 or something like that. ROMANS (voice over): Bankman-Fried who was known as crypto's white knight sitting for a wide ranging interview at \"The New York Times\" DealBook Summit. Speaking about FTX's liquidity crisis and bankruptcy filing. BANKMAN-FRIED: I didn't ever try to commit fraud on anyone. ROMANS (voice over): The collapse of FTX is under civil and Federal investigations into whether FTX misappropriated customers funds when it made loans to his hedge fund, Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried addressing this -- BANKMAN-FRIED: I didn't knowingly commingle funds. I was frankly surprised by how big Alameda's position was. ROMANS (voice over): Bankman-Fried now acknowledging the lack of corporate controls and risk management within the businesses he oversaw. BANKMAN-FRIED: Look, I screwed up like, I was CEO. I was the CEO of FTX, and I mean, I say this again and again, that that means I had a responsibility, that means that I was responsible. Ultimately, there was no person who is chiefly in charge of positional risk of customers on FTX and that feels pretty embarrassing in retrospect. ROMANS (voice over): FTX, which was once marketed as an easy way for people to get into crypto using star athletes like Tom Brady, Naomi Osaka, and Steph Curry and even a Super Bowl ad with Larry David, to amplify the platform.

I think themost important part here is, it's very difficult to assess the subsidies part or the investment flows. What is important is that, at least right now, governments are talking about helping the transition to the green economy. I think that's the positive side of this conversation. We are seeing governments trying to facilitate with incentives, with developing the infrastructure. And all of that is extremely important. I was in Sharm el-Sheikh a few weeks back for COP27. And we see a mind shift. It was all about commitments; now it's about action. And the private sector was very much there, right? Trying to be active, to be vocal. So I think that shift is very healthy. And we are doing everything we can to help in that sense. We need to be perceived as part of the solution to this. I think that's where we should be focusing as far as the conversation is concerned.",

But they areslow, they sometimes take a long time to get policies in place. The private sector does not have the luxury to wait for that. We do not, as the international community, wait for a long time. We have to take action now. In fact I will share with you news about PepsiCo tonight. In Reno, Nevada, we are receiving the first batch of electric trucks from Tesla. They are just 36 but they are very important in our journey. We have the largest fleet in North America. We have 80,000 vehicles in North America and we need to shift to electric as quickly as possible. So we hope that our action, together with others, will bump up supply. We need to scale up the supply of electric vehicles fast. And we cannot wait any longer. So we must be doing everything we can here. Everybody has a role to play here. I think the private sector, PepsiCo, is definitely taking a part here.",
