In just nine days voters will decide key races at the state and national levels, including who controls the House and Senate. Top power brokers for both parties are fanning out across the country. Former Presidents Trump and Obama will lend their influence in tight races, as will President Biden. Barack Obama is on a five-state tour to rally support for Democrats. He campaigned in Georgia Friday and in Wisconsin and Michigan yesterday. And Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is also on the stump this weekend. The rising GOP star rallied support for Lee Zeldin in the race for New York governor. In Georgia, more than 1.6 million people have already cast their votes as of yesterday. CNN's Nadia Romero shows us how churches are mobilizing their faithful. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADIA ROMERO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): It is the last Sunday of early voting here in Georgia. Traditionally called Souls to the Polls here and that means that people from black churches. Once church lets out Sunday service, they head on over to the polls either in a stroll or walk or they're bussed over together as a group to vote in that next election. That's what's happening all throughout today on Sunday. And it is so important to keep that vote for this community, a community that makes up a great percentage of voters here in the state of Georgia, and that's what we're hearing from a senior pastor with Beulah Missionary Baptist Church in Decatur, Georgia, just outside of Atlanta. I want you to hear from Deacon Brown, 99 years old, on Friday, it was his birthday and he made sure he voted. We also spoke with other people in the congregation to tell us why it is so important to keep up this right to vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DEACON RALPH BROWN, 99-YEAR-OLD VOTER: There was a time when we were called all different kind of names and there was even a time when they gave us money to keep our mouths shut. JO HANDY-SEWELL, DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL JUSTICE MINISTRY, BEULAH BAPTIST MISSIONARY CHURCH: The intimidation here in Georgia is subtle. You take the drop boxes away.

So we made some changes in the SB202 Election Integrity Act which basically allows counties to begin to process and tabulate the votes on election morning, including early voting. It was unclear in the law before. So we should have a very good indication of where a lot of the votes are lying.Now the issue we have is, given the last four years and two years, it used to be that Republicans and Democrats used different ways of voting essentially the same. But now Democrats are much more likely to vote by absentee, Republicans are much more likely to vote in person on election day. So those buckets of votes will swing the amounts of votes people see on election night. So it really depends upon the voters and how much they're turning out one way or the other.",

And that was sort of the genesis of this. And over the last year and a half, it has just gradually gotten worse and worse. Our sources have told us that Trump has been griping to aides about Ron DeSantis, saying that he really owes his political rise and stardom to Donald Trump and his endorsement in the 2018 gubernatorial primary.And that spilled out into the open this week when DeSantis decided to endorse Joe O'Dea. He's a Republican candidate for senate in Colorado, somebody who Trump just days before DeSantis endorsed him said was a RINO Republican, didn't belong in the Republican conference, let alone in the Senate. So for DeSantis to go out and endorse him just a couple days after the former president said that, it did not go unnoticed by Donald Trump. And it really took this tension that had been existing behind the scenes into public view and, you know, a week later, Donald Trump was announcing a rally in Florida where DeSantis was not invited. He was not mentioned in the invitation or in the rally announcement, and I think a lot of people looked at this and said, we're barely over the midterms. I mean, we haven't even reached election day. 2024 is already getting ugly. Both of these men are widely expected to run for president and if they can't contain the tension between them a weak out from election day, just how nasty is this going to get once election day is over and the presidential primary starts to heat up.",
