There are -- there were a lot of law enforcement agencies on the scene. You said there were more than 300 responders from different agencies. And what's necessary is for them to all train together, not for the first time when the incident occurs. So that if everybody trains together and gets the equipment that the various different local agencies have, in the right place, at the right time, that's a way to protect ourselves in the future.

So this is Trump's attorney asking her questions. It's something that's really significant in the course of a proceeding where you're talking about sexual abuse, right?That was the core of the trial back in the spring. Now they're just talking about damages. But everything that she has said on the stand, no matter how difficult that has been for her, is now subject to cross examination by a defense attorney. So it's not always a very pleasant experience for the witness. And the Trump defense is largely that while she is arguing she is owed damages because of what happened to her career and her reputation after he attacked her publicly, they're arguing that no, in fact, your career prospered. So, Alina Habba, Trump's attorney, asked her questions about how much money she was making at the height of her career. We learned she made about $400,000 in one year at her peak in the 1990s. A significant amount of money. But they argue that by 2018, her career had dwindled. She was making about $60,000 through her work at Elle Magazine. And then in 2019, Habba points out that's when E. Jean Carroll decided to publish a book and talk about her allegations against Trump. So they're trying to insinuate, right, that she made these allegations to revive her career. She also testified that she now makes about $100,000 from Substack, so her newsletter. And she also has a much larger social media following, but E. Jean Carroll also testified that even though she has a bigger profile, she would gladly return to the reputation that she had before he attacked her. Now, going forward, we do expect here for some additional witnesses right now. They were hearing from a professor, an expert who testified at the trial in the spring about how much she should be owed in damages. They also expect to hear from Robbie Myers, Carroll's former boss, but the judge hasn't ruled on whether they will hear from other Trump accusers. So that's still an open question. Now I also want to note, Carroll's lawyers also had a chance to do redirect and they brought up a clip of Trump's press availability. I won't call it a press conference because I was there and he didn't take any questions last night. And that's significant because one of the themes of the case is they're arguing that not only did he defame her in 2019 and then again in 2023, but he continues to do so as recently as yesterday. So they played a portion of that statement, and clearly the goal of that statement was to attack the judge and cherry pick things that E. Jean Carroll had said to paint a very unflattering portrait of her.",
