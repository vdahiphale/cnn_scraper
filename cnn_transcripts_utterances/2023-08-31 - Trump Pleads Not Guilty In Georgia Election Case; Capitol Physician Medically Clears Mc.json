We start today with our law and justice lead and a not guilty pleafrom Donald Trump in the sprawling 2020 election case in Fulton County, Georgia. The former president, of course, faces more than a dozen charges there, including racketeering for his alleged efforts to steal Georgia's electoral votes, despite Joe Biden wining the state over and over. It is still unclear when Trump will go on trial in this case. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has asked the judge to schedule a trial for all 19 defendants including Donald Trump for October 23rd of this year. That's less than two months away. Today, Trump formally asked to separate his case from the codefendants who are asking for a speedy trial and other codefendants who are trying to get their cases moved to federal court. We'll get to all of that in a moment. But, first, today one of the longest sentences yet for a January 6th rioter was handed down. Joe Biggs, a leader of the so-called Proud Boys, was sentenced to 17 years in prison. Biggs plotted with other members of the far right militia to storm the U.S. Capitol and he led a group of violent rioters to the Capitol on January 6th. Let's get straight to CNN's Sara Murray. Sara, Biggs was convicted on serious charges including seditious conspiracy or conspiring to overthrow the U.S. government.",

And Biggs did make a tearful appeal to the court today, essentially saying he wants the ability to be able to pick his daughter off and take her to school.And the judge essentially said, look, you guys, as part of the Proud Boys, were part of the group that broke the tradition of this peaceful transfer of power and then issued a hefty sentence to go along with that, Jake.",

He says he has another trial going on shortly before that and they said it was essentially infringe on Donald Trump's constitutional right to force him to go to trial in that timeline. Again, we're still waiting for the judge to weigh in on this. Other than the folks who have asked for this speedy trial, we haven't really heard from the judge about how he plans to handle the other defendants in this case.

Remember that the special purpose of a grand jury working under the direction of the district attorney met for about eight months to consider the case and she's been investigating this particular case for about 2-1/2 years. So you can think about the volume of materials out there.And the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution gives every defendant a right to have effective counsel. And so, you can't be effective if you don't have time to prepare. So, by sort of lobbing this argument out there, his lawyer doing the right thing and saying, look, if you don't give me time to prepare I'm not effective. That sets up a possible appeal should there be a conviction. I -- just as a practical matter, there's no way that the judge is going to hold him and his right under the Constitution to be prepared to that date be -- even though the court is bound now that there has been a request for a speedy trial file by some defendants. That case has to be heard, has to be started in October, or else as a matter of law, those defendants would be acquitted and found not guilty. So, it wasn't really a move by the D.A. or a move by the court. The law says the case has to start then. Simply because two or three people may want to avail themselves of that right under the Speedy Trial Act, that doesn't mean that the constitutional rights to have more time and sufficient time to prepare would be infringed on.

Like you said convicted of first-degree murder a little over two weeks ago and he was found guilty of stabbing his girlfriend back in 2021 to death 38 times in front of her children.

Here's an opportunity for you to respond to the skeptics what do they need to know? GOV. JOSH GREEN (D), HAWAII:  Well, I appreciate it, Jake. Of course, people are traumatized and we're in the era of mistrust and I respect that. I come at it more as a physician than as a politician and people know that of me. We have to deliver services for people. This is a tragedy beyond anything we have ever experienced. We already have gotten through after 23 days the recovery phase. We have lost 115 souls but we're starting already to also look at the rebuilding. I know people worry that they're going to not be able to get into their properties. As soon as it's safe from the standpoint of the EPA, we want people in there so that they can get closure.

Also, I want to share with people right now one of the things that we don't talk much about but we're doing, and that is we're doing everything we can to prevent predators from coming in, stealing people's land, buying it up at pennies on the dollar while they're struggling and suffering to pay their bills. We've actually made it a penalty, a year in prison, and up to $5,000 in fines for every time someone reaches out to try to take someone's property. And then finally, this is an important thing I would like to emphasize here nationally, I want to know -- I want people to know that I'm concerned about outside interests coming in as predators in a legal way. And we're going to do what we can to protect against that, too, not unlike we did as a country with 9/11. We want to make sure that people who have damages are protected, so we're looking and studying how we can do that. Again, people should ask those hard questions about how they can trust.
