Obviously, the governor would have information because I'm sure that he is in touch with the command post to try to, you know, get more information on what's going on.But right now I just don't know. You could have an active shooter there. You could have someone who fired a shot and then later, you know, left the campus area. We see a couple cars now starting to leave.

You can see in can you see in this reaction here a measure of just how tuned in to this kind of threat and the way and how quickly perhaps and with what sort of number and what sort of resource that law enforcement responds to reports of an active shooter like this?",

      "sentences": "Yes, you know, this is a well rehearsed, unfortunately, response for law enforcement now. We know as you suggested, Jim, that the time of response is absolutely essential to keep the victim countdown if you have an active shooter situation. So it's not surprising at all to see a massive response. You can see in the shot there, there are UNC, so University police vehicles, there are also Chapel Hill City Police vehicles there. I would expect there are probably also police from all kind of local departments have probably responded. This tends to bring out a massive and very quick response.Now, we haven't heard from any witnesses that saw a shooter or a shooting take place. But if there is a photograph circulating online, law enforcement are clearly still -- you know, they've got some sort of intelligence that they're working on. And as the chief said, this sort of response is to do a very methodical clear through any building that you have any sort of witness even potentially positive identifications associated with. Every one of those buildings is going to be checked room by room, closet by closet, door by door. So you will probably see tactical officers kind of circulating in the background. You'll see more folks leaving buildings with their hands up. And that is, you know, of course, not to treat them harshly, it's to clearly identify them as bystanders and people who are not involved in the event. Just to put some context on it. Chapel Hill is an incredibly astute university, about 20,000 undergrads, about another 10,000 or 11,000 graduate students added to that population. It's set in just an absolute beautiful, bucolic location right there in Chapel Hill. It's hard to say, you know, and when you're there, it's hard to actually delineate where the university stops and the city begins. It's also surrounded by a residential community. So my point is the places that a lone shooter could hide or escape to very quickly are innumerable. So this search could be going on for quite some time.",

      "sentences": "That's absolutely right. And law enforcement officers know that, you know, a great percentage of the intelligence, the information that you get immediately in a crisis situation like this will turn out to be incorrect. Nevertheless, they have nothing -- there's nothing else they can do but to react to every single witness sighting, something somebody heard, something they maybe thought they saw out of the corner of their eye. Every single report like that needs to be looked into.You will recall many of these horrific mass shootings that we have unfortunately had to cover in the last several years, it's very frequent to hear the initial reports are more than one shooter. And almost all the time it ends up being only one shooter. So law enforcement has got to act on all of that information and the burden becomes the search, right? That methodical, logical, careful search of every location, every structure. It's an incredibly intense thing to go through as a member of one of those tactical teams. Because you literally don't know what you're going to see around every corner, through every door. At any moment, an armed gunman who has the advantage of secrecy and has a little bit of time on you, can really pop out of any corner and engage in a firefight. And that's of course what law enforcement is trying so hard to avoid. It's an incredibly intense terrifying moment for everyone. For the witnesses first and foremost, but of course law enforcement as well.",

This is the second Monday of the semester, and students are dealing with this now. We've been looking at live images from our local affiliate WTVD and WRAL of what appeared to be a very chaotic situation early on, with the heavy police presence and included ambulances there on the scene. That has become a starkly different seen now as you see students in backpacks casually walking up and down the sidewalks there on campus. The initial report said that this incident took place at the Bell Tower area of the campus, which is the central part of UNC Chapel Hill along South Road, which is one of the main thoroughfares there on UNC. Students describing their anxiety, saying that they are very much so terrified because there's scarce information coming out from police. We saw images of students being led from buildings there on campus hurriedly rushing away from those buildings with their hands up. Again, this scene has become very different now as we're looking at a student there in a backpack which seems to be -- who appears to be on the phone. But this incident is still very much so active. We've heard Governor Roy Cooper tweeting about this, putting it on his X account that they're dedicating any and all resources. But very interestingly to note here, guys, UNC Hospital -- you could see it there on our banner -- saying they've received no patients from this, quote, active shooter situation so far. Campus police initially said that there were some reports of shots fired around the 1:00 p.m. Eastern hour.
