      "sentences": "Milton has already proven to be a powerful hurricane, rapidly intensifying and exploding instrength. While the entire Florida peninsula will see impacts of damaging winds and heavy rain from Milton, the exact location of landfall will be crucial for where the life-threatening storm surge will occur. Storm surge is the push of ocean water inland from the strong hurricane winds. The highest storm surge is at the location of the strongest winds in the eye wall. Tampa Bay is one of the most vulnerable spots on our coast to storm surge because of the huge population and the shape of the bay. The track of Milton could be one Tampa Bay hasn`t seen in 100 years, meaning unprecedented storm surge. If Milton`s eye goes just to the north of the bay, that would mean a worst- case scenario for the storm surge in Tampa Bay. The onshore wind direction will send the ocean waters funneling into the bay with nowhere to go, creating devastating impacts. If Milton`s eye lands just south of the bay, winds will be offshore out of the bay, possibly even receding waters like seen during Hurricane Ian. In this scenario, the worst of the storm surge would go just south of Tampa. Even just a few miles wobble in Milton`s track could greatly impact the storm surge forecast for better or for worse. So all warnings should be taken seriously. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

To prepare for long seasonal migrations, many bird species enter what state of being to bulk up for their journey?Brumation, predation, hypophagia, or hyperphagia? Your answer here is hyperphagia. Just like bears who eat large amounts of food before hibernation, migrating birds overeat to gain weight and store fat for their long journeys. Man versus nature. It`s a tale almost as old as time. Humans and animals sometimes compete for land and resources. Well, that`s the case in one town in Argentina where thousands of parrots have moved in. Normally these feathery friends would pass right through the town as they migrated, but as the birds` natural habitats have been destroyed through deforestation, they`ve been staying longer and longer. CNN`s Elisa Raffa has the perspicacity to further explain how residents are putting up with their pesky parrot problem. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFFA (voice-over):  The town of Hilario Ascasubi is facing a parrot invasion. Thousands of the multicolored birds have increasingly occupied this Argentinian city in a site similar to that of Alfred Hitchcock`s 1963 thriller, \"The Birds.\" In recent years, the parrots have arrived in pursuit of shelter through the fall and winter months, but now, it`s spring in Argentina, a biologist at the National University of the South says the parrots have come due to disappearing trees along the hillsides. DAIANA LERA, BIOLOGIST (through translator): Estimates say that 4 percent of the forest is lost annually in the south of the province of Buenos Aires. It is causing the parrots to have no food available, and they are increasingly moving closer to the cities where they find food, shelter, and water. RAFFA (voice-over): The parrots, however, have become pests, residents citing a whole range of annoyances, with the birds continuous shrieking, harming electric cables, and leaving deposits of bird droppings everywhere. Despite the various tactics residents have used to scare them away, nothing has worked. RAMON ALVAREZ, RADIO TAXI FM JOURNALIST (through translator): They bite and damage the cables. Water can then get into the wires when it rains and transmission is cut off. These parrots create daily costs and problems for us. It goes without saying that when the power goes out, there is no radio. RAFFA (voice-over): Argentina`s forest land has been gradually lost over the years, but Biologist Lera believes there are proactive steps the residents can take to both restore the environment and allow them to live in peace with the pesky parrots.

      "sentences": "While humans and animals might sometimes find themselves at odds, there are ways we can benefit from working together. In Colombia, aninnovative project to combat the growing problem of trash buildup is enlisting the help of the enormous rhinoceros beetle. Their larvae eat through piles of organic garbage, diverting it from landfills. CNN`s Rafael Romo shows us how it`s done. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In the Colombian highlands, a new solution has been found to tackle an escalating trash problem. These are the unlikely heroes of the story: the larvae of rhinoceros beetles, which feed on organic waste. This isn`t the only thing these beetles have to offer. Larvae poop is also sold as fertilizer, and once the beetles reach adulthood, they can be sold as pets to buyers as far away as Japan. GERMAN VIASUS TIBAMOSO, ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH ENGINEER (through translator):  The beetles have the answer, but we haven`t seen the full potential of the function they have. ROMO (voice-over):  Every week 15 tons of waste are collected at this facility in Tunja, a city about 130 kilometers Northeast of Bogota. Once it`s piled up, the larvae, which can grow as long as a human hand, begin. Other larvae are placed in tanks where they consume liquid organic waste that, that can be harmful to the environment. With the landfill close to capacity, the larvae provide an ingenious solution. The U.N. estimates that around 11.2 billion tons of trash are generated globally each year. Colombia produces around 32,000 tons of waste daily, about half of which is organic. TIBAMOSO (through translator):  We should aim to preserve beetles because they are responsible for breaking down all the organic waste produced by humanity today. ROMO (voice-over):  The larvae start to become beetles after about four months when they develop hard shells. Rhinoceros beetles can live up to three years. Some are exported to other countries while others stay in Columbia, where they are seen as good luck charms. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Known as castells, human towers play a bigpart in Catalan culture and are known for an expression of national optimism.

They watched 42 teams fight for the prize of just over $15,000. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
