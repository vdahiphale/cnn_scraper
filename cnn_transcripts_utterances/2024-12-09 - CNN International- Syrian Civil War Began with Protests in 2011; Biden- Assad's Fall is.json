Well, celebrations across the country over the ouster of Bashar Al Assad in the end of his tyrannical rule. Thousands who have been forcibly separated from their loved ones can finally reunite, and potentially millions who've been forced to leave their homes may finally be able to go back. It is a new reality, but one that comes with great uncertainty about the country's future and crucially, who will govern it? Well, the fall of Assad happening with lightning speed. An alliance of rebel forces seized the capital with little resistance just 11 days after sweeping through the North Aleppo and other major cities, the leader of the main rebel group calls Assad's ouster a quote victory for the entire Islamic nation. Well, the Kremlin says Assad and his family fled to safety in Russia and have been granted asylum by Russia's President, the spokesperson not commenting on Assad's whereabouts.

They're lining up for gas. They are trying to make sure that they have enough food to ride out this transitional period where nobody really knows what's going to happen. Now, you can see behind me at the end of the road there, that is the Central Bank of Syria. Yesterday there was extensive moving there. A lot of people in the city started to feel a little bit concerned that this was going to be a chaotic period. The more rebels arrived in the capital; the looting appears to have stopped. It does seem very calm on the streets. Of course, there are many people who are elated that Bashar Al Assad is finally gone. But there is also the day-to-day that people need to focus on to ensure that they have enough bread, enough gas, enough cash, enough supplies to get them through this tenuous transitional period.

The Russians also saying that it was Vladimir Putin himself who signed on Bashar Al Assad and members of his family being able to come here and being granted asylum inside Russia, as the Russians say, for humanitarian reasons. Now, of course, for the Russians, all of this could have very big repercussions. At the same time, the Russians do understand that there is a new reality on the ground in Syria. As of this morning, the flag of the Syrian opposition flies above the Embassy here in Moscow. And we asked here at the Embassy, and folks here told us that the Embassy is actually working as normally, even though, the transition in Syria is already very much taking place. For the Russians however, they were one of the biggest backers of the Assad Regime, and of course, still have major military assets inside Syria as well. They have an air base in -- close to Latakia, which is very important for them, not just for air operations in Syria, but also to project power into the Mediterranean and even all the way into Africa. And of course, they have a major naval base in Tartus and -- just last week conducted big naval exercises, firing some high-powered missiles from ships inside the Mediterranean Sea. The Russians admitting that for them, it's unclear what the future of those military bases will be. They say a lot of that depends on who will have power in Syria in the future.

The Israeli Prime Minister sent Israeli troops into that buffer zone yesterday after he said that the Syrian troops on the other end of it had abandoned their positions changing a dynamic that has existed over just over 50 years now where neither Israeli nor Syrian troops have been inside of that zone. But Israeli troops are also now coming beyond -- going beyond that buffer zone into Syrian territory to take up strategic positions there. The Israeli military says that it is in order to protect communities like this one right here in the Golan Heights. But in addition to that, as you said, Israel is certainly taking advantage of not only the fall of the Assad Regime to get rid of -- to carry out airstrikes on strategic weaponry, air defense systems missiles that are stored inside of Syria by the Syrian governments. And also, presumably to go after any Hezbollah and Iranian targets inside of Syria at this moment of weakness for that Iranian access. The real question, I think is first of all, how deep into Syria will Israeli troops ultimately go? And then also, what kind of neighbor will Israel actually end up with inside of Syria? We heard the Israeli Prime Minister yesterday extending a hand of peace. He said to that, the future leaders of Syria, but what kind of neighbors will Israel actually have, and what will their position be towards Israel after 50 years of a regime that ultimately maintained a kind of peaceful -- with Israel during the course of half century Becky.",

It lasted for five decades, only to fall with stunning speed, accused of severe and repeated human rights violations and inhumane assaults against civilians for years.

RIFAAT ASSAD, BASHAR AL ASSAD'S UNCLE: Hafez was a leader, the head of the entire regime while Bashar never came close to that. ROBERTSON (voice-over): At first, the new president agreed to modest reforms and released hundreds of political prisoners. But that brief moment of optimism dubbed the Damascus Spring ended abruptly. Protest demanding change spread across Syria in early 2011. The regime cracked down, turning, peaceful, protest into slaughter. The UN found what it called massive evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity, responsibility at the highest level of government, including the head of state. The chaos spawned countless local militias and opposition forces. In the mayhem, the Ultraviolent Islamist Group, ISIS gained a temporary foothold, spewing its nihilistic terror over the border into Iraq. U.S. and Iraqi forces confronted and ultimately crushed them, but didn't challenge Assad's brutal authority. Russia too joined the fight. Assad and his allies, Hezbollah from Lebanon and Iranian militia were losing ground, committing more forces than any other country with barbaric, internationally condemned ground and air assaults, Russia turned the tide in Assad's favor. But when Russia's forces went to war in Ukraine in 2022, the clock on Assad's rule began ticking down. By late 2024, his other main allies, Iran and Hezbollah, were blooded by over a year long war with Israel. Assad's fortunes plummeted. Former Al Qaeda turned nationalist Islamists Hayat Tahrir Al Sham surged out of their northern enclave, exploiting Assad's allies' weakness overrunning the country. Within two weeks, Assad had fled to Russia, ending his family's half century ruthless repression of the Syrian people. His life in exile begins living in the shadow of fear.

I mean, this will be intriguing for our viewers around the world. Why is it proving so difficult for police to track this man down? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Because he planned it and maintained a high level of discipline to make it that way. The idea that he was on the ground 10 days in New York City, that he came in on a bus from somewhere else, that in those 10 days going all over the city, retrieving all of this video of him passing by, walking down the street in a McDonald's, having coffee. He never really takes down that mask except one time in the hotel where you can see a partial view of his face. And these new pictures from inside the taxi, you can look right into his eyes, but you haven't seen him in any case, without a hood without a mask with a full headshot where you could see what he looks like. He's been extraordinarily careful and fingerprints lifted from the phone, did not register in the automated fingerprint information system that tracks people arrested for serious crimes or convicted. The DNA preliminary tests are done, but probably have the later results back on Tuesday, but so far, nothing. It's going to be difficult. But with the pictures, they're hoping somebody's going to call because if you know him, you would know him.",

President-Elect Donald Trump outlined some of his priorities once he becomes U.S. President during whatwas his first major television interview since last month's election. It was a sit down with NBC News. And the president-elect said he will look at issuing pardons to January 6th, rioters on his first day back in office. But he is leaving room for his appointees to decide whether to go after those who led investigations into his conduct during the Capitol attack. Trump was pressed on whether he'd direct his picks to send political opponents to jail? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL-ELECT: For what they did.",

      "sentences": "Now, Trump had previously said that he would support trying to protect Dreamers during his first term as well. Butthen he also tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program and Obama era program that really would've protected Dreamers that was later struck down by the court. So, we'll see what this could look like in a second term, but I think it's clear that Donald Trump as he's having these conversations since he got elected, he's having some political considerations about what this could mean as well. Now I also want to talk about another major issue that Donald Trump addressed during this \"Meet the Press\" interview. And that was whether he wanted to double down on his claims to seek retribution against political opponents. Trump said that he does not plan to go after directly President Joe Biden. However, he did leave the door open to allow some of his political appointees and people like Pam Bondi he has picked to leave the Department of Justice as well as Kash Patel has picked to leave the FBI really giving them kind of a broad authority to go after whoever they believe maybe had committed crimes or acted in a corrupt manner. He also talked about wanting to issue January 6th pardons on day one. Again, this is something that Donald Trump had repeatedly vowed to do throughout his time on the campaign trail, but it's been unclear really ever since he won the election, how he would do that. He didn't really get into the specifics during this interview, but I will say from my conversations with Trump's team, there are two different thoughts about how to go about it. Some people believe that really, he should have these wide pardons sweeping pardons for anyone who was convicted for what they did on January 6th in the Capitol attack. Others, however, saying it should be on a case-by-case basis specifically looking at the people who did not -- you know attack police officers or weren't committed on seditious conspiracy charges. So, some considerations there. But again, this is something that Donald Trump said that he will do very early on once he assumes office. And I'd also just add here that this is also a promise that I'm told he needs to follow through on. He didn't just make this promise broadly throughout his time on the campaign trail. He also promised this to specific people to their families. And so, this is something I am told that he is expected to follow through. The question is, what will it look like?",
