Just ahead for you, fighting between Israel and Hamas intensifies across Gaza as the Israeli Prime Minister claims once again that the territory should be under Israel's control.Then, Boris Johnson admits that mistakes were made during his government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. We'll have more on the former British Prime Minister's COVID inquiry. Plus, CNN meets with Ukraine's White Angels, a police unit in the town of Avdiivka, in charge of helping civilians on the frontlines. We begin with what appears to be a significant expansion in the Israel-Hamas war, with both northern and southern Gaza coming under heavy attack. The IDF says it has carried out some 250 airstrikes against militant targets over the past day. Particularly intense fighting is taking place in Khan Younis, this enclave's second largest city. In central Gaza, eyewitnesses reported multiple strikes on Tuesday. A hospital spokesperson in the area said there have been dozens of casualties, and that many people are still trapped under the rubble. It all comes as the U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees warns that Gaza has become one of the most dangerous places in the world, as we can all well imagine. CNN's Alex Marquardt joins me now live at an army base in southern Israel. Alex, bring us up to date with the latest on the operation and the encirclement of Khan Younis.",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianca, Israel's top commanding general says they have now entered the third phase of this conflict. And what that essentially means is they say they're solidifying gains that they have made in northern Gaza and then heading south and focusing their efforts on southern Gaza.The IDF saying that they are operating in the heart of Khan Younis trying to encircle the city as well. As you pointed out, that's the second biggest city in the Gaza Strip. It is the biggest in in southern Gaza. We have seen a number of airstrikes over the past few days in the area as well, leading to chaos in the streets as Palestinians try to get their wounded to the hospitals, which they say are overflowing at the same time. The Gazans in Khan Younis are being told by the IDF that they need to leave parts of Khan Younis and had even farther south for their own safety. We've also gotten some new video and information from the IDF today. They say they found a huge weapons cache in the northern part of the Gaza Strip that included hundreds of missiles, they say, including long range missiles. There were rocket propelled grenade launchers, dozens of anti-tank missiles, dozens of explosive charges. Some of those weapons, the Israeli military says, were destroyed on sight. Others were taken back to Israel for examination. But there are major humanitarian questions now, Bianca, as Israel presses south. Again, hundreds of thousands of people, we believe, are being told to leave the Khan Younis area. Where they will go is the question that humanitarian officials are now asking. Shelters in the south, particularly around the city of Rafah are overflowing. People are living in the streets. They're finding a shelter wherever they can. There is not enough aid. And Palestinians and humanitarian officials alike will tell you that nowhere in Gaza is safe. Bianca?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so this was a meeting, a private meeting between some of the freed hostages and some family members of those that still remain in Gaza with the Prime Minister Netanyahu and some members of the Security Cabinet.Now, audio has leaked, some of it was published on the Israeli news site Ynet. So this is where we've been able to get some of these stories. Really critical is the level of anger in this meeting. People feeling very let down by the government. There was heckling in one instance, people shouting shame. And that gives you a sense of the tension. That one really striking part of it was there are several accounts of hostages reporting being shelled by essentially by the IDF while in captivity. One of them saying that they were shelled not only in their hiding place, had to be moved or wounded, but that they were fired at by a helicopter on their way into Gaza. [08:05:16] Another one saying that the hostages are not just in tunnels, but some of them out on the streets under the constant threat of shelling. One woman who was freed talks about her serious concerns for those who remain. The implication is some of them are elderly. She says they're lying on mattresses all the time. She had been there to sort of get them up, keep them active, but she's very worried about their mental state now, says they're on the verge of losing hope. Now it's reported by Ynet that there were obviously responses from Netanyahu to this. We did not get a sort of a sense of regret or remorse really. He made the point that it is only the ground offensive in his view that pushed the talks to this point, that got them to the point where they were able to secure the release of 105 hostages as for whether any more to come. He said we couldn't release everyone at once. This is as reported by Ynet. The price they want is not prisoners. The price they want is not only the prisoners. The implication being that the price that Hamas wanted for future hostages was too high. I think critical to remember the families of the hostages thus far now the freed hostages themselves, they have been a political force in Israel. And I think we're going to continue to see the pressure ramp up. 138 believed to still be there.",

Videos from one hospital, which some viewers may find disturbing, show the floods of patients coming to the medical center for treatment. Doctors Without Borders said Tuesday that supply levels at Gaza's Al- Aqsa Hospital are now critically low due to road closures. As the war drags on, the need for aid is becoming more and more dire. CNN's Ben Wedeman takes a closer look at what people in Gaza are being forced to endure as they evacuate further south. And a warning that the report contains disturbing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They came here hoping to escape the war and this is what happened. Tuesday afternoon, an apparent Israeli airstrike demolished this building in Deir al Balah, in Central Gaza. Civilians more than 50 are now martyrs, says Abu Bassem. The building's owner had given them shelter. They all came from the north. Under the sand and rubble is a lifeless body. There is his head, someone says, while others peering into the ruins search for survivors. Is anyone alive, he calls out. Without heavy equipment, bare hands will suffice. Deir al Balah's only functioning hospital, the injured are rushed inside. The hospital's spokesman says they received more than 130 injured and more than 90 bodies. CNN cannot confirm the death toll. Once again, so many of the victims are children. Stunned, confused, terrified, she grasps her mother's hand. The injured treated on the floor. The luckier among those who fled and then fled again further south end up in places like this, makeshift camps devoid of running water, electricity or sanitation. A plastic sheet is all that protects Enas Musleh and her family from the elements. We spend all night hearing rockets and bombs, she says. We're living between life and death. We may die at any moment. Indeed, in Gaza now, the line between life and death is perilously thin. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

A U.S. official told CNN on Tuesday that the White House is deeply concerned about how Israel's operations will unfold in the next weeks. All this as multiple senior U.S. officials tell CNN that they believe this current stage of war could end by January.To discuss this, let's bring in CNN's Ben Wedeman, who's been following developments for us from Jerusalem. Ben, first to this point made by Netanyahu, that the IDF would have to retain open-ended security control of Gaza after this offensive and the war with Hamas ends. There's obviously been a lot of speculation about what Israel's plan would be after the war. Why does he think that a suggestion like this would be accepted by his allies or neighboring countries?",

That means basically they have to be control of the entire Gaza Strip with its more than 2.2 million population. Does this mean they have to search every square inch of Gaza for any weapons?This is obviously would be a process that would take a very long time and that would essentially mean that at least temporarily, Israel would be the occupying power directly as opposed to indirectly as is the case now of the Gaza Strip. And as the occupying power, it would be responsible for the provision of basic services, education, electricity, health care, things like that. And certainly, Israel's neighbors would be very concerned if basically Israel reestablishes the direct occupation of Gaza that existed until the summer of 2005 when Israel pulled out its settlers and troops from the Gaza Strip. And there is a lot of concern among many. Palestinians as well as beyond the Palestinians. Given that we are seen oftentimes on social media, a desire among some of the soldiers who were in Gaza at the moment, among other Israelis that they would like to reestablish the settlements that were dismantled in 2005. So there's -- it's a wildly complicated proposition by Prime Minister Netanyahu and clearly one that even the United States, which generally seems to agree with everything Israel does, it's something that even the Americans don't seem very enthusiastic about.",
