Victims of what a civil defense official says was his really tank and machine gun fire on a crowd of people waiting to receive desperately needed humanitarian aid. People who are going to get food and flour because they have nothing to eat, he says, then suddenly tanks appeared and started firing shells at people.

Wednesday at the same spot, Kuwait (ph) Circle in Gaza City southern outskirts, there were scenes of panic when, according to eyewitnesses, Israeli forces opened fire during the distribution of aid. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment, but it's not yet received a response.

Some supplies are available. Close to 90 percent of the people of Gaza are now displaced. Many now living like this. Winter rains have turned parts of this makeshift camp into a muddy pond. I'm looking for are things, he says. What they have found is anger at the man who pose as the leaders. Look, Ismail Haniyeh, let him see us, shouts this man referring to Hamas's political leader (INAUDIBLE). The war has raged now for more than 110 days. For three and a half months we've been on the run, says Iyad Abumasad (ph). Let us go back to our homes were sick of this life. Death would be better.

Jean Carroll. The former president took the stand very briefly on Thursday, CNN correspondent Kara Scannell with that story. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): And an extraordinary move for Donald Trump, the former president briefly taking the stand in the E. Jean Carroll defamation trial against him, as the 2024 Republican presidential front runner continues his strategy of bouncing between multiple court appearances and the campaign trail. Trump testified for less than three minutes in the civil trial that will decide how much money if any, he must pay Carroll in damages for statements he made about her sexual assault allegations against him. Trump attorney Alina Habba asking Trump, do you stand by your testimony in the deposition? 100 percent yes, Trump replied. He was then asked if he made the statement in 2019 in response to Carroll's accusation. Yes, I did. She said something that I considered a false accusation. Totally false, Trump testified. Judge Lewis Caplan immediately cut Trump off saying everything after yes I did is stricken. Finally, Trump's lawyer asked if he intended to hurt Carroll with his statements. No, he responded. I just wanted to defend myself, my family and frankly the presidency. After a brief redirect, Trump was off the stand and the defense rested. The judge allowed only very narrow testimony ordering restrictions that Trump could not deny assaulting Carroll or say that she lied about the rape allegation because those questions are not before this jury. A civil jury already found that Trump's sexually assaulted Carroll and then defamed her in a 2022 statement. The judge previously ruled that verdict would carry over to this defamation trial. Before Trump's testimony, Carroll's lawyers rested her case after playing a series of video clips of Trump disparaging her and misidentifying Carroll as his wife Marla Maples while looking at a photo.

Ukraine is pouring cold water on Moscow's claim that Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in a plane that went down in western Russia. Moscow claims a Ukrainian missile shot down the plane in the Belgorod region on Wednesday, reportedly killing 65 Ukrainians headed for a prisoner swap plus nine Russian service members. But Ukraine's intelligence now suggests only five bodies from the crash site have been taken to a local morgue. That number according to Ukraine, matches the size of the crew on the plane, which Kyiv says was transporting missiles not POWs. Russian videos from the scene, including this one, do not appear to show mass casualties, but Russian investigators still said on Thursday, their preliminary probe showed the jet was attacked by Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile.

Joining me now, Dr. Leah Stokes associate professor of environmental politics, UC Santa Barbara. Thanks so much, Professor for your time. How dire is the drought situation in the Amazon Basin? Just how unprecedented? DR. LEA STOKES, UC SANTA BARBARA: Well, the thing is that scientific records, in terms of drought go back a little bit over a century. And what scientists looking today are telling us is that this drought under the previous climate before we warmed it by burning so many fossil fuels, this drought would have only happened something like once in every 1,500 years.

How this is affecting people in very real ways. Just give us a sense of that aspect. What's happening at the micro level to the people who live there, just trying to survive. STOKES; Yes, just imagine what happens when, you know, the ground is too dry, when it's not raining enough, what happens is your crops die, right. Trees start to die. You start to have, for example, forest fires. You know, people don't have the same amount of food that they need to have. This can be really devastating. And of course, it's happening right now in the Amazon where for example, many indigenous communities live. But drought is becoming more common all around the world, you know, even in places like California, where I am.

Keep in mind, we've just warmed the planet by about 1.2 degrees centigrade, right? And these are the impacts that we're seeing. So what happens if we keep on this course? Of course, we don't have to, right. We can stop burning fossil fuels. We can start using clean electric machines like electric vehicles, heat pumps.
