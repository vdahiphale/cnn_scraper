Guys, thanks very much for joining us. The poll immediately after the debate among those who watched the debate, as you know, Doug showed 53 percent thought -- of registered voters who watched the debate thought Harris won, 24 percent thought Trump won.

Both parties put out those press releases and e-mails all the time.The rhetoric right now is that he won't. It's not clear that he definitely won't face her. Donald Trump changes his tune quite often, and he doesn't get charged with flip-flopping the way that other politicians do. It's part of his Teflon persona. And if he feels a need to do it, he will do it. He does raise one good point, though, and this has been consistent for the Trump campaign, that debates typically happen after people start voting. And we know we're voting earlier and earlier in this country. Alabama is already voting. North Carolina is right about to start voting, should have already. I think he does have a good point that we should have these debates before people start voting. But I'd love to see him debate Kamala Harris again. I think it'd be both for good for both of them. He needs to prove that he can be that stable genius he keeps saying that he is, which he wasn't at the last debate. And Kamala Harris still needs to put meat on the bones and tell voters, here's who I am and here's what I want to do.",

At the debate itself, when she came over to his side of the debate stage to shake his hand, I think that shook him to his core. The rest of the debate, he did not even look at her. And I think that shows a couple things, that he's scared of her. But, at the same time, he has disdain for her. And so that, I think, demonstrated where his discombobulation started. And it was at the very beginning. After that, the fact that he showed up in the spin room, that does not happen unless you really feel that you did badly in the debate. And then, thirdly, when have we ever seen Donald Trump shrink from a challenge? Never. And so the fact that he is saying, no, he doesn't want a debate, I think he's going to be the really proves that he's actually scared to do it. But I agree with you, Doug. I...",

It also tells people that you're not focused on what you should be. And so if you're a Republican campaign or you're the state party of Arizona, which has put up billboards on these eating of cats and geese and all this, you're not talking about those issues that Kamala Harris is underwater on.

Other celebrities might move 10 people, 20 people, even 100 people. She can move 100 million people. And so that is where I think the Trump campaign is really concerned, and they're trying to counter that in some way. We have already seen the registration numbers have completely skyrocketed. The interest in actually just going to register has skyrocketed ever since Taylor Swift has told her followers to go register to vote and then to support Kamala Harris. So I think the Trump campaign is concerned. This is what they're trying to do to counter. I think the Kamala Harris campaign has got to continue to push voter registration, to push actually people coming out to vote. That's where I think this campaign is going to be won and lost.",

And then last night against the Bills, Tua on this play running for the first down, lowers his head, slams right into Damar Hamlin. Tua immediately went into a fencing response with his arms in an unnatural position. He was attended to on the field, was able to walk off on his own. But this is Tua's third diagnosed concussion of his career. He has admitted in the past he's considered retirement due to concussions. His status moving forward now certainly unclear.

The very next week, Tua hit his head, and that's when his hand seized up on the field, and he was carted off with a concussion. He would return two weeks later and would play until week 16, when he suffered another concussion against the Packers. Tua ended up missing the final two games of the season and the playoffs. Now, as for the game last night, it was dominated by the Bills. James Cook, he ran for two touchdowns, caught another from Josh Allen. Miami actually controlled the time of possession and had more yards, but Tua threw three interceptions, including this pick six right here in the third quarter, before leaving the game. The Bills beat the Dolphins for the 14th time in 16 games 31-10 there. Josh Allen after the game, Wolf, said that his thoughts were with Tua, he was praying for him, and he just talked about how good of a guy he is.

Lots of speed, lots of space. This season, only the kicker is back here, while the opposing teams are lined up, all the way over here, separated by just five yards. And none of those players can move until the ball has been caught by the receiving team or it hits the ground. It reduces the speed and the space of the play.
