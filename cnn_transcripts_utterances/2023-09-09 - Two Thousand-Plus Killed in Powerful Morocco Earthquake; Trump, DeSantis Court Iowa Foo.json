We begin this hour with our breaking news coverage out of Morocco, just moments ago, the official death toll has surged yet again, more than 2,000 people are now confirmed dead after a powerful 6.8 magnitude earthquake that struck last night. More than 14,000 people -- or excuse me, 1,400 people are now in critical condition, but that number could go higher as well. Here we see a rescue team pull a woman from the rubble and as searches continue, the death toll is expected to climb even higher. CNN's Sam Kiley joins us now from Marrakech. Sam, we've been checking in over the last couple of hours with you. What are you looking at now?",

And you could see how the vibrations this massive earthquake, 6.8 on the Richter scale, peeled away a side of this building.We are in about a hundred yard, a hundred meter block from the previous couple of locations that we've had a look at with you here, Jim, and this is just yet another sign. Also you can see the building materials here, they ironically may be more robust often than some modern materials. But that hasn't been the case out in the countryside, Jim, where villages have been reduced to the sort of rubble you can see on the screen now except that that is across an immense scale. So whereas here in Marrakech, there are 13 dead now, 2,000 dead across the country. Most of those are in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. The epicenter of this earthquake was about 45 miles from here where I am in Marrakech. The authorities, indeed the king has declared a three-day period of national mourning. He has mobilized all of the Emergency Services and the National Army, Air Force, and Navy to try to get their helicopters out into those remote areas because it is in those areas where clearly the need is greatest -- Jim.",

There have been several elsewhere, more localized aftershocks that have been felt, four or five at least in the last 24 hours, and it is about 24 hours since that earthquake struck.But if, for example, an aftershock were to hit, then in all probability, a good chunk of this building would fall down into this street. This is a very tightly packed area, the Medina, and that is a pattern that would be repeated in any of the buildings that have been damaged in this quake that are vulnerable to those aftershocks, those tremors that could even on a relatively light scale, even rain could start to bring a lot of these buildings crashing down. But as a result of that, the authorities here have evacuated at least 30 percent we are told by some locals of tourists, possibly more. I have to say the Medina is almost a ghost town now, just a few curious onlookers and people keeping an eye on their homes. But most people in what would be at this time of night, absolutely teeming streets have completely disappeared. They are all staying with relatives, out sleeping in parks, trying to stay away from buildings that might be vulnerable to exactly those aftershocks -- Jim.",

I mean, he is worried about the impact that his baggage and these legal cases are going to potentially have on. He is worried that some of his co-conspirators and people that are named in these cases are going to turn on him and we're going to see new evidence come out, and here is what happens. When I'm out here on the stump, after people hear me, folks that are wearing Trump hats and Trump's shirts with his mugshot on the shirt come up and say, hey, we really appreciate the things that you're talking about.

They're asking a judge to move the case to federal court. It's the first high profile legal case, arguing the 14th Amendment disqualifies the former president from seeking office. The post Civil War provision says anyone who takes part in an insurrection or gives aid to insurrectionists is banned from the privilege of running for president.Trump blasted the group behind the lawsuit on Truth Social calling them \"slime balls.\" Joining me now to discuss this is the executive director of that group, CREW. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Noah Bookbinder. Noah, I don't want you to respond to ad hominem attacks from the former president, but it sounds as though this movement that's afoot on the 14th Amendment has gotten under his skin officially. NOAH BOOKBINDER, EXEC. DIRECTOR, CITIZENS FOR RESPONSIBILITY &amp; ETHICS IN WASHINGTON: Well, I guess what I would say is that the Constitution is not optional. It is the law of the land. And we have believed for a long time that this is good law, that this applies in this case, we were able last year to successfully represent residents disqualifying an official who participated in the January 6th insurrection. He was a New Mexico official. So this is something that is a serious case and we're ready to go and make that case with evidence and witnesses and it should be taken seriously.",

So Colorado has a specific law that allows voters to go to court and say this person is not qualified to be on the ballot and to request that the secretary of state remove them.Some states have those kinds of procedures. Other states have different kinds of procedures. Some - it's not clear that they have them at all. So I'm absolutely expecting to see this in other states. It's not necessarily going to be the same path in every state. But we also think that, particularly as court make judgments and we think and hope determined that Donald Trump is disqualified for having participated in insurrection, secretaries of state may well be willing and able to make those judgments themselves on remove people from the ballot as well.",

It doesn't apply in a whole lot of other circumstances. We have courts to make those kind of judgments and we think that that system will work, but that you have to be willing to use it in a case like this, where you had a president seeking to keep himself in power despite losing an election and doing so by inciting a violent mob.

Mary Ellen, great to see you, as always. Thanks so much. Why can't they catch this guy? MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, FORMER FBI PROFILER: Well, I think he's actually very good at what he's doing. But you compound that with the area. I mean, that's a really challenging area to have to search. And they're being very careful so that they don't have to go back and research areas that they've already done, so it really is a challenge. And I think right now what they're doing is they're trying to cut him off. So they're probably installing new cameras and they're also going into buildings using the technology that he has no access to, to make sure that they cut off any sheds or homes where he could go and get supplies.",

That means he's willing to take a lot of risk. He's comfortable with it. It also suggests to me that he's a very impulsive guy. And those two things are going to get him caught eventually, because that's part of his personality and he takes that out into the area now where he's roaming around trying to evade law enforcement. But sooner or later, he's going to wear out of food and warmth and clothing and so on. And eventually, even though he's very determined to get out of there, his body is going to break down. So - because you have two things, you have your mental ability to do this and then you have your physical ability to do this. And once the physical ability breaks down, it doesn't really matter how determined you are because your body just can't keep doing it.",
