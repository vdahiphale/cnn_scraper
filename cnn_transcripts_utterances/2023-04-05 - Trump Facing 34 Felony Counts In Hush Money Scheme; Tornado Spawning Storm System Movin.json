In their indictment, prosecutors accused Trump of orchestrating a broader scheme of paying for people's silence. Hush money and also catching killed deals, buying damaging stories to keep them from going public and all of the 34 counts have to do with one case and are tied to these eight checks made out to Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen in 2017.Now Cohen says that he helped arrange the hush money deal with adult film star Stormy Daniels. And in order to bump up what would be misdemeanors to become Class A felonies, the Manhattan DA has to show that Trump did all of this to further another crime, a crime which is not spelled out in the court documents but is likely tied to trying to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Now to help paint that picture of intent and have a broader scheme, the indictment details two other hush money payments involving the National Enquirer. In the first the tabloid paid $30,000 to a former doorman at Trump Tower, who claimed that he had knowledge of Trump fathering a child outside of his marriage. The Inquirer later learned that the man's claim was not true. A second deal involved a $150,000 payment to this woman, Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model who wanted to sell her story of her alleged relationship with Trump to The Enquirer, a story The Enquirer bought in order to kill.

Exactly for the reason you said so that the defendant knows what he needs to answer. So what will happen is no doubt, his defense team and he has an excellent team, will ask for a bill of particulars. They will make a motion, no sir, you need to tell us exactly which crimes you're accusing this defendant of as being the predicate offense. And there will be motion practice on this.

But I want to start with the skyline shot of downtown Chicago overlooking Lake Michigan. This is just moments ago, an incredible image to just show you the true force of the storms that are moving through as we speak.That is a shelf cloud. That's the - you're looking at the backside of this line of powerful storms that brought 50 to 60 mile per hour winds and up to an inch in diameter hail. But if you look closely on maybe the water there, you can see the ripples there, but you could just see just how powerful the winds are that have just recently moved through downtown Chicago, causing ground stops at O'Hare, causing ground stops and delays at Midway as well. Now I want to show you some of the first visuals we're getting out of the Missouri region. This is Southeast Missouri, just west of Cape Girardeau in the Glen Ellyn region where the fatalities and destruction from the long-lived, supercell thunderstorm that caused a tornado. You can see people cleaning up the damage within that area. We'll continue to highlight that region and get - pass along information as we get it to us but spending more time on Chicago, this is the more immediate threat of these as the storms race across the Great Lakes. They'll move into my home state of Michigan, Grand Rapids, Holland, eventually into Detroit. You're under a new tornado watch, that's new information to pass along to you since the last time we spoke. And then as we head a little further south to where I'm located in Little Rock, Arkansas, Central Arkansas, you're under the gun as well because this area has more storms developing to our west. This is a very storm weary region. As you can see the damage behind me remember that's from the long- lived supercell tornado that moves through on Friday evening.

The trip to get here from where we were would normally take about 20 minutes but it took longer because the lights are out. So people who are out on the road exercising, using the four way stop.

Congressman Jesus Chuy Garcia took a lot out of the Latino neighborhoods. So those were all significant votes that were up for grabs, and Johnson took just about every single ward that Lightfoot did.
