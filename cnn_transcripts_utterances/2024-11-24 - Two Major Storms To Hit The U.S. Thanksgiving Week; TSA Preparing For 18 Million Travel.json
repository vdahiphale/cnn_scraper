We start off the day Monday with this new system here impacting portions of the Midwest down through the Mississippi and Tennessee Valley area region. That's going to have rain on the south side and some snow showers farther to the north.Out to the west, we are going to have a series of systems moving their way through. This is expected to bring some heavy rainfall along the coast and some very heavy snow, especially in the Sierras, could see two to three feet over the next few days. By late into the day Monday, again, you'll start to see that first system begin to spread into the areas of the mid-Atlantic, as well as the northeast overnight into early Tuesday. Also looking at some showers along the southeast coast, too. The other system we're watching, that's the one that moved into the West Coast now starting to overspread into the Rockies and eventually into the central portion of the country once we get towards Wednesday. This is going to have mostly rain here as the temperatures won't quite be cold enough for snow. You're really going to have to go pretty far north to get the snow into the mix. But by overnight Wednesday and into Thursday, those temperatures starting to creep down in some areas allowing a few more spots to get some snow or even a rain-snow mix. Heavy rain at times possible across the Tennessee Valley, even cities like Nashville, Atlanta and Knoxville could have rain in the forecast. Then, by midday Thursday, you're looking at more of that moisture over spreading into the northeast and into the mid-Atlantic. So any last- minute travel or local travel on Thanksgiving Day itself, the biggest concerns are going to be the northeast stretching all the way down into the Gulf Coast where you're going to have the bulk of that really heavy moisture. So then the question becomes, OK, what about the famous Macy's Day Parade? Here's the thing. We've got that rain coming in, the heaviest will hold off until the afternoon and evening hours of Thursday. So the first few hours of the parade should in theory be OK. But those rain chances go up very quickly for the back half of the parade. Temperature wise, also not exactly going to be very warm. You're looking at those temperatures likely only in the low 40s.

There are a lot of folks who want to win at travel this week with TSA bracing for a record 18 million passengers at airports across the country. We know the TSA has already been having staffing shortages. Do you think that they're ready for this crowd that's coming? BRIAN KELLY, FOUNDER, THEPOINTSGUY.COM: Well, I'm not so worried about the TSA. I'm more worried about the FAA. The nation is currently undergoing a shortage in air traffic controllers and Secretary Buttigieg has already said that that could impact this holiday, especially if those storms start to throw things in disarray.

So if you're flying through New York this Thursday, you may want to do that or even call and ask the airline to leave the night before.Also understand the DOT in October now instituted new rules. If your flight is delayed three or more hours domestically, or six or more internationally, just know that you're owed a full refund. So if you're in the airport, your flight keeps getting delayed, you want to get home for the holidays, you can actually book yourself on another carrier and know that if the delay qualifies, you will eventually get a full refund for your other flight, which is a little bit of peace of mind.",

Joining me now is senior political analyst for CNN and senior editor of \"The Atlantic,\" Ron Brownstein. Ron, it's good to have you tonight. ABC News reports that Trump's team has told lawmakers to either get in line for some of these confirmation votes or get primaried. Obviously, you know, it's very early in the consideration for many of these lawmakers, but what do you think is the consideration that a Republican senator is making when they're considering some of these candidates as they're coming in?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Look, I think the vast majority of them are going to line up behind Trump on all or virtually all of the nominees, but with a 53-seat majority, you don't need that many to defect and you have some for whom that threat is much less relevant. Murkowski in Alaska, Collins in Maine, Mitch McConnell in Kentucky, who is in his final term.You know, I think there are two important considerations from the Matt Gaetz episode. One, in terms of what it means for the remaining nominees. I mean, one is that they did not have to vote publicly against him, right? He withdrew before it came to a vote, either in committee or on the floor. And that's important because I think even the Republican senators, who are the most immune to Trump's gravitational pull, are probably having their head a number of how many times they can afford to vote against him, especially early on. And the fact they didn't have to use one of those on Gaetz who was maybe the most, you know, unfit of the of the choices is important. The other dynamic I think that's important is whether these nominees can be attacked from the right, like if a Republican senator can oppose some of these nominees from the right, I think that might be easier for them. And certainly Tulsi Gabbard is one that you could imagine Republican senators opposing from the right. We saw from Nikki Haley last week the kind of language that you might hear when she called her a Russian, Iranian, Syrian, Chinese sympathizer. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.. Mike Pence attacked from the right on abortion. So those are dynamics that that I'm going to be keeping an eye on.",

She's been called a RINO. She has taken a lot of criticism from the Republican Party, but it does lend to this suggestion that Republicans are trying to brand themselves as the party of the working class.Just this morning outgoing Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown said that Democrats need to be better at messaging toward the working class.

But then when it comes to negotiating the second term Trump agenda most of those action items require 60 votes.And so there will need to be some sort of deal-making that takes place. And I'm wondering whether you think that's possible. BROWNSTEIN: Yes, well, you know, John Thune did say he's going to preserve the filibuster so, as you say, you know, anything that is beyond the reconciliation bill, which is the one big fiscal bill that you can pass with a simple majority. Now, the biggest things they want to do, they can do through reconciliation, extending the Trump tax cuts for individuals which expire in 2025, making significant cuts in the federal government, and also potentially block granting and cutting Medicaid, which I think is a very live item, something Republicans have been trying to do since the early 1990s. Beyond that, it's kind of hard to see. I mean, there are, you know, there are certainly elements of the trade agenda that you could imagine certain Democrats signing onto. But an awful lot of what -- you know what Trump wants to do uh, particularly on the cultural side, it's just hard to see how you get seven Democrats for that. I suspect that, as is often the case with Republican, you know, presidents, the key agenda items on the domestic side are cutting taxes and appointing judges and justices. And you can do both of those with simple majorities. And I think that's where most of their emphasis is going to be.",

I think that all of that is going to be stressed right from day one.And as we're seeing, it's even before day one, and certainly what you're describing in terms of the background checks and the implications of security clearances is a real problem. But I think it's going to be only, you know, a very small. What are recusals going to look like? What are conflict of interest rules going to look like? I mean, you have, you know, you have a president who fundamentally does not believe in the structures that have been built over time, particularly since Watergate, to try to ensure kind of the non -- the impartial, you know, use of federal power, not kind of applying it in an arbitrary way to reward friends and punish enemies.

First of all, I think when historians look back at this conflict, they're going to say that while President Biden did a good job bringing the allies together and holding them together, his policy of denying Ukraine the weapons they want and then putting restrictions on their use will probably be cited as a major reason why the conflict is in a stalemate right now.And it's just terrible that the Ukrainians have had to fight for two- and-a-half years now with at least one arm tied behind their back. But look the introduction, finally, of the ATACMS into the fight, allowing them to be used beyond Ukraine is important. I think the introduction of this new intermediate range ballistic missile by Russia was a chance to kind of respond to that. But I also assume they're looking at more economical ways to deliver warheads and putting multiple warheads on a single missile launching it. It travels at hypersonic speeds. It also allows them to do a better job in terms of evading air defenses. So, right now, what's happening, though, in Ukraine is each side is attempting to maneuver to gain as much territory or as leverage as possible anticipating that Donald Trump is going to try to bring them to the negotiating table sometime early next year.",

They've taken a large chunk out of their supply of rockets and missiles and they've pushed them back north of the Litani River. So, at this point in time, the framework as was discussed, is can they return to a 2006 UN Resolution 1701 that would create that demilitarized zone, if you will, between the Litani River, which is about 18 miles north of the Israel-Lebanon border, keep it free from Hezbollah, allow a combination of Lebanese armed forces and un peacekeepers in there to kind of to kind of keep that ground safe. And the question is, what rights does Israel have if Hezbollah once again breaks the agreement and returns and tries to attack Northern Israel. So, I think that's all on the table.

So, this evidence in addition to a letter that Erik wrote before the killing describing the sexual abuse, is what the defense team says is enough evidence to have a judge reconsider the sentencing or the conviction and so that is the thing that they've been pushing all along. The district attorney here in Los Angeles agreed. The problem there is that the district attorney essentially was voted out. The new district attorney has a different view in all of this, the incoming district attorney, Nathan Hochman. And take a listen to what he told us.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Barbara worked constantly as an advocate for the safe return of the hostages. We are so grateful to have both of you with us this evening.Barry, you're featured in this upcoming episode telling the story of your detainment. Tell us what brought you to Iran in the first place, and can you describe what you remember from that first day when the embassy was overtaken. BARRY ROSEN, SURVIVOR OF 1979 IRANIAN HOSTAGE CRISIS: Well I think it all occurred, I believe in 1960 when President Kennedy said ask not what your country can do for you and ask what you could do for your country. I joined the Peace Corps. I joined the Peace Corps and I went to Iran and I spent one of the most two interesting years of my life visiting and seeing the culture, being with people, talking with them, living a life much like in a low and middle class Iranian at that time. And then I went to graduate school and then I was in the USIA, the Voice of America Central Asian desk, and then recruited to the US Embassy as the press attache for the US Embassy and that's how I got there and then everything started to go upside down. It was a year, a little more than 13 months of a social revolutionary movement, which was combined with that is secular movement, a religious movement a wide array of different factions that were attempting to overthrow the Shah of Iran and also the revolution also was partly one against the United States, too.   TAUSCHE: Barbara, it was 14 months that Barry was held captive. You were back in the US with your young family during that time. How did you use your resources, your voice, to bring awareness to what was happening and what was it like for you when Barry returned home?",
