European leaders are meeting there in Spain on the agenda, migration Armenia and Ukraine. Leaders should speak anytime now and we are monitoring events for you. New York facing the consequences of the migrant crisis as chaos moves north from the Texas border. Temperatures breaking records by absurd margins, we'll have the very latest numbers from the very latest report from Copernicus. We're keeping a close eye on financial markets this hour. As well of course U.S. stocks look set for a lower open when trading gets underway on Wall Street an hour or half an hour from now. Investor's sentiment remains cautious and volatility in global bond markets is clear. But U.S. stocks did post across the board games on Wednesday looking at that market view as we are 30 minutes out the arrows pointing to a lower start. Well, a productive day for Ukraine and all of Europe those hopeful words from Ukraine's President who is attending a summit of European leaders in Spain. Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived on an unannounced visit pushing European allies for more military assistance amid the political chaos in Washington. President Zelenskyy's surprise appearance in Spain comes as U.S. President Voices his concerns about securing future U.S. funding for Ukraine. Joe Biden says he plans to make a speech soon to stress the importance of continued aid. Meantime, CNN has learned the U.S. will transfer thousands of seized Iranian weapons and rounds of ammunition to Ukraine to help alleviate critical shortages facing the military there. There's a lot to unpack our Chief International Correspondent, Clarissa Ward, connecting us from London today. Let's start with the chaos in the U.S. in Congress, and the juxtaposition of the Europeans today meeting, we've got Zelenskyy calling for more funding, as it appears it could dry up from the U.S. and the West. What do you make of what you're seeing here?",

They're planning a big speech that they need to really sell the American people on the idea that their continued support is absolutely crucial for the future of democracy because Americans have made it clear or are starting to make it clear that there is increasing reluctance to continue to write a blank check without some kind of a tangible game plan. The real fear I think, becomes Becky, whether this contagion starts to spread to Europe as well, whether you see European nations starting to raise questions about their commitments, both militarily and financial to Ukraine. And so that's why what we're seeing today in Granada is so crucial, and why it will be very crucial for President Biden to make a strong case to the American people, Becky.",

And what'squite telling you Becky's that it was just last week that the number of asylum seekers reached 3700 in terms of those arriving here in New York. That is one of the highest numbers that they've seen in terms of weekly arrivals. So that really is quite telling in terms of this being an issue that is still ongoing for New York City. Those 3700 will be added to the nearly 63,000 that are still in New York City's care. There are many factors in play here, Becky, there's certainly that increase in border crossings that we experienced along the southern border that is certainly potentially linked to that number of asylum seekers arriving in New York going on a daily basis from 400 to nearly 600 a day. One of the highest figures they've seen, but also Republican Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, has reportedly increased the number of asylum seekers that he is offering transportation to cities like Chicago, Washington, D.C., Denver, and certainly here in New York. Now the city is hoping to bring some relief to their shelter system by serving some of those adult asylum seekers with 60 day vacate notices basically asking that they leave these shelters and reapply for housing. However, the number of people that are coming into the system is so large. That they have not seen any sort of positive benefit yet, in terms of what we've seen and heard from New York City officials. The Mayor Eric Adams waking up in Mexico City this morning, I made criticism that this is as described by one migrant advocacy group a pointless trip. He insists that this is a fact finding trip which he hopes to not only speak to folks in Latin America, but also traveled to Colombia and other parts of South America potentially a visit the Darien Gap, which is that treacherous stretch of jungle in Central America and that many migrants will tell you have had to survive before they make their way to major American cities, Becky.",

It was a place where the Ukrainian citizen said that the Russians had been pulling forces together to possibly launch some sort of offensive. So, definitely a place where a lot of shelling has been going on and lot of shooting has been going on as well and the Ukrainians now saying that apparently a civilian area has been hit now. I'm going to share with you some of the details they are still coming in because of course all this is very fresh. But the Ukrainians are saying that shortly after 1 pm. So sort of around mid-day, I think the exact time they're giving us 1:15 pm. That was shelling near a town called Groza, which is near Kupiansk in that area. They said that a cafe was hit. And the supermarket was hits there as well. Obviously, some of the rescue operations, they're still very much ongoing right now. We have sort of stills images of the aftermath of that. It certainly looks as though the building that appears to have been hit is completely destroyed. The death toll at this point in time and you just said that. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine had said that 48 people were killed. It seems as though the authorities are still trying to clarify that whether it was 48 or 49. But of course again, all of that is still very much in flux. Apparently also, some children could be among the casualties, certainly among the wounded as well. And you know, again, this is an area where active combat was taking place close to that area. We know that in the City of Kupiansk as well, which is pretty much right on the front line between the Russians and the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians had been urging people to leave that area. And in some cases, even talking about mandatory evacuations from there, because the fighting was coming so close because the Russians had been trying to push into that area for quite some time now the Ukrainians had been saying that they managed to stabilize that front line over the past a couple of weeks moving some resources up there also some Western equipment as well to try and push the Russians back. But now the Ukrainians are saying that a soft target as they put it, a civilian target has been hit. Of course, President Zelenskyy of Ukraine who is currently on a visit to Spain has already condemned what he called this attack that took place, calling it a demonstratively brutal Russian rate, a crime. A rocket attack on an ordinary grocery store a completely deliberate terrorist attack again, those are the words of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who's currently in Spain, Becky.",
