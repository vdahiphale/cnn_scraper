      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Russia's Wagner fighters claim to beclose to the Bakhmut city center, but Ukraine says it's not giving in yet. Then frustration rages across Greece after a deadly train crash. Officials say human error is to blame. And the fallout after an Israeli minister's incendiary comments calling for a Palestinian town to be erased. I speak to statesman Yair Neglin(ph), an architect of the Oslo Accords in about 30 minutes.   But first, after weeks of relentless fighting, Ukraine says Russian troops are advancing on the city of Bakhmut. Now, according to Ukrainian military officials, Russian forces are assaulting the city itself, suggesting that they no longer simply operating on the outskirts. But Ukraine does not plan to withdraw yet, its defense forces are still holding on to their positions and are repelling Russian attacks. Now, the boss of the mercenary Wagner Group says this video you're looking at here shows his fighters practically in the center of the city. However, CNN has geo-located this video to be at the east of Bakhmut, around two kilometers or so from the city center. Meanwhile, Ukraine fears that if Bakhmut falls, the town of Chasiv Yar as you can see there, will be the next on Russia's list. Our Alex Marquardt is there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  This is the road on the way to Bakhmut. Cars, military vehicles, bombing up and down this road going to and from the front. You see this armored vehicle right here with the V sign for victory. There are still some people here, not too many, but some of these hardy residents have stayed behind. This is the shop of Seviuch(ph) who is here grilling meat, it's called Shashli(ph). He actually fled from Bakhmut two months ago, and has opened up a shop selling basics like bananas, beetroot and candles. There is another man who here, who we just met, whose daughter is still in Bakhmut. One of the thousands of people there who have been asked to evacuate, but are still in the city amid this incredible fighting. You can see that they put up wood there to protect those windows. So much destruction in this town. We were just farther in the center of town, it's called Chasiv Yar, this is one town over from Bakhmut with a large group of people at a bus stop waiting for a water delivery that never came. Every few moments, you can hear explosions, the sound of what we believe to be outgoing artillery fire. Ukrainians firing at Russian positions. We spoke with an older woman named Valentina(ph), who said that there is so much flying over their heads that she is scared all the time. That, they are so close to the Russian positions -- that's more outgoing artillery fire -- they're so close to the Russian positions that they can walk there. We also spoke with some Ukrainian soldiers, like these ones, who manned one of those artillery positions. They told us that there has been no order to pull back from Bakhmut. That they're fighting because, if they give up Bakhmut, then this town, Chasiv Yar, this would be next. And that is what everyone is thinking now, that If Russia were to take Bakhmut, that they would have another foothold in this region from which to try to push farther into eastern Ukraine. Alex Marquardt, CNN, in Chasiv Yar. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The new START Nuclear Arms Reduction Treaty and Paul Whelan, of course, the U.S. citizen who has been in Russian prison for some 4 years.

So according to the Russian readout of their meeting with the Chinese, they say that the Russians and the Chinese werevery much on the same page with regard to the war in Ukraine. Of course, China did issue its own kind of peace proposal for that war that the United States and the West are extremely skeptical of. And the U.S. has said -- Antony Blinken said during a press conference earlier today that in fact, the U.S. had warned many of the allies at that G20 Summit about China's contemplation of sending Russia that lethal equipment. And the fact that many of those allies were deeply concerned by that. And so, I think what you saw here was kind of a divide, of course, between the kind of U.S.-led western alliance at the G20, the kind of China-Russia alliance there. And then India, which was of course, the host of the summit, kind of in the middle. Of course, we have seen the U.S. express concerns about India not condemning Russia's war in Ukraine. And of course, India buying up a lot of that oil that is keeping Russian profits afloat and allowing them to continue the war. So, it was a really interesting dynamic here. But of course, we're seeing the push-and-pull on both sides from the U.S. and from Russia, China, India, to basically come to some kind of solution here with regards to the war. It does not look like that's going to happen anytime soon however, Isa.",

Well, Russian Federal Security Service officials claim an armedgroup crossed into Russian territory on Thursday, allegedly raiding villages in the Bryansk region. The region's governor says two civilians were killed and a child injured by, quote, \"sabotage groups\". And the FSB says they discovered a quote, \"large number of explosive devices\". Ukraine is dismissing these claims as quote, \"as a classic, deliberate provocation\". U.S. and Ukrainian officials have long warned that Russia was planning false flag attacks, basically, as a pretext for military escalation. Fred Pleitgen joins me now from Moscow with more.

I mean, one of the things that we have to keep in mind, Isa,is that the last big military victory for the Russian armed forces was several months back. In fact, I would say it was in the Summer of last year. So, right now, it's been a very long time since there has been a big victory. And then if you look at Bakhmut itself, I mean, we've been hearing from the Wagner Group, we've been hearing from the Russian military that, that place is going to fall soon, that they're working on encircling it. And so far, that simply hasn't happened. I mean, the Ukrainians themselves are now saying they're under a lot of pressure there, it's very difficult for them, there are advances on the part of the Russian forces. But the Ukrainians still themselves are not willing to budge. So it certainly is significant for the Wagner Group to be able to go on a high rise building like that. It is inside the city of Bakhmut, even though it is on the eastern side of the city. Isa, they're not as far in as they would like to point out, they're not near the city center. But certainly, for them, it's very important to point that out. But it does look as though it could still be a very long and very bloody battle until the Russians would be able to encircle that place, if they're able to do it at all. I mean, the Ukrainians are saying they are going to fight over every inch of territory. So that is a very difficult battle for both sides, certainly very bloody on both sides. Wagner apparently is also losing a lot of their fighters as well. And yet, neither side is willing to budge. It's a very symbolic place town. It has become that for both the Russians --",

This security footage shows the moment the two trains collided. At least, 57 people were killed and dozens more are injured. Now, rail workers on a 24-hour strike, protesting what they call, inadequate safety measures. The Greek prime minister says tragic human error was the main cause of the disaster. Our Nada Bashir is at the scene of the collision in Tempe, Greece, and joins me now. So, Nada, I mean, it's clear the Greeks are very angry and understandably so, given their loss.

And in fact, the transport minister here in Greece just yesterday announced his resignation. He said that this would be a mark of respect on his part, to those who had lost their lives, but he also conceded that the safety standards, the rail network in general is simply not up to the standards one would expect in the 21st century. And because of that, because of the clear failings in the rail network system here across Greece, we have seen that frustration, that anger growing. We've seen protests taking place across the country. We've seen now rail workers, metro workers going on strike. And there is mounting pressure on the government. Many now questioning even if it was the case of human error, there should have been a backup system. There should have been safety systems in place, to prevent a catastrophe like this from happening. And of course, we are still seeing this recovery effort taking place, but this is very much shifting into focusing now, more on removing the wreckage. Some of the rescue teams here have told us that they are still looking for biological remnants, in order to identify DNA. That is the stage that they're at. The first two carriages of this train, completely engulfed in flames. The third turned on its side after it derailed. And there are so many more people, victims in hospital, their family members waiting for news   of their condition. Of course, some of them are in a critical condition in intensive care.

Smotrich is Israel's finance minister but also has significant powers over the West Bank, which makes his remarks all the more disturbing. He called for the town of Huwara to be wiped out by Israel, just days after settlers went on a rampage there, setting fire to Palestinians' homes and terrorizing families. One man was shot and killed. A top Israeli general has condemned the violence as simply indiscriminate terror. In a televised interview, he said the army prepared for reprisals after a gunman shot two Israeli brothers in Huwara but was not ready for what he called a problem, have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. GEN. YEHUDA FUCHS, ISRAELI ARMY COMMANDER, WEST BANK (through translator):  The incident in Huwara was a pogrom carried out by outlaws. We are prepared, as we prepare after every terror attack. There's a phenomenon of outlaws taking the junctions to throw stones and block Palestinian roads in the area. I don't think that collective punishment helps combating terrorism. On the contrary, I think it might even cause terrorism. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is just the latest full act of politicalviolence that specifically targeted an elected official in the state of Michigan; this one, having to do with Jake Eugene Carpenter III. Federal investigators allege that he took to Twitter back in mid February, writing that he planned to, quote, \"carry out punishment of death to anyone that is Jewish in Michigan government.\" That tweet immediately got the attention of federal authorities. They then started working with Michigan State Police the day after that was posted and were able to speak to the defendant's mother, who told investigators she believes that her son was armed, was in Texas and even shared his phone number with investigators. That is the way they were able to track him down in northern Texas, a day after this was posted, and quickly apprehended him without incident. What we know about the suspect here, when you read through the many tweets that he posted online, they're certainly unhinged. They are anti-Semitic and alarming in nature. In fact, on one occasion, on that same Twitter page, he declared a sovereign country of so-called New Israel in his rural Michigan home. But what really escalated the situation was when federal investigators found out that there were at least three 9 mm handguns that were registered in his name, in the state of Michigan. That certainly simply added more urgency to track him down. Afraid that he would act on this threat, not just for Michigan's attorney general but other elected officials. He is currently in custody. We've reached out to the public defender's office that's representing Carpenter. But just to close things out on a larger scope, what this means for officials in Michigan is that we have seen this sort of merging of anti government/COVID conspiracy theories and now adding this anti-Semitic factor as well. That's why ADL, an anti-hate group up here in the U.S., is seriously concerned that many of these individuals may potentially act on these threats. But when you look at this particular case, he said, really, it's remarkable how it all came together. The tweet was posted on February 17th. And he's in custody on February 18th, preventing what could've been a tragedy targeting Michigan's top cop.",
