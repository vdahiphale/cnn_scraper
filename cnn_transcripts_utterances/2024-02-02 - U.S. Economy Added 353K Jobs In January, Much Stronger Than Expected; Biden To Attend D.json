When you look at it in a vacuum, however, it ties a two year high in some of the opinions over the last two years have been quite low 21 percent. So, this is a lot higher than it has been over the last two years.You break it down by party. It's a similar story, 62 percent of Democrats things -- think things are going well, that's a big increase from the fall, 32 percent of independents. Again, not a great number, but an increase from the fall, 14 percent of Republicans think things are going well. A low number, but again, double what it was in the fall. How is Joe Biden being given credit for this? Well, a little bit more. Again, how is Joe Biden handling the economy? Right now, 37 percent approve of the way he's handling the economy. Again, not a great number in a vacuum, but up from what it was in November. So, you're starting to see these numbers move a little bit in the direction the White House would like to see. How have Joe Biden's policies affected U.S. economic conditions? A very similar story, worsening conditions 55 percent, a number that you're troubled the White House moving in the right direction for them since August, improved conditions 26 percent. Again, moving up from August had no effect stays the same. Finally, again, if you are the Biden reelection campaign, you're excited that you are seeing improvement but this number right here, how is your financial situation changed in the last year still, even with all these positive numbers we are seeing, 42 percent of people say their economic condition has worsened in the last year.

I mean, I voted for Trump in 2016, on the theory that knowing everything that we had heard about him then on the theory that it was a better choice than Hillary Clinton. But I acknowledged that when I saw him in operation, my hope that he would be disciplined by the gravity of his responsibilities and national security simply hadn't worked. Nothing disciplines his thinking.So, I don't -- I don't plan to vote for him. This year. I didn't vote for him in 2020. But I'm not going to vote for Biden either, because it's -- I think he is dangerous for the country. And in other ways I'm going to write in somebody.",

As I say, I had met Trump before the 2016 election, had conversations with him. I had conversations with him after he was elected before I took the job as National Security Adviser. But it was my expectation, which I will fully admit turned out to be wrong, that, like every other president before him, the consequences of his decisions in the foreign and defense policy field would discipline his thinking and would lead us to coherent policies. But that turned out to be wrong. And obviously, I can't unlearn what I saw every day during 17 months there.",

Hillary Clinton called Trump supporters deplorables.

I confess to being completely frustrated, like many other people in the party.I don't think the nomination is completely over with it's -- it's not an easy stretch.

I think the President of three years of evidence of the President's policies to date, show that his -- he pursues a very weak line to America's disadvantage. And we see the consequences with Russia's second invasion of Ukraine. And in 2022, we see Iran and its terrorist surrogates, utterly undeterred by U.S. power, we see China increasingly looking to take advantage and with respect to Taiwan and the South China Sea and elsewhere, we do not see the level of defense spending that we desperately need.So, as I say, that's why I'm not going to vote for either one of them in both in their own ways, I think are doing grave damage to our national security.",

Apart from -- from driving Trump's base itself, just into further recalcitrance.You know, Trump tried to steal the election in 2020.
