Then, obviously, what Arlette is reporting is that that frustration has changed, not necessarily about the comparison to Donald Trump, but more about the way that his own administration and his own team has handled this because it does obviously have an appearance of being clumsy in a way that, again, once we know the facts after the special counsel is done, might not bear out to actually reflect what really happened.

However, the Ukrainians do fear that that could increase to a certain extent. If we pan up a little bit, you can see just the utter destruction of that building that was completely flattened by that missile. Now, Wolf, the Ukrainians say that the missile that was used in the strike is a missile that was actually designed to destroy aircraft carriers. And, obviously, if it hits a residential building, it causes exactly what we see right here. We do have to note that the Kremlin denies that Russia was behind this. They claim that this was a Ukrainian air defense missile trying to shoot down a Russian missile that went astray and landed in this building. Ukrainians say that that is absolutely not true. And you were alluding to the fact, Wolf, that the Ukrainians say that they do want an investigation. In fact, they have launched an investigation. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine, has said that he wants to bring those who are responsible for an international tribunal. Right now, of course, though, what's first and foremost on the minds of Ukrainians is waiting to see if they can, by some miracle, save anybody from underneath the rubble. But as you can see behind me, this is turning more and more into a cleanup operation. The Ukrainians themselves are saying it would take a miracle that anybody would still be alive here. In fact, they don't believe that they are going to find more people who are still alive. They did manage to pull some people from the rubble over the past couple of days. But as this day went on, it was really the death toll that was going up. What we're seeing on the ground here, Wolf, is the residents, the people that we have been speaking to, there's a lot of grief, there's a lot of anger in Russia.

Colonel Leighton, you see the devastation there in fred's report, the video, the pictures are horrific. What does this horrific on civilians in a residential apartment complex with a cruise missile, the Kh-22, say about Putin's brutal strategy right now? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, Wolf, it's a strategy of annihilation and coercion. And basically what Putin wants to do is he wants to destroy Ukraine from the bottom level up. In other words, he wants to go into the societal structure and destroy the society. He also wants to destroy the institutions of government and keep them from functioning. And one way to do that is to very brutally attack the civilian population, and, unfortunately, that's exactly what we're doing right now.",

So, I think, you know, it's very hard to climb into the mind of Vladimir Putin and figure out what does he want to do ultimately. What is he trying to do?We know geopolitically, but this almost goes beyond geopolitics. It is now an obsession, it appears, and he's not giving it up. So, I think it bodes very poorly for the future because if he's not going to give up this type of war, which is really just extraordinary, you know, where do we move from there?
