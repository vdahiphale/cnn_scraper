Three weeks from tomorrow is Election Day, and Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are both campaigning today in the all-important battleground state of Pennsylvania. Both are desperate to break the stalemate of a tied race. CNN's latest poll of polls in Pennsylvania shows Harris with a narrow edge, her support averaging 48 percent in the state to Trump's 47 percent. This weekend, the former president leaned into some of his dark rhetoric regarding potential unrest on Election Day.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within, not even the people that have come in and destroying our country, by the way, totally destroying our country, the towns, the villages, they're being inundated. But I don't think the other problem in terms of Election Day. I think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. It should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary by the military. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Democratic Representative, Brendan Boyle, who represents much of Philadelphia County, joins us now. Representative, thanks for your time. So I want to start with that CNN's poll of polls for the state you represent.As I noted earlier, it shows an extremely tight race with no clear leader in either case. Why, despite all the campaign's best efforts, is Harris's message not pulling her ahead more with Pennsylvania's and your view? REP. BRENDAN BOYLE (D-PA): Well, it's good to be with you, and it's -- it's not surprising to me, because that's the nature of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was a one point race in 2016. It was one point race in 2020. And I predicted about a year ago that actually Pennsylvania would be a one point race in -- in this election. So I, in many ways, this was -- this was very much expected. Just as long as Kamala Harris is on the north side of that 1 percent not the south side, I will be happy. The nature of Pennsylvania is such that we have incredibly tight, close elections where an evenly or almost evenly divided country. And Pennsylvania, probably more than any other state comes closest to duplicating that. BROWN: So this is Harris's 10th visit to your state this campaign season. It shows just how important it is the campaign. And she is fighting this threat of voters not feeling passionate enough to get out and vote. What are you doing to get the vote in your district, which primarily includes Philadelphia?",

They are here constantly in Pennsylvania, from Erie to Philadelphia to all points in between, asking for Pennsylvanians to vote for them, while Donald Trump is in California repeatedly. He's in Montana, he's in New York. It's -- it's an odd campaign strategy. Add to that the fact that the Harris campaign has invested so much in a field operation and door to door in these field offices, while Donald Trump's campaign hasn't at all.In a one point race, I mean, I know this from my own firsthand experience, in a tight one point race feel can make all the difference.

      "sentences": "Not -- not. Well, there are two separate issues. One, the second question was about performance in Philadelphia. I'll get to that second. The first one about party registration doesn't worry me at all. Historically speaking, party registration tends to be a lagging indicator. For example, West Virginia had a majority Democratic voter registration not too long ago, even though it had been voted Republican for the last 25 years, you see a lot of that in western Pennsylvania.You would also see in suburban Philadelphia a good 10, 20 years after those counties were voting Democratic, it still had majority Republican registrations. So that doesn't really worry me. The second part of your question, though, about Philadelphia actually does concern me. There has been a small drop in recent elections and turnout in urban areas like Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Detroit, that is a place where I'm spending some of my time and resources. I know a lot from the national campaign is going into that as well. I mean some drop off from the enthusiasm of Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 was to be expected. But frankly, on the Democratic side, I do think we have more work to do in urban areas, both in terms of turnout, but also persuasion to match the sort of gains that, remarkable gains that we've made among well-educated suburban voters.",

Because it might be hard to believe for some, but there is anywhere from a good 5 to 10 percent of people who are torn. There sometimes more liberal on some issues, more conservative on others.They might be people who otherwise vote Republican, but can't stand Donald Trump's dictatorial tendencies and what he did in provoking the insurrection on January 6th and some of his rhetoric now. They might be people who are generally more liberal, but they don't necessarily know enough about Kamala Harris, because they don't consume as much political information as those of us who are in the business. So making sure that we reach out to those persuadable voters and actually reach them where they are and where they consume information that is critical over these final 22 days.",

You can't just choose the base and get them out and get -- get out the vote and persuasion.You got to do both what is and -- and I believe that the Harris campaign is sort of focused in that direction. What the Trump campaign -- what the sort of aberration that Trump is in American politics is that while they do sometimes do things to try and persuade, they realize they've had little success in -- in that over the time of him in the national spotlight, they have found real success in mining deeper into areas where they have found aligned voters and finding more gold there, right? And so for instance, where's Donald Trump going to be today? He's going to be in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. It's one of those collar counties outside Philadelphia. He's going to be in OAKS, Pennsylvania. So you're, well, Joe Biden won it huge there. Hillary Clinton, even though she lost the state, won big there. What is Donald Trump doing there? Well, he's trying to find more Trump voters, even in places that he may not win. I'll give you an example, in Montgomery County, between his victory in Pennsylvanian '16 and his loss in Pennsylvania in '20, he still found 20,000 more voters to come out for him between those two elections in Montgomery County. And so he may have lost it by a bigger margin because Biden did so well in the suburban areas, and that was part of why he won Pennsylvania, and that is what Harris needs to do if she's going to win. But he was still able to find more voters, even in a Biden rich territory.",

And you saw this in covering the Trump White House. Tell me a single day in his four years as president that you could point to where Donald Trump was all of a sudden playing for the middle or to expand his reach in the middle, they are few and far between -- between. The bulk of his four years was constantly trying to increase those that are already aligned to be with him, increase that share.",

Great to have you both here. All right, so let's just dive into some of the polling we're looking at, OK.

There are other polls, both a Latino poll, a Hispanic Federation poll, a Pew Research poll, an Univision poll that has her in the mid to low 60s with Latino voters and has Donald Trump in the mid to low 30s, which seems to be his ceiling with Latino voters.So she is at right now what Joe Biden had and won with in 2020.

There's only one candidate here that wants to keep families together. Donald Trump, wants to rip families apart, wants to put in mass deportation, wants to put in proposals for the economy that will raise taxes and will lower the economic opportunity, especially for Latino voters in this country.
