I'm Whitney Wild, in for Christine Romans.We begin with new information about the deadly Walmart shooting in Chesapeake, Virginia, and how it unfolded. Police were first called at 10:12 p.m. Tuesday. They arrived within two minutes and made their way inside the store two minutes after that. The scene was declared safe around 11:20 p.m. The gunman was an overnight team leader at that Walmart store. He worked there since 2010. Witnesses say he walked into the break room, pulled out a gun and started firing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Whitney, we have new information from the Chesapeake police on how this unfolded and the suspect themselves. They identify him as 31-year-old Andre Bing. Walmart confirms that he was the suspect in this case and that he was an overnight team leader on their overnight shifts for the store that he had been with them since 2010.But police now saying that Bing did not wear any body armor or a ballistic vest at the time of the shooting. They say that 50 people were believed to be inside the Walmart at the time of the shooting. Police and law enforcement sources tell us that Bing went into a break room and fired on the people who were gathered in there. One witness, Briana Tyler, told us there were maybe 10 or 15 people inside that room at the time that this shooting occurred, including her. She's an employee there. Briana Tyler told us she had been previously warned by other employees to, quote, look out for Andre Bing, that he is the kind of person that would write up people for very little reason, who was just someone who always had some kind of an issue around him, some kind of a controversy there at the store. She gave an account that was really riveting of what happened to her there. She said that the shooter came in and just started opening fire on people in that break room, that he had no expression on his face. That he was not firing on anyone in particular. He was turning and firing at people indiscriminately. She said that he looked her right in the eye and fired at her but that a bullet just whisked by her head and then he left the room. At that point, she scrambled out of the room. Just a riveting account from Briana Tyler who lost a friend in that shooting who died right next to her in that room. Now, we have reached out to Walmart for some additional detail on this suspect. We have asked them whether -- first if they could respond to Briana Tyler's account that she had been warned by other employees about his behavior and tow respond to our questions as to whether he had had any disciplinary issues or was subject to any disciplinary measures while he worked here. We also asked them whether other people had complained about Andre Bing. They have not responded to those questions -- Whitney. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He obviously had a beef with some of the people that he targeted. There were 50 people in the store. He passed up a lot of people. If the goal had just been to kill, he didn't have to go all the way to the break room in order to do that. The one thing I'm not certain about, there was a woman who was shot in the head in the parking lot apparently. I don't know if she was an employee, if she's somehow related to him, if she's just a random victim. That I don't know at this point in time. But it just looks like a workplace shooting unfortunately that took place from a very disgruntled employee. But really I don't -- at least from what I'm hearing now didn't give any signs that he was going to resort to that violence.",

They don't hit the mark of what a mass shooting is. It's rarely reported nationally.But gun violence is a problem, and it's not new. It's been around a while. Part of the problem, like everything else, lawmakers will give thoughts, prayers, all that kind of stuff but they won't do anything concrete that really will make a difference and people have short memories. A week from now we'll all be talking about something different and so we lose focus and we don't take the steps necessary. Law enforcement can only do so much. We have weak gun laws here and we've got to really look at universal background checks, including private sales. You've got to ban assault weapons, extended clips. We've got reporting guns lost or stolen on a mandatory basis. I mean, there's a lot of things that could be done but our elected officials do not have the courage to do it and citizens of this country are dumb enough to keep putting them back in office over and over again. So, this is going to happen again. It is not going to change. We can't pray our way out of this. We have to take action and that's -- I just don't see it happening.",

But those that were able to hit their target, that caused really huge damage.Nearly every single electricity consumer in Ukraine was cut off from power at some point yesterday. In the capital Kyiv, almost every single resident was cut off from running water. Some of that has been restored. Emergency workers have been working around the clock through the night and they have been able to bring back some services. But for President Zelenskyy, this was yet another violation by the Kremlin. He called an emergency Security Council meeting yesterday. That was granted and he did address the security council yet again accusing Russia of terrorism, of war crimes, of essentially trying to ramp up civilian suffering in an attempt to break the resistance, break the will of Ukrainians. President Zelenskyy said that's absolutely not going to happen but that's what you're going to see happen more and more here.

They've said the Germans won't be punished for that action. So a small win for them there on a day of a big upset in terms of their football. The four-time world champions letting a 1-goal lead slip to see them fall to a 2-1 defeat to Japan. And the Japanese fans winning themselves some supporters after their incredible move after the final whistle not heading out straight to celebrate but picking up some bin bags and collecting all their rubbish in the stands. That puts football in prospect. Today we have many people's pre-tournament favorites Brazil kicking off their campaign against Serbia. We see Cristiano Ronaldo take to the pitch for the first time for Portugal. They take on Ghana. Of course, Cristiano Ronaldo ending his relationship with Manchester United just a couple of days ago.
