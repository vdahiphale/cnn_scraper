We speak to the key architects of that effort this hour. But first, the death toll in Turkey and Syria stands at more than 50,000 three weeks after the major earthquake that struck the region and another aftershock hitting today killing at least one person. Britain and the EU have just reached an agreement on new trade rules that would cut red tape in trading goods between Northern Ireland and Britain. And the Head of the CIA says there's growing concern China might provide weapons to Russia. The Kremlin note in declining to comment on the allegations. Welcome back to \"Connect the World\" live from our brand new studio here in Abu Dhabi. As we reported last hour, it's been a deadly weekend in the West Bank. On Sunday, two Israeli settlers were shot and killed south of Nablus and that prompted an angry reaction from other settlers who went on a rampage, burning Palestinian houses at least one person was killed in that violence. Well, these attacks overshadowing a rare gathering between both sides of this conflict brokered by Jordan in the coastal city of Aqaba. The meeting was meant to be the first step in defusing the recent violence so tonight we ask can calm be restored in the West Bank. Well, the meeting in Jordan would quite simply not have gone the way it did. But then our next guest Ayman Al Safadi the Jordanian Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister played a key role in proceedings. He joins us from Amman tonight. So Mr. Foreign Minister, a meeting like this is the first of its kind in many years. Regional and international players, and those involved in both politics and security. Just describe the significance of this Aqaba Summit, if you will?",

But yesterday was the first time the parties got together. The discussion and the negotiation started. The Israelis committed not to discuss any new settlements, and not to authorize any new illegal outposts that I don't believe will reverse the decision that was taken before which we wish and would continue to work that it does. But ultimately, what we got yesterday is an agreement, work to de-escalate work to stop unilateral measures. And both parties should have an interest in that because everybody is going to pay a tremendous price from the violence that we see erupting, particularly as we approach the holy month of Ramadan which would also coincide with Passover? There is simply too much to lose here. There is so much at stake. And if the commitment in Aqaba yesterday, is honored, then we might see some progress towards these escalations.",

We're seeing settler violence, and we're seeing radicals, continuing to incite against peace and continuing to try to drive us towards the best. So the danger is real Becky.

And especially last night, the message we're getting from the Israeli military is that these attacks by the settlers were unacceptable, and that they do see them as acts of terror, then, you know, that's also what they called the attack that killed two Israelis, the shooting attack that killed two Israelis, earlier on Sunday was as a terrorist attack. And in fact, Becky, just in the last few minutes, we are getting word of a another shooting attack that's taken place in the West Bank, not far from Jericho, and not far from the northern part of the Dead Sea. What we're hearing right now from emergency medical professionals is that they're saying that a 25-year-old man was shot. It seems to be while he may have been in his car on the road on this route 90, and that he is in critical condition being taken to the hospital, and this is still a developing situation. But if it turns out to be another shooting attack, I mean, these emergency medical services are already calling it a terror attack.

The UK getting out of the European Union has been a very, very painful process. And this perhaps is the last major thorn that's being removed here. Because it was still contentious because the UK wasn't doing what was agreed with the EU and it even threatened legislation to unpick and undo and not go along with the agreement as it was. So that led to a lot of tension. Why Rishi Sunak says this is going to work as because he thinks that will appeal to the Unionist community in Northern Ireland, whose principal political party, the DUP who refused to continue in a power sharing government with the other political parties in Northern Ireland. Which means that all sorts of things from health care to roads to education have been affected now for a long time damaging the sort of social infrastructure in Northern Ireland, potentially leading to further tensions, as had been witnessed, and that was mentioned at the top of the press conference that the attempted murder of a police officer just last week in Northern Ireland.

The air thick with dust, as excavators comb through the destruction, there were no more survivors to be rescued, only bodies to be recovered. For the living, life has changed forever. And all that remains is the trauma of the earthquake. The moment the earthquake happened, our electricity was cut off. It started to rain and hail fell from the sky - tells me. I pray no one ever has to witness such a moment. Homes cracked and collapsed in front of us. This family has lost everything. Three generations now housed in this small tent in the nearby city of Iskenderun. They are among the hundreds of thousands of people displaced across Southeast Turkey with camps like this expanding each day. Every effort is made to provide families with a semblance of normality. Hot meals, medical care, and even psychological counseling are provided at this humanitarian hub. But there are also many smaller camps with little in the way of infrastructure or even shelter. 73-year-old - tells me that he has not only lost his home, but he has lost loved ones too. Now his family is living on the street. Many of the families still waiting for a tent at this camp of Syrian already made refugees by a cruel ward home now some say they feel they are being side-lined in favor of Turkish families. They've given tents to the Turkish families here, but still no tents for us, - says. Each day we wait. But they say the Turkish families come first. Aren't we all one, and we all brothers and sisters, this earthquake affected all of us. Her sister-in-law Danya says that they along with their young children have spent every day and every night on the streets since the earthquake struck. Accounts like this have been shared with us by numerous Syrian families here in Iskenderun. Though authorities and volunteers alike have told us that no distinction is made between Turkish citizens and Syrian refugees the hope for many now living in tents is that this will all be temporary but aid workers tell us that these camps could be in place for years and the threat of yet another earthquake still hangs over this already shattered population.

And now we're really seeing not just the U.S. moving to try and cut off much of that key pipeline of resources and funding that Russia was able to siphon back into its war effort into Ukraine circumnavigating, the U.S. sanctions. It actually puts the European Council one step ahead of the U.S. The U.S.'s sanctions against Meroe Gold in Sudan date back to 2020, as you saw in this piece. Now the European Council is signaling that it is more serious than the State Department that it is able to move within a legal framework that not only targets Russia and its exploitation of Sudan, but actually moves to the Central African Republic. And moves too much of this fertile territory that Russia has found for new resources across Africa that has brought with it so much pain and death and the executions and the torture that the European Council has spoken about sanctions take a while because they are legal mechanisms. And what we were able to show in our piece, Becky, which this European Council statement has now confirmed was the sanction evasion mechanism that Meroe Gold was able to use in Sudan, which is via this Sudanese front company with the complicity of Sudan's generals.
