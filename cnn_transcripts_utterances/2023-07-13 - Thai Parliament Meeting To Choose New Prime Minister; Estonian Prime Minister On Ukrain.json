That appeared to have calmed frustration and concerns over Ukraine's future in the alliance.But still the Ukrainian leader does not have a timeline for NATO membership. He did though leave the meeting with a promise of unwavering support from allies and moves meant to boost the country's military capability as the war grinds on. Zelenskyy called the summit a meaningful success for Ukraine and said the two days of talks removed any doubts about whether Ukraine will be in NATO. Following the summit, U.S. President Joe Biden headed to Finland, the final stop of his overseas trip, where he will meet with leaders in the hours ahead. CNN's Nic Robertson is following developments and joins us now live from London. Good morning to you, Nic. So, after a tense start, the NATO summit ended in a show of unity and support for Ukraine.

Those bilateral meetings that President Zelenskyy had earlier in the day gave him commitments from nations like Germany, like France, like the U.K. From France, in particular. The cruise missiles from Germany, more attack fighting vehicles and Patriot missile systems, vehicles for those.So, there were those immediate military commitments, which he needs to fight the war right now, which was one of the things that President Biden actually said to him as well, you know, when they sat down -- the pair sat down together in front of cameras, one of the things that President Biden says, you know, we just need to get through the next few months. So, there was that part of the day where that was done. Then, there was a whole NATO part with the NATO communique that really did fall short of what Zelenskyy wanted. But then, there was the G7 part later in the day. And that was the big headline banner, which gave Zelenskyy the cover if you like to say to his people, when he was in the train on the way home, that it actually got something. This is how he explained that.

We don't know yet what happened to that Iskander ballistic missile. But this was, as you say, a third night of attacks Russia bookending, essentially, the NATO summit with these overnight assaults. And in terms of the counter offensive, things continued to be inch by inch this morning, the Ukrainian military claiming a few small areas of success along the eastern and southern France. And as you say very keenly focused now on hitting targets far beyond those frontlines behind enemy lines to try and weaken Russia's reserves its stores of ammunition to make things easier, frankly, for the troops on the front line. But alongside that, an extraordinary development, the resignation, publicly, it seems, in an audio message posted on the Telegram channel of a Russian member of Parliament Ivan Popov, who was the commander of the 58th Army in the -- on the southern front, really commanding troops who were involved in this critical fight in Zaporizhzhia, has said that he has been relieved of his post, fired essentially, by the ministry of defense for telling the truth about what he says the lack of counter battery combat, the absence of artillery reconnaissance stations, mass deaths. He then goes on to say, the servicemen of the armed forces of Ukraine could not break through our army from the front. A senior commander, he says, hit us from the rear, \"treacherously and vilely decapitating, uses that word, \"the army at the most difficult and tense moment.\" So, essentially, not only accusing the Russian military leadership of incompetence of not providing enough support and equipment, but of essentially self-sabotaging themselves by firing him. So, like, obviously, this is coming from this audio message posted on his Telegram channel. It has not been confirmed by the Russian ministry of defense at this stage. But it speaks to this sense of disarray in the Russian Armed Forces underscored, of course, by the Wagner rebellion just a few weeks ago that then reports of purging, cleansing, within the Russian military ranks.

He addressed the summit today. He will also be holding talks with Wang. As we know, China is a close ally of Russia and has been supporting the Kremlin economically and diplomatically throughout the Ukraine war. Now, Wang was not actually supposed to attend this summit.

So, Wang, as the foreign policy chief for the CCP, who ranks above Qin, he will be there in his place. Now, just last month, Rosemary, Blinken met with Wang in Beijing, in what was the first visit to China by U.S. Secretary of State in five years. The aim, obviously, to reset relations and restart communication between the U.S. and China which has been at an all-time low. And then, last week, we saw U.S. secretary of state Janet -- sorry, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. She went to Beijing. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry will be flying to China this weekend for talks. Now, while this flurry of diplomatic activity has certainly raised hopes, you know, and potentially clearing the way for talks between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, this week's revelations that Chinese hackers have breached e-mail accounts of two dozen organizations, including some U.S. government agencies, specifically, the state department, is certainly cause for alarm. Microsoft and the White House have confirmed the hack was a spying campaign aimed at sensitive information, as we know, and investigation is underway.

      "sentences": "Unfortunately, there are just so many different impacts that anomalously high temperatures can have for marine ecosystems.So, I'll start with coral reefs, they're really evolved to stay within a very narrow band of temperatures. They live in the tropics where things don't usually change that much. But when those temperatures get anomalously high get really, really hot, corals actually often will have a process called coral bleaching. This involves them losing their symbiotic algae, these really, really important micro-organisms that live in their tissues that help them survive, they help them grow. But when the temperatures get too hot, they actually lose these algae, which basically cause them to starve and eventually die. This is a process called coral bleaching, it leaves the corals looking stark white. And over the past few decades, coral bleaching events because of these marine heat waves have been increasing in intensity and severity. In fact, just in 2016, Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the biggest coral reef in the whole world, lost an estimated half of all of its corals because of a massive bleaching event. So, we're really worried about seeing something like. This repeated here in Florida and in the Caribbean, because of these just crazy extreme high temperatures that we're seeing that are just completely off the charts. And then, so many other types of marine ecosystems are also going to be affected, you know. Warmer water actually holds less oxygen than colder water. And so, with less oxygen in the water, marine life may not be able to kind of access the oxygen that they need. And they actually may have physiological consequences, it may even lead to fish kills and things like that mortality, which would be just really, really sad to see. And warmer waters are also less productive. Warm water tends to kind of stay put and cause less ocean mixing. And what we want to see is cooler water with more ocean mixing, that causes lots of nice nutrients to float around, that causes plankton to bloom. And that allows the whole ocean food chain to kind of function. Because lots of things eat that plankton, and then things eat those fish, and so on. So, all of these heat waves are really, really problematic for many different pieces of sort of the larger ocean system.",

      "sentences": "Yes, if we're going to see coral reefs persist into the future and surviving in the face of these marine heat waves. We really need to test and implement intervention strategies to actually increase their heat tolerance, increase their ability to survive these heat waves.So, I had mentioned that one of the problems with heat and corals is the fact that they have these symbiotic algae that live in their tissues. And they lose those algae in a bleaching event when that heat gets really high. And so, something that we're doing is actually trying to provide those corals with more heat tolerant types of algae. They're naturally occurring, but they have a higher threshold for bleaching. And that actually allows the corals to survive longer at these high temperatures and remain relatively healthy without bleaching. And then another strategy is kind of like, how we're able to have breeding programs that select for specific traits that we want. And things like livestock, even in dogs. Were actually able to do manage breeding in corals. That is, we're able to identify different parent colonies that are genetically more heat tolerant than others, and then breed those together to create new generations of coral that are also more heat tolerant, and that can survive heat waves like the ones that we're seeing. And we're planting those new generations onto the reefs.",

Now, if Pita fails, another party in the coalition called Pure Thai will nominate its own candidate. Now, after a Prime Minister is elected, a government can be formed luckily by early August but if no candidate wins a majority of the first vote, more candidates can be nominated, and lawmakers will just keep on holding votes until that majority is reached.

And Mr. Zelenskyy, thanked the U.S. President for standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine since the start of the war. So, the Summit ended well, but has enraged Russia, not surprisingly, which warned of negative consequences to the west for offering security guarantees to Ukraine. What might that mean do you think? Do you think the Green Deal is in jeopardy here? Is that what they're suggesting here or something?",

So, basically, everything which Russia is doing right now is at their maximum. I don't think they have much of the escalation potential. But also, of course, they were frustrated. They saw the massive support to Ukraine. They have seen the reiteration of the fact that Ukraine's future is a NATO. They saw the enlargement of NATO with Sweden and Finland.So, for sure, whatever the thing was they were doing is failing right now I mean, Russia is doing is failing right now. So, for sure they're frustrated. But also, Russia is expected to outwait West support -- Western support. They thought that they have more resources, they have some patience, they don't have democracy. So, essentially, Putin could stay whatever he wants, in how long he wants in Russia. And basically, they thought that long-term they would win. But that statement about the long-term guarantees and long-term support obviously destroys their strategy as well. And that's why perhaps they were upset. But that's their problem, to be honest.",
