If you can hear the music behind me right now, there is actually a group of pro-Israeli volunteers just outside the White House right now trying to raise awareness to those 240 hostages being held by Hamas. This group has been out here for several hours now, and it comes, as you noted, there will be those protests, demonstrations here in Washington in support of Israel.But as the president is preparing to head out to San Francisco for this critical meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, he is expected to bring up both the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Hamas in this meeting. Officials say that the president is hoping to lean on Chinese President Xi Jinping and his relationship with Iran to try to push Iran not to try to escalate this war any further, from preventing it taking actions to potentially widen the conflict. That is something the president is planning to bring up in his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. This meeting is all about trying to stabilize the relationship between the two countries at a time when there have been moments of tension and strain over the course of the past year between the U.S. and China. Another issue Biden is expected to press Xi on is trying to restore the military-to-military communications. That is something that China pulled the plug on last year after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. They wanted to try to restore that communication to prevent any surprises from occurring. There are also expected to be a major agreement announced when it comes to the fentanyl crisis, something that the Biden administration has been working towards for quite some time. But this meeting will be watched very closely as the president is trying to find a way to maintain this relationship without preventing it from deteriorating any further.",

That's what our law enforcement sources have been telling us. We know that the mayor, before he took office, when he was still Brook and Borough President, sent some text messages to fire officials asking them to take a look into something that the consulate needed help with. He has argued that that was just part of doing his job. He was looking out for his constituents and that there's nothing to see there. But I think today there's going to be a lot of questions for the mayor, who, as you said, has not been accused of any wrongdoing and has said that he has nothing to hide. But here you have the FBI issuing a warrant, which means that they presented probable cause that there was evidence of a crime on those electronics.

So, in 2023, these are the car thefts per 100,000 cars among residents. Look at how high Washington is over 2000 per 100,000 cars.Compare that to New York City where it's just 670. So, it's not just that the rates are increasing, it's that they were already high to begin with. Here's the other thing about Washington, though. You were mentioning it, Phil, which is the overall crime rate in 2023 versus 2022, it is up. In Washington DC, it's up 27 percent. So, a lot of people aren't feeling safe there. Compare that to a place like New York where crime is actually down by a percent. So the fact is Washington, DC, has higher vehicle theft, and it's part of a larger trend of overall crime growing overall. So it's a big reason why I think a lot of people in Washington, DC don't exactly feel really safe these days.",

So, breaking it up, doing part of the bills in early January, part by February 2, allows Congress to do its job. And so this will have to be a bipartisan measure to prevent the government from shutting down. Because I guarantee you the government shut down, you know who they would blame? They'd blame the House Republicans. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
