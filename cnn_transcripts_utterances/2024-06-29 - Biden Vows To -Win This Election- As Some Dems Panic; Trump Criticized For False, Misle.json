And I say this as a historian of this, that these things almost never matter. And it wouldn't matter last night at all if he had just shown up and did a typical job. Instead, deer in the headlights, mouth agape. He looked like he was zoning out. He was losing the topic, the topic of abortion came up and he brought up the topic of immigration. And didn't hit it out of the park. HIs abortion topic the way that he should. I think right now, the conversation is about whether or not he's -- essentially his people ego (ph) will allow him to step aside. Power doesn't give up power. This is a public servant, a patriot, someone whose service has been incredible to the country. And at this point in time, the only way that he could be replaced, really, in a fashion that would render the party just in tatters, would be for him to give his delegates, release his delegates at the Democratic National Convention or before that. That happens in August in Chicago. And have them coalesce around another candidate. So I would imagine there are all sorts of strategy sessions going on at night, close friends are definitely encouraging him to do that.

But from everyone that I've spoken with, that have known President Biden for years and I mean a number of years, he is going to stay in this thing. And so Donald Trump is going to run a race against him. And the question is going to be for the American voter, do you remember the first two years of the Trump administration before the COVID pandemic? And we can certainly criticize those last two years. Or do you want someone who potentially isn't competent to lead the country forward on economic front, inflation, immigration, the potential for the United States to be drawn into some type of a foreign conflict with Russia or China in the South Chinese (sic) Sea.

VAN DAM (voice-over): So why did Macron do it with a centrist coalition lacking the majority and already struggling to get laws through parliament? Observers say a no confidence vote loomed. Voting happens over two rounds with the French electorate heading to the ballot boxes to send 577 MPs to the national assembly. Macron's announcement sent parties and politicians scrambling to form coalitions. His biggest threat, France's far-right national rally. Seen as Russia friendly and skeptical of the E.U., the party is led by Marine Le Pen's acolyte, 28-year-old, Jordan Bardella. He's a strong contender for France's next prime minister, a role that the president appoints from the party that wins a majority. Other challenges include the new Popular Front, a new coalition of socialists, Communists, Greens and the far left who want to officially recognize the state of Palestine. And this man, current prime minister, Gabriel Attal, who's only been in the job five months, now back on the campaign trail for Ensemble, peddling a message of economic stability. Whoever France's new prime minister is, they will stand shoulder to shoulder with Macron on the world stage in less than a month's time as Paris hosts the Olympic Games. This political uncertainty has spilled onto the streets. A quarter of 1 million people marched throughout France in recent weeks to oppose the national rally. Emmanuel Macron's political gamble in dissolving the parliament hurts his legacy in serious jeopardy. His last years in office could be plagued by political uncertainty or worse. He could be remembered as the French president who paved the way to the far right -- Saskya Vandoorne, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
