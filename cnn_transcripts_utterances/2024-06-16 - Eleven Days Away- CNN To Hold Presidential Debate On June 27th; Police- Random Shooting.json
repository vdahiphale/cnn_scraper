He is saying it is going to be stolen in 2024.

We all remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg, probably stayed in the court a few years longer than she should have and then of course, Trump was able to replace her. I suspect some of the Democrats would prefers some of the older Democratic justices to think about stepping down while Biden is still in office, and they still have nominal control of the Senate, but again, I don't think anything that Biden says will make a difference to the Supreme Court justices' retirement plans.",

So anything Trump can do to cut in into that Black vote, I think is smart and I think focusing on crime is a good issue because in many of these major cities, we have seen, and many African Americans do want a more robust law enforcement presence.

I understand that.But I do think that President Biden has really strong record to run on with the things he has done for the Black community and I think that just does needs -- that message probably needs to get out there more. But I don't think that answering a question about entrepreneurship with crime and how you're going to enforce defending crime in different communities, I don't think that's a good thing for Donald Trump to do.

President Biden has been in touch with local officials there and has offered his support.A total of nine people sustaining gunshot wounds, ranging in ages from eight years old, four years old, and 78. These were families and young children that were gathered for Saturday of play at the local splash pad. This took place in the Rochester Hills section of Michigan. We are learning a little more about the victims, including that group as you mentioned, all members of the same family, a four-year-old boy was shot in the leg and an eight year-old boy sustained gunshot wounds to the head. He remains in critical condition along with a woman believed to be their mother. She is 39 years old. She was shot in the stomach and her leg as well. Now, Fred, we are learning more about this suspect. Police identified him earlier today. He is Michael William Nash from Shelby Township. He is 42 years old. And police tell us, is that this shooting appears to have been random. He drove up to the splash pad, got out of his vehicle and started firing multiple rounds, at least 28 shots were fired. He reloaded that weapon multiple times, then fled the scene, barricaded himself in inside his mother's home. That is where police responded to. They were able to contain him inside that location. There was a standoff between the suspect and police, and what you're seeing there is video taken by a drone that was deployed into the house. Police tell us they believe this is the weapon that was used. You can see its sort of military style assault rifle that was used in this shooting which would explain the large number of times that he was able to fire and the fact that he was able to reload multiple times. So far, we have not learned anything about the motive. As I said, police saying, it appears to have been random and witnesses talking about how chaotic it was when they first heard the shots.
