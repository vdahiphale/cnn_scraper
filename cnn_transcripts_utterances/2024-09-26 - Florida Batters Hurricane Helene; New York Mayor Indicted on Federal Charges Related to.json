I'm Rosemary Church.Just ahead, Hurricane Helene takes aim at Florida's Gulf Coast, set to make landfall later today as a major catastrophic storm. What we know about the potential impact for people in the southeast. And the Biden administration pushing for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah as the two continue to trade fire, what it will take for both sides to agree to stop hostilities. Plus, New York's mayor indicted in a federal investigation. We'll hear his defiant response and look at what charges he could be facing. A massive hurricane churning through the Gulf of Mexico is on track to be the strongest to hit the U.S. in more than a year. Hurricane Helene already dumped torrential rains on Mexico and Cuba, just a preview of what's in store for the southern United States. It is a category one hurricane at the moment, but the forecast was enough to prompt evacuations in Florida. Helene is expected to make landfall as a category four storm later today with catastrophic winds, record rainfall, and life-threatening flooding. Florida's governor warned there could be significant damage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): This could, as I mentioned, be a major hurricane. It could hit as a major hurricane. Some models even have it as a category four, but I think a lot of people are expecting at least a category three. It is a fast-moving storm. It's projected to leave up to 12 inches of rainfall and the storm surge could reach 10 to 15 feet in some areas, which is of course very, very significant. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Earlier this year, Trump, his two older sons and his business were found liable for fraud, as well as issuing false financial statements and business records. The judge ruled Trump inflated the value of his assets to get more favorable terms for loans and insurance. The former U.S. President is not expected to appear in court. No decision is likely until after the November presidential election. Over the past month, Trump's legal team has tried to get multiple cases thrown out, including special counsel Jack Smith's federal election interference case, as well as the guilty verdict in the hush money criminal case and the defamation verdict. Well Kamala Harris is taking aim at Trump's economic plan, saying it would lead to a recession. During an interview with MSNBC, the Democratic presidential nominee said his threat to impose a broad hike on tariffs shows he's just not very serious, adding, that's not an idea you just throw around. The vice president said the U.S. will need to raise corporate taxes to pay for her economic initiatives which include an expanded child care credit and assistance for first-time home buyers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS (D), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Top economists in our country, from Nobel laureates to people at Moody's and Goldman Sachs have compared my plan with his and said my plan would grow the economy, his would shrink the economy. Some of them have actually assessed that his plan would increase inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. So the facts remain that Donald Trump has a history of taking care of very rich people. My perspective on the economy is when you grow the middle class, America's economy is stronger.

      "sentences": "Yeah, well, first of all, I think this speech really underscores the extent to which we are looking at very divergent visions of how the federal government manages the economy.Trump, even more than in 2020 or 2016, is laying out a vision of a kind of fortress America economy with high walls of tariffs, severe restrictions on immigration, a mass deportation program, and lower tax rates, which, by the way, those three things are pretty much the formula that Republican presidents employed during the 1920s in the decade before the depression. Harris today made clear that she wants to extend the kind of neo- industrial policy of the Biden administration, with a lot of tax cuts to steer investment both toward industries, where she says it's important for the U.S. to compete, but also toward places that have been left behind in many ways. And this has been probably the signal success of the Biden economic strategy, all the existing tax incentives that she wants to build on in the Inflation Reduction Act have generated a torrent of private investment, primarily in clean energy, primarily in Republican-held districts. The problem that Biden and Harris have had is that success and the other economic successes of low unemployment, a lot of job growth, high stock market have really all been overshadowed for voters, eclipsed for voters by the increase in prices during his first few years in office. And even though inflation is coming down, prices themselves are not coming down. And that makes it hard for Harris to prevail over Trump when voters are asked who they trust more on the economy.",

When we use the phrase, usually we're thinking about someone that the campaigns call a persuadable voter, which is someone who is pretty certain to vote. But uncertain, whether they're going to vote for Harris or Trump, there really aren't that many of those voters.I think, the campaigns believe it might be somewhere between four at the low and maybe seven percent of voters in the swing states and these are idiosyncratic voters they tend to be either a white collar Republican Nikki Haley-type voters or blue collar media in common below younger non-white voters kind of hard to see how they're going to sort out. But there's a much bigger group of undecided voters Rosemary, which is what the candidates call, what the campaigns call irregular voters. 80 million people were eligible in 2020 and didn't vote. That is the real reward here. That is the real prize for the two campaigns.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet separately with U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Mr. Zelenskyy is expected to share his victory plan with the White House. The Biden administration is pledging long-term support for Ukraine despite political uncertainty. The U.S. announced a new aid package for Kyiv on Wednesday worth $375 million. That is nearly double the size of recent shipments and more could be on the way. Well CNN's Clare Sebastian is following developments for us. She joins us now live from London.

Russia would like to sort of take over Ukraine and they say that they're fighting not against the Ukrainian people, but of course what they call the Kyiv regime.So the Republicans are seeming to take their cue from President Trump, the House Majority Leader Mike Johnson is now not set to meet with him, even though Zelenskyy will be meeting with his Democratic counterpart, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. So this is the political roller coaster that Zelenskyy is having to navigate while in the U.S. and really sort of sets up why there is now so much weight on this meeting with Biden today.",

And so Russia is sort of tightening up that red line here.Now, Russian nuclear doctrine before this did allow for a first strike if Russia felt that its very existence was threatened with conventional weapons. But what Putin said on Wednesday is that they are now sort of adding a point where if Russia feels that it is under threat with conventional weapons from a non-nuclear country but supported in some way by a nuclear country, they would consider that a joint attack. So clearly this is a direct response to that issue. with those long- range missiles and Russia as it has done throughout this war rattling that nuclear saber but it is something that certainly the West does watch very closely since we know that certainly at one point in this war in the in the autumn of 2022 there were serious concerns in the US that Russia came very close to using a tactical nuclear weapon on Ukraine.

It's pretty impressive to see numbers get that high for a storm, it's a larger storm. We've had storms pass on the same path like that.

But many in Japan are also asking whether justice has really been served. Hakamata has spent nearly five decades behind bars for a majority of his life for the court to now find that he's never committed those crimes. And these are years that he cannot get back.Now just some details about Hakamata's case and the timing of his acquittal. He was first arrested in the 60's for allegedly killing his boss and his boss' family. Now at the time of his arrest, he initially confessed, but according to the judge, he was actually made to confess by the police, who used violence and also threats. And ever since making that forced and false confession, Hakamata has always maintained his innocence. You can see that in the hundreds of letters that he sent to his family over the years. Now, the timing of this retrial comes first actually back in 2014 when it was first granted. And that's in large part because new evidence in his case emerged. And as we learn today, according to the judge's ruling, that evidence is in fact the fact that the prosecution and the police fabricated evidence to convict him. They planted articles of clothing at the scene of the crime that they said belonged to Hakamata that they said contained blood stains that matched the DNA of Hakamata. But again, according to the court's ruling today, that evidence was indeed fabricated and Hakamata was found innocent. Now these all point to, according to human rights activists, why Japan should abolish the death penalty. Outside of the United States, Japan is the only G7 country that actually still practices the death penalty. And according to human rights activists and lawyers, it can lead sometimes to falseful convictions and wrongful convictions like in Hakamata's case. Now also as we've seen over the years, Hakamata's mental health has deteriorated significantly because of all the time that he spent behind bars and also because in Japan they practice same-day execution. Unlike in the United States, death row inmates are only informed that they'll be hanged a couple of hours before. Now imagine waking up every single day wondering if that will be your very last day. And of course that has taken a huge mental toll on Hakamata. And again, that's why human rights activists and lawyers have argued that Japan's criminal justice system needs to change in order to provide better rights for these inmates. Rosemary.",
