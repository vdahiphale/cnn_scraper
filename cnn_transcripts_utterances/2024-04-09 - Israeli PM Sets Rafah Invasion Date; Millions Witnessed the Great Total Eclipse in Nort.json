Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a date has been set for a ground operation into the southern Gaza city of Rafah despite strong international opposition to such an offensive.More than one million displaced Palestinians are seeking shelter there and the U.S. State Department says Israel has not presented a credible plan for dealing with those civilians or provided a date for an invasion of Rafah. A source says CIA Director Bill Burns has presented a new proposal to try and bridge the gaps in the ongoing negotiations between Israel and Hamas during weekend talks in Cairo. Hamas says its leaders will review the latest proposal from Israel even though it doesn't meet their demands. Here's Mr. Netanyahu's reaction to that news. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Today I received a detailed report on the talks in Cairo. We are constantly working to achieve our goals, primarily the release of all our hostages and achieving a complete victory over Hamas. This victory requires entry into Rafah and the elimination of the terrorist battalions there. It will happen. There is a date. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the Turks had also requested to get in on the airdrops being done primarily by the Jordanians with their own cargo planes, something that the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, says that the Israelis have now rejected. And Fidan said yesterday in a press conference that there is no excuse for Israel to block our attempt to airlift aid to starving Gazans. And he said that Turkey will now take action.And just this morning, we have seen confirmation from the Turkish trade ministry that exports to Israel in more than 50 categories have been blocked or have been barred until there is a ceasefire agreement reached. That includes things like cement, aluminum, steel, electrical components, ceramics, the list goes on and on. We know, of course, that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has been one of perhaps the most outspoken critic of Israel since this war began. But his critics inside the country have long complained that his words or that his actions didn't necessarily match his words. Now, that seems to be changing. Back in December, I spoke, I interviewed his chief advisor, who said that there were no talks of sanctions on Israel. At the time, he said that this was not a state- to-state issue, but rather an issue for private businesses to sort out. And perhaps part of it is because Turks sent the message at the ballot box in this last round of local elections where smaller parties to the right of President Erdogan's own AK Party siphoned off some of his votes. And those parties wanted to see a harder line when it comes to Israel. And now we are seeing it. Turkey also is well known, of course, as a host of Hamas officials right here in Istanbul. In fact, the leader of Hamas may have actually been here on the date that those October 7th attacks carried out. Whether or not that played into Israel's decision to reject Turkey's participation in airdrops, we don't know. But we have reached out to the Israelis for comment. Rosemary.",

Lord Cameron, the British foreign secretary, was actually in Florida talking to Mr. Trump, trying to talk some sense into him to, you know, take away his opposition to this bill.

Both Lord Cameron and the French foreign secretary wrote a very, very strong op-ed saying that not only could Ukraine lose if this funding doesn't come through, but the West will feel this. Putin will continue his relentless advance further into Europe. It would trigger NATO action boots on the ground here. It would disrupt supply chains. Very, very disastrous for the West.

In a matter of seconds, a so-called sounding rocket blasts off, then disappears from view at NASA's Wallops Island facility on the Virginia coast. Traveling at about 6,000 miles an hour, three of these rockets carried special payloads tailored to this solar eclipse. Launched just before, during and just after the peak of the eclipse, each rocket traveled about 260 miles above the Earth to the ionosphere, the uppermost layer of Earth's atmosphere that borders space. TRAVIS PAUL, SOUNDING ROCKET ENGINEER; Once the motors are done burning, we will deploy booms that take measurements, and then we'll also deploy these swarm modules that shoot out away from the body of the payload. TODD (voice-over): The swarm canisters, each about the size of a two- liter soda bottle, and the booms, are equipped with instruments to measure the disturbances in the ionosphere during the solar eclipse.
