And the Michigan gunman who killed four classmates at his school back in 2021 is now sentenced to life in prison without parole. The teenager hearing emotional statements from the victims' families and then telling the court, and I'm quoting him now, I am a really bad person. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Will Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Our top story tonight, Donald Trump gagged again. An appeals court agreeing the former president of the United States should be barred from public statements about witnesses and other key players in the federal election subversion case, but with some significant exceptions. CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider has more on the ruling. So, Jessica, what does this mean for Trump?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, it means the gag order against Donald Trump, it will, in fact, be in place moving forward.But the appeals court today saying that the original gag order from District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, it was just too broad. So, specifically, the appeals court is removing restrictions when it comes to Trump talking about Special Counsel Jack Smith. The appeals court really explained that Jack Smith is part of the Justice Department, that Trump should be allowed to criticize public officials and he should be able to express his views that this prosecution is politically motivated. So, the appeals court here really trying to walk this fine line of protecting Donald Trump's First Amendment free speech rights, but also limiting just how far he can go in attacking witnesses and other court staffers and personnel, as we've seen him already do. So, this is how the gag order will play out. Trump will not be able to make public statements about potential witnesses in this case. He also can't make derogatory comments that would interfere in this case when it comes to the court staff, the special counsel staff or family members. And, of course, we saw Donald Trump speak out against Special Counsel Jack Smith's wife recently at one of his rallies. So, Trump will now be restricted from making any comments about her or other family members, though it's important to note there will be no restrictions on his speech about Special Counsel Jack Smith or the judge in this case or really the prosecution, in general. So, the appeals court, in making this decision, they wrote this. They said many of former President Trump's public statements attacking witnesses, trial participants and court staff pose a danger to the integrity of these criminal proceedings. That danger is magnified by the predictable torrent of threats of retribution and violence that the district court found follows when Mr. Trump speaks out forcefully. And, Wolf, tonight, Trump is saying that his legal team will appeal. So, the next step in this case would either be to appeal to the full appeals court here in D.C. since today's decision was just from that three-judge panel or the president's legal team could take this appeal directly to the Supreme Court. So, presumably, we'll see what they do in the coming days. Wolf?",

It goes through a reminder of the kinds of statements that Trump was making that, in the words of this panel, had real-time, real-world consequences, statements that he was making about potential witnesses and how they received torrents of threats. We've seen this over and over again. We saw what happened in the New York civil case when Trump not only went after the judge, but went after the clerk, a court employee, said things about her that were flatly not true, and she ended up receiving several -- many dozens a day of threats on her cell phone that people somehow got a hold of, anti-Semitic threats.So, look, I think that this is not about silencing Donald Trump. In fact, this opinion goes chapter and verse into the importance of the First Amendment, but makes it clear that you cannot hide behind the First Amendment to make statements that are clearly not protected by the law.",

One adviser say that he's going to walk all the way up to the line but not cross it. Again, as we've mentioned, he can go after Jack Smith. He can go after the Department of Justice. We know this is a big part of his campaign to be president that he's being politically persecuted and that he's going to continue with that messaging. There is some concern among some allies that when it comes to the witnesses, he might have a harder time, particularly when it comes to perhaps getting some of that testimony or learning what these witnesses have said.

That is the biggest number all across Gaza since that fragile truce fell apart a week ago, exactly a week ago on Friday. That's one of the biggest numbers that we've seen since this war started exactly two months ago. We did hear from the defense minister of Israel earlier today. He said that he's starting to see the signs of Hamas beginning to break inside Gaza. Much of the IDF's focus, Wolf, is on Khan Younis. That is the second biggest city in Gaza. That's where Israel believes that some of the most senior leaders of Hamas are. And that is where Israel is focusing a lot of its attention, the IDF saying that they are going house to house, tunnel to tunnel, carrying out raids.Elsewhere in Gaza, in the north, Wolf, we saw Israeli troops raise the Israeli flag in Palestine Square. That is a main intersection in Gaza City, not too far, incidentally, from Al-Shifa Hospital, which I think people will remember well. And then, Wolf, the IDF also announcing that they tried to carry out a raid to rescue a hostage. That raid did not go well. The hostage was not rescued. Two IDF soldiers were severely injured. They have tried to carry out these rescue raids in the past. In October, they were successful. They got a young female hostage out.

And that was -- I mean, Wolf, listening to Hunter Biden say, they're trying to kill me, he doesn't mean that metaphorically. He means that literally because he's an addict. And his argument has been that the reason he didn't pay his taxes, the reason he spent so much money, over a million, maybe almost a million and a half dollars, on all of these untoward things and more, is because he was addicted to very horrible drugs, to crack. And so what he is saying there is they're trying to get me to get me off the wagon, which would destroy my father. And there, of course, are political reasons for this.
