They`re still rescuing individuals, but they`re also trying to convince them to evacuate. Let me show you around. This is an area that`s called the River Bottom. Now, this street curls around, and there are homes back there, RVs back there. I`ve talked to neighbors who say that there are between 8 and 15 individuals back there who do not want to evacuate. But take a look around, and you`ll see the water levels. You see the water level on the fence and on the trees. If you look closely, the good news is that some of the water is receding because you can tell that water level from the tree. Now, I talked to the owner of this mobile home. Her name is Stacey Smith, and she is one of the individuals who has access to her home. She has taken everything out. She has left the area, but she says that she`s trying to come back because she`s trying to convince the 8 to 15 individuals that she calls friends and family who are back in the river bottom because she`s hoping that they evacuate to safety. Take a listen.",

Brazil`s president is assuring citizens that there will be help from the government for healthcare, food, and transportation for people affected by the floods. Pop quiz, hot shot. How long does it take for the moon to make a complete orbit around our planet Earth? 31 days, 27 days, 14 days, just a day. If you said 27 days, put your hands up. The moon makes a complete orbit around Earth in 27 Earth days and rotates or spins at that same rate or in that same amount of time. Ever wonder why we always see the same side of the moon, even though both the Earth and moon rotate on their axes? Well, it`s because the moon takes about the same amount of time to complete an orbit of Earth and rotate around its axis. Well, the far side of the moon is about to have a visitor, a probe, China`s Chang`e 6. This probe won`t have any astronauts on board, but it launched on Friday and is set to land on the far side of the moon to collect samples during its 53-day mission. While spaceflight has traditionally been led by the United States and Russia, more countries are getting in on the game. CNN`s Marc Stewart has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is China`s latest leap in the global quest to put a human back on the moon. CNN was there invited by the Chinese government for a behind-the-scenes look at the Wenchang launch site here on Hainan Island along the South China Sea. The goal of this mission to bring back the first samples ever collected from the moon`s far side. Part of China`s ambitious plan to send astronauts by 2030 and build a lunar research station.",

Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, a zebra named Shug finally found safe and sound. Four zebras were seen running down an interstate near North Bend in Washington State after they escaped from a trailer on April 28th. The owner reportedly stopped to fix an issue with the trailer, and then these zebras were seen running through yards. Some people thought this was some sort of prank. While three of the zebras were captured within a few hours, a mare named Shug remained on the run for nearly six days, but animal services says Shug was safely rescued Friday night.
