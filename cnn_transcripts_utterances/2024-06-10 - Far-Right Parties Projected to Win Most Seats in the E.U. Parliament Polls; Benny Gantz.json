But I think it's safe to say now, and especially given how clearly we see that it feeds international politics like in France, that these parties are no longer on the fringes. This is the mainstreaming of these far-right parties and these far-right policies.Now, look, it's clear also that the center did hold the EPP. The European People's Party, led by E.U. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, is still the biggest party in the European Parliament. It did gain seats. And she should be able to comfortably form a coalition with several other parties in the center and the center-left in order to be able to push through the policies that she wants. Of course, there's another question hanging over her. She is up for re-election. Her term expires in July. So she'll be hoping that she can bring forward that support for that as well. But I think if you look to the right of that chart, you do see gains for the I.D. group, led by Marine Le Pen from France, which, of course, gained huge amounts of seats in this vote, the ECR, where Giorgia Meloni of Italy is the key figure. And, of course, N.I., non- attached members, now includes the AFD, the Alternative for Germany party in Germany, that was deemed so far to the right that Marine Le Pen actually kicked it out of the I.D. group a few weeks ago. So that's another part of this story, is that the far-right itself is not unified. So given that, I think it's unclear at this point how much power they will wield within the parliament.",

In a televised statement, he described the decision as, quote, \"complex and painful\". Gantz's departure comes just weeks after he issued an ultimatum to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he called on him to lay out a new plan for the war against Hamas by June 8.Netanyahu asked Gantz to change his mind, saying now is the time to, quote, join forces. But Gantz made his thoughts clear, accusing the Israeli leader of putting his own political considerations ahead of a strategy for a post-war Gaza. And he's calling on Netanyahu to hold an election in the coming months. Well, Gantz was expected to resign Saturday, but postponed his announcement following news that Israeli forces had rescued four hostages held in Gaza. Officials there say the raid killed at least 274 Palestinians. Israel says it estimates the number of casualties from the operation to be under 100 civilians. CNN cannot independently verify either side's figures. We are tracking all the developments from London. Well CNN's Nada Bashir and journalist Elliott Gotkine are standing by for us. Good to have you both with us. I want to start with you, Elliott, first on the resignation of Benny Gantz. He had given an ultimatum. He wanted a plan to bring the hostages home. There are still over 100 in Gaza. But he also wanted a post-war plan for Gaza. So his resignation, while not unexpected, he did express his frustration with Netanyahu, right?",

Benny Gantz was seen as a kind of moderating influence on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He ensured that he was in the war cabinet, along with Netanyahu, along with Defense Minister Yoav Galant, and that specifically the far-right ministers in Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition would not be in the war cabinet.So all of the decisions and the prosecution of Israel's war against Hamas since the Hamas terrorist attacks of October the 7th have been a result of decisions made by the war cabinet. It hasn't just been Netanyahu. And it hasn't been Netanyahu and his far-right ministers. But what's going to happen now is, first of all, Netanyahu, it's important to note, is not under threat in terms of his position as prime minister. He still has the numbers in Israel's parliament, the Knesset, 64 out of the 120 seats. So as long as his right-wing ministers don't bolt from the coalition, then he is pretty much politically at least safe in government until October 2026. What it does do, though, is leave Netanyahu more isolated and also gives more power and will perhaps leave him more open to persuasion by those far- right ministers in terms of the war and in terms of those hostage negotiations.",

Thanks so much.Well, more than 80 million people are under heat alerts here in southwestern U.S. as the southern half of the country grapples with extreme heat at the start of the workweek. Some areas could see temperatures as high as 110 degrees Fahrenheit. That's about 43 degrees Celsius. Here's CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And that's thanks to some showers and thunderstorms that will be moving back into the area. Quite a different story, however, for both Macon and Jackson, where the temperatures will actually be going back up as we make our way into the middle of the week. And that's the same story out to the west, where those temperatures are expected to drastically rise over the next few days. Albuquerque going from 77 all the way up to 98 by Wednesday. Denver, Colorado going from 84 up to 93 in places like Phoenix, Las Vegas, even up around Sacramento, all looking at those temperatures well above average for this time of year. When we look at the heat risk again, you can see a lot of these areas up in that moderate risk area, the orange color you see there, but even a few spots in red from western Texas stretching all the way up into Utah and even California. The concern there is that, yes, even though it's June, it's summertime, we expect hot temperatures. These are considered dangerously hot for a lot of these areas compared to what they normally would see. And for some of these areas, it's going to last for quite some time. Take Tucson, for example. Every single one of the next seven days, this temperature is expected to be well above average. Las Vegas, for example, a very hot place, but right now their average high is only about 98. They're not even technically supposed to be at triple digits. But if you look at every single one of the next seven days, all of them looking at those high temperatures into the triple digits, some of them even making it awfully close to around 110.

And the threat of another failed rainy season has UNICEF raising the alarm. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KINKADE (voice-over): Children line up for what may very well be their only meal today, waiting patiently for a scoop, maybe two, of macaroni. Their parents, who rely on neighboring farms for work, out of the job due to crop failure. No crops mean no food, let alone any money to buy it. A drought caused by a combination of naturally occurring El Nino and human-induced global warming plagues Zimbabwe. It's the worst drought here in years, after a failed rainy season from October to March. And the threat of another below average season later this year. Crops have dried up and families are struggling to put food on the table. In a flash appeal UNICEF said 7.6 million people need life-saving support, of those the most vulnerable are children. LETWIN MHANDE, MOTHER OF FOUR (through translator): Food is a big challenge and sometimes the kids carry corn snacks to school. This is different from previous years when we had good rainy seasons and I could at least pack something decent for them. We can now only afford to have one meal per day because we have no choice. KINKADE (voice-over): At this feeding station and four others, donors fund two meals for about 1,500 children a day. But as the drought persists and donations dip, resources are stretched increasingly thin.",
