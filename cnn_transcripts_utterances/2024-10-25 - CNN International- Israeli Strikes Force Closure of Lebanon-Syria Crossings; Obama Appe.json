It is 04:00 p.m. in Beirut, and it is 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Eleni Giokos. This is \"Connect the World\". And also happening over the next two hours, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrapping up meetings with leaders from Lebanon, Jordan and the UAE ahead of fresh cease fire talks this weekend. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump both head to Texas to try and win over undecideds in the famously -- state. And Ukraine says North Korean troops are on the ground in Russia near the front lines of war, but leaked intercepts show not all Russian soldiers are happy about it. All right. Welcome to the show. Let's check in to see how the U.S. futures are faring around 30 minutes to go until the start of market trade. As you can see, all nicely in the green, S&amp;P 500, four tenths of percent higher, as well as the DOW Jones, three tenths of a percent higher. What's driving markets over the past few days is, of course, corporate earnings having a significant impact this week. In fact, we've seen a lot of volatility coming through as market participants are absorbing some of the profits coming through from these companies. Well as cease fire efforts appear to be revving up again in the Middle East. We begin with a stark reminder of what is at stake. At least 26 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes targeting homes and tent camps in Khan Younis in Gaza. Meantime, health officials say Israeli troops fired on and entered a hospital in Northern Gaza, separating men and women. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. Now in Lebanon, Israeli strikes on Hezbollah have forced the closure of eastern border crossings with Syria, as well as about 1/3 of Lebanon's health facilities. Overnight, an Israeli strike on a guest house reportedly killed three journalists. Israel's military says it is looking into it. In London, meantime, U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken has been holding security talks with officials from Lebanon, Jordan and the UAE. The meetings come ahead of cease fire negotiations scheduled for Sunday. A lot going on in the region. We've got CNN Paula Hancocks joining us in studio today. It's been quite a week, and I just want to talk about what happened overnight, because these are significant issues we've seen in Northern Gaza, specifically at that hospital. What do we understand is happening on the ground right now?",

It's right in the heart ofwhere Israel says it's operating at the moment, because they believe that Hamas is rebuilding, regrouping in that area. So, it's an operation that's been going for almost three weeks. But now we understand from the director of the hospital and the Ministry of Health that the Israeli military has entered twice into the compound. They have fired upon the complex, according to the director, and there have been fires in some of the buildings. And he also said that there were some very sick patients who he was worried were going to die because they weren't able to give them the health care that they need. He showed a video of him in the ICU, and you have patients and the medical staff huddling in the corner as this is going on now. Now from Israel's side, they say that they have information that Hamas is in this area. They say that just the night before, they had actually facilitated the WHO, the World Health Organization bringing fuel to the hospital. They had evacuated some of the sicker patients with their escorts and children. And they say that they have eliminated, in their words, hundreds of militants in this area. So, it's a very difficult situation for those civilians who are left in this area, in particular that hospital.",

Well, as we mentioned, the top American Diplomat, AntonyBlinken, has wrapped up his London meetings with the Middle East leaders and is about to return to Washington. CNN's Kylie Atwood is at the U.S. State Department. Kylie, great to see you. We just heard from Paula Hancocks describing what seems to be ongoing escalation in what we've seen in Gaza as well as in Lebanon. But importantly, Antony Blinken is trying to find a way to look at diplomatic solutions in the Middle East, with leaders here. And then, importantly, wrapping up meetings with the Lebanese Caretaker Prime Minister in London. Give me a sense of whether these meetings are yielding any progress or yielding anything at this juncture. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's a really good question. And the Secretary of State, his 11th trip to the Middle East since this war began last October. And he really set out to try and bring to life what the United States says is this moment of opportunity, following the death of Hamas Leader, Yahya Sinwar, to actually drive an end to the conflict in Gaza. Initially, there were a few signs that he was making any progress on that front. Yesterday, after his meetings in Doha, he was able to say that there would be a meeting of the negotiators over the coming weekend. CIA Director Bill Burns is going to be attending that, the top Israeli intelligence official will also be attending that. But significantly, we don't know that Hamas will be at the table. And the Secretary said that in the coming days, it will become clear if Hamas is ready and able to partake in those negotiations or not. The question of how effective conversations can be without Hamas at the table is an open one. And frankly, people are concerned that talks can't really go anywhere until you have Hamas at the table, until there is someone who is picked actually to take over the -- from Yahya Sinwar and become the leader and also the decision maker within Hamas. Now you have these conversations that happened today with the Secretary, as you said, with the Lebanese Caretaker Prime Minister, also with his counterparts from the UAE, his counterparts from Jordan. The Secretary used the word urgent multiple times ahead of his trip, with his visit, excuse me, with his Jordanian counterpart saying that this is a moment to take urgent action to try and drive forth an end to the conflict in Gaza. He said they also discussed plans for post war situation in Gaza, what that could look like. So, these are conversations that the U.S. has been having for months now, almost a year now, really. So, the question is, how exactly they dig into the details to make them an actual reality, particularly given the backdrop here. We've talked to U.S. officials who recognize that due to the U.S. presidential elections less than two weeks away, Israelis are very unlikely to agree to any path forward for Gaza until those elections take place, until they see who they're going to be dealing with on the U.S. side as a result of whomever wins those elections.",

But if you looked at the fine print on his super PAC website, in order to sign that petition you needed to be a registered voter in a swing state, and that is the problem, because in the eyes of many legal experts that we spoke to and now, apparently also the Justice Department, it is legally problematic to link the act of registration to these payments. Registration really cannot be a prerequisite for getting cash prizes or lottery or sweepstakes. It is been long U.S. law. It's been a long-standing law here in the U.S. to criminalize that the Justice Department polices it every cycle. Things always come up here and there, but it's very rare for the world's richest man to dole out a million dollars a day in a program like this.
