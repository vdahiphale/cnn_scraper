SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENTNow, the first Ukrainian confirmation of the use of Storm Shadow with a particular target being mentioned, I think, is significant because this is now not just an attempt to break the logistics back of the Russians, but also to signal to the Russians about just how bad things are likely to be for them down the line when this offensive gets underway. Now, we've seen some sort of propaganda video being produced by the head of the armed forces here saying an offensive is imminent, but that is really directed again at Russian troops because Ukrainians take their inspiration for fighting from scenes like this. This is a mental health outpatient clinic. Two people killed here yesterday. One at least missing. There have found remains in what was the rubble is now being cleared up. That's going to be analyzed. This was a daytime air strike by a Russian missile, part of the ongoing effort by Russia, of course, to break the spirit of the Ukrainians. But I have to say. When you talk to Ukrainians, it's this kind of scene that they cite as a reason why they are fighting so bitterly in places like Bakhmut, for example, which doesn't have an obvious strategic necessity about it but is a frontline position.

There's a lot of narrative. There's a lot -- there's a lot of very boisterous comments about Russia using nukes. So, this is very, very troubling. I think the only good thing in all of this is that in the case of the potential Russian use of nukes, is that we, the United States, and all Western powers are multiple decisions from a bad decision and multiple levels of a decision. What I mean is, there are off-ramps. If there's the threat of nukes, there are mechanisms in place where we can try to de-escalate that.

It's really almost directly analogous to what the U.S. government does when they get -- when they get rated that this way.And so, they're going to go down effectively. It's like saying that the U.S. is -- the U.S.'s FICO scores going down. And so therefore, when they have to go out to borrow more, they have to pay more interest to borrow that -- borrow more of that money. And that really has a dramatic impact on everyday Americans and families. You know, that means that typically, their auto loans, their home loans, school loans, everything that's any variable interest rate loan would actually go up, and which is, you know, deeply dramatic, especially at a time when most Americans are feeling the crunch right now. And, you know, job losses are mounting. And many people are now moving -- burned through their savings and now move into credit cards to pay their -- pay their monthly bills. And so, it's just a real challenge -- real challenge.

So, the name of the pathogen is Acinetobacter baumannii, which is a mouthful, and it's a problematic hospital acquired infection.And what makes it so challenging is it likes to hang out for a really long time on hospital surfaces, it's really hard to get rid of. And the other reason it's a particular challenge is because it likes to take up DNA from its surrounding environment. And you would imagine, if you're a bacterium living in a hospital, you're going to be taking up lots of antibiotic resistance genes. So, it's really common to find isolates of Acinetobacter that are resistant to many, if not all, are currently used antibiotics. In addition to this, it's quite virulent, it can cause a lot of different types of infections, from pneumonia, to meningitis, to wound infections, to sepsis. And it has quite a high mortality rate, you know, estimates put it at roughly one in four. So, it's a really burdensome clinic pathogen.",

People have been working on this for decades now.But I think the technology is becoming sufficiently robust, sufficiently sophisticated in order to meaningfully, let's say, improve the drug discovery process, in our case, antibiotics. So, what the process looked like is we gathered data, chemical training data in the laboratory, figuring out which chemicals could kill Acinetobacter and which ones couldn't. We then use that data to train an artificial intelligence model. And then, we started showing that artificial intelligence model pictures of brand-new chemicals that we didn't know whether they were antibiotic or not, just brand-new chemicals. And the model helped us discover this one molecule we named Addison (PH) that ended up showing this interesting activity against Acinetobacter.",

It's a significant time savings. And this scales, right, you know, we did this here at a relatively small scale. But, you know, we are currently working on projects where we have A.I. models that are running predictions on hundreds of millions, billions of chemicals.
