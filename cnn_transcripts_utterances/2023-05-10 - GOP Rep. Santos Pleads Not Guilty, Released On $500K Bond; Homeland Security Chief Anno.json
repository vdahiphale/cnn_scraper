And he did not think that George Santos should resign. In fact, he repeated that today. In fact, he repeated that today, despite the fact that now Santos has been indicted. Here he is.

Officials say the U.S. plans to open about a 100 more processing centers, deploy hundreds of more military troops and 1,000 officers to help process asylum applications and to add detention space. Border authorities are also right to expand the use of a new app that apparently helps migrants make appointments for entry while also taking steps to cut down on misinformation.

Because what you're seeing now are streets that used to be packed are now empty. Look down that alley. There were so many times when I looked down this alley it was completely packed. Not the case anymore. A lot of the resources that the city and the county have dedicated to this area because this was practically ground zero are still here. You can see a lot of the port-a-potties are still here and washing stations. Even though the migrants are no longer here, because a lot of them turned themselves in, you can see that this street is closed and that the resources are still out here. Today is actually Mother's Day in Mexico, so there's actually a Mother's Day event on site for a lot of the mothers so the mothers can have a meal today. I want to show you live drone footage from just a few miles from where I'm standing. This shows you the current flow of migration. What you're seeing is the border wall. This is El Paso. These officials have turned themselves into immigration authorities. And the reason why they're there is they're waiting for transportation to a processing facility. Those are the images that we're going to be monitoring as Title 42 ends. Because we're going to be able to see, are those lines going to get longer or shorter? We don't know exactly what's going to happen. Here's what we do know. According to officials here in the city of El Paso and the county, a county official telling CNN that they expect about 2,000 migrants to be released into the community, in El Paso, every single day. Now, right now, about 150 to 200 are being released into the community. So that gives you a sense of the magnitude, Boris, of what they're expecting. Now, all of the officials that I've talked to warn me, they don't know exactly what's going to happen when Title 42 lifts. Maybe it's fewer than 2,000, maybe it's more -- Boris?",

Tell us how much bigger you expect it to be in the coming days? MAYOR VICTOR TREVINO (I-LAREDO, TEXAS): Thank you, first of all, for having me. We're seeing some historic challenges in our border, as we know. As a border mayor, we're in the trenches of every immigration problem. So we're boarding up like it's a hurricane coming. Laredo continues to be one of the safest cities with one of the lowest illegal border crossings in the country. But we have been informed that we'll be receiving transfers from Brownsville, Texas, and El Paso, Texas, that are currently overwhelmed, as we saw. Our fear is that we will be overwhelmed with this transfer of migrants and have the same situation as they have. Some of these challenges include making sure that we have resources in our community and the humanitarian aid for these migrants that they need. But beginning with our hospitals and medical structure that we're struggling with due to capacity and personnel, we also don't have a pediatric intensive care unit. And these are family units that are coming. I'm also concerned about our commercial bridge is protected. At the end of the day, what has been a federal problem for decades, now has become a local problem for our border communities. (CROSSTALK)",

ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: So, Jim, about half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Studies have shown that having to go back to the doctor for a birth control prescription for an updated refill prescription is a problem. It is an impediment for women. Some women aren't taking their pills because of it. That's why the American Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for years have supported putting birth control pills over the counter. And basically, the FDA's panel of external advisers voted one by one saying yes, yes, yes, this pill should go over the counter. It's a specific birth control pill, called Opill, it's called a mini pill because it's progesterone, it's only one hormone and not two hormones in combination.
