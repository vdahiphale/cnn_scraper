The 10th and final stop for U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will come at the end of a weeklong tour aimed at calming tensions in the region. On Wednesday, Blinken added an unexpected stop in Bahrain, following a meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah in the West Bank. Blinken spoke with Abbas about the ongoing efforts to minimize harm to civilians in Gaza, and boost the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Abbas who called for an immediate end to the hostilities also stressed the importance of accelerating aid. But some aid deliveries are hitting roadblocks. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says Israel has denied several coordinated movement requests, which has critically inhibited the humanitarian response in Gaza, or just says those denials left five hospitals in northern Gaza without access to life saving supplies. The World Health Organization also says delivering aid in Gaza continues to face major challenges. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: The situation is indescribable. Almost 90 percent of the population of Gaza, 1.9 million people have been displaced, and many have been forced to move multiple times. People are standing in line for hours for a small amount of water, which may not be clean, or bread, which alone is not sufficiently nutritious. The barrier to delivering humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza is not the capabilities of the U.N., W.H.O. or are our partners. The barrier is access. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She was more willing to give up her time than take on Trump directly. And the same with DeSantis. I mean, you did hear some sound bites there of them, criticizing him a little bit for not showing up. But they really got to distinguish themselves from Donald Trump here and why that they will be a better candidate than Donald Trump. And instead, they've mostly just went after each other. Now, I think it would be more of less a draw between the two. I mean, they took different hits at one another. DeSantis referred to Nikki Haley as basically engaging in a U.N. way of thinking that she wouldn't be tough on immigration, and that she would essentially basically be like Biden, and too moderate. And Nikki Haley essentially said that he is a liar. She constantly refer to this web site, DeSantislies.com, and he said -- and she said that he would be bad for business. But because both of them failed to really take Trump head on and explain why he is just morally unfit to be president and sidestepped these types of questions, which Chris Christie had been doing.

And they might want to lend their support to Nikki Haley.And New Hampshire is a very different state to Iowa. Iowa is much more conservative in many ways, and, of course, Trump is going to win that without any doubt. But in New Hampshire, things could get shaken up. And it could change the momentum. And I still think this is highly unlikely, but it could change things. It doesn't help that Chris Christie was caught on the hot mic, saying that basically, Nikki Haley has no chance. It would have been better if he could endorse her and get behind her, because that would then ensure that his supporters would definitely vote for her.

But I think the most important thing to notice, this doesn't seem to really matter with voters. Ron DeSantis brought this up as this could be a huge problem. He didn't say essentially, that Trump did anything wrong, but this could be a problem in the election, or in his, you know, term as president, because it will be just such a huge distraction. But we see that Trump seems to be able to galvanize more support every time he has all these different legal battles. And this basically means that he doesn't have to talk about the issues so much. I think he did a little bit of a better job in the town hall in letting people know that he wasn't going to be a dictator, and that he wasn't going to be focused on retribution. But as he seems to be able to deal with these court battles, we have a lot of legal questions, unchartered territory for U.S. politics, and we don't really know what's going to happen. It will he be convicted, will he not? And what will that mean for the race? But he seems to be using the momentum from these court cases to gain more money and more funding than, you know, we would predict.",

But in this case, he has actually launched a case against the Russian Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Court in Russia is hearing that case.He has essentially brought this case to protest some of the regulations affecting all prisoners in Russian jails, specifically the limitations on how many pieces of religious literature they are allowed. So you see him talking to lawyers, judges in the Supreme Court, trying to clarify points in that law, explaining his case. Now, this isn't because he really thinks anything is going to change. Navalny brings these cases to have a platform, so that he can be seen on this video link now from his very remote penal colony in Siberia. And so, he can continue to protest and to expose the ills of the Russian justice system, and in general the abuses under Vladimir Putin. This is why we see these things happening. But of course, the reasons why he's been transferred to Siberia, they haven't been articulated by the Russian Prison Service or by the Kremlin, who generally does not comment on Navalny. But his supporters, his aides believe that this is not coincidental. That all of this has happened, the pressure is stepping up on Navalny, the arrest of his lawyers in October, his transfer to Siberia, none of that is coincidental. All of this is related they say to President Putin's re-election bid. Obviously, it's a foregone conclusion that he will be re-elected to a fifth term in March. But Russia needs to put on a show of unity and that is why you see the pressure stepping up on Alexei Navalny, of course, the main opposition figure in Russia",

The casualties on the Ukrainian side after two years have been quite heavy as well.

Prison officials say at least 139 guards and staff are being held hostage by gangs inside five prisons right now, as drug gangs wage a war against the government. Ecuador's president says the country is fighting more than 20,000 \"terrorists\" after a wave of violence, kidnappings, and prison riots stunned the nation. President Daniel Noboa said on Wednesday, he sympathizes with the families of those kidnapped and vowed not to give in to the terrorist groups.Military and police operations are underway nationwide to root out the gangs behind this week's widespread attacks. The military says it has arrested nearly 330 people belonging to so-called terrorist organizations since Tuesday. Security forces killed five alleged criminals and recaptured dozens of escaped inmates. Ecuador's government is vowing to catch the notorious gang leader whose escape set off this crisis, Jose Adolfo Macias, also known as Fito, was discovered missing on Sunday. Though officials concede he could've escaped before then. Ecuador's president says prison officials who were on duty at the time will be prosecuted. CNN's Patrick Altman has more on Ecuador's most wanted fugitive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PATRICK ALTMAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He should've been Ecuador's most closely guarded prisoner. So, how was it that the notorious gang leader Adolfo Macias alias Fito was able to escape from prison? Ecuador's government can't say how or even when Fito, who is serving a 34-year sentence for drug trafficking, murder and organized crime, escaped from this prison, Guayaquil.

In 2013, Fito escaped from another prison in Guayaquil and was on the run for three months before police recaptured him. For years, many of Ecuador's prisons have been under the control of drug gangs as the South American nation increasingly became a key conduit for cocaine trafficking. More than 400 inmates have been killed in drug gang violence in prison since 2021, as the groups battle for valuable turf and smuggling routes. Los Choneros have been linked to Mexico's brutal and powerful Sinaloa cartel once led by Joaquin El Chapo Guzman. In 2023, presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio ran for office on a platform of confronting the gangs, that he said were corrupting Ecuador's political system. Villavicencio said he was threatened by the gangs for speaking out. FERNANDO VILLAVICENCIO, 2023 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF ECUADOR (through translator): I was told that if I keep mentioning Fito's name and the Choneros, they will destroy me. ALTMAN (voice-over): Villavicencio was gunned down while campaigning in November, alleged hitmen arrested for the candidate's killing were themselves murdered in prison and officials have yet to determine who masterminded the assassination plot. Following Fito's escape and ensuing violence, Ecuadorian officials said gangs would be treated as terrorists. ADMIRAL JAIME VELA ERAZO, ECUADORIAN ARMED FORCES (through translator): From this moment on, every terrorist group identified in the affirmation degree has become a military target. ALTMAN (voice-over): Fito is sure to be at the top of the government's list. Officials say thousands of police and military personnel are searching for the fugitive and another gang leader who also escaped from prison. Ecuadorians are reeling from a wave of gang-related violence on Tuesday, including the brazen attack on a TV station that was carried live.
