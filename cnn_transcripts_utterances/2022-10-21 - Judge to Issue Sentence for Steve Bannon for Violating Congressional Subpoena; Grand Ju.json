      "sentences": "Punishment will be delivered to someone who was flouting a congressional subpoena. That is what happened to Steve Bannon. He was convicted of two charges in the federal court just a couple of months ago for failing to turn over documents and for failing to sit for testimony before Congress, the House Select Committee as they investigated January 6th and the attack on their own body.So they have now come to court. They want the court to enforce this and provide some sort of sentence here. Going into this morning's proceedings, we know that the minimum sentence that Bannon will receive would be 30 days in jail, at the very least. It could go up much higher than that. The Justice Department would like it to be quite harsh, a six-month sentence in jail. They also want Bannon to be fined the maximum amount, $200,000, because wherever the court was doing their proceedings to try and figure out how much he could pay financially, he said, charge me the most. I was convicted, charge me the most. I'm not giving you my private, financial information. So that's what the Justice Department wants. They also want punishment for Bannon's behavior. The trial was very simple. It was about, did he show up or did he not, wherever he was subpoenaed. Today is about how he has acted throughout this process of the congressional proceedings, of the court proceedings, and the Justice Department writes \"Throughout the pendency of the case, the Defendant has exploited his notoriety to display to the public the source of his bad faith refusal to comply with the Committee's subpoena, a total disregard for government processes and the law.\" We're going to have to see if the judge agrees with that argument today from the Justice Department. Bannon is obviously saying that he should be receiving a very lenient sentence. He was following the advice of his lawyer. And he's also asking the judge to put on hold any sentence so that he can appeal. So he hasn't arrived yet, but we are waiting. Brianna? BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR:  Yes, it's going to be very interesting to see what the message is that the judge is going to send, because, obviously, he's not the only one who has not complied with a congressional subpoena. You're awaiting his arrival. Do we have any idea when he's expected there, Katelyn?",

So the judge is going to weigh the flagrancy of his violation with the lack of remorse. He's proud of what he's done. He's touting this as his American duty to resist this politicized commission. And so the judge is going to weigh that against the fact that they're just misdemeanors and he's facing very little time.So the commentator was right. It's a minimum of 30-day sentence. Technically, he could get two years. I think the DOJ played it safe by asking for six months so that they weren't asking for too much. And it looked like a win for Bannon. But I think this judge is probably going to go right down the middle.",

The law favors after someone is sentenced going to jail right away, but as a traditional matter, judges will let someone surrender some 30 days, 60 days, 90 days afterwards. Bannon's reason for doing it is not something that the law embraces. He has to show that there's a compelling appellate issue that he might get his conviction reversed. The chances of that happening here are slim to none. The evidence was compelling. The violation was flagrant. The jury convicted him in less than three hours. So I think that argument is going to go nowhere. But I do expect the judge, who's a Trump appointee, to give him some time to surrender.",

And so far, the State Department, the Secretary of State Tony Blinken has said that they have seen no indication that Russia is in a position to engage in serious diplomacy.So what we have seen is that the Biden administration is really doing everything it can to support Ukraine during this time so that if Ukraine goes to the negotiating table, they are in a position where they would have their strongest hand on the table. But we should also think about the fact that if they want to set up a channel like this, would President Putin allow it?

I worry about this as well because of what's just happened in the U.K. The U.K. has been such a staunch ally of NATO. It still belongs to NATO. Brexit relates to the E.U. in providing aid to Ukraine.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution citing a log of hundreds of text messages sent and received by Loeffler ahead of the Capitol riot describes ties to the Trump family in a scathing rebuke of Loeffler from Tricia Raffensperger, the wife of the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger.CNN has been unable to independently verify these text messages, but according to the paper, Tricia Raffensperger wrote, quote, never did I think you were the kind of person to unleash such hate and fury on someone in political office of the same party. I hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to any of my family, for my husband, children, and grandchildren. You do not deserve to be in elected office.
