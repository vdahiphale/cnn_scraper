We've never had such an intense level of communication, of coordination. Since the beginning of this crisis, President Biden has been there. He's, first of all, you know, painted a clear picture from a moral point of view that Hamas, he said, is sheer evil and must be destroyed.And he's asserted and reasserted again and again Israel's right to defend itself. He said it's not only our right, it's our obligation to act against Hamas to protect our people. And of course, he's given us important diplomatic support at the United Nations. And more than that, he's given us the tools to finish the job. He's made sure that we have the ammunition that we require to win this war.",

That organization, the Hamas terrorists, are our enemy.

But it's very, very difficult because Hamas, as you know, has orchestrated this policy of using Gazan civilians as human shields. They've put their military machine under urban neighborhoods, under hospitals, under schools, under mosques, even under U.N. facilities.So, we are trying to be as surgical as we can be in a very difficult combat environment. But once again, I stress, we don't want to see civilian casualties. And I can tell you, my information is that civilian casualties are going down, and that's a good thing. Of course, the numbers you get from Hamas, which are most likely exaggerated, but those numbers do not make a distinction between combatants and noncombatants. If you tell me we killed 200 people yesterday in Gaza and they're all terrorists, I'll tell you, good. We want to get those terrorists. We want to find those people responsible for the October 7th massacre. But civilians, every time a civilian is caught up in crossfire, from Israel's point of view, it's a tragedy. It shouldn't have happened.",

They have the senior Hamas leadership sits there in their capital, Doha. And for many people that don't understand this, if you claim to be a member of the civilized world, how can you host these terrorists, these Hamas murderers, these killers, these beheaders? And the government of Qatar answers, well, we can bring benefits to the world by having this relationship with Hamas. So, we say, OK. Let's see what benefits you can bring. Can you bring about another formula that brings our hostages home? We want every last one of our hostages out. [10:35:00] You know, we're speaking to the families of the hostages, and they are going through living hell because they know who Hamas is. They saw what Hamas did on October 7th. The way they brutalized our people. The way they killed randomly. The way they burned people alive. And the hostages that got out in November have been reporting back and some of them have spoken on CNN and they've spoken about psychological and physical abuse. So, of course, the families of the hostages are rightfully worried about their loved ones. And the Israeli government will do everything we can to get those people out as soon as possible.",
