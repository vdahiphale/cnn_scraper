I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.New today, Elon Musk has reinstated the Twitter accounts of several prominent journalists he had banned without warning despite repeated claims of supporting free speech. Late last night Musk tweeted, \"The people have spoken,\" after posting an unscientific poll where he had asked users to vote on whether the Twitter suspension should be lifted immediately or extended for another week. Those journalists include CNN's very own Donie O'Sullivan. They have covered Musk extensively in recent weeks. And in the course of doing their jobs, which is to report the facts, they were falsely accused of sharing Musk's exact real time location. The Twitter boss accused them of, quote, \"giving out assassination coordinates,\" which of course is flatly false and is just not true. What had happened in reality is that they were reporting on Twitter's decision to ban an account that tracked Elon Musk's private jet. An account that Musk had initially promised not to take down. Here's the moment when journalists challenged Elon Musk on that very point. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so my suspicion and some reporting has supported this out is that he's basically trying to increase engagement on the site with a lot of the recent stuff including the Twitter Files stuff that he's been disclosing and get more activity on the site, trying to get Trump back.But at the same time advertisers are basically recoiling from how a lot more toxic content feels like it's sort of floating up, including from Elon's own account, you know, sort of going after his own employees. So I think he really has a remedy problem that he's trying to deal with.

Migrants braving freezing conditions to line up and turn themselves into border control officers. It's partly because of a pandemic era policy that allows officials to turn migrants way. That is set to end in just four days from now. CNN's Ed Lavandera is following this for us from El Paso, Texas. Ed, this uptick is border crossings is putting a strain on El Paso.

Many out here is dropping off donations, there are a couple gentlemen who brought boxes of children's clothing, shoes, all those kinds of items. A big truck in the distance has a truck full of blankets. Out here you can see a food truck that has brought lunch for people.And the line goes about probably 70 people deep or so. And this is because even though the long line of migrants arriving that we've been seeing on the Juarez side of the border here in El Paso and Juarez has dissipated. There are still people coming through and arriving. And the backlog here, Jim, is that it is taking several days for many of these people to get transportation away from the border region. These are people, if you talk to many of them as we have for the last week, they are going to places all over the country, from Nevada, to Connecticut, to Georgia, all over the country. But it is taking time for many of these people to find bus transportation or flights to get out of this region. And that is why city and county officials are so concerned about the lifting of Title 42 on Wednesday because if indeed that happens and the expected happens, there will be an even greater influx of migrants arriving here in the city. The shelters here on this side are already over capacity. And that is forcing a lot of people to essentially camp out on the streets here. And it has been painfully frigid cold for much of the week. And that is expected to continue into the week leading into the Christmas holidays as well. So many people here are making makeshift camps here on the side. And this is really happening around the bus stations. And the reason this is also happening is because, especially families arriving together, a lot of times they are released from Border Patrol custody at different times. So these bus stations have become kind of the central gathering point for a lot of these families to reunite so that they're not just scattered all over the city. And that is where you're seeing also a lot of volunteers who are coming to buy to bring food, blankets, whatever they can to help these people get through the difficult days here of being on the streets. City officials here are saying that in the coming days, this transportation issue, getting people out of here, will be the most difficult aspect of handling this potential humanitarian crisis. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARIO D'ANGOSTINO, EL PASO DEPUTY CITY MANAGER: There is not enough funding to buy our way out of this. There's not enough shelter space here in El Paso. There's not enough transportation out of El Paso and it's not just -- speaking of El Paso, that's where I'm at. It's any of these border communities that are going to see this influx in the next few days. We need to look at how can we de-compress to other areas. If you're going to allow them to pass through, take them to where there is larger transportation hubs where people can connect and get to their destination a lot quicker, and so leaving all this strain along the border region.

This is really an enormous amount of information, 13,000 documents, some of them multiple pages here.But it is also getting to the tail end of all of the records that the federal government has on the Kennedy assassination. Roughly five million in all. Put them all together, did the math on them here, if you read one a minute, it would take nine years to get through all of this. Bottom line is this is a lot of minutiae. There aren't any real giant revelations from what we have seen so far. It's going to take a long time to read through all of it. But there are some details that are interesting. For example, a psychological breakdown about Oswald's motivation, saying it was largely explained in terms of his neurotic background, his failure to achieve status, and his deep resentment of authority. There are other parts where it talks about how he never expressed any real sympathy toward the Soviet Union or Communism. And the Soviets neither encouraged nor discouraged his desire to become a Soviet citizen. So little details like that, for people really into the Kennedy assassination, the history of it and everything involved, they will find this interesting. It will keep them busy for quite some while digging through it all. But scholars have basically said there's no real indication there's going to be some giant revelation here. Even CIA officials came out and said essentially the same thing. Look, everything that people really need to know about the Kennedy assassination is known, has been known for quite some time. This is just a lot of debris, leftover information. Now the National Archive says 97 percent of all the information, all the records they have on this, are publicly available. There are a few little more pieces that may come out in the future here. But it's pretty much all out there now. Which, again, will be grist for historians and conspiracy theorists, too -- Jim?",

A 2-year-old boy is lucky to be alive today after one of the most dangerous animals on the planet nearly swallowed him whole. We're talking about a hippopotamus. According to police in Uganda, the boy was playing near is home near a lake when the hippo grabbed him and swallowed half of his body. But thanks to a quick-thing neighbor with a stone and an amazing arm, a direct hit forced the hippo to spit the boy out and return to the water. According to \"National Geographic,\" hippo can weigh up to four tons and can snap a canoe in half with their jaws. Thankfully, the boy was treated with just minor injuries, given a rabies vaccine, and has fully recovered. Good news there. An encouraging health update now for Oscar-winning actress, Jane Fonda. Fonda say her cancer is in remission just three months after she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Fonda described her first four chemo treatments as easy and said the most recent one was rough. With her cancer in remission, she will get to stop the treatments. Fonda, who turns 85 next week, calls it the best birthday present ever. Of course, we all wish her well.
