      "sentences": "Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, depending on where you're joining us. I am Erica Hill in New York.Happening now in Georgia, a key hearing is underway in the election interference case against Donald Trump and a number of other defendants. Trump's attorneys arguing the case violates the former President's right to free speech and should be thrown out. In just moments, President Biden is scheduled to depart the White House, making his way to New York City for a star-studded fundraiser, which his campaign says has already brought in some $25 million. Plus, disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried in court at this hour for sentencing. The FTX founder is facing potentially decades in prison for fraud and conspiracy that prosecutors say accounted to billions. We begin this hour with a court hearing in Georgia that could be critical to the race for the White House. Right now, attorneys for Donald Trump are seeking to dismiss the election subversion case against him in the state of Georgia. Among the charges, the former President is accused of engaging in an illegal conspiracy to overturn his 2020 election loss. Trump's attorneys have been arguing this morning the First Amendment protects, what they call, his political speech, and therefore the indictment should be thrown out. Prosecutors, however, stressed that speech is not protected if that speech involves the commission of a crime, and they want the judge to set a trial date before the November election. Zachary Cohen has been following all of this closely for a long time, and is an expert on all things here, and joins us now. So, as we're watching what's happening here in court, they've been there I guess for about an hour or 90 minutes, maybe. What are we hearing from the attorneys and from the judge?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. They're really wrestling with this question of, is false speech a crime? And prosecutors are making the case that under Georgia law it is, if it's used to try to incite a criminal act. And of course, in this case, prosecutors allege that criminal act would be an attempt by Donald Trump to overturn the 2020 election results. And look, prosecutors notably pointed to the fact that the judge in Trump's federal case, the one overseen by Jack Smith, the Special Counsel, has already evaluated this question of First Amendment protections and whether Trump's false statements about voter fraud and allegation the election was stolen fall under the umbrella of political speech, and denied that they did. She has already denied that motion from Trump in the federal case.And so, prosecutors leaning on that today and also leaning on the fact that they say, you have to -- at this stage in the process, you have to assume that everything alleged in the indictment is true, and that it's up to the jury in a trial phase to determine whether or not the speech is in fact false. Steve Sadow, the lead attorney for Donald Trump in the Georgia case, has tried to push back and then tried to argue. At one point, he said, look, if you take out the speech, there is no underlying basis to charge Donald Trump. So, trying to make that distinction between the issue of false speech, potentially false speech and the criminal acts outlined in the indictment.",

And really the issue at this point is that these arguments are premature, that based on where we are in the process at the indictments stage. To throw out an indictment, you have to assume that everything in that indictment is true. That's the legal standard. So, what we're really seeing from these arguments, we're getting a forecast of what types of arguments we're going to see when it comes down to the trial. So, we know that this First Amendment issue is something that the defense is going to argue before the jury. So, that's really what we can glean from these arguments. They're being made right now for the defense for the purpose of trying to get the indictment thrown out. It is unlikely that it will be successful, if not almost an impossible hurdle.And so, what we're seeing is arguments that will be made before the jury who are the finders of facts.

So, that is who is up and speaking at this moment.As we look at moving forward here, we know from CNN's own reporting that Fani Willis does really want to get this trial back on track. She wants to continue moving forward, and initially asked the judge, David, for a trial date of August 5. We don't have an answer on that. But, reporting from my colleague, Zachary Cohen, and his colleagues is that she may, in fact, push and ask again for a summer trial date. Once the judge has ruled on this motion, how quickly, David, is your sense that we could see a trial date set?",

Look, these are preliminary matters. They're separate and apart from the preparation that counsel takes to get ready for trial. So, while they're putting their heart and soul into arguing these motions, they also have to be getting ready for trial. It's up to the judge to decide if you've had enough time. He can't simply listen to you say and I haven't had enough time. He is going to look at the volume of documents. How much is there? What do you need to do? How do you need to get ready? How do you need to prepare? Look at his schedule. Look at the other trials that are going on.And so, he could look at all of this and say, well, you know, August is perhaps a little bit early, beginning of August. But, I think by the end of August, we're in March, almost April here, that's enough time for you all to get ready. So, I'm going to set the trial date, and you keep moving forward to get ready. If you think you're not ready, come back to me again and tell me why you're not ready, and I'll think about maybe perhaps setting a later trial date.",

I think, and David is spot on on this, because the judge has a lot of discretion to make that determination about when the trial is going to go forward, and merely saying I need more time isn't enough. It has to be backed up by some form of an argument or it has some substance to it. So, end of August, I think, just based on everything we know to date, would be a very reasonable timeframe. But, jury selection in this case is going to be a beast. And in Fulton County, I have covered other cases with you, Erica, and with others on CNN, where jury selection was taken months.So, in this case, with the most -- one of the most high-profile cases ever, right, and certainly one of the most high-profile in the country, jury selection could certainly go for months.

So, if you watch this here, you'll see the ship visible. You see it moving on the right side of your screen. It's about halfway under the span, though, when this video stops. The images also showed traffic was able to be stopped before impact. That, of course, thanks to the ship crew, which notified officials with a mayday call.

And so, now the process begins to try to get all of it out of the water. They are bringing in a lot of very large equipment, barges and cranes, the plan being to cut up those pieces of the bridge and remove them from the water. And officials have said, when that is done, those divers are going back in to find the remaining construction workers and bring closure to the family.But, look, one major roadblock here is going to be some hazardous material that has been found around the ship, 56 containers, more than 700 tons of hazardous material, flammables, corrosives, lithium ion batteries. We heard the head of the NTSB yesterday say, it's not a safe area right now for federal officials, first responders to go into. This is right along the bow of the ship, right where the bridge came down. And so, it's going to take time to clear that to make sure it's safe, and that's going to be part of this salvage operation. Meanwhile, investigators are having a very busy day today. They are interviewing the two pilots who were on the ship, as they have gone through the black box of the ship, constructing a much clearer timeline, Erica, of the minutes that led up to this catastrophe. When the ship experienced that major power outage, that total blackout, as it was previously described, when the pilot lost the ability to steer the ship, we have learned from that timeline that the pilot called for tugboat assistance that they radioed in that mayday call, that they dropped the anchor and they were trying to slow down the ship. And with that mayday call, they were able -- police on shore were able to stop traffic onto the bridge. But, it was seconds and not minutes, Erica, until the collapse. They knew about the crew. But within just 30 seconds or so, the bridge came down before they could reach those construction workers. As you said, that investigation could take possibly two years. And we still don't know what caused that power outage. There has been talk of potentially contaminated fuel in the shed, maybe some sort of electrical issue. And the NTSB, when questioned about that, has really pushed back and said, look, that's why we're doing this investigation. We want to know what happened, and that's what investigators are working on now.",

But that additional timeline, the information about the call for the tugboat, for example, so helpful for so many people to start to get a better understanding even that -- if that final investigation may not be released for some time. When we look at the bridge itself, this is critical to the area, some 30,000, 35,000 people a day would cross that bridge. We know there are also a number of jobs that have been impacted by the port being shut down. What are you hearing from folks in Baltimore today?G. COHEN: Well, look, there is obviously a lot of grief about the lives lost. But, when you look at the loss of such a critical artery here in Baltimore and really for this region, the economic implications, as you brought up, are massive. Thousands of port workers are concerned about having a job because the port is basically shut down, ships stuck on either end and basically being rerouted to other ports across the East Coast. The economic implications for people across the country are significant there. But, we're talking about potentially millions of dollars within the Greater Baltimore area that are going to be lost between wages and business operations. And so, Erica, there is a lot of concern there. And we know that the federal government has said they are going to step in and assist any way they can. But, people are definitely on edge here in Baltimore, knowing that the port remains shut down and the timeline to get all of that cleared is really fluid right now.",

So, once FTX filed for bankruptcy in November of 2022 and collapsed, their money was essentially gone.Now, through this bankruptcy recovery effort, the person now overseeing FTX says that they have recovered a lot of money, but the individuals have not gotten it back. And they certainly haven't had the benefit of the more than 400 percent increase in some of these cryptocurrencies that have experienced since the bankruptcy of FTX.

He knew computer codes. He knew how to do sophisticated things. And it began as simply as him being restricted from using any VPNs that can hide where your computer is. And he was doing that in order to watch the Super Bowl. The judge didn't like that. Then he also had made contact with the former general counsel of FTX. The judge viewed that as witness tampering.And in addition, he was in communication with a reporter, providing them with information about one of the government's key witnesses, Bankman-Fried's former girlfriend, the former CEO of the hedge fund, and providing information that could have been viewed as negative against her before she was testifying against him in this case. Now, she has pleaded guilty to numerous crimes as well and will be sentenced later. But, the judge viewed all of that as witness tampering and revoked his bail, put him in detention back in August.

The council will now have the task of appointing a new Prime Minister to replace the outgoing Ariel Henry.

President Biden, former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, will be taking the stage together at New York's iconic Radio City Music Hall tonight for a fundraiser with a number of big names, celebs, including that Queen, Queen Latifah.

They can each speak to their own audiences, especially former President Obama. What does it say, though, that the Democratic, right, the presumptive Democratic nominee for President can have his predecessors there with him? I mean, I don't see the same thing happening where you're going to see George Bush appear at an event with Donald Trump.",

Everything else is just, it's a sideshow. I don't think it matters. That said, the money issues that you just highlighted are very real. Trump is struggling, and the Trump campaign raised $20 million in February. The Biden campaign raised one heck of a lot more, I think, over $53 million. The cash on hand advantage is almost four times more for Biden than Trump. The RNC is broke. They have $11 million, I think cash on hand or financial train wreck.I mean -- so, I think right now it's hard for Donald Trump to be both a criminal defendant and a presidential candidate. So much time and effort is being distracted and moved away from the campaign toward his legal defense. I mean, this is just an incredible amount of money that is not being used for real campaign purposes. And he is down ballot candidates, Republican candidates, are going to struggle because of this financial inequity. This money is really needed to help with the grassroots operations at the state level. It's not there. And so, if I'm a Republican, I'm really worried about this money disadvantage.",

If you're not Faiz, if you're not one of those people who is paying -- the cheapest ticket was $225, the most expensive was half a million, if you don't want to shell out that kind of cash, do those celebrities have enough power that they are going to sway votes?",

This is considered, of course, one of the largest white collar crimes in history. David Weinstein, former State and Federal Prosecutor, and Misty Marris, Defense Attorney, are both back with us now. This was -- the prosecution had been asking for 40 to 50 years. The defense said that would be medieval. He will spend the rest of his life in prison. How about six and a half? The fact, Misty, that the judge settled on 25, does that surprise you? What do you make of this sentence?",

Sentencing guidelines would have allowed them to go up to like 110. And I think there was something in this case that Judge Kaplan, who have appeared before many, many times, it was not really buying. And one of the arguments was that all of the people who had been wronged by this widespread financial scheme would be made whole through the bankruptcy proceeding. He was not buying that argument.And also, remember, Judge Kaplan, during the trial, had found that Sam Bankman-Fried lied and perjured himself on the stand. None of that is going to help in the context of a sentencing hearing. So, not surprised to see that 25 years is the result.",

And keep in mind, he is also appealing his convictions. So, he has to be careful what he says about admitting anything. And so, he gave sort of a (inaudible) apology on behalf of what he had done, and the people he had offended perhaps had shaved off a couple of years on his sentence, finally showing his acceptance and responsibility here. And that's why the judge came down a little bit. Not surprising to me that the sentence fell where it did either. I was kind of thinking it would go in the 30-year range. So, I was a little off.But, again, a dangerous line that he was walking there. I've often seen a client who snatches defeat out of the jaws of victory, but there was no way he was going to sentence him to the low end that they were asking for.",

But, I think the sentence sends the message to the people who were victimized that the system cares about you, then we're going to punish the people who did this. And it sends a message to others who are perhaps thinking about this or are involved in this, that there are going to be some serious repercussions to what their actions are.
