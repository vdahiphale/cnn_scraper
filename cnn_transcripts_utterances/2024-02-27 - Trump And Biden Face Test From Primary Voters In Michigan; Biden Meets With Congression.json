And Democrats voting uncommitted could send a powerful message to President Biden.Also tonight, shutdown showdown. With a deadline approaching, President Biden meets with congressional leaders for talks on funding the government, tightening the border and helping Ukraine. Plus, a key witness testifies in the defense effort to remove the D.A. and lead prosecutor in the case against Donald Trump in Georgia. This testimony when asked when the pair's romantic relationship began and what the judge will make of it. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. First up tonight, the voting in Michigan where polls start closing in just two hours, a big test for both former President Donald Trump and President Biden in this key swing state. For Trump, will it be like in South Carolina where some Nikki Haley Republicans said they would not vote for Trump in November? And for Biden, will tonight's uncommitted vote, as it's called, especially from Michigan's large Arab American community, mean similar general election trouble for him? Let's go to CNN's Dianne Gallagher, who's been visiting polling stations across the state of Michigan all day. And right now she's in Ann Arbor for us. Dianne, what's it been like today and what are you seeing? What are you hearing? DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, Wolf, we have seen light but steady turnout at this particular precinct I'm at in Ann Arbor. We've seen there's two different precincts here at this polling place. We've seen about 375 voters today. But this area had the highest number of early in-person voters as well. It's the first time that Michigan has done that. We had more than a million early in absentee votes in the state. The secretary of state says they're not sure what election day voting turnout is going to look like because of those early voting opportunities. Now, look, there is a lot on the ballot here. They can choose whichever one they want, Republican or Democrat. Actually, I have a voter with me right now, Joanne. And, Joanne, you chose a Democratic ballot. Tell me how did you vote?",

It's been led by members of the Arab-American community, which is very large here in mission. But there's also a coalition that has formed around this with young voters and progressive voters. They've been up here in the Ann Arbor area as well working with students at the University of Michigan trying to get them to vote early uncommitted as a protest vote to send that message to President Biden. They say that they are Democrats, but they cannot support him unless they say he calls for a permanent and immediate ceasefire. Now, look, they say that their goal is about ten thousand votes uncommitted, Wolf. Everyone who votes uncommitted is not doing so for that purpose during this election. People vote uncommitted in Michigan all of the time for various reasons We talked to some today who this was not their reason. But it will be interesting to see how President Biden fares versus this uncommitted vote and whether or not he may have a problem in Michigan in the long-term",

Because a lot of those uncommitted voters who declare uncommitted, they're voting because they oppose this policy towards the Israel-Hamas War. ALENCIA JOHNSON, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER, BIDEN 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Yes, I think the Biden campaign and the White House should be very concerned about this vote because this is the first time it's being put directly in front of voters and then making a statement, right? Folks have been talking about how this decision around continuing to support Netanyahu and the Israeli government has been a top priority, but this is going to be the data point. I do think that the campaign and the White House are paying attention. They have sent campaign officials as well as policy officials to meet with the Arab and Muslim community, but it's beyond just the Arab and Muslim community. A lot of young voters, a lot of progressive voters, a lot of black voters, this is their issue. So, while the president and Democrats are doing really well on abortion, which will be a deciding issue this cycle, this is also going to be a deciding issue for a key part of the Democratic base that Biden can no longer ignore.",

Frankly, most frontline soldiers we see face every single day in terms of tackling a lot of the time, Russia trying to push forward at many points along the frontline, but they desperately urgently need these tens of billions of dollars to the point where, frankly, some people you meet specifically lay out pieces of equipment they urgently need and make appeals directly to the U.S. to try and provide that. We heard more bad news today again for Ukraine, linked, I think it's fair to say, to the shortages of personnel and ammunition they're facing. We know that two Saturdays ago, Wolf, we've talked about this before that Ukraine had to pull out of a key town in Avdiivka. Well, yesterday, they announced that Lastochkyne, a village about three miles to its northwest, they pulled out of that. And today, they announced that two other villages near that as well, they had to pull back from to. Ukraine officials, some have said that this is part of the withdrawal they always planned.

What's this done? Well, it's essentially made Europe think what are we actually willing do here? What are our red lines in terms of how far we're willing go?

But the reality is, is what is the connection? Does he have information with respect to a quid pro quo that would have permitted the hiring of him so she could financially benefit? How specifically does he have knowledge as to a financial benefit? What does he know as it relates to monies that Fani Willis might have gained as a result of the relationship? None of that was there. It was about when they were together, when they were not, what did you tell me, how much gossip is it. And so the reality is no on credibility, but I'm looking to the issue of qualification or disqualification and how this impairs the relationship against the president. It's a distraction, a deflection. Talk to me about the process. Talk to me about the indictment.

Iranians will pick a new parliament and a new assembly of experts, as it's called, which selects the country's supreme leader.The vote is important because it comes during soaring Mideast tensions right now and an economic crisis in the country. This will also be the first ballots cast since Mahsa Jina Amini's death in police custody back in 2022, sparking nationwide protests, calling for major political change. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is joining us live from Tehran right now. Fred, you're there. It's not often we get a live report from Tehran.

And I think, first of all, it is absolutely correct to say that the current tensions between the United States and Iran and the greater Middle Eastern region are having a massive effect on the election campaign here in Iran. And I would say it certainly has emboldened the hardliners and further marginalized the moderate forces here on the ground.One of the things that we have to keep in mind though as far as the parliamentary election is concerned but also the election for the assembly of experts that is so important because it does pick the next supreme leader is that, right now, some of the moderate candidates have indeed been disqualified from running for either of those bodies. One of the more prominent ones is, of course, the former president of this country Hassan Rouhani, who, so far, is not allowed to run again for the assembly of experts and he's still trying to appeal that. But at the same time on the ground, you do see the hardliners, the conservatives really emboldened a great deal especially since you've had that renewed confrontation between Iran and the United States in the Middle Eastern region. I was actually at a rally today of conservative forces and there was one gentleman who had both his sons dressed up in military fatigues and says me and my children, we are fighters for this country, as he put it, Wolf.",

Has that changed the dynamics? PLEITGENAnd one of the things that's really been sticking out to us, we were going around Tehran today, is how many people were willingly coming to us and saying, look, they don't necessarily intend to vote in the upcoming election because they feel sort of disenfranchised right now by the ruling political elite. It's certainly something that I would say the folks who are in power here in this country are trying to work against. In fact, you do see it almost every corner here in Tehran, certainly in other cities as well, posters urging people to come out and vote. Whether or not a lot of people are going to come and do that, that's something that we'll see on Friday. The government is trying, but you do see that there's still some discontent on the ground here as well, Wolf.",

And just about two or three hours depending on the time zone in Michigan, the polls will be closed in the state's primaries.Earlier, you heard a Democratic voter there tell our Dianne Gallagher that she voted uncommitted. She said it was because of President Biden's policy of supporting Israel in the war against Hamas. President Biden expressed optimism Monday that a temporary ceasefire in Gaza may be close at hand, however, an Israeli official today tell CNN, they were quote surprised by the presidents remarks. The comments occurred late Monday after the president taped and appearance with late night comedian Seth Meyers. Listen (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My national security adviser tells me that we're close. We're close. Not done yet. My hope is by next Monday, we'll have a ceasefire. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, of course, coming with that would be the entry of much needed relief aid into the Gaza Strip.We know that there has been some progress in these talks over the last week or so, things are moving in the right direction. We have indications that Hamas has backed off of some of their key sticking points here, reducing the number of Palestinian prisoners they would need to see exchanged for these Israeli hostages. And also backing off of their demand that Israeli forces fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip. But it is also clear, Wolf, that there are still very much obstacles including the movement of Israeli troops during this ceasefire, the number and the types of Palestinian prisoners. So, a lot still remains to be done. A lot of gaps still need to be closed. And it's very clear that the clock is ticking. We have less than two weeks to go until the holiday of Ramadan. And by that point, either we will see a deal fall into place, or perhaps alternatively, a major Israeli military offensive into the city of Rafah, where there are 1.5 million Palestinians currently living -- Wolf.",

It seems that President Biden was talking about a temporary pause in the fight against part of a hostage deal. What do you make of the timing of the president's remarks? And his specific use of the word ceasefire right before the Michigan primary? REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, it shows that the president is listening to the broader Democratic coalition. Many voters, Arab American, Muslim American voters of color, the AME Black Church, young progressives won a permanent ceasefire and release of all the hostages and they want aid resumed into Gaza.

They were interested in sharing the huge grief.And I think that the war has to come to an end with the release of the hostages. Then there has to be a period of healing before we can make progress on the politics. One idea that came up is, can we get our military to airlift food and nutrition and medicine into Gaza?
