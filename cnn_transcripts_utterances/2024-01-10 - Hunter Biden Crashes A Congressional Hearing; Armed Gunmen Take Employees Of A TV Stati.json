He is the Director ofthe Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Larry, it is good to see you. So, as you have noted in your writing, in all likelihood, Trump will be the Republican nominee. And just moments ago, we had new data that supports that from polling. Donald Trump has supported 49 percent of Republicans in 2024. That is based on a Lou Reuters Ipsos poll. Nikki Haley has 12 percent, Ron DeSantis, 11. As you see the day's approach, we've got this debate tonight, we've got Iowa just a few days away, is there anything that you think could turn that tide? LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA'S CENTER FOR POLITICS: Well, it's very difficult, certainly in Iowa. The profile of the Iowa Republican caucus participants is tilted toward Trump heavily. Evangelical Christian turnout is very high, they're very pro-Trump. Really the battle there is to see whether either DeSantis or Haley can emerge as the clear challenger to Trump. Because as your correspondent just noted, this race is consolidated much more quickly than the one when Trump was first nominated. You had 17 candidates, counting Trump. It took a long time to filter that down to a handful and it was too late to stop Trump. Now, it may be too late simply because Trump is between 50 and 60 percent, depending on which polls you look at, of Republicans nationally. That doesn't mean he can't lose either Iowa or New Hampshire, though New Hampshire is much more troublesome for him than Iowa. But that's because independents participate in New Hampshire. In most of the other Republican primaries and caucuses throughout the country, independents are banned unless they switch their registration to Republican.",

Now, the road to oblivion may take a while for one or it may not take a while for the other. So, we'll have to see how the numbers actually shape up. But this is a very specialized audience where Republicans, generally, will want to watch and see how they interact and who impresses them the most. But it's really voters in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary that we'll be watching most carefully because they're here and now. They're the ones who vote in January.

Both Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, aswell as the British Defense Minister, have clearly stated that if these continue, the U.S., the U.K. and others are ready perhaps, even willing to act. I'll just point out that the interception of 21 drones and missiles was actually on Tuesday evening in the Middle East time. That's when U.S. Central Command says three U.S. destroyers, F-18s from a U.S. carrier and a British destroyer, intercepted a total of 21 missiles and drones. That includes 18 drones, two anti-ship cruise missiles and one anti-ship ballistic missiles in one of the largest, if not the largest barrages we've seen over the course of the past several months since the Houthis, an Iran- backed proxy in Yemen, began attacking international shipping lanes in the Red Sea. Initially, according to the vice admiral in charge of U.S. Naval Forces Central, these attacks tried to target ships that had some tertiary or distant connection to Israel, either coming from an Israeli port or partially owned by Israel. But the last dozen or so attacks have just been at international shipping lanes in the southern Red Sea. You see that map there. It's one of the world's most critical waterways, and that is where the U.S. and about a dozen countries have stepped in as part of Operation Prosperity Guardian to try to safeguard shipping there, but clearly the U.S. has had enough. The question, what, when and how will the U.S. respond and will the U.S. go as far as to strike the Houthis in Yemen instead of a more defensive position intercepting a Houthi launch is that -- is the major question. Now, given the statements we're seeing, both public and from Central Command, from that multi-national coalition defending shipping there, it seems the U.S., the U.K. and others have truly gotten to the point where they would consider strikes inside Yemen itself against the Houthis.",

I think it covers just about any possible reason, from the genetics of more aggressive tumors being diagnosed inblack men to the difficulty obtaining screenings, less likely to be referred for certain therapeutic options. I mean, there's been all sorts of research into why these disparities exist. But you're quite right. In fact, if you look at the numbers, I don't know if we have the numbers -- if we can put those up. But just for men across the board, for example, in the United States, one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, one in 41 will die. It's a common cancer. People may not realize just behind certain types of skin cancers in terms of its prevalence. But to your point, if you go to black men overall and say, what is the difference now with black men specifically? And you find, just like you're saying, about almost two times more likely to be diagnosed and more than two times likely to die. And it's, again, there's all sorts of different reasons. I think what it means fundamentally is that for people, black men are at higher risk. If you have a family history in particular, you need to be especially vigilant about getting screened, perhaps. Screening's not recommended for everyone, but obviously Secretary Austin was getting screened. Doesn't sound -- which is good news -- he wasn't having symptoms, but it was on one of those screenings that they diagnosed an early form of prostate cancer in the first place, and that's what took place in early December.",

That's the natural course of things. But then it sounded like he had a miserable time at home. Just had discomfort in his abdomen and his hips and his legs. Subsequently, went back to the hospital, was diagnosed with the urinary tract infection, but they knew it was more serious. Ultimately, it was found that he had these abdominal fluid collections and that was causing all sorts of problems for him. That was all addressed on the second hospitalization. And, you know, within a few days, he was able to go back to normal duties. He's still in the hospital, but able to do his duties. What is interesting, Bianna, to your point, if someone has an operation, what does that mean? As a surgeon myself, that basically means, hey, look, we're confident, we can take this out. If it had already spread outside the prostate, at that point, surgeons are far less likely to advocate for surgery because it's not likely to get all of the cancer. So, caught early and operation removes the prostate tumor, which is likely localized within the prostate and that bodes well for him long term.",

So, they don't even advocate for screening after age 70. But in his case, obviously, he got that screen right around that age. He found this. It was taken out. So, the chances of this being a problem again in his lifetime are very, very low.

You could embark on something known as watchful waiting, where you're just sort of keeping an eye on this. Another thing that sometimes is recommended, depending on how aggressive the tumor seems, is radiation or some sort of what is called adjuvant therapy.
