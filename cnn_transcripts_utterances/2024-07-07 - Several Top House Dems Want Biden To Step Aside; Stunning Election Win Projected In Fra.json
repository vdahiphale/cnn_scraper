I'm Pamela Brown in Washington, and we are following some breaking news coming into CNN.Sources are saying more than a handful of top House Democrats are now calling on the president to suspend his reelection campaign. This came during a call today with House Leader Hakeem Jeffries and as President Biden hit the campaign trail in Pennsylvania, telling supporters today he's, quote, \"never been more optimistic about the future of America.\" And when someone asked him, do you still have the support of the Democratic Party, the president empathically said, yes. But our reporting is suggesting otherwise at this hour. Let's go straight to CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz, who's traveling with the president today -- Arlette.",

      "sentences": "Well, Pamela, the pressure is growing on President Biden from within his own Democratic Party to step aside in this race. Now, this afternoon, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries held a Zoom meeting with the ranking members of the committees to kind of get -- feel their temperature, take the temperature about their feelings about the 2024 election before Congress is set to return tomorrow.And sources tell CNN that in that private phone conversation, that the number of lawmakers who want to see the president step aside outweighed those who spoke up in support of him staying in this race. CNN has learned about six of those Democratic lawmakers said that they believe it is time for the president to leave the 2024 race, that it included lawmakers like Congressman Takano, Congressman Nadler, also Congresswoman Wild of Pennsylvania, a key battleground state. Sources have also told CNN that lawmakers like Congresswoman Maxine Waters as well as Congressman Bobby Scott spoke up in support of the president staying in this race. Now, one of the concerns that was expressed in this phone call is the potential that keeping Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket could weigh down other Democrats running in competitive races in the House and Senate. There is a concern about Democrats being unable to win back the House majority if Biden remains at the top of the Democratic ticket. Now these private calls from these lawmakers join the already other five Democratic lawmakers who since the debate have called for President Biden to step aside publicly. Now President Biden himself believes that the Democratic Party is still behind him. That is something that he's told reporters today as he was traveling in Pennsylvania trying to make his case directly to voters. The president spent some time visiting a black church and then also speaking at a campaign headquarter where he showed no signs of backing down from this race. Take a listen to what he told supporters there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I was outside of that church service where the president spoke this morning and I spoke to a handful of the parishioners who were in attendance for the church service, and they all told me that they still wanted to see President Biden move forward in this race. One of those voters told me that they believed it was too late for the president to drop out at this point.Others saying that they believe that he is allowed to have a bad night and that they wanted to see him continue forward. When I was in Wisconsin, I heard really a mix reaction from voters. Some people, fervent supporters who wanted to have him stay in the race. Others who did have some concern after the debate and what it would mean for voters and how that would sit with them heading into November's election. So President Biden is hoping that he can try to convert some of those skeptical voters as he's hitting the campaign trail. He will be in Michigan on Friday. That'll be the next battleground state that he will be visiting, I'm told. But of course he is also facing those very loud calls from within his own party, from Democratic officials, from donors who are very concerned about what this race will look like if Biden stays at the top of the ticket.",

Bush, Scott Jennings, and Democratic strategist and co-founder of Lift Our Voices, Julie Roginsky. I guess the first question to you, Julie, is help us make sense of this, right? We are now at this stage where you have a president who is digging in his heels saying, I'm not going anywhere, I am staying atop the ticket, and then you have more and more defections in his party. Now the latest count is 11 House Democrats saying he should step aside. And what I'm told from sources is actually there will be more coming out this week as members of Congress come to the hill. What weight does this carry? If these are House members calling him to step aside, but not necessarily, some of them are ranking members. But not necessarily leadership. Like Hakeem Jeffries or Nancy Pelosi.",

He certainly knew that you couldn't have as many as whoever many out on the call today without this getting out immediately. It's also not a coincidence I think that a lot of these ranking members spoke up to effectively I think give Hakeem Jeffries the leeway to maybe go with Chuck Schumer to the president and say, look, we've heard now from ranking members like Jerry Nadler, who are certainly in no danger of losing his seat this November, but also from frontline members like Susan Wild in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, which is the swingiest county in the swingiest state in the nation, who are worried about you and worried about the down-ballot effect this may have.And that's before we get back from July 4th recess and Congress reconvenes where Scott well knows these guys kind of feed off of each other and they're not all necessarily profiles in courage, but they all do speak to each other and they may all team up together to deliver that message to leadership and have leadership send that message to the White House. And so this is not trending in a good direction for the president. I'll also say that every day that goes by where we're talking about this and we're not talking about Donald Trump, and the threat he poses to the nation, both with his personal record of 34 felonies and with his plans for a second term where he promised to effectively be the vengeance for all of his MAGA offended party is not a good day for Democrats. And so with every day that goes by, and we're focusing on this and not focusing on the former president is not a good day for us. And so I strongly think that it's time for President Biden to take a look at what this may look like. If this continues on into next week and the next month, we don't have time, we need to refocus this campaign on Donald Trump and the threat he poses to our democracy and to our nation.",

I mean, Chuck Schumer staying silent. Hakeem Jeffries is staying silent.

Most of them not in any danger of losing their seats.The House is on the precipice of flipping. The Senate needs to remain in Democratic hands. That's going to be a tall order regardless of what happens with the presidential and both these -- both Senator Schumer and Leader Jeffries need to think about the fact that there are -- there's a separate branch of government, the legislative branch, that needs to be the bulwark to any potential Trump presidency. And so they also need to consider the fact that having an enfeebled frontrunner or president, excuse me, on the ticket is not necessarily good for them and their prospects. And so the fear here for people like Susan Wild who you just mentioned earlier is not necessarily just that Donald Trump wins. It's also that the legislative branch will go Republican, which will make ensures that there's absolutely nothing standing between Project 2025 and all the crazy things that Trump wants to enable and nod. And the Supreme Courts certainly not going to do it as we all saw recently. So the only thing that stands between Trump and complete just freedom to do whatever he wants without any guardrails is the legislative branch and they need to make sure that the legislative branch stays in Democratic hands. Hopefully with the Democratic president. But worst-case scenario, at least in Democratic hands in the legislative side.",

I don't know that he is and it may also be that he's their worst option. It's not clear to me that Kamala Harris is any better and I don't think they can give it to anybody else. But Harris, I mean, she is the most unpopular vice president ever, even more unpopular than, you know, my old boss Dick Cheney and he shot a guy in the face. I mean, she is very unpopular. OK? Just handing this off to somebody who's untested, the last time they ran for president, she was terrible at it. I mean, that's a big roll of the dice to do that. The one thing Biden has going for him is that he has run and he did win. And he currently is the president. I recognize he had a bad performance so I'm truthfully not sure what the correct strategic answer is for the Democrats.

Really unusual unity for that part of the French political spectrum but also then the tactical voting between the two rounds. So far from coming first, the far-right National Rally comes a distant third after that left-wing alliance first and Emmanuel Macron's centrist second.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Thick clouds of sand shroud the road to Rafah. But as the dust settles, the destruction is unmistakable. Flattened homes and bombed-out buildings, Gaza's last refuge devastated by the Israeli military assault on this city. We are now entering the third month of Israeli military operations in Rafah, and you can see all around me the kind of destruction that these last two-plus months of military operations have wrought inside of the city of Rafah. All around destruction, very similar to the kind that I've seen in central Gaza as well as in the northern part of the strip. (Voice-over): This is the first time CNN has gotten access to this devastated city. Israel and Egypt have barred journalists from Gaza, except under tightly controlled military embeds like this.",

Once a lifeline for millions of Palestinians, it now lies in ruins. The Israeli military says it is now facilitating a safe corridor for these trucks to deliver aid to Gaza via Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, but humanitarian aid groups say the roads are still not safe. And simply not enough aid is getting in as the war rages on. (END VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (on-camera): And during the nearly three hours that we spent on the ground in Rafah, we didn't see a single Palestinian. This city that was once a safe haven for displaced Palestinians from across the Gaza Strip has been almost completely emptied out. More than a million Palestinians have been forced to flee that city, many of them heading for that coastal Al-Mawasi area where they are simply trying to survive. And now their hopes are simply resting on these ceasefire negotiations and the prospect of a deal. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem.",
