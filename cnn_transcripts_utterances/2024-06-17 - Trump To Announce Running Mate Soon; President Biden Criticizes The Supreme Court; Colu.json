There are a lot of smart good people that Trump is looking at, but it also applies to our senators, it applies to our congressmen and women too.

Yes, he did win the straw poll at that conference over the weekend. He was also the only one of the potential VP candidates to actually speak in person at the event, so perhaps seeing him in the flesh was actually one of the reasons he was supported.But look, he has become one of the biggest defenders of the president. There is no doubt that he is on the shortlist. We know this because he's been spending significant time with former President Donald Trump. He'll be doing so again on Thursday evening in Cleveland when Trump goes there for a fundraiser. Jake, so much of this, via Veep-stakes if you will, has been sort of playing out right in front of our eyes. These auditions have been happening in real time. The former president will pick one or a couple of them to fly with him, to travel with him, to appear at rallies with him, and he wants the buzz and the conversation to be about all of them as he makes up his own mind. Talking to Trump advisers they say look he is going to make up his own decision, he is not going to get much input from the outside, but it's who he feels comfortable with. But there is no doubt J.D. Vance at 39 years old, the youngest person on the list, has proven himself as a strong fighter and defender of Trump on television, and we know that that is what the former president likes more than anything perhaps, his skills on television. He's ambitious though. The question is he too ambitious? That will be one of the questions weighed here.",

He is absolutely a strong defender of Donald Trump and he would also bring several things to the ticket. One challenge of course, he is a resident of Florida, Trump also a resident of Florida.

And so that's kind of a big issue of parents are using them in the same way that kids are or a slightly different way. It's a problem to do that. But I think probably you don't tell them not to use them and take them away. There's a lot of -- there's a big movement of removing them from schools during the school day, and it showed some really good effects on schools. If you take the phone away, lock it away for the school day, and then give it back to kids.

It's very difficult to do. So the question is, should it just be legislated that there's an age gating thing? Or should they do it at the app level and all kinds of things, but I think everyone's involved in this problem. Everyone is addicted to it.And so -- but when you do use things like addiction, you think about warnings and you think about things like that.
