And that matters whether you're traveling via air or even on roadways, because we've got a couple of different systems here, several different fronts that are going to bring quite a bit of different weather. We've got heavy rain at times. You've got some snow, thunderstorms, and even some strong gusty winds.Right now, we've got to focus up to the north, some pretty heavy rain coming down across Chicago, rain for Detroit, Columbus, even Cincinnati. You've also got some snow along the portions of the Upper Midwest, down to the south. The concern her is still the potential for strong to severe thunderstorms. You've got several of those sliding through the New Orleans area, heading towards Mobile and more rain pushing in towards Atlanta and Charlotte. Here's the potential for the strong to severe thunderstorms today, again, basically stretching from southeastern Mississippi, all the way over towards Virginia Beach, isolated tornadoes and damaging winds will be the main concern. Now, as we go through the rest of the day today, these systems are going to continue to push off to the east, taking a lot of the rain and snow with it. So, later on today, you've got the concern of Charlotte, Raleigh, up to Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, and then eventually once we get towards the evening hours tonight, that's when the bulk of this really spread into the Northeast. So, New York, Boston, Hartford, Connecticut, starting to finally look at some of that rain and snow sliding across portions of the Northeast. By Wednesday morning, still looking at there, and again, by Wednesday morning, you're looking at some pretty decent snowfall coming down across interior New England, as we push through those hours of the morning. Then by late afternoon, we finally start to see an exit of the lot of the rain, and strong winds, and even the snow, so that by the time we actually get to Thanksgiving, albeit still a little bit breezy in some spots in the Northeast, most everybody else finally starts to see things dry back out. Out to the West, however, we have the next system coming in that will make for a bit of a white Thanksgiving for some.",
