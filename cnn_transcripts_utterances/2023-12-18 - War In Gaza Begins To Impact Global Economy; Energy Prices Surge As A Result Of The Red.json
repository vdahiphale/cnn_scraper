We'll have the latest on the heaviest rain Australia in decades. Hello everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. Well, just a short time ago, the U.S. Defense Secretary made one thing very clear. The U.S. remains Israel's strongest ally. Lloyd Austin met earlier with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's Defense Minister. As pressure mounts over civilian casualties in Gaza, U.S. officials want Israel to move away from the intense bombing campaign in Gaza to a lower- intensity strategy that targets Hamas' leadership directly instead. But if there were any messages of caution in private, Austin's words in public were ones of absolute support for Israel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: This is Israel's operation, and I'm not here to dictate timelines or terms. Our support to Israel's right to defend itself is ironclad, as you've heard me say a number of times, and that's not going to change. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Jim, I found one of the questions to Secretary Austin about the escalating attacks by Houthi rebels especially interesting. And that was why hasn't the U.S. struck back like it has following other attacks by Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria?

It does not want to make this a U.S. versus theHouthis, which would be, in effect, as you know, a U.S. versus Iran conflict, because Iran backs the Houthis, although there are some questions as to how directly they're directing these particular attacks. Regardless, from the beginning, it's been a U.S. priority, a Biden administration priority, not to allow the war in Gaza to expand, whether that be with Hezbollah in the north attacking Israel or to further expand these attacks, we've already seen on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. So, they want to bring partners in so that this is an international response to these ongoing attacks on shipping, which are having the effect, Bianna, the more we watch this of a blockade to some degree, because the threat proving so great that you're having a series of shipping companies, such as Maersk, and oil companies, such as BP, saying they're just not going to go through the Red Sea anymore, whether that be to an Israeli port in southern Israel or to continue on to the Suez Canal, which is a vital corridor for container shipping, certainly, but also oil shipping. And you're hearing numbers down to a third of the normal oil flow through the Suez Canal. That's a significant economic impact, and that, therefore, has global ramifications. So, the Biden administration appears to want to make this not just a U.S. versus the Houthis battle, but a world or at least a coalition versus the Houthis and by association Iran. We'll see if that coalition comes together and how quickly and can it have the effect re-opening these vital shipping channels.",

But while they've attempted to, they've culminated on the offense and gone into the defenses in many places. The Russians have continued, as the reporter just mentioned, to push reinforcements, new soldiers to the front line. And it's knowing that these new soldiers on the Russian side are just cannon fodder, meat for the attacks, throwing a lot of bodies into an offensive operation. And thus far, Ukraine has been relatively good in handling those on the defensive. But pretty soon, in terms of a lack of logistics, a lack of supplies.

Yes, you can certainly conduct operations when there's some disagreements between thecivilian leadership and the military leadership. All armies experience that, Bianna. No one is immune from that. But what we're talking about is the potential for General Zaluzhny to be bugged. And who is doing that? Is it inside of the Ukrainian government, or is it from an outsider? And what's interesting to me, and my experience is dated the last time I worked with the Ukrainian army was 2013. But even at the time, the chief of staff of the Ukrainian army was talking about the old Soviet generals that were still in the Ukrainian army. And one of the things he used to talk to me about is, how do we replace them with the younger breed, the ones who are more patriotic toward Ukraine as opposed to the old Soviet bloc? Now, that was in 2013. And it was surprising to me to hear him say that. But when you think about it, the military that grows up in a society that spends 30 to 40 years reaching the top ranks certainly will be beholden to some of the old days. So, was that bugging conducted by someone within the Ukrainian government to get the feeling for what General Zaluzhny's next plans were going to be or how he was affecting it, or was it from an outsider? Again, I don't want to throw conspiracy theories out, but you're in the context of a war that's been going on for two years now that has had fits and starts, good times and lesser good times for the Ukrainian forces. And they are entering a period when the West must continue to support. And their morale is being affected because they see what's going on in the politics of other countries, especially the United States, who has been their main supporter in terms of arms and ammunition.",

OnSunday, party officials told me there is nothing he can say that will change their minds. They want him out. Zeigler was stripped of his duties and his salary reduced at a closed door meeting in Orlando of the Florida Republican Party, where we're told that Zeigler tried to defend himself and apologize in remarks that were not welcomed by officials. Over the weekend, there had been some talk that Ziegler was looking for a buyout. That is a move that Ziegler told me was not true and it's a move that party officials said is not going to happen. Ziegler has been under investigation since October when a woman claimed he raped her after a planned sexual encounter between the woman, Christian and his wife, Bridget, fell through. The woman told police that she canceled on the encounter after learning that Bridget could not attend and that Christian still showed up to her home in Sarasota where the alleged sexual assault took place. Ziegler, who has not been charged, said the sex was consensual. Here now is the Vice Chair of the Florida Republican Party on why top Republicans across the state of Florida, from Governor Ron DeSantis to Florida's two senators and county-level officials all believe that Ziegler is unfit to serve.",
