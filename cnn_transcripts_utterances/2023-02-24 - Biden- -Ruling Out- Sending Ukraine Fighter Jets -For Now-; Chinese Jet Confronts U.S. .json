There has been a lot of speculation that Ukraine was getting ready to cede that city any moment that they basically just wanted to get through the anniversary. But officially, the message today was an upbeat one. We heardPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy who gave a very long press conference to journalists today, who also went and handed out medals to soldiers, saying that he believes that 2023 can be the year for victory. I think a lot of people across the country would love to believe that, too. But I think there is also a lot of clear-eyed realism about the number of challenges ahead. And that's why you've been hearing Ukrainian officials relentlessly asking again and again for this heavier weaponry that they believe they need to win this war once and for all, Kate.",

One of the major things that they needed in the short term at the moment was ammunition because they've been burning through it at a rate that the U.S. and NATO can't keep up reapply to.But, more importantly, arguably, if they'd want to meet this marker that they've now essentially set themselves with Zelenskyy saying 2023 is the year for victory, they say that they need to be able to go on the offensive. Part of that will be some of these tanks that the U.S. and Poland and the UK and Germany and other countries have agreed to give. But part of that, they say, needs to be things like long-range artillery that can hit the Russians at a greater distance, and also the fighter jets. I mean, you just played the clip from Biden's interview with ABC News where he appears to rule that out. When I spoke to a senior Ukrainian official just the other day, he was saying that they had impressed upon Biden and his team when he was visiting here just how important this was for them and that, quote, it was now in America's hands and that America understands. So it'll be quite interesting to see what response we hear from Ukrainian officials to that, essentially, revelation that the U.S., for now, is ruling out sending fighter jets. I should add, though, the UK has said that they would send them. They say also with a qualifier that it will take years to train pilots on them. But this is something we'll be watching very closely in the days and weeks ahead, Kate.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, the Russians obviously love this peace proposal. The U.S. has already criticized it, says there's very little new in it and called it a pro- Russian peace plan. And Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine, he also came out today and said, look, he's happy that the Chinese are putting something like this forward, but he also says, quite frankly, the Chinese need to talk to the Ukrainians as well and not just talk to the Russians.Nevertheless, the Russians, for their part, are saying they quite like what's in this peace plan. There are two things that the Russian foreign ministry has sort of picked out. On the one hand, it criticizes some of the sanctions that have been placed on Russia. And then also talks about alliances in Europe not being too strong. Obviously, a criticism of NATO. Now, of course, the Russians have said that, yes, of course under certain circumstances they would be willing to find a political solution to this conflict. And then they sort of put forward in a statement to the foreign ministry under what circumstances that would be. So I want to read that to you really quick. They say, quote, this implies the cessation of supplies of western weapons and mercenaries to Ukraine, the end of hostilities, the return of Ukraine to a neutral nonaligned status, the recognition of new territorial realities that have developed as a result of the realization of the right of the people to self-determination, demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, as well as the elimination of all threats emanating from its territory. Aside from the fact that this denazification, it's not really clear what is meant there. Essentially what the Russians are saying is that if there is going to be negotiations, if there's going to be a political solution, they want Ukraine to give up to surrender, to give up large parts of its territory, and to give up its entire army as well.",

Ian, just broadly as we are sitting here 365 days into this, where do you see this war standing one year in?IAN BREMMER, EURASIA GROUP PRESIDENT &amp; FOUNDER:  Well, for the last year, the level of support that the United States and the allies have provided to the Ukrainians has been extraordinary, it's been staggering really well beyond what anyone would've expected, including the Ukrainians in the early days, as well as the coordination in punishing the Russians. The big question is can that persist. Certainly, you are starting to see a reduction of support among some Republicans and certainly among public opinion of those that tend to vote Republican as well as among independents. And the Europeans are watching that carefully, they're deeply concerned about it. When I was in Munich at the security conference last week speaking to a lot of Ukrainian officials, they don't like this formulation of the Americans saying, as long as it takes, because they feel like time is not working in their favor, that they need as much as possible as soon as possible because if they're still fighting two, three, four years' time on their ground, their economy is going to be completely destroyed. The final point is that China, of course, is now playing a greater role, and the fact that they put forward this 12-point diplomacy plan is not going to be accepted by the Ukrainians or the Americans. But it is going to be accepted by all of the developing countries in the world. In fact, if you didn't know that China had written this plan, could've easily come from India or from Brazil or South Africa. That's a problem for the United States. It's a problem going forward in terms of how this conflict plays out.",

In fact, actual Chinese policy towards Russia has been virtually identical to that of India, which is, of course, much more aligned with the United States. If they were to provide direct military support for Russia, that is a red line. And that's why it's so important that not just the Americans but also the UK prime minister, the NATO secretary general, they all coordinated in making these very strong statements over the last few days that there will be hell to pay if the Chinese actually decide they're going to put their thumb on the scale in that way in favor of the Russians.I think you would see direct sanctions, secondary sanctions from the United States against Chinese firms. And while the Europeans would have to debate this very strongly, because, you know, their economies are already getting hit a lot harder because of this Russia war, I suspect that most of them, especially the Germans and the French would be aligned with the United States. This is the exact opposite of what the Chinese wants to see happen going forward. So I agree with Jim, it's a good use for operational intelligence. And I personally would be quite surprised if the Chinese went ahead and actually did provide these weapons in the near future.",

The issue of motive is important, too. No, you don't have to prove motive, but jurors want to know why we have done this. And he's there saying I loved my wife, I loved my child. And then he's given an opportunity to pivot to this issue of, I have these pill problems. There could be other unsavory people who he was dealing with, who could have committed this. His son Paul remembered that, got involved in that boating accident. There were people saying nasty things about him. So he's given them reason. Last, last thing. The necessity I spoke to was the time line. Remember, a lot of times in these cases, you admit what you have to admit, you deny what you have to deny. And the reality is, is that he was cold-busted.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Indiscriminate and nearly constant shelling by the Russians has left a trail of death and destruction throughout this region. The once bustling residential suburb of Saltivka (ph) now a grim memorial to the carnage. The last time we were here in Saltivka, it was just getting smashed by Russian artillery every day, 300,000 people roughly used to live in this area, but since the beginning of the war, it really became the front line, and even now coming back here, you're just starting to see little hints of life reemerging. One resident told me this was her first time back to Saltivka since the bombings. Months later, she is still haunted by the violence. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (translated):  Honestly, it makes me want to cry. Anyone who hasn't lived through it won't understand the fear. The dread. And the images can't reflect this. It's very scary. Terrible. I'm speechless, honestly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
