I'm Fareed Zakaria coming to you from New York.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): Today on the program, Israeli tanks push deeper into Rafah while ceasefire talks stall, and Russian troops advance towards Kharkiv in a new offensive. I will talk about the state of both wars with General David Petraeus who has been described as the most effective American military commander since Eisenhower. Then, the six-week long election in the world's largest democracy will soon draw to a close and India's Prime Minister Modi is perhaps on the brink of winning a third term. But what is his record on the economy? And what about fears of democratic decay? I'll ask the former head of India's Central Bank. And at a time when journalists across the globe are under siege, I'm joined by Pulitzer Prize winner Nick Kristoff. In decades of reporting, he's witnessed the best and worst humanity has to offer. I'll ask him why he remains stubbornly hopeful. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "But first here's my take.Something very unusual is happening in Israel. Senior military officials have begun voicing criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conduct of the war in Gaza. Israeli media has been reporting on a weekend security meeting at which the chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, General Herzi Halevi, criticized Netanyahu's lack of a clear strategy, pointing out that the Israeli military had re-entered Northern Gaza, an area it claimed to have cleared in January. He warned that unless there was a plan to set up some kind of non- Hamas government in these areas, the IDF would have to keep repeating these kinds of operations endlessly. Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has gone further publicly criticizing the prime minister, pointing out that the day after Hamas will only be achieved by actors who replaced Hamas, and declaring that he would not permit Israel to try to govern Gaza directly. \"The New York Times\" reported on others within the Israeli Military making similar criticisms. As Anshel Pfeffer writes in \"Haaretz,\" these briefings to the press have been synchronized as part as what can only be a coordinated briefing against the prime minister. The reason for these extraordinary dissents at a time of war is that Israeli officials have begun to realize what American officials have been warning them about for months, that without a strategy to create stable governance in Gaza, they will face a continuing insurgency just as the U.S. stayed in Afghanistan and Iraq. There is evidence it is already happening. Israeli forces have been forced back into Jabalya twice, and they have returned three times to Zeitoun. Their recent and controversial raid on the Al-Shifa Hospital was the second effort showing that their initial success was not lasting. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted last Sunday -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We've seen in areas that Israel has cleared in the north, even in Khan Younis, Hamas coming back.

We're going to help you get them out at the very least don't oppose us, at the very best, let's reconcile. We ultimately reconciled with as many as 80,000 former Sunni insurgents and others. Many of them just in the wrong place at the wrong time and trying to survive.And then we did the same actually with the Shia militia supported by Iran, about 23,000 of them. We did it initially directly with them. Eventually we were able to hand it off and get the Iraqi government to embrace that as well. I do think it is an example for this situation, noting, by the way, that Fallujah, Ramadi, Mosul, Baqubah and Baghdad altogether are not anywhere near as difficult as the context in Gaza, where you have 350 miles of subterranean infrastructure. Very well-organized enemy, knows the neighborhoods really well, uses civilians as human shields. And of course as still 100 plus hostages in addition to a variety of other factors. This is the most fiendishly difficult context imaginable, but it is doable.",

If the answer to that is no, in other words, you're not going to take more often than you create, you're supposed to retool the operation and figure out how to get to yes without which you go sit under a tree until the thought passes.So how you carry this out matters enormously. You've got to demonstrate your concern for the people. And this is why I mentioned up front that it would be very helpful if the Israeli leadership at the very top would say we want to make their life better knowing that because of the trauma that's been inflicted on the Israeli people, keep in mind, we lost not quite 3,000 in the 9/11 attacks. This would be the equivalent for us having lost 42,000 plus 7,000 taken hostage, and I'm not sure -- I've been in Israel just recently. And that sense of trauma is much, much more palpable than it is from a far. So, you've got to keep that in mind.

And really from the beginning, on the one hand, the U.S. has really led a very robust response to this unprovoked and brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine. But on the other hand, individual decisions have often taken far too long. The decision on M1 tanks, which held up the German decision on the German made Leopard tanks really was one of the factors that undermined the possibilities of success.Last summer, the decision on F-16s took too long. The decision on the army tactical missile system. Now all of these have been made, but there are still some additional decisions that should be made such as allowing the full use of American air defense systems over Russian airspace because it's from Russian airspace that these glide bombs can be launched. They don't actually have to go into Ukrainian airspace when Kharkiv is so close to the border. So there's still decisions that should be accelerated, that should be made.

If all this gets into place, European support has been very, very solid, each individual country has been doing bilateral security agreements.The E.U. itself pledged $50 billion and so forth.

Of course, the president of the university said ahead of time that he does not want to see any major disruptive protests that if that occurs, he would stop the commencement ceremony on the spot. But we will see whether there is any engagement of some type of peaceful protests from the students who are here. I will note that just before President Biden was set to speak, the valedictorian of the class. DeAngelo Fletcher, addressed the conflict in Gaza and in his remarks, he talked about the need for hostages to be released, but also said that there needs to be an immediate and a permanent ceasefire.

Black voters made up a core part of Biden's coalition back in 2020. But there have been some signs of narrowing of support within that group. If you take a look at a recent \"New York Times\" poll in a hypothetical head-to- head matchup between Biden and Trump, it had Biden at about 63 percent support from black voters, while Trump had garnered about 23 percent.So that is a tightening from what we saw back in 2020, but it's clear that the Biden campaign is taking this issue relating to some struggles they're having with the black voters very seriously. Biden has been engaged over the course of this weekend in multiple appeals to try to reach black voters. Just yesterday, he met with people in here, Atlanta, Georgia. A bit later today, he is traveling on to Detroit where he will speak at an NAACP dinner. But the group of people that he will speak here today is also very important as they are specifically young black men. That is a group that has shown some disaffection when it comes to politics, when it comes to President Biden. And so these are all groups that the president will need to continue to make inroads with as he looks to secure a second term and really the black vote is critical to try to stitch together that diverse coalition that he had back in 2020 including in a battleground state like Georgia.",

Of course, a key moment for his campaign as he tries to renew his support with Black voters. The president speaking about his record on race, talking about the challenges confronting Black men in this country, even his own personal journey, how by MLK Jr. influenced him through the course of his life. MLK Jr., of course, a graduate of Morehouse College.And he also addressed the issue that has been roiling in college campuses across the country. The Israel-Hamas war and talking about how he said that innocent Palestinians have been caught in the middle of it. He's working around the clock for an immediate ceasefire, he said. Then he's trying to push for a two-state solution railed against how innocent Palestinians have been caught in the middle of this conflict. There were some -- there was no protests that we saw. Maybe some folks turned their backs to the president. We're going to get a report from inside the room in just a matter of moments here. But were going to break this down here first with two Morehouse graduates on the panel, Bakari Sellers, the former Democratic state representative from South Carolina, conservative political strategies CNN's Shermichael Singleton, were both CNN commentators. And of course, CNN's political director, David Chalian. So, what did you guys think? I mean, this is obviously -- you know, we're coming into middle of a key moment of that campaign. He's trying to court Black voters, young voters. And he tried to confront the issue that's been an elephant in the room, the Israel-Hamas war. Did he strike the right tone?",

He does that a lot, but it's the fact that he went into the history of Morehouse College and tie that into protest and said, look, young man, I understand you have every right to protest. People have to remember Samuel L. Jackson actually held the board of trustees hostage, so we could change -- have policy changes on campus. Julian Bond went to Morehouse College. I mean, we had a history of protests on this campus in Atlanta, Georgia. And so, he was speaking to that history of protests and said, look, I understand what you're protesting. You have every right to do. I understand that history. And then he pivoted and went directly into it. Now, I don't think anybody thought he was going to bring up Gaza, Palestine, Israel today, but he went in and he talked about it from a nuanced fashion which I thought was very appropriate. I think we were having a question about how it how it was received in the audience. I'm not sure, we're not there. But I do believe this speech will be well-received around the country to one group and one group only, that's Black men. He has to talk directly to Black men because that is where he's lagging. If he's going to get to 90 percent of the African American vote, he's at whatever it is, 70 percent, 75 percent now, he's going to have to tighten up Black men and this speech was a step in the right direction.",
