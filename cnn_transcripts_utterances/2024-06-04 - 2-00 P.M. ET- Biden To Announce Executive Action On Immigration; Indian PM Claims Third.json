House Republicans are continuing to grill the attorney general on the baseless allegations of a so-called weaponized Department of Justice. We'll continue to monitor the hearing and bring you the latest throughout this hour. Stand by for that.But first, there's other important news we're watching right now. President Biden is getting ready to bypass Congress and unveil executive actions cracking down on the flow of illegal migrants across the southern border. The measure would severely restrict asylum seekers who crossed unlawfully. The threshold effectively shutting down the border would kick in once the crossings reach a daily average of 2500. The regulation was enforced under the Trump administration and was widely denounced at the time by Democrats. CNN's Rosa Flores is on the border in Hidalgo, Texas for us. So, Rosa, what's the reaction there to this expected executive action by the president?",

      "sentences": "All right. Good report. Rosa Flores, on the scene for us, thank you very much. Let's discuss what's going on with CNN political analyst Laura Barron-Lopez, Republican strategist, Doug Heye, and former communications director for Vice President Kamala Harris, Ashley Etienne. And, Laura, let me start with you. How we're both Republicans and Democrats, first of all, from what you're hearing, responding to this upcoming executive action by the president?LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, there's a bit of a mixed reaction from Democrats. There are some Democrats, especially ones in difficult reelection races, who wanted the president to take action, who wanted to see him do some executive action because of the fact that the Senate bipartisan deal was killed by Republicans. But then there are Democrats, including those within the Hispanic caucus that are not happy about this. They feel as though it's way too strict, that it's going to essentially turn back migrants who otherwise would have qualified for asylum. And they, of course, I think are going to be supporting some legal challenges. And I think we can expect those legal challenges to come. Republicans are attacking the president, despite the fact that months ago, a number of them thought that he should take executive action. And were using that argument as their reason for not supporting that bipartisan border deal.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. And what I'm hearing from leadership in the House Democrats but also from the White House, is that the argument they're making to those members is we might be able -- we disagree on the remedy on how to solve this problem, but we all agree that there is a problem, and we have to take some action. The fact that there's a problem at the border is not lost on Democrats at all. And it's not lost on the president.But I think what's really important here is the sequence as we talk about timing. The president day one introduced comprehensive legislation. As the reporter said, it's better to codify this into law. That didn't happen. He negotiated a bipartisan deal. It was a conservative's wish list. They decided they didn't want it. Trump stepped in, he killed momentum, told them to walk away from the deal, and they did. And now, they voted against their own bill several times. So, left with no other choice, the president has to take action at this point. And I think what's so disappointing about it is, Republicans' sort of fury about this issue and outrage about this issue is completely disingenuous. Why wouldn't they go ahead and vote and pass the bill? They've instead left jeopardized the safety of the country in these communities all over the nation to suck up to Donald Trump.",

So, while this is still going on, Narendra Modi, the man who has been Prime Minister of India for 10 years, is already declaring victory. He's come out and he's just given a speech saying this is a glorious day. This is a victory for the world's largest democracy.But he's spinning a little bit because it does look like his electoral margin has shrunk. We're still looking at preliminary numbers. But he was boasting that he was going to have a massive electoral win, a landslide. Instead, it does look like he's majority will have shrunk compared to the last two elections that he may actually even end up having to govern in a coalition with other political parties. So, the opposition, they're saying -- they're spinning this as a major defeat for Narendra Modi. Take a listen to Rahul Gandhi. He's the leader of the main opposition party. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

President Biden telling Time Magazine that it's \"uncertain whether Israel has committed war crimes in Gaza.\" But he's still pushing back against the world court warrants for top Israeli officials, including the prime minister and the defense minister.CNN's Jeremy Diamond is joining us from Jerusalem right now. Jeremy, we know there have been disagreements about what exactly was discussed in these latest ceasefire talks. Is there any more clarity today? Are they any closer at all to a deal that would allow the hostages to come home and at the same time remove the Israelis -- the Israeli forces from Gaza?",
