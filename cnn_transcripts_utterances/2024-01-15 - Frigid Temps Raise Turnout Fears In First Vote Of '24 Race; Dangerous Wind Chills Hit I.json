We asked the CEOs, is the world ready for AI? Live from WEF in Davos on Monday, January the 15th. I'm Richard Quest with AI Alex, and together, we mean business. Good evening and a very warm welcome. It's January. It's freezing and we're up a mountain. So on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, it can only mean one thing, it is time for Davos. And we even have -- hallelujah -- we even have snow. We've done our annual pilgrimage high into these results. We're going to ask the leaders gathering here what worries them the most. There's a range of issues -- AI election disruption, stalling economic growth. It's all to be discussed over the course of this hour. And the timing could not be more appropriate. In the US stage of Iowa, voters are preparing to cast the first official formal votes, if you will, of the 2024 election season, and they're doing it in a very unusual surroundings, the Iowa caucuses.

The first votes for the Republican presidential nomination will be cast in just hours. Party members in Iowa will head to their local precinct and caucus for their preferred candidates. It's an interesting process. We'll talk about it in a bit. Former President Donald Trump is trying to secure what he hopes will be a blowout victory. His main rivals are former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Haley is seeing some momentum ahead of next week's primary in New Hampshire. DeSantis is really just trying to keep his campaign alive. He's put a lot of resources into Iowa. Caucus-goers will be forced to brave, as I said, life threatening cold. An arctic blast over the Midwest has sent temperatures across Iowa below zero degrees Fahrenheit, we should note. By tonight, temperatures will range from negative two to negative 13 degrees -- even colder with the wind. The negative 30s, again in Fahrenheit. There are questions about how this might affect turnout, whether any specific candidate could benefit or be hurt by it. Trump is telling his supporters to show up, literally, no matter what.

We do have polls and a closely watched poll out of Iowa shows Donald Trump polling well ahead of his competition. According to \"The Des Moines Register\" newspaper there, 48% of likely caucus-goers say he is their first choice. Haley polled second at 20%. That is more than last month. Ron DeSantis, close behind her, but back in third candidate -- third percent -- third place. No other candidate polling above 10%. Like I said, though, we're going to have votes tonight, and that's what we're going to be looking for. I want to bring in Republican strategist, Doug Heye, and CNN Political Commentator Paul Begala, who was a chief strategist for the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign. Good to have you both on.

You know, Iowa is a very different process as you laid out. Also, what happens with Iowa is different than what we typically see. Iowa is not necessarily about who wins it, and I think it's pretty clear that Donald Trump is going to win it and win it handily. But if the margins look exactly like you're polling that you showed earlier turn out to be, then what we'll see is this is a two-person race. Iowa is about who emerges from Iowa. You can win Iowa and not become the nominee. That's certainly happens more often than not. But who emerges and goes on to New Hampshire and other states is what Iowa is really about. It winnows that process down. If the polling holds firm -- and again, it may not -- it means that there are two tickets out of Iowa, one for Donald Trump, one for Nikki Haley. If Ron DeSantis comes in third place, his campaign is, if not just effectively over -- completely over -- Vivek is a word that we just stopped using. So I think that's where were going to be looking at tonight is Donald Trump's going to win handily. Does he get over 50%? Who comes in second?

They say Nikki Haley's path, though narrow, would look something like this coming in a decent strong second in Iowa, a real strong finish in New Hampshire, possibly even winning.

The question is, what does that look like? This attack on a US-owned and operated ship appears to be the first time the Houthis have successfully hit a US-owned and operated ship since they started launching attacks in mid-November, but they have more capability. The US/UK strikes didn't try to destroy the Houthis' military. It tried to limit their ability to target international shipping lanes as they have in this sort of massive barrages, like we saw earlier last week. Did they do that? Well, we're going to wait to see here. The US feels their strikes were affected. But clearly as were seeing now, the Houthis still have the ability to launch. This wasn't the only launch we have seen since the US led strikes. So we'll need to see how this plays out, but it's difficult to see a scenario in which this comes down in the near future.

The goal is to get the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden back to situation where ships and shipping companies are comfortable using them again. But given the levels of activity we've seen here over the course of the past 72, 96 hours, that's not happening anytime soon.

It's especially a commitment when the temperatures are like -15 to -20 degrees.To be clear, no votes have been cast in the Iowa caucuses yet, even though it is caucus day. At 7:00 p.m. central time tonight, Republican caucus goers will show up to one of their precincts. As you said, there are well over a thousand, some of them will be in the same buildings. But they show up by seven central, which is 8:00 Eastern time. Once they get there, inside that room, a representative from each campaign gives a speech that could either be a campaign official, it could be a campaign family member if you're one of the huge caucus sites, or it could be someone from the local community, and they can actually have a bigger influence than anyone, Jim because there's someone you know, if you hear from a neighbor, to vote for Nikki Haley, or Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis, maybe you'll listen to them. After they give that speech, then, the balloting, you write down your choice, usually just on a paper ballot that you stuff in a box. I mean, this doesn't have to be high tech at the caucus site, because there are so many of them, and a lot of them are quite small. So, you write down the name, it goes in a box, then the votes are counted. Once they're counted each caucus site, then they are reported to the Central State headquarters. A lot of the time, we have CNN reporters each of those locations, we get a sense from some of the biggest caucus sites who might be ahead in each place. The votes are tabulated. Then we get an idea of who's ahead on caucus night, it gives us our first sort of straw poll of the situation. This is all ultimately about selecting delegates, though, Jim, and this is the first step, the very first step in selecting delegates for the Republican National Convention much later this year. What happens tonight is delegates are picked from each precinct site, then they go to a county convention, then they go to the state convention. And then those delegates are sent to the national convention. But this is the first step in apportioning those delegates. And I should note one other thing because some people say, well, what about the caucuses where there's a threshold where people move around the room if you don't get a certain point? That was only in the Democratic caucuses. That was never a Republican thing. That was a democratic thing. Republicans don't do that.
