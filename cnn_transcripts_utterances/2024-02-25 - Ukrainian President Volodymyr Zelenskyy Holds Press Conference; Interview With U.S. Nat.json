Jake, thank you so much for joining me. Ukraine is marking two years of the war. They are running desperately low on weapons, on ammunition. American aid, as you well know, has dried up because of opposition from Republicans. And Russian forces are advancing up and down the front lines.

So, Russia has already failed in its fundamental objective to subjugate Ukraine. And now the question is, can Ukraine continue to stand fast against the Russian onslaught and push it back? And, there, they do have to rely upon their own courage and bravery, which they have in spades, and on resources and capacity from the West, including the United States. And we are not able to give them what they need at this time because Congress has not acted to provide us with the necessary funding to do that. And we're asking Congress, especially the House of Representatives, after a bipartisan vote in the Senate, to move fast so that we can once again supply Ukraine with the tools it needs to win this fight.",

After delays and threats from Russian officials, Alexei Navalny's body has finally been turned over to his mother.We have seen security forces, though, crack down on mourners, protesters in the wake of Navalny's death. His mother says officials tried to threaten her into holding a private funeral. Does the Russian government need to allow a public funeral? And what is President Biden's message to Russians mourning both Navalny and the state of their country right now? SULLIVAN:  Well, what President Biden has been struck by, what I have been struck by is the commentary in the United States that the death of Alexei Navalny has some great show of strength by Vladimir Putin, when, in fact, the very idea that he had to lock this guy up to try to muzzle and silence him, and now he's trying to suppress and silence anyone who wants to come out and mourn him, that's a sign of weakness, not a sign of strength. And so, from our perspective, what we would like to see is a situation in which the Russian people and individual Russian dissidents like Alexei Navalny are not subjected to the kind of brutal repression and the conditions that led to Alexei Navalny's death. That's what we would like to see. That's why the president came out and imposed a sweeping set of sanctions this past week to send a clear message about where the United States stands on this issue.",

I know that we have got this primary, and we will see differences of opinion. I just want to make the case, though, that it's important not to lose sight of the fact that any vote that's not cast for Joe Biden supports a second Trump term. A second Trump term would be devastating, not just on fundamental rights, not just on our democracy here at home, but also when it comes to foreign policy. This was a man who promoted a Muslim ban. This is, I think, a very high-stakes moment. I am encouraging people to cast an affirmative vote for President Biden. I understand the pain that people are feeling. And I will continue to work to build bridges with folks in all of these communities, because they're all important to me, they're all important to Michigan, and I know they're all important to President Biden as well.

What did you make of her argument and what we're hearing from her campaign over and over, which is, if she gets close to 40 percent, then that means that there is a very big part of the Republican Party that still doesn't want him? Does that kind of comport with what we're actually seeing? FMR. GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR):  Well, I think it's true. And I think she reflected it last night, even though she didn't win. She was 20 points behind. It was a big night for Donald Trump. He won in South Carolina, where Nikki Haley was governor. But she got 40 percent of the vote, right at it.

We have also seen polling that suggests that over half, well over half of Republicans who are supporting Nikki Haley would not support Donald Trump in a general election. So, not only does she have every motivation, in my view, to at least stay in through Super Tuesday, as the governor suggests, but also she is clearly trying to make a mark for herself going into 2028. She's taking a gamble that Trump is not going to be the president. And I completely agree with her. I don't think he's going to win this election. I think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to get reelected. And she wants to take on the mantle of the GOP going into 2028.
