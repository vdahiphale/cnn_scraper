I had a municipal court judgeship that was paying me 100- something-thousand dollars a year, and like you've got to show up twice a week. Easiest thing, I've ever done in life.I also had private clients that were paying me to represent them. So I was able to have a law practice and that. Raising two daughters by myself, there were times in life where things were hard. And so I was telling people, I don't really run for D.A. I don't want to run for D.A. I mean, a good position right now. I got this easy job that I enjoy being the chief judge of the city of South Fulton, making money at the law firm. And I'm not sure that I want to make the sacrifice. And why does it always have to be me? Eventually, I prayed. I think that I was the appropriate person. I think that I did that. So when you're referring to that, what I'm saying is why should I make a sacrifice again? And what I was not talking about is being district attorney. Once you get elected district attorney, you're in a fine financial position. I make over $200,000 a year. What I was talking about is I ran for judge. When I ran for judge, I took $50,000 of my personal money out of my retirement and that money ended up being lost. And I know when you bet on yourself, you're going to have to bet money on yourself. And so, what I was talking about was not wanting to go to the personal financial expense of running for office. By no means that I think that I was going to be financially in a bad position once I won. Let's talk about what I was up against because it's important to understand that comment. I had a district attorney who had been here for 24 years. You put -- no, no, no, this is very relevant as to what my mindset was about this. So I'm trying to answer your question.

When I first became D.A. is the office was not properly staffed and so I'm surprised any lawyer would take it, but I did a contract for $60 an hour to help us out with first appearance. That lasted a few months, okay?So I can't remember Bradley or Campbell had that. I'm sure we can have records and I can tell you which one, but I just can't remember now, I liked their experience. One had been -- Bradley had been a probation officer and a defense attorney. Campbell had been a police officer and defense attorney. There's a reason I'm telling you this. Then that contract, like I said, it didn't last long. It was just I was aggressively hiring, hiring, hiring, hiring. Soon as I got where I felt like I have first appearance, enough lawyers for that. I'll let them go. Then, we have what's called a filter contract, but it was not filter for this particular case. I do have a lawyer who does the filter for this election interference case. When were talking about filter the contract, they had that neither one of them has any longer. I now have another lawyer that does f for me. It was only for police brutality cases, is for what I call the -- so when I first got to be the D.A., I had -- the whole unit was called anticorruption. It dealt with both elections and police brutality cases. I actually took a trip to Houston and visited the district attorney in Houston. They divided their workup and I thought the way she was doing it was better than me. And so I made a civil rights unit. And so they did what we would classify as civil rights cases. Those are specifically the police brutality cases. When I first took over, I was told Paul had not filtered five cases. That was a joke. It ended up being the 101 cases. They weren't filtered, which is why I hired two of them. Eventually we got it down enough that it was one of them. And then now I still have one lawyer that does it.

And then I think I pay my filter lawyers which I still don't know how get away with, about 150 an hour.And I want you to understand, the AG pays special prosecutors $1,000 an hour. So I'm a tough negotiator. Paul was paying people up to 375 an hour. I won't pay anyone more than -- 250 is my max.
