Award-winning filmmaker Rob Reiner joins me.Plus, Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei tells Hari Sreenivasan about his new graphic novel \"Zodiac,\" which explores the ongoing struggle for freedom of expression through art. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. President Biden says he has decided how to respond to the attack which killed three U.S. troops in Jordan, but he's not yet provided details. It comes after Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that the situation in the Middle East has not been this dangerous for 50 years. Hamas, meanwhile, says it's studying a proposal for a potential renewed truce and hostage deal, but insists on Israel's complete withdrawal from Gaza. So, what are Biden's options? Adam Kinzinger knows these issues on several levels. As a former Republican congressman and as a pilot still serving in the Air National Guard. And he's joining me from Texas. Welcome back to our program, Congressman. Can I first start by asking you about a very, very serious matter, you know, the president has got to decide whether he's going to take an action that could hit a sovereign state and expand what is a sort of a -- you know, a war in the Middle East right now, a widening war.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, look, it's going to be a tough decision no matter what he decides to do. Look, we havea longstanding position, and I think it's the right position that we will defend ourselves, that Americans have a right to defend themselves if they're attacked. And we have a right to retaliate if far troops are attacked. And up to this point with 160 attacks on American troops, you know, throughout the Middle East. We've been lucky to the point where there has been no loss of American soldiers lives until this last attack. And that was obviously very tragic with dozens injured. So, he's going to have to make a decision. I think the thing to keep in mind is, of course, nobody, I don't even think Iran is seeking to widen this war. But when we don't react, particularly on something as deadly as what happened, that is seen as weakness. As much as we'd like to think that we can now just, you know, engage in a friendly negotiation with Iran and kind of get everybody to step back from the brink, that's not how it's worked. So, I don't envy the president's decision, whether he takes us directly to the militias that did this or whether he expands us to, for instance, maritime assets with Iran, but I think it's going to have to be a significant strike to make it clear that any benefit you think you are gaining from attacking Americans in the region, the cost will actually far exceed any benefit.",

Andthere were a lot of folks that said, you know, oh, this is going to lead to World War III, and it didn't. And I think the lesson from that is they will have -- it's the same as Vladimir Putin, they will advance until they hit a brick wall, and they know they can go no further. That said, it's easy to tweet. If you're Lindsey Graham, it's easy to tweet just bomb Iran, because you don't have to make the decision. You can just be on whatever side as you want. And if you look in the GOP there's actually a big split. There's the bomb Iran now crew and then there's the Joe Biden starting World War III crew. And instead of arguing with each other, because they're on very different positions in this issue, they're all arguing against Joe Biden for some reason. Let's see what he does here. But I think there is a way for him to have a significant response that is tough. The key is we don't want to look like we're just reacting because we have to. A response that is tough that's not necessarily bombing the middle of Tehran and trying to expand the war further.",

Again, the U.S.and the, and the U.K. decided to take air action against their missile bases or whatever they have there in Yemen. It is one of the poorest places in the world. It is war-torn. The Houthis are non-state actors, and yet they seem to be winning not just the propaganda war, getting tons and tons of buy in from young people all over the world, including in the United States, but they haven't stopped. So, if the United States can't stop the Houthis, what can they do about Iran and its other backed militias?",

And, you know, we saw in Afghanistan, the United States won't be defeated when it comes to the military, the U.S. and the U.K. particularly. We can be defeated in our will. And so, with the Houthis, for instance, we've attacked them a number of times. We've taken out some of their anti-ship missiles as they have stood up, but they're still attacking. This is a long-term process to degrade their ability to do this. And even if they're going to continue to fire at ships, one of the things we're showing is that the cost is not nothing. You want to fire one anti-ship missile. It's going to cost you three or four if we respond to that. That's important to look at, this deterrence as a long game strategy. The problem is, we kind of live in this moment where it feels like we -- when we strike something once, we have to actually see immediate results. That's not necessarily the case. But that willingness, that will to stick it out is important. In terms of the youth, look, I have a huge problem with what's happening on TikTok. That's been litigated 100 times in the in the political side of things. But there is there is a failure somewhere in our education system that there are people that are showing, you know, sympathy to the Houthis and actually heroism of the Houthis when they actually launched this attack against Israel and against shipping in the Red Sea out of whatever, some sense of brotherhood.",

You know, yes, there's meant to be negotiations going on for a pause and more hostage prisoner swaps. But what about the pressure on President Gaza?

And so, negotiations are good. And I think it's important if Israel can negotiate a ceasefire or end the hostilities on a place where it feels that it can defend itself. That's the key. The danger in any kind of a war, whether you started or you didn't, is putting out a goal that's unachievable. The entire destruction of Hamas, I would love to see that. But as long as there's one person that self- declares themselves Hamas, you can't necessarily destroy all of Hamas. So, the ability to degrade Hamas prevent, you know, attacks and try to bring in a different government to Gaza would be important. So, negotiations are good. This meant this current situation may not lead to anything, but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't stop -- that they should stop negotiating.

Just four or five months ago, the GOP kind of sadly, you know, \"tanked Ukraine aid\" in order to get a border change because they needed a change in policy in legislation. Now, President Biden has come forward and said, OK, I'm basically going to give you everything you've asked for. And now, the Republican position -- after Donald Trump said he wants this issue politically, the Republican position has been, we don't need to change policy. The president can do this on his own already. It's not a serious party. Linking the issue of Ukraine and the border is very bad and very wrong. They're very different issues. Regardless, they were linked. Former -- the current president gave them a lot on this and they're walking away. This is an opportunity for the Democrats. They're not going to be able to change to flip the script against the GOP in just 10 months on the border issue, they can make some real gains on it. They can be out there calling for border security and saying the Republicans are unwilling to work with us. And I think it is so important to continue to talk to the American people about Ukraine.

He changed the landscape of how we receive television. He talked about real people, real issues. He had political opponents going at each other. And I learned from him not only how to make great and funny television and great funny movies, he was a supporter of mine, and he was like a second father to me. I loved him. I loved him dearly. And it's sad to me that he had to go, but he left a tremendous legacy, which is that we can -- we should fight.
