At least 154 people died in a massive crowd surge in Seoul, it happened on Saturday night in the city's popular nightlife district. Chaos erupted when Halloween party goers packed into a narrow street in Seoul. Witnesses say they were unable to move or brief. Forensic teams descended into that alley on Monday, questioning witnesses and combing through security camera footage looking for answers. The Interior Ministry says there were no guidelines to deal with gatherings that didn't have an organizer. Well, the nation begins a week of mourning. Senior International Correspondent Will Ripley joins us now live from Seoul. Well, the authorities there where you are seeking answers. Do they have any at this point?",

      "sentences": "Well, they're certainly getting closer than we were when we arrived here, Becky, onSaturday night, when all of this chaos was unfolding. One of the obvious questions is where was the crowd control? Where was the planning? And the answer is, and we got it today that there was not really there were extra police officers and increasing about 50 percent from previous Halloweens, which are always busy here in Itaewon. This is a very popular nightclub district, especially post-COVID, first Halloween in three years; people didn't have to wear masks. So they knew that there were going to be large crowds out here. But for events without a single organizer they have acknowledged that they don't have contingency plans. So there wasn't a lot of coordination. There were police officers out here, some of them were sent away to a protest that was happening in another area, and those who were here, their commands to the crowd, when they eventually did show up, were drowned out. And some people thought that they were even in costume just like everyone else. So the severity of the situation wasn't really sinking in. Even for people who were caught in the middle of the crush, I just talked with two people who actually were caught into the crush in this alley. And we'll just zoom in a little closer, Becky, so you can see how narrow it is. So when you have several thousand people packed in this really small space, a man who was in it, and a woman that I just spoke with a few minutes ago off camera here, they said that it basically felt like people were pushing them from all directions to the point that they couldn't breed. And the one woman was kind of showing me that she was basically being pushed to the left to the right, push forward. And that's how people started to fall. And as people fell and the crowd continued pushing forward, apparently there were social media videos, and people could hear people in the crowd saying, push, push, move forward. Then the pile of people grew to about 10 people high. And when first responders finally arrived to the scene, and they couldn't get through, because even though the traffic right now, as you can see is very sparse. It was gridlock here on Saturday night, when the first responders finally arrived and started to pull these people out. They described essentially what looked like a pile of people, you know, with the ones on the bottom having nine other people possibly on top of them, only if their face is visible. They were pulling them out one by one; they were placing them down on the streets on the sidewalks. And they were trying to perform CPR. And these people were not coming back, they were not being revived. Some of them were conscious when they were in the pile itself. But then as they were pulled out, they faded away. And so that's why you have just this horrific number of dead 154 people, 99 of them women. You know, the women particularly had a harder time is struggling against such a massive amount of force from so many people pushing them in multiple directions. You have now this memorial here, Becky that continues to grow. And the crowds here silent now but there have been times earlier in the day where people have come out and they have shouted in anger. Where was the government? Where was the protection of our young people? Why was more knocked on to keep them safe? That is the big question.",

But for people in their teens in their 20s this was the spot to be in Seoul. In fact, people even fly in from other places to come and party here in Itaewon on Halloween. That's why you had 26 foreign nationals listed among the dead. You know, two from the United States, there were five from Iran, four from China. There were victims from France, from Australia, from Austria, from Sri Lanka, the list goes on. And so this is truly an international tragedy, Becky. This area here obviously a very wide street, but the alleyways of Itaewon are kind of what makes it so unique, because it's these very, very narrow and winding, small roads, where people can go up into bars, and they can go to restaurants. But when you had so many people, you had 100,000 people packed and then everybody trying to get into the same place to get to a particular bar that might have had a particular special or particular music that people like.

India just one of the nation's hit hard by this, it has turned to discounted Russian oil to help ease the pain with imports rising to a record 23 percent of its supply in September up from just 2 percent before the war. That makes it Russia's second biggest oil client after China. While our Western nations iron out plans for an oil price cap, some question how effective it will be given the Kremlin's Asia market. I'm joined now by Hardeep Singh Puri, who's India's Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas. India has certainly served, and welcome to the show been benefiting from discounted rates of Russian oil.

And let me tell you what we've done. We are the one country in the world which has demonstrated that we can bring the cost of solar down; we brought it from 25 cents down to three cents. Now if you have to make green hydrogen, what do you need? You need cheap power and you need electrolyzers. We're getting both. We are one of the most ambitious and comprehensive green hydrogen plants in the world. Biofuels we have gone from 1.4 percent blending in 2014, Andy to 10 percent now, we had a target of 20 percent biofuel blending by 2030. We brought it out to 24, 25. If you look at compressed biogas, we have 42 plants producing compressed biogas. Our target is 5000 plants, making ethanol from agricultural waste. So India is doing precisely what Minister Sultan is recommending. So we have no difficulty on that. What we have a concern on is that if you want to make the transition from the current position to green energy, you have to survive the present. And that is where I think the high oil prices have unintended consequences, some good some bad. The bad ones are that you will find that the situation which is already inflationary, because of the stimulus packages, which went in pair, will become more inflationary and recessionary. And the good ones are that we will be a mother is a necessity of - necessity is the mother of invention, you're English speaking. So we will go into green energy faster, which we are doing. And we've just released 1 million square kilometers out of the 3.5 for exploration production. Well, all a major guys coming in.",

Well, some of the defeated president's supporters aren't accepting the results, at least not yet.

And then he only really addressed it in a tweet, basically mocking the New York Times for reporting on the fact that he had tweeted this absurdity. And so he's not seemingly taking it very seriously. I think most of us if we had promoted a heinous conspiracy theory like this would be a little more apologetic, and remorseful for doing so not in Elon's case. But I do think this really speaks to a larger issue at play here. And that's really our broken information economy that allows conspiracy theories like this to flourish, to gain a foothold in the public discourse.
