Both the former and current president are making their cases to voters and Biden is doubling down on his strategy of trolling the former president, calling him a loser. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  You're the reason I am president. You're the reason Kamala Harris is a historic vice president. And you're the reason Donald Trump is a defeated former president. You're the reason Donald Trump is a loser. And you're the reason we're going to win and beat him again. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He was a bit sensitive, and I think his feelings were hurt, but he threw a temper tantrum out on stage.

You were around when Trump was calling the border -- what was happening at the border an invasion.

Saying, \"What's good for America is bad for him politically.\"Now, he tried to draw a connection with some of his own legislative accomplishments and how that's affecting. communities that being investing in HBCUs, driving down the cost of insulin. Also, student loan relief was a big issue that he touched on during this. But notably, Jim, he also weighed in on border security and that emerging border deal that we've been reporting on throughout the day. Saying, essentially what he said in his statement last night, that he would shut down the border if given the authority and then fix it quickly. It was a notable mention, given that in other speeches that I've attended, he's not yet touched on this particular issue. But here, clearly, another example that he was drawing on to draw a sharp contrast from Former President Donald Trump. Now, the other reality that President Biden faced during his remarks was protesters. There were two protesters that got up over the course of his remarks, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. This is something that has come up in multiple of President Biden's remarks and really underscore some of the splits in his own coalition that he and his campaign are going to have to navigate in the months to come. The president did not engage his with these protesters and said -- continuing on with his remarks. But again, just another example of this coming up when he is trying to draw up support, shore up support in these big remarks. But I will say, Jim, at the end of the day, the bottom line from the president was that he needs South Carolina. He wants the voters to show up. This is a state that he has credited with turning the tide in 2020 and he wants the same to happen in 2024. This is a state, too, that will have its primary next week. It will be the first in the nation primary for -- after the Democratic National Committee overhauled the schedule with President Biden's support and it will be, while not competitive, the first time that we'll have a sense of his standing with black voters.

Has it been overstated too much, do you think, that Democrats are unhappy with Biden as a nominee for president one more time, running for reelection?And one of the reasons why I asked that question is if you look at what took place in New Hampshire, Dean Phillips mounted this challenge, didn't really go anywhere. There's a story in the New York Times of him having a coffee event where nobody showed up. There wasn't a Bernie Sanders like challenge this time around and Biden has really managed to keep other contenders out of the fray and really -- I mean, not -- I don't want to say unite the Democratic Party because it's far from it at this point, but he's been able to fend off challenges that we've seen other incumbent presidents do in the past.

And they're using their ability to get people into these organizations as a cover for their activities as well.So, it's certainly something within the realm of the possible and I think it's very clear that the U.N. has to do a very -- much more solid job of vetting the personnel that they get to work in their areas.",
