Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Today, we talk to two journalists at the heart of critical developments in the Israel-Gaza war. First, a conservative political analyst close to Benjamin Netanyahu. Then, to a student newspaper editor at the epicenter of U.S. campus protest. We begin with a renewed push for a ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas is set to meet negotiators in Cairo, as Egypt's foreign minister calls on both sides to accept the proposal on the table. A diplomatic source suggests that two- step process over several weeks involving hostage releases, prisoner swaps, and some sort of pause in the fighting. Speaking in Saudi Arabia, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken puts the onus on Hamas, saying they're \"the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire.\" But Israel hasn't yet agreed to the proposal, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is being urged by his extreme right flank to send troops into Rafah. Here's the finance minister addressing the prime minister. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEZALEL SMOTRICH, ISRAELI FINANCE MINISTER (through translator): If you decide to raise a white flag and cancel the order to occupy Rafah immediately in order to complete the task of destroying Hamas and to restore security to the residents of the south and to the citizens of Israel and to return all our abducted brothers and sisters to their homes, the government headed by you will have no right to exist.

By the way, this is theonly consensus in the Israeli cabinet. Even ministers from the left, like Benny Gantz, support entering Rafah at the end of the day because there are three strategic assets by Hamas in Rafah. One is the last five battalions of this terror army that invaded Israel on October 7th with those horrific results. Second is the senior figures in Hamas, in war and death, number one and number two. If they are killed or caught by Israel, it means the end of the war with an Israeli victory. And the third thing, which is the most important one, is cutting the chain of supply. The lifeline for Hamas from Egyptian Rafah. Through the tunnels, Hamas gets all the commodities, all the explosives, all the weapons that he wants. I'll just give you one example, Christiane. Each cigarette that is sold in Gaza is sold by Hamas, and they sell it 300 times the cost of a single cigarette. All this money goes to fund terrorism activity -- terrorist activity against Israel. That's why it's so important to cut this lifeline in Rafah.",

As you know, the friend of Israel, the columnist Thomas Friedman says, Netanyahu has to decide, is it Rafah or is it Ria (ph)? Do you want to make, you know, an international coalition or do you want to be pushed into a very unpopular and potentially very difficult, for everybody, particularly the Palestinians, invasion of Rafah?",

That is to say that was -- there was a Muslim, Jewish, Christian cooperation against fundamentalist Islam. What Thomas Friedman always writes, by the way, since, give or take, 1995 is a deal that I never hear from Saudis or people from the Emirates. I only hear it from Washington, New York, and London, which means for Israel to give up its security and get the prospects for peace in the Middle East. By the way, what Saudis really want, behind closed doors, I guess you hear it as well, is eliminating Hamas as a regional power, because if Hamas ends this war on its feet, it means that he got away with killing 1,200 Israelis, Americans, and British. That's why Saudi Arabia wants Israel to eliminate Hamas. And I think it goes the other way around. I mean, it's -- I'll put it differently. From what I hear from senior sources in Jerusalem, Biden gave the impression that invading Rafah means for him that Donald Trump is going to be the next president of the United States because Michigan voters, especially the Muslim voters, will not forget this and will not go to the ballot So, he loses Michigan and that's how he'll lose the election. That's why Americans push Israel for not invading Rafah, dispute it in a very dramatic moment for Benjamin Netanyahu. But one thing, Christiane, I'm not sure Netanyahu needs those threats from his right-wing. I don't think Netanyahu wants to skip Rafah. I think this is his raison d'etre these days.",

It believes in full victory over Hamas. You see it in each and every poll. The most persuasive thing for Netanyahu to do as a politician is to defeat Hamas. And as for the goodwill, I'm quite sure that President Biden wants all the best for Israelis, but there is a heated debate about what will cause it. I think the logic means that if Yahya Sinwar and Hamas as a whole get away with it and they are still standing on their feet after October 7th, so, what's next? I mean, you'll still have this terrorist enemy, monstrous enemy, just one mile from your borders. It will not be very good for Israel. It will be devastating for Netanyahu's prospects as a politician, which are not very good these days anyway. So, I think Netanyahu or the public opinion in Israel, and this is what people in Washington don't really understand, they're not against Netanyahu because he's too hawkish, they are against Netanyahu because they see him as too dovish. For instance, 72 percent of the Israeli population are against those -- this humanitarian aid to Hamas from the border -- from the Israeli border. So, for Netanyahu to be more popular, he needs to go -- to be more hawkish rather than the other way around.",

But can I just ask you, because as you know, better than I do, over the weekend there were more proof of life videos that were sent by Hamas to you, well, in some way released, of two male hostages. Now, we are not running the video, but we've shown pictures. And every night, as far as we can gather, there are hostage families that blame Netanyahu for slow rolling any deal to get their loved ones back. And this is something that's really causing a huge problem. At what point does Netanyahu believe, if ever, that the hostages come first, that the families, the people of Israel, comes first?",

If Israel accepted these very specific deals -- deal, it means that it ends the war with threequarters of the hostages still in Gaza, 50 minutes from here by car. 99 hostages will still be in Gaza. So, the debate in Israel is not between those who want hostages back and those who don't want them because they are -- I don't know, they don't have anything in their heart. But the question is what helps the most? I'll give you an example. Five months ago, Israel put a strong military pressure on Hamas and it got 123 hostages in return for only, I think, eight days of a ceasefire. So, there is a sentiment in Israel that says put more military power and you'll get more hostages. By the way, did anyone think what caused -- just a second, Christiane, what caused Hamas to release those video clips just seconds before Israel enters Rafah? Maybe they have something to hide there. Maybe they want to have it as a commodity. And one last thing about what you say about starvation. Prices in Gaza -- and facts beg to differ, prices in Gaza of food and humanitarian supply reduced dramatically over the last few weeks because of the humanitarian aid. Actually today --",

It's almost seven months in, Hamas has not been beaten. And, you know, you've got one leader, Marwan Issa, Yahya Sinwar, and the others are still there.

And he told me, you -- there won't be a specific moment, but there will be a day you'll sit in a restaurant in Jerusalem with your family and all of a sudden, you'll tell each other, wow, do you remember the days when we had masks and the warrants restaurant and bars and pubs? I think the same applies for defeating terrorism. 20 years ago, Israel defeated the terrorist suicide bombers from Judea and Samaria. It took three or four years, but at the end of the day, there is no threat of suicide bombers in the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. I'll give you two examples. One, the number of rockets fired from Gaza reduced by 99 percent. The number of tunnels, terror tunnels, reduced by 70 percent. The ability to invade Israel and to massacre, behead, rape, and murder does not exist anymore. So, I think we have to go there. And just one thing, Christiane, 20 years ago, to the date, there was a letter, a presidential commitment made by President Bush in order to persuade the Israeli public to withdraw from the very specific Gaza Strip. He wrote Sharon, then-Prime Minister Sharon, that the U.S. will work to dismantle every terrorist organization that might try to seize Gaza Strip. So, not only the United States does not put boots on the ground, now trying to prevent Israel from doing it, is something that will risk not Israel, but the very commitment, the very meaning of presidential seal and presidential commitment.",

That is to say that once Netanyahu, let's say, make a state visit to London or to Brussels, he'll get arrested there. By the way, it almost happened to then-foreign affairs minister, Tzipi Livni, some 15 years ago following the, caste led operation, I think, in Gaza. So, it's not something new, but it's very, very dramatic. It actually puts Israelis in a very problematic situation. It's an earthquake in an unprecedented level.

Today in Paris, French police entered the Sorbonne University campus to remove students occupying the main square. Now, the epicenter of all of this is Columbia University, where today, with negotiations between students and the administration at an impasse, the university called on protesters to clear their encampment or face suspension.

This interim suspension says they would have no access to any campus buildings, including residences, dorms, dining, et cetera, IDs completely deactivated, which would effectively evict a lot of those students or at least leave them without access to the residence halls and other important buildings.

To be frank, that off campus protest activity has held quite a bit. It has calmed down. That is where a lot of people were sort of citing a lot more tension in terms of when it came to, you know, certain chance or certain incidents that were arising from those outside protests. But predominantly for right now, the encampment has sort of remained the same. And there's been very few updates sort of on the day to day. That's why today is actually quite a big day. But, you know, I was just at the encampment pretty recently distributing our newspaper and really, when you walk on and you see it, it's students sort of laying on the lawn, you know, chatting, reading books, getting water, getting food. It's a really interesting environment because we are certain that there are a lot of students who have reported feeling uncomfortable, have reported feeling unsafe by the presence of the encampment. But also, when you walk onto it, there isn't like active protests necessarily occurring on the encampment itself, it's mostly just the state of occupying that space and kind of being on that space, and there being kind of a series of other activities often but very little in terms of tangible protest. There is going to be probably more escalation we can anticipate as a result of the university's crackdown. And that's sort of why we saw, in the first place, some of those outside protests come in and also some of the students themselves start to galvanize in terms of upping their protest activity was because or was in response to the arrests and also university crackdown. But for these past few days where everything has been at sort of a -- the negotiations have stalled, it has been pretty, you know, regular in terms of just the students laying on the lawns and, you know, kind of doing their day-to-day activity and programming, sometimes even tuning in to class from the lawn.",

But that was -- that piece in particular was addressing Shafik herself. It was attempting to say, Shafik, take a look at what your legacy looks like right now to the public, to your students, to the administration. And I think a lot of it is inspired as well by what we know from previous protests at Columbia, 1968, Vietnam, antiwar, South African apartheid, these are all huge moments in Columbia's history in which those presidents also have been looked upon for the decisions that they made at that time. And now, when we reflect on it now, there is, of course, a lot of disdain and criticism for those decisions. So, I believe what the editorial board was really trying to get out here is, you know, really warning President Shafik as to what your legacy will entail if it means, you know, the forceful removal of students from campus and also this crackdown on student protests. Now, of course, there are many differing opinions here, but that was the opinion reflected by our editorial board in terms of what the majority voted for.",

And we saw that as well in the congressional hearing. Congress went very, very hard on Columbia for, naming multiple faculty members by name, most of whom came from the (INAUDIBLE) department regarding statements that they had made, scholarship, and other things that they have taught in their classrooms as, of course, labeling them antisemitic and unsafe. And so, there has been this really big question as to whether the university has done enough to kind of protect academic freedom in the first place to allow that discourse to even happen. And so, I think, you know, in terms of agree, like our tradition here at Columbia of both our Middle Eastern Studies Department, but also our immense connections too, we have the Jewish Theological Seminary, we have a -- controversial, but we have a relationship through a program with Tel Aviv University. We have these very deep-seated ties to this issue in particular Edward Said, many scholars who are considered foundational in Israeli and Palestinian issues. And so, a big question here has, though, been, what is academic freedom, what is the university's role in protecting it, and has Columbia, in this time frame, under political pressures, under student pressures, has it done enough to protect that and allow that discourse to occur on its campus?",
