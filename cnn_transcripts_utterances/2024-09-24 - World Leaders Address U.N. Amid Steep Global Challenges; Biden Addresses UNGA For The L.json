But first, let's begin with Richard Roth at the U.N. So because of what is happening in the Middle East, everybody was keen to hear what the U.S. president says about the crisis in Lebanon. He essentially said that, look, a full-scale war is not in anybody's interest. And, of course, his priority was trying to figure out a diplomatic solution. Richard, take us through it. RICHARD ROTH, CNN U.N. CORRESPONDENT: Well, we're kind of at that full- scale war almost with thousands of rockets and thousands of casualties. Even two U.N. refugee agency workers killed today in the latest strikes. President Biden told the General Assembly, you know, we need a deal, get a deal. But Israel has long ago ignored the U.N. and Hamas is a terror organization. So these are not parties that are going to listen to the diplomats here. For the president of the United States, he was, as we heard, hopeful on the future. He also stressed the need for unity, such as working with a group such as NATO. He said, we're stronger united with everyone on board, perhaps a note to the isolationist theme of former President Donald Trump, who may be here next year again.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Perhaps we'll see that, although the president did just say, I think it was yesterday, that hehasn't made up his mind about whether to grant Ukraine permission to fire those long-range missiles deeper into Russian territory. But that's certainly something that Zelenskyy wants. A lot of other world leaders are pressuring the United States to come to this decision. And it will all kind of come to a head in that meeting on Thursday. And certainly we will also hear from Zelenskyy when he addresses the U.N. himself, talking about his need for greater capabilities, if he is to win the war against Russia. And you heard President Biden in his speech trying to take credit for his efforts to rally the world behind Ukraine amid this aggression from Russia. It's something that he is, you know, proud of. It's something that he wants to take a victory lap in some ways. But at the end of the day, the war is still going on, and the president didn't necessarily describe how the war might come to an end. And if you were listening to this speech, looking for any sort of new capabilities, new strategies, you were walking away still waiting to hear that from the president. I think in a lot of ways, this was a valedictory speech. You know, this was the capstone of a very long career in foreign policy for the president. And you heard him kind of tick through all of the various foreign crises that he's engaged with throughout his 50-year career, starting with the Cold War in Vietnam and apartheid in South Africa, ending with the conflicts that he is still dealing with today. This was always going to be a tough speech in some ways for the president. It's a tough moment. The world is still very much on fire in a lot of ways in the Middle East, in Ukraine, in Sudan. It wasn't a speech that he was going to be able to come out and say, I've brought peace to the world. Instead, he talked about the ways in which he is trying to bring these parties together and said that the U.S. and the world are at an inflection point. And I think you can interpret that to mean we're at an inflection point in the Middle East or Ukraine, but you could also interpret it to mean we're at an inflection point in the United States, on the cusp of a very critical election that will determine the future of American foreign policy. And you hear the president warning that a return to the isolationism of President Trump wouldn't necessarily resolve all of these conflicts. And so the president had a lot that he wanted to give, but at the end of the day, this was the shortest U.N. speech that he's ever given. The last three years were a little bit longer than this. And I think it tells you that the president didn't necessarily come to this speech with a lot of new strategies, but certainly wanting to talk about what he has done so far to bring the world to where it is right now.",

The rhetoric keeps escalating as the years go by. But he warned of a powder keg ready to explode. He said that leaders of these conflicts thinks they have a get-out-of-jail free card in their pocket. And he warned of a cataclysm ahead. He knows these issues very well. I asked him at a press conference last week when I overheard him saying to hostage families of Israel, I have no power. He said, I have no money. I have no troops, aggressive troops, but he has his voice. Well, he keeps using his voice. And as you mentioned, we have three major conflicts going on besides the other side wars that are happening. It doesn't appear, I've said it before, that the U.N. can handle all of these now with the balance in leadership of these strongmen. And even the - - that President Biden said, when he explained his decision to step down and let Kamala Harris become the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, he said that, you know, you've got to do more for your country, not for yourself.

      "sentences": "Yes. He's repeating the message that he put out to the people of Lebanon yesterday in many ways. He'ssaying, we are not your enemy. Israel is not the enemy of the people of Lebanon. It's Hezbollah is our enemy. And the warning for them to separate themselves out, as the IDF has been saying, get away from where Hezbollah is operating, get away from where it is storing weapons systems. This is a very, very clear message. Is it, in reality, going to have any traction in Lebanon? People are fleeing for their lives. They're afraid. Hundreds of people have lost their lives already. Tens of thousands of people have taken to flight from the south of Lebanon, further north, and others also have been seen crossing from Lebanon into Syria to try to get away from the possibility of Israeli airstrikes. So it's not really clear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's message is going to have traction. It is certainly, one, if he gets to the General Assembly this week, and it still seems to be a little bit up in the air, if he'll make his time slot on Friday for his expected speech, if this would be part of his narrative there. But certainly, it's an important message for Israel to try to signal to Lebanese civilians that they're not the target. But also what is being signaled is that this operation is not letting up, Northern Arrows. That's the name of the military operation underway. The Army Chief of Staff, General Hertzi Halevi, has said that it will -- that there should be no reprieve at the moment for Hezbollah, that its operation should continue full force, that they're going to speed the operation up. And it needs to be continued on all fronts vigorously. So the signals coming from the IDF are very clear. Their military operation is continuing. It's going to continue to target Hezbollah. But I think Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's message to the civilians is not one that's going to bring them solace, and the idea that they have really safe sanctuary.",

Given the distraction, what is your message to world leaders to keep their attention on this issue and to try to ensure that these hostages come home sooner rather than later, Maya?",

So your goals are aligned, especially the return of tens of thousands of Israelis to the north.

You just showed it in your program. And the leader of Hamas out there, Yahya Sinwar, does not want to move, doesn't want to move an iota. That's the truth. That's the crux of the matter. It's been said time and again by American leaders from Secretary of State Blinken downwards. So this is the equation. So if Nasrallah wants to fight for Sinwar, and Sinwar says no, we can't go on this way. We have the full right as every decent nation to defend ourselves. That's the point. So we are fighting. We are trying to clean, as we say, to take off capabilities of Hamas. We are attacking their capabilities of huge missiles and specific missile and launchers who are aimed at our families, at our homes, at our cities, at our villages, in order to enable us at the end to get to calm in the north, bring our people back and work as much as we can to get a hostage deal.

What is most frustrating today is not simply the level of death and destruction and hundreds of thousands of Lebanese people having to leave their homes, but also the fact that the end game, so to speak, of this war should be well known to everybody involved in this process. And this is the agreement that was put in place in 2006 with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 and a return of both countries to the armistice agreement. The issue being that over the past few months, the diplomatic effort has been mostly ceremonial and premised on the idea that this conflict can, in fact, be contained disregarding the fundamental linkage that Iran has put in place in the region between the so-called Unity of Fronts. So now what's important, first and foremost, is for the international community to step in with all the tools at its disposal with the largest alliance possible, learning the lessons from the failures of international policy towards Lebanon, especially with the so-called quintet that's been operational for the past years and to put once and for all an end to this madness. It's really important that the centerpiece of any negotiations be that this should be the last war between Lebanese armed groups and Hezbollah.
