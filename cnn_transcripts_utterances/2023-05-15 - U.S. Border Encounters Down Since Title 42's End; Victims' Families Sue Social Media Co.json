This is what the White House had hoped for especially when there were scenes like this, just one week ago migrants lining up before the expiration of Title 42.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warns it is too early to know if the migrant surge has peaked. While that's going on, there are new examples of political maneuvering. The governor of Texas sent a bus carrying migrants to the vice president's residence in Washington, D.C. We have teams at the border and at the White House. Let's begin at the White House. CNN's Arlette Saenz is there. What are you hearing from people inside the building behind you, Arlette, about what they're seeing?",

Now the Biden administration has been touting the fact that there has been a drop in the number of border encounters since Title 42 ended just take a look at the numbers.On Saturday, there were 4,200 encounters at the border and Friday 6,300, compare that to just before Title 42 lifted when the number of border encounters were hovering around 10,000. Now we are expecting to receive an update shortly from the Department of Homeland Security about the situation down at the border. But you heard yesterday the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas really trying to argue that the plans and messaging that the administration had put in place in the lead up to lift the lifting of Title 42 has led to some of this drop in the encounters. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now the White House has really been pushing back on the political criticism they've been receiving from both Democrats and Republicans.They are also still grappling with legal challenges to their Title 42 policies. Chief among those is that federal judge down in Florida, which blocked the Biden's administration's plan to release some migrants from CBP custody without court dates. That judge had ordered that program to be halted for 14 days. We're now about four days into that. The Biden administration is expected to appeal that very quickly. But it's simply one of the tools that the administration had been trying and hoping to use to try to alleviate the overcrowding or capacity issues at some of these facilities and shelters. Those shelters could be a major challenge for the White House going forward. A top border patrol official had warned that if they don't have that tool in place, they could see over 45,000 migrants in CBP facilities and shelters by the end of the month. So that is one thing that the administration will be watching at this moment as they're still grappling with the lifting of Title 42.",

And a framework can even be agreed upon House Speaker McCarthy said that he thinks that they have to have a deal in hand by this weekend, in order to ensure that they have the time that they need on the floor to get this all through before that June 1st deadline.We are expected to get an update from the Treasury later this week on whether or not that is indeed the date or whether there might be some more time.

Basically what they're saying here, the lawsuit alleges that this shooter was radicalized by what he was seeing on social media. And part of the lawsuit says that's because this was a person that was not raised by a racist family that as far as they knew, he had no personal history of negative interactions with black people.And the suit says specifically that the shooter explicitly acknowledged that the racist, anti-Semitic and violence promoting material he encountered on social media caused his radicalization, motivated him to commit racial violence and provided the training equipment and expertise to plan and implement the massacre of May 14th, 2022. But it's not just that, but it's also about how this livestream proliferated, excuse me, how it went from Twitch to 4chan to Reddit to Facebook. And the suit alleges, in part that these social media platforms were profiting off of not just hosting this content, but also potentially amplifying it, as well, as we heard from that lawyer that this video has been viewed over 3 million times across multiple different platforms, so all of those factors are playing into this lawsuit here.",

And so all of them in some form, Meta, Facebook, Snapchat, they say they've invested in technology to detect and remove extremist posts, especially when it comes to violence. But we're talking about a lot of content here.Snapchat, in particular said in regards to this case, that we deliberately designed Snapchat differently from traditional social media platforms, and don't allow unvetted content to go viral or be algorithmically promoted. Instead, we vet all content before it can reach a large audience, which helps protect against the discovery of potentially harmful or dangerous content. And that, of course, is the main crux here of what this lawsuit is arguing, did whatever algorithm the shooter was in, amplify, or basically pull on that dark seed of thought until it became reality. And again, it's first of its kind, or at least a very rare one.

And so yes, there is a possibility, a very real possibility that there are voters in Iowa who will go to the Iowa caucuses who are looking for that next generation.And you remember, back in 2016, the last time there were real Iowa caucuses on the Republican side, Donald Trump didn't win. It was Ted Cruz, who won I was there Donald Trump did not take that very well. But I have to say, since then, talk to Iowa Republicans, Donald Trump has become even more popular.
