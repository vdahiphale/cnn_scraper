      "sentences": "Good evening. On what was a blockbuster day in the criminal hush money trial of the former president, blockbuster because after what has at times been a meandering cross-examination of the prosecution's most important witness, Michael Cohen. Today Trump attorney, Todd Blanche was able to repeatedly raise questions about Cohen's honesty, not just in the past, but his honesty in his testimony before this jury this week.I was in the courtroom this morning just before the lunch break. Blanche presented text messages to Cohen between him and former Trump bodyguard Keith Schiller. The messages were from October 24th 2016, and they appeared to contradict testimony Cohen gave Monday on direct examination that goes to the heart of the alleged scheme to falsify business records. Earlier in the week, Cohen testified about texting Schiller. He said under oath that he needed to talk to Trump urgently, and Schiller was always by his side. He testified that he used Schiller's phone to speak to the former president. Cohen told the jury in his earlier testimony that the purpose of the call was, quote, \"To discuss the Stormy Daniels matter and the resolution of it.\" But today Todd Blanche did something the prosecutors had apparently not done, or at least not discussed with Michael Cohen in their questioning of him on the witness stand. Blanche read previous text messages Cohen had received shortly before he texted Schiller. They showed that Cohen was responding to a 14- year-old crank caller who'd been pranking him by phone for days. Cohen texted Schiller informing him about the prank call and wanting help from Schiller about the calls and that appears is why he then called Schiller. Blanche appeared to have trapped Cohen, arguing that the subsequent call between him and Schiller lasted only 96 seconds, and questioned whether, and this quote comes to us from our reporters in the room, \"You had enough time to update Schiller about all the problems you were having and also update President Trump about the status of the Stormy Daniels situation.\" It's important to remember that Cohen had never mentioned this 14- year-old crank caller in testimony. Blanche directly stated that he lied under oath earlier this week about speaking with then-candidate Trump on that day. It was a major moment on a day that saw several other notable developments, including that sources tell CNN the defense may call a former attorney for Cohen, Robert Costello, to continue the defense argument that the one-time fixer for the former president is a liar. However, the judge also suggested summations could begin next week. There's a lot to talk about with our panel. Joining us is Robert Ray, former president's counsel during his first impeachment trial, former federal prosecutor Jeffrey Toobin, CNN anchor Abby Phillip, also three more who witnessed that pivotal moment in the courtroom today, CNN's Anchor Kaitlan Collins went after the lunch break, Norm Eisen, who was the counsel for the House Democrats during the first impeachment, was there this morning, and correspondent Kara Scannell. Kara, what - was that moment the one that stood out to you?",

      "sentences": "Oh, by far, absolutely. I mean, it was the big moment of the day. And the way that Todd Blanche did it, he spent a lot of the morning on these inconsistent statements, drawing out when Michael Cohen may have lied. And then he gets to this phone call, and he begins by saying, you spoke with the former - you testified on Monday you spoke with Trump on the 24th. Cohen says, yes. And he says, do you remember, was it on speakerphone or did Schiller hand the phone. Cohen's like, oh, I don't remember.So he's setting it up in such a way that you think you're going back to this and then he says, and what about these text messages. And then goes exactly as you just described, just confronting Cohen with these text messages and the timestamps that were so close and that showed Keith Schiller saying to him, Cohen's complaining about this 14-year- old calling him, Schiller says at 8:02, call me. Cohen calls him at 8:02, it's a 96-second phone call. And Cohen then says, well - and Blanche is just building to this crescendo. He is focusing in on this on Cohen. And he's like, admit it, you lied, you made up this call. And Cohen says, I'm not sure that's accurate. Later on, he tried to correct that a bit and said that the reason why he remembered this specifically was because this was, as he put it, so important, such a critical thing and so he had it in his memory. He's been telling the story for six years. I'm not sure that that did the job though.",

I mean, just write him off. Or are they going to say, look, he's had this traumatic experience, he went to prison because he thought he was helping Donald Trump. Let's parse each statement and see whether those statements are corroborated. And this is really, I think, the prosecution's great hope, and this is why they examined him the way they did on direct, which was scaffolding his testimony with text messages, phone records.Now, the big problem with today is those text messages came back to bite him, at least in this one exchange. But it is also worth mentioning that, he had years of contact with Donald Trump. It's not in debate that whether he could - whether he was in touch with him ...",

Again, it was to prove their assertion that Cohen did not ask to speak to Trump about Stormy Daniels as he testified earlier in the week, but he wanted to talk to the bodyguard, actually, to Keith Schiller about a crank call or a series of crank calls.This is the key moment, quoting Cohen's text: \"Who can I speak to regarding harassing calls to my cell and office? The dope forgot to block his call on one of them.\" The call was - these calls were allegedly by a 14-year-old. After that, Keith Schiller texts Michael Cohen, saying, \"Call me.\" And shortly after, minutes - seconds later, there's a call from Michael Cohen to Keith Schiller, which he had previously testified was a call to get to Trump to tell him important news that he was moving ahead on the payments to Stormy Daniels, and he claimed that Trump had agreed. We're joined now by John Berman, who has more on this moment. Although the full text of this cross-examination that so - that was so momentous is not out. JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: We have almost all of today's transcript except this part, as you can imagine, which is very frustrating. But Anderson, you did a great job explaining it based on what you and others have reported from inside the courtroom. Look, he - Todd Blanche went after Michael Cohen on this. Michael Cohen basically said, \"I know that Keith was with Mr. Trump at the time and there was more potentially than this.\" In other words more potentially than me just talking to Keith about the kid. Maybe I talked to him about something else. Then he said, \"I always ran everything by the boss immediately, and in this case, it would have been saying everything's been taken care of. It's been resolved.\" And then he ultimately had to admit it, because based on what was going on, based on the text message and so on, based on the other text messages about the Stormy Daniels matter, that is how we came to the conclusion that he talked to Trump about Stormy Daniels on this phone call. It was all the other things. Blanche challenged Cohen to confirm that his trial testimony was based on materials prosecutors showed him in preparation from questioning.",

I saw eye rolling, really looking away. It was too much and it detracted.It shows his lack of experience, because it actually detracted from the point he was making. He would have been better to let the revelation that he had elicited from Cohen breathe, rather than being objected to and so loud and unpleasant.
