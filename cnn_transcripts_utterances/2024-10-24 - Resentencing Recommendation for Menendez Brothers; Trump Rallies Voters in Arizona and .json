RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  A very good morning to you. 6:00 in the morning in Kuala Lumpur, 7:00 in Seoul. We're still at the back end here in New York at 6:00 at night. I'm Richard Quest. Julia's off tonight. Wherever you are in this world, it is your \"First Move.\" And I've just realized if you are on the other side of the dateline, you're already into Friday. So, a very warm welcome to the start of your weekend. This is what you need to know. The district attorney in Los Angeles says he will recommend that the Menendez brothers, Lyle and Erik, be resentenced. The twins have spent more than 30 years in jail for the murders -- I beg your pardon, the brothers in the murders of their parents, they're not twins. The battleground blitz, Donald Trump rallies voters in Arizona and Nevada. Kamala Harris is going to take the stage, with her will be Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen, and that's in Georgia. Ukraine says North Korean troops have been spotted near the front lines for the first time. And a ticker- tape parade right here in New York, honoring the newest champions of the Women's National Basketball League. We've got all of that, and a great deal more. I start with the stunning developments in a case more than 30 years old. A murder case that gripped the U.S. back in the 1990s. It's the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez found guilty of killing their parents in Los Angeles in 1989. Now, the Los Angeles District Attorneys announced an hour ago that he will recommend to a judge that the brothers be resentenced. Under his recommendations, the brothers could soon be freed. That's because of the amount of time that they've served. This is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, instead of trying to replenish using a draft system or some type of conscription they are not -- the Russians are not doing that, especially in the big cities.

I mean, we're talking 20 inches of rainfall just in 48 hours, in some spots picked up about 250 millimeters in 12 hours. So, causing flooding, causing mudslides, real problems for the people here on the east coast, yes, but on the west coast as well, because the storm has that backside, the part of the eye that comes around and brings the rain to parts of the Philippines on the west side there of the islands, that's going to try to make a run toward Da Nang, stop and then possibly even come back over the weekend and into next week. Now, Da Nang will get significant rainfall, at least a couple of hundred meters there -- millimeters, but the area here that's going to see the heaviest rainfall could again be the Philippines if it does come back around. This is still five days away. Things change rather rapidly, obviously. We can't make a 10-day forecast for tropical cyclones. But another one, as you said, Dana there moving into parts of India, making landfall right now, according to the Indian Met Service, 120 kilometers per hour. So, it is a wind event, a surge event, and certainly, it will be a rain event. The difference here may be a little bit is the amount of population, the density of population, Richard here. You know here from West Bengal how many people are going to be in the way and in a very low land area in some spots. So, you can't get 150 to 250 millimeters of rainfall and not have problems there across parts of Northeastern India. Richard.",
