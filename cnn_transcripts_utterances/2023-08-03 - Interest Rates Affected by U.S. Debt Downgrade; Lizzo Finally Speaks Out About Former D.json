The fact that it happened when it happened, and the fact that it was based on what Fitch called deterioration of governance and not on the relative strength of the economy. It is that strength of the economy that made the White House and treasury and the Biden re-election campaign all extremely confident that they believed Fitch had made, in their words, a mistake, and that they needed to craft a forceful and aggressive response.A senior administration telling me this about the White House's response once they learned about it from Fitch that 24 hours, where they essentially circled the wagons to try to figure out exactly what they needed to say to response. This senior official telling me, the view directly from the economic team was that we need to be aggressive in our response. There was unanimity among the top economic officials that this was a mistake by Fitch. Now, it wasn't altogether unexpected, Kate. Fitch warned in May that it could downgrade the U.S.' credit worthiness. And Fitch alerted treasury with about 24 hours' notice that it was going to be making this decision, that's customary. But the 24 hours that ensued were essentially that period where all of these officials were saying, hey, wait a second. We don't agree with this. We think that they made a mistake. And so, the forceful response that resulted, you saw the press secretary talking about Republican extremism being the real threat to the economy. You saw the Biden campaign calling it a Trump downgrade, essentially mirroring or echoing the messaging that they crafted during the debt ceiling debate where they said, hey, this debt has been accumulated over several centuries, and it was really the predecessor to President Biden that caused it to balloon.

JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  So, this morning, unrelated story, pop star Lizzo is breaking her silence about a lawsuit in which three of her former backup dancers alleged workplace harassment. In a statement on Instagram, Lizzo responded in part by saying, these last few days have been gut-wrenchingly difficult and overwhelmingly disappointing. My work ethics, morals and respectfulness have been questioned. I'm very open about my sexuality and expressing myself, but I cannot accept or allow people to use that openness to make me out to be something that I am not. This morning those three former backup dancers spoke with CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm only, sort of, joking here. They say, undergrowth, regrowing across the battlefields of southern Ukraine is likely one factor contributing to the generally slow progress of combat in the area.

      "sentences": "Well, I know that the performance has been slower than most people hoped for. I think one of the reasons is that Ukraine has gone from being on defense to offense, and the Russians have had plenty of time to interdict progress with laying of landmines and three -- two or three layers of defensive measures that would prohibit and restrict a rapid advance.But the transition from Ukrainian going on from the defense last year to the offense this year is something that is different. Generally, when you are on the offense, you need a three to one personnel advantage. You take more casualties. And I think the other thing that is really important here is that Ukraine is trying to fight a combined arms tactic which is a western tactic but without adequate air power. And that element that's missing is really important. And the sooner that we can help them with air power, and it's not going to be any time real soon, unfortunately, but that is the missing element right now. And that contributes to a slower rate of advance by Ukraine, although they're making some progress, there's no question about it.",
