Agree with her politics or not, few Speakers of the House were as good at their job as Nancy Pelosi and none can make the history that she made 15 years ago when she became the first woman to hold the gavel. Today after two terms as Speaker during which even her opponents acknowledge her accomplishments in getting major legislations passed and with Republicans set to control Congress, she turned the page and closed the book. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):   Scripture teaches us that for everything, there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven. My friends, no matter what title, you all my colleagues have bestowed upon me, Speaker, Leader, Whip, there is no greater official honor for me than to stand on this floor and to speak for the people of San Francisco. This, I will continue to do as a Member of the House speaking for the people of San Francisco, serving the Great State of California and defending our Constitution. And with great confidence in our caucus, I will not seek reelection to Democratic leadership in the next Congress. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

ANNA ESHOO (R-CA):   Well, today was a day of appreciating the history that Nancy Pelosi has made. She has an unmatched record of leading the House of Representatives as Speaker. No Speaker in the history of the country amassed the record that she has done so, you know the pride of our caucus in our Speaker, the achievements, the history that she has made, the role model that she is for so many girls and young women, and the role that she has played on the international stage where leaders of other nations have a deep, deep respect and regard for her, her intellect, and her leadership.

ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA):   Anderson, I wanted my daughter to be on the floor when Speaker Pelosi was sworn in for the second time and also today for her farewell remarks because she represents my daughter, all of the little girls who have many more opportunities in their future because people like Nancy Pelosi served and have paved the way for her. And Anna and Speaker Pelosi have gone to great lengths also to enable the next generation, and I think the fact that there are three younger leaders who are ready to step up right now is a testament to Nancy Pelosi because I've benefited from her mentorship, and those three leaders, the fact that they're probably going to be uncontested certainly benefited from her mentorship. So yes, she was fierce in the way she led our caucus, you know, historic in the legislation she passed.

I mean, the central argument that Republicans were making in the Midterm Elections, is that they would do a better job handling policy issues that they think Americans care about -- crime, immigration, other things along those lines. And quite frankly, these investigations do not actually accomplish that goal. Now, I think, you know, political culture has changed over the course of the last decade in a dramatic way under Donald Trump, and there does seem to be sort of a higher tolerance for some of these exercises that are seen as political. I mean, it's become like extraordinarily tribal from a political perspective. I do think, to Evan's point, and I think, you know, what I certainly am looking forward to learning from his and our other colleagues reporting is whether Republicans can prove that last assertion that Congressman Comer made in that press conference, where he said and Joe Biden knew about it and had influence over it, because that's the piece that, you know, extensive reporting has not been able to show. You know, it's obviously true that Hunter Biden has come in for some serious scrutiny over his actions, but whether they can connect that back to the President is a big question both from a reporting perspective, but also from a political perspective, because they do run the risk of seeming to go too far, attacking his family. I mean, the Biden folks have been -- they've noted that there has been a lot of criticism of, for example, of Hunter's drug use. People have tried to tie that into here. You know, there are a lot of Americans out there who have someone in their family who has gone through something similar to what the President, as a father, has gone through with his son in terms of those issues.",

And if the FBI ends up -- and if the Justice Department ends up not charging anything related to some of these business activities, then they will obviously make that a political issue for the sitting President should he run in 2024.But here's the deal. You know, right now, what we know, Anderson is that this is an investigation, certainly, the charges -- potential charges are centering more around his tax issues, perhaps something related to buying a gun when he was a drug addict, when he should not have been able to buy a gun, those are the things that have been the focus. There has been some debate inside the Justice Department. Certainly, I think some investigators and at least some of the Prosecutors believe that there is enough evidence to charge. The final decision lies with David Weiss, who is a Trump appointed US attorney who was kept on to oversee this investigation. We believe you know, that decision could come at any time, obviously, given the fact that the elections are past us. So, we are now waiting for that.
