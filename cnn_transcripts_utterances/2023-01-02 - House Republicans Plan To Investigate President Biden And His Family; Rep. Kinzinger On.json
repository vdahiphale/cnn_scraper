There have been private meetings, between members of this team, and the various agencies that look like they are going to come under scrutiny, from House Republicans. And when you talk to officials, at the White House, they acknowledge, one, that, they know this is coming. Many of them are Veterans, of the Obama administration, dealt with this, when Republicans took control of the House, back in 2011. But also, a recognition that they need to be prepared, for whatever is coming. And that means trying to do as much work, in advance as possible. One thing to note though, a number of the lawyers that have been brought in are longtime Veterans, of Oversight investigations, of dealing with Capitol Hill, on investigations. And they appear to already be quite prepared. They just submitted a letter, to the two lawmakers that are expected to lead the critical committees, in that new House Republican majority, saying they were going to need to resubmit, all of their requests, for investigatory documents, when they take over the majority.

For example, border security, legitimate issue for oversight. But, if they're, going to go down the road, of impeaching Mayorkas - Secretary Mayorkas? Well, that's a loser. Same thing on COVID. There's some legitimate issues of oversight on COVID. But, again, but attacking Dr. Fauci, again, I think, is a loser. A very, I think, a popular figure. And they have to always worry about overreach, whether it's on Hunter Biden, or any other area of oversight. Because, it's, look, as somebody just said, Republicans just can't play to their base, do these Oversight hearings. They have to really talk to their more moderate members, because the moderate members are very sensitive, to these independent and swing voters. And those are the folks they really need to be talking to, in these Oversight hearings. And they need to do it in a more understated way, without all the bombast, but just trying to get the facts.

He's calling Doug Mastriano, a Pennsylvania state senator, who pushed all of these \"Stop the Steal\" lies.

And the Justice Department investigations are on their own timeline, including the election investigation, and the classified documents investigation, related to the former President's residence. So, those two things are not the same. And the Justice Department is going to consume information, that has been released by the Committee, for example, the transcripts, and whether they will look for exculpatory information, or information from witnesses, that maybe they also interviewed that are inconsistent. But I don't necessarily see the release of information by the January 6 committee as speeding up the Justice Department's investigation, in any way. I do think that they will take into account, how the presidential election, of the future, transpires, over time. They won't want to influence that election. But they also will be aware of the political consequences, of any major decision they might have.

And it'd be curious, and I've been communicating, with Jonathan Reiner, who's a cardiologist, about this. But one thing, I don't know if this was done, maybe you or Coy know. But if there in fact, was a defibrillator, near the field, or on the field, or if a defibrillator was used? That's something that you're using to basically give electricity, to try and restart the heart. And that is sort of the key, is restarting the heart. In the absence of that, CPR is basically trying to move oxygen, in the blood. The blood should still be oxygenated, for a period of time, for several minutes, at least. And the goal is to just keep that blood moving, through the body, perfusing the organs, perfusing the heart itself, perfusing the brain, until the heart can be restarted. That's the goal.",

And I think you mentioned that, you're seeing these tears, and the players' reactions. They're so powerful. And I think you mentioned earlier, Anderson, how we're seeing this on TV, we're seeing it from far away. When you're a player, on that field, you noticed right away, there were some Cincinnati Bengals players, taking a knee, right away. Teammates started gathering around. And you're seeing things that you don't see, on TV. You sometimes see eyes rolling, into the back of their head, you see their arms shaking and quivering, uncontrollably, things that you don't notice.

And they're told, \"Don't remove that yet because it might be a spinal cord injury,\" and they're trying to assess and evaluate. And there are shoulder pads on. And, this guy, if he was hopefully still breathing, his chest is rising up and down, at a rapid rate, because we're in the middle of a football game. And that adrenaline that you mentioned, Anderson, it is, there's so much emotion, and so much physical energy, buzzing, all in this chaotic moment, while you're just trying to figure out, how can we best help this young man?

So, it sounds like he was in cardiac arrest, there, on the field. Heart was either not beating or was in an arrhythmia, where it wasn't beating well, wasn't pumping blood, efficiently, through the body. And that's why it sounds like he, CPR was started, and he had several minutes of CPR, on the field. Why that happened is, it's certainly hard to know, at this point. There is a condition that we were talking about earlier, known as commotio cordis, which is basically something that is, as a result of blunt force trauma, to the chest, it can result in an arrhythmia, an abnormal rhythm of the heart. And that has happened. It's rare. I've actually never seen it before. But it's talked about, in sports, in baseball, even. From a fastball, for example, where it hits someone, in the chest, it's just the right time, or just the wrong time, as it maybe, and causes this, say, arrhythmia. He had this significant blow, to the chest, as part of that play that we saw. And that may have been what, what caused that. But again, we just don't know, at this point. I think what they're going to want to sort of ascertain is, if he was in abnormal rhythm. Did he require defibrillator? Did his heart need to be shocked back into a rhythm? Did that happen? Did it happen on the field? Did it happen in the ambulance? Has it happened yet? Those are all important questions. Because that's the goal, is you got to restart the heart, in some way.
