I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin this morning with breaking news of a mass shooting in California, ahere, at any moment now, officials will give us an update on any new developments. Meantime, I do want to bring in our correspondent who is there and bring you up to speed on what we know thus far. At least ten people are dead, another ten hospitalized after the shooting Saturday night in Monterey Park. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department says the male suspect in the attack fled the scene and remains at large. California Governor Gavin Newsom sharing his condolences in a tweet that says, in part, Monterey Park should have had a night of joyful celebration of the Lunar New Year. Instead, they were the victims of a horrific and heartless act of gun violence. The deadly shooting happened inside a dance studio, seen in these images right here, shortly after 10:00 P.M. local time during a Lunar New Year holiday celebration. The city of Monterey Park is about seven miles outside of Los Angeles and is a predominantly Asian community. The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, saying the news is absolutely devastating, adding families deserve to celebrate the holidays in peace. Mass shootings and gun violence are a plague on our communities , that from the new mayor of Los Angeles. CNN's Natasha Chen joining me now live now from Monterey Park, where officials will hold a briefing momentarily. What more can you tell us, Natasha?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Fred. We're at Monterey Park City Hall, and I see some officials actually behind doors, looking like they are preparing to walk out. So, as soon as they do, I am going to step aside so we can listen to them.But from what we know, as you said, ten people have died, they were pronounced dead on scene. This happened shortly after 10:00 P.M. local time at a business that is actually just a few blocks away from where we are standing here at city hall. Police say that they arrived to find people pouring out of the business. They found victims inside, gunshot victims. So, in addition to the ten people who were pronounced dead, there were at least ten more people who were brought to local hospitals. Now, there were some people in the community who came to the scene who came to take a look at what was going on. One of them spoke to reporters on site and really commented about how he had lived here in Monterey Park for 15 years and has never witnessed this kind of violence in this community, a very shocking and troubling to people here. He also said that America's gun issue is out of control and that he said it's best not to go to public places too often. That's his reaction, just a member of the community, during what is supposed to be the happiest time of year for this community, the Lunar New Year holiday. Now, as you mentioned, this was a gathering during this Lunar New Year weekend. This is likely a private gathering, separate from the city of Monterey Park's Lunar New Year Festival, which was also planned to be along those streets where this business was located. On the city's website, it says that this festival typically brings out 100,000 people per day during this holiday. So, that has been canceled because of the shooting. Those streets clearly blocked off initially in preparation for a festival, and now because of this tragedy, Fred.",

They started that off at the beginning of the ceremony. She didn't want a sad memorial. She wanted people to celebrate. This is the pamphlet that people are getting as they come in, this beautiful portrait of her on the front and on the inside a little bit of facts about her and then the order of events today. People are holding on to this forever. One woman told me this is history. That's why she wanted to here. Take a look over here. This is the gates that will lead you into the famed Graceland estate. And you can see people who were part of the public memorial walking out now. I want to tell you that it is cold, and so not everyone was prepared for the weather today. So, people have come in. They've been waiting for five, six hours for their cars just to stand in line. The first stop for many people, though, was to come and put flowers like this up for Lisa Marie Presley. People have added their names here. And you can see signs, flowers here. Folks came. This family is from California and Texas, just to make sure they were able to get here. We spoke with people who said they came in from Cleveland, Ohio. They booked a last-minute flight. They had two connections just to get here. Another woman said that she called her cousin and said we have to be here, because so many people remember when Elvis died. One woman told me it was the first and only time she ever saw her father cry back in 1977 when Elvis died. And ever since then, she had been a die- hard Presley fan. I want you to listen to two women as they talk about why they wanted to make sure they came here today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He directed her to make sure that the FBI is providing full support to local authorities and update him regularly today as more details are known.Now, I have to say that the vice president was also briefed on the shooting in Monterey Park. And we actually heard from her and some audio-only remarks just a few moments ago where she mourned the victims of her home state of California, and also herself pledged that she and Biden will be pledging that federal support. Now, I have to point out to you, Fred, that this, of course, is not the first, second or third time that the president will be responding to a major mass shooting while in office. We've seen him take this issue very seriously while he's been in office the last two weeks, often going to the site of the mass shootings to talk to the victims, talk to the local officials there, while also continuously calling for stricter gun laws, especially when it comes to banning assault-style weapons. That's something that the president has talked about quite frequently these past two years. Of course, the ability for that to happen, despite the fact that he was able to shepherd through a small limited bipartisan gun bill earlier last year, you know, that is also really on the table there. But, of course, the president has talked about that a lot. So, while we don't know all of the details and we are waiting to hear more in that press conference that's suppose to start any moment now, of course, we're also waiting to hear from the president who, again, has been really vocal about the need for stricter gun control in this country.

When they first arrived at the scene, police will have a number of working theories that they will attempt to run down in the hours immediately after the incident occurred. And there's a lot of information coming out recently about incidents that occurred nearby, the fact that the Lunar New Year event may have been over at the time that the shootings took place. And the fact that the suspect was armed with a long rifle, that mitigates towards someone who planned this event.However, it is going to be really critical to get information about what the suspect looks like, his description, and how he has fled the scene. Did he have associates? Did he have someone assisting him that picked him up and drove him away? Did he run away from the scene? Did he drive away? Video in that area is going to be really crucial. So, I think that we'll hear a bunch of information that will tend to clarify exactly what the motive was behind this incident at the press conference.",

And my heart goes out to the victims and their families, and to the Asian- American community, which has been obviously -- the focus of increasing hate crimes is monitored by the FBI in the last couple of years.So, law enforcement and homeland security experts do not have to be immune to context. When something like this happens, you look at the community, the date, the place, the victims, the time, what's been happening in atmospherics, and hate will be one of the likely motivations rather than, say, randomness. You don't put randomness that it could be a random perpetrator aside, but you obviously can take into account in terms of what your investigation is looking for. So, as Ed, the commissioner was saying earlier, have people been speaking about going after the Asian- American community, about the Lunar New Year? Are there things online that can give us hints about who it might be? That larger context is important also because whether hate was the motivation for the perpetrator, it is definitely going to be perceived by the community here in the United States and the international community that looks at these kinds of cases, it is going to be viewed as a hate crime. So, every city is having events today for the Lunar New Year. Every mayor and police department will have to position themselves to protect that community, because we don't know what's going on, and the community needs to be addressed. They'd live life fully in fear unless told otherwise. And I think we have to take that into account for what that community is facing today.",

County sheriffs. This is a large, sophisticated, highly capable law enforcement agency but there are still very specific technical tools and assistance that the federal authorities can bring in, things like cell phone site analysis and, you know, really complicated ballistic analysis. So, I'm sure they're on site assisting with the investigation already.I think it's also really important that we stay focused on the fact that, right now, law enforcement is looking for a man before they start thinking about a motive. They are really at like ground zero of this investigation, without even a -- you know, a specific description of who they're looking for. So, they are likely conducting hundreds of interviews of people who were on scene that night coursing through video surveillance capture from every camera in the area and really trying to find someone leaving that scene in a hurry might lead them to the shooter.",

I was with some friends in the Asian community last night and they were all excited about going out today.

We believe that there's an incident that may be related. We're not quite there yet. But it's definitely on our radar screen, where a male Asian suspect walked into a dance hall. And he walked in there with a firearm.And some individuals wrestled the firearm away from them. And the -- that individual took off. Now, some witnesses in that area are describing a white cargo can. We don't know though, at this time, if it is connected. That white man should be considered a man of interest at this point. Again, detectives looking at multiple locations, multiple clues. And I know how hard they're working. In regards to the firearm, obviously, there were multiple rounds fired at the first location where we have all the victims and survivors. We don't know how many rounds were fired. Different weapons have been described. In regards to this specific weapon, we don't believe it was an assault rifle at this time. But again, that's part of the investigation that we're looking at, just to make sure, and I don't want to put out bad information.",
