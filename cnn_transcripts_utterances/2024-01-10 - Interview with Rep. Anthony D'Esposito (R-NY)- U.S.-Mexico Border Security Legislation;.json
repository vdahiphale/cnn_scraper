But what I'm saying is that it's been 220 days and only until recently has the White House decided to have any negotiation. So, we've been doing our job. We sent a bill over to the Senate that, you know, what could begin those conversations could begin the negotiations. And only until recently, and I would have to argue that it's only because the White House is playing politics, because they see that their poll numbers are in the dumpster. And they know that the election is less than 10 months or 11 months away. And now they want to see movement at the southern border. That's why they're making moves. The House Republicans have been doing the job that they're supposed to do. We said that we were going to secure our border.

The Secretary is saying that the Houthis will face consequences.Of course, Bahrain is also the headquarters for U.S. Naval Central Command, where many of the naval activities in the Central Command region are based. We've also seen reaction from the U.K. Defense Secretary, who said to watch this space in terms of a potential retaliation against the Houthis. It is something that the U.S. has not been eager to carry out, particularly strikes on the Houthis inside Yemen itself, because they don't want to upend a very fragile peace deal that has been brokered by the U.S. there in the last couple of years. But still, clearly, given this massive escalation here, the U.S. feeling pressure to respond in a meaningful way -- Boris.",

But he also has been promoting a lot of conspiracy theories over the last few months on Pat McAfee's ESPN show. And yesterday, people who tuned in got a taste of that, where he was pushing medical misinformation about the vaccines, attacking Dr. Anthony Fauci, going after the media. He even went after an ESPN executive on ESPN's air. And so, this was just really bad publicity for ESPN. This is not what the network wants to be known for. And so today, Pat McAfee, the host, coming out and saying that Aaron Rodgers is no longer going to be joining them for the rest of the NFL season. Now, I am told that this is in direct response to Rodgers' behavior on the program. You know, in past seasons, in past NFL seasons, Rodgers has been a guest as the playoffs have been underway. But that won't be the case this year. And frankly, Pat McAfee, who has a very good relationship with Rodgers, he pays them seven figures to come on the show every Tuesday for these interviews. He also seemed relieved. Take a look at what he said earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
