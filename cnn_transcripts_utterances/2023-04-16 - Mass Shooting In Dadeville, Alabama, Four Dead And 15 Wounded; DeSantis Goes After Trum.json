Spokesman for a local hospital says 15 teenagers suffered gunshot wounds and were treated. Another hospital says it received multiple patients. The attack was tied to a sweet 16 birthday party in this community of 3,000 people. Let's go live now to Dadeville and CNN's Isabel Rosales. Isabel, what's the latest that we're learning there?",

We are learning that one of the four victims who was killed right behind me at this dance studio that was a venue, we're told by witnesses, for a sweet 16th birthday party. That victim has been identified as Phil Dowdell. That is per the DJ who was here last night when the shooting happened.Also, a senior pastor and leader in the community here, and the assistant football coach for Dadeville High School where Dowdell was at. He was a senior. Michael Taylor, that coach, saying that he knew Dowdell since he was nine years old. He is in total disbelief at the news. He says that Dowdell was a freak athlete blessed with any sort of sport, any ball that you put in his hand. He was good at track, football, basketball and was about to graduate next month. He had a scholarship, the coach says, to play football at Jacksonville State University in Jacksonville, Alabama. Here's what he had to say about Dowdell. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It simply seemed as though somebody began firing shots in the middle of that room in the middle of a party and then he just saw bodies dropping.Horrible scene for any child to see, for anyone to see.

And the president in the statement voices frustration over the inaction that has recently been seen when it comes to gun reform measures.The president wrote in this statement, quote, \"What is our nation come to when children cannot attend a birthday party without fear? When parents have to worry every time, their kids walk out the door to school, to the movie theater, or to the park? Guns are the leading killer of children in America, and the numbers are rising -- not declining. He added, this is outrageous and unacceptable. Americans agree and want lawmakers to act on common sense gun safety reforms. \" The president went on to say, \"Instead, this past week, Americans saw national Republican elected leaders stand alongside the NRA in a race to the bottom on dangerous laws that further erode gun safety.\" That final line, a reference to the National Rifle Association's convention that was held this week, where several Republican lawmakers, including some 2024 candidates, were on hand. One of those candidates is former President Donald Trump, who said that there's not a gun crisis in this country. Instead, it's an issue that pertains to mental health. Now, the president in his statement did have praise for one Republican, and that was the governor of Tennessee, praising his decision to sign executive orders strengthening background checks in the wake of that devastating shooting at that school just a few weeks ago. Of course, the Tennessee governor's wife lost a very dear friend in that shooting. But the president went on to push for Congress to enact further gun reform measures. Of course, the president wants to see an assault weapon ban and universal background checks, but that -- there simply is not the appetite for that up on Capitol Hill. Once again, though, so much of the focus in the past few weeks has been on gun reform including at the state level as we've seen this wave of devastating mass shootings across the country.",

Where was the custody of the documents and who are they for? Those are important questions. We can ask in the intelligence committee so that we can have stronger oversight. REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH): The access that he was having to this information should have been cut off.

And anytime this happens, whether it was Snowden, whether it was others who have revealed this kind of information, what happens is that you suddenly have to take another look. Stop becoming complacent about what happens with regards to intelligence.I think there are several areas that have to be looked at. I'm glad the president directed both the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to not only investigate, but determine how we improve security. Number one, ask the question are we classifying too much? Should we tighten up on the classification process to secret and top secret and not include all of these other areas that are part of the classified information? Secondly, who should have access and how do we secure that access? If you're going to have access, shouldn't you have somebody else in the room, particularly if you're a low-level airman? Shouldn't you have a superior officer or somebody else in the room to make sure that it's secure? Thirdly, what about clearances? Shouldn't we have a review process on clearances? We provide a clearance as was provided here, but then when somebody like this goes astray and starts getting involved in chat boxes with others, shouldn't we have the opportunity to be able to take a look at that and determine whether he should retain his clearance? And lastly, oversight of social media. This stuff was out there for almost a month before it was detected.

That's on the first indictment. I don't know if that will be the same on the fourth indictment. The thing about this ad I noticed is this kind of defensive. It's not him talking about anything he wants to do. It's about social security and of course, Republicans have been all over the place on cutting this. Rick Scott when he headed this Republican Senate campaign committee in the last cycle said they were going to make cuts in social security and Medicare. Scalise and McCarthy had both talked about that.

The real strategic challenge for DeSantis here is that he's fightingoff Trump who's been attacking him, but he's also got the other problem of having to consolidate the non-Trump lane of this primary. So, DeSantis is by far on top of that lane, but he still has a bunch of other people out there who are also trying to bring him down. So, he's really kind of fighting a two-front war. He's certainly at the top of one side of it. But fighting off Donald Trump while you're trying to do that is no easy task. I thought this ad was good.

In the town of Slovyansk, the holiday comes just two days after a Russian strike on residential buildings that killed 15 people. One of those killed, a two-year-old boy. Here's CNN's Ben Wedeman.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Air raid sirens. And the sermon. It's Orthodox Easter in Slovyansk, a town battered Friday, Good Friday, by deadly Russian missile strikes. That didn't stop residents from packing the church with worshippers spilling outside. I always pray for Ukraine, for our children, says 73-year-old Anya. I asked for peace as soon as possible, to live a little bit longer without war. We don't want to die. Anya and others have brought bags and baskets of food to be blessed. In these troubled times, more people than ever attend church even if some are reluctant. (On camera): Not everybody could make it to Sunday services. These emergency workers have been here all night because they believe there are still more bodies under the rubble. (Voice-over): This was the deadliest strike on Slovyansk since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion. An S300 missile gouged out the top floors of this apartment block, killing, among others, a little boy. A child who died was only two-years-old says Tatiana. His father is still there. If only they could lift those slabs, they could rescue him. That family, like many others fled Slovyansk early in the war, but came back after the Russians retreated last autumn. Officials say around 30,000 residents have returned in recent months. I knew all of those who were killed, says Lilya, a neighbor. It's horrible. Elsewhere in town, another missile landed in a playground. As fate would have it, Friday was cold and rainy, the playground was empty. The Easter services here go on for hours, allowing those shaken by recent attacks to renew their faith that this war will eventually come to an end. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Slovyansk, eastern Ukraine.
