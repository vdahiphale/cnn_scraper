Well, the reason that I think he didn't have to do it, although I certainly see why he did it, is because the actual regs give him the discretion if he thinks it's warranted and that really depends on whether he thinks there's some kind of basis for a criminal investigation. He's certainly now not privy to what he learned from the U.S. attorney in Chicago who had done the preliminary look at it. But judging from the outside, it doesn't look like there is any evidence of criminal intent. So, he could have handled it there himself and determined no need for a special counsel. Obviously, from his own remarks, he's very much relying on the notion of public interest here. It's a sitting president, so he wants the COVID and the installation of using a special counsel. So, I don't think he had to, but certainly see why he did.And actually, there could be some unintended benefits for the Biden administration because by having a special counsel actually run a criminal investigation, that can really insulate them from a lot of the congressional inquiries, because now it's an active criminal investigation.",

And in the case of Biden, they seem to have kind of kept this under the rug since the first documents were found in November before the election. And they have questions about the timing of that and whether there was any coordination with the Justice Department.So, there's still a lot of questions to be answered, depending what comes out.

I mean, while there might be a question of this small window of time between the discovery, same day notification to the archives and then to DOJ, we are talking about one to two months at this point where the government already knew about it. In contrast with the Trump Mar-a-Lago situation, there were months of negotiation. There was even a grand jury subpoena before finally, apparently, through some, you know, human source information, the Department became so concerned about the exposure of these highly sensitive documents that they went to a judge and asked for a search warrant. So, the differences are enormous in terms of the cooperation.Here, at least from the outside appearances, the Biden folks did exactly what you would want them to do. They discovered the documents, told archives right away, archives referred it to DOJ. And the Biden spokespeople haven't really made this point but there is an argument to be made that one reason for not trying to be ahead of the story is that it's in the hands of the Justice Department. It's not really the place of the White House or any witness or subject of an investigation to be making public statements ahead of DOJ unless you're purely doing it for political spin. And, of course, you know, they may be interested in doing that, but there's an argument for not doing that. They're letting the Justice Department take care of the investigation.",

It was quite frenzy up until the last minute, was holding really high- profile meetings, you know, with Poroshenko and the like and how his lower staffers were packing up his stuff in his offices.

And as your guy is reporting showed that there was a lot of things going on and that aides were frenzied and trying to pack documents. So, it is easy enough to mistake. You know, you have classified documents out for briefings that you're doing and different things. And it's easy to misplace things and certainly we don't know 100% for sure if that's what happened. But there's an argument to be made that it could be an accident and that things happen. But I think what this whole thing has shown, this and the situation with President Donald Trump, is that maybe there should be more formal protocols in place for packing up documents when a president or vice president leaves office to avoid situations like this in the future, because these are two incidents have come to light.

This is in the eastern part of Ukraine and this explosion is at a building that appear to be occupied by Russian troops. The Ukrainian commander says there were at least 25 Russian soldiers in that building. And Soladar in the Donetsk region has been the site of intense fighting. Russia has claimed victory there, but Ukraine says it still has troops holding that town. We want to talk about that situation with CNN Military Analyst and Retired Colonel Cedric Leighton.Colonel, always great to have you on bright and early. We appreciate you joining us. Put this into perspective for us. This is a relatively small town, but it carries symbolic importance, right? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It sure does, Boris. And good morning. There are certain things about Soledar. First of all, it's a mining area. It's mainly known for its salt mines, which have a lot of caverns in them. So, there is the possibility that somebody could use this as a storage facility for military equipment, for troops to keep them in hiding, things like that. Soledar is also right near Bakhmut. Bakhmut has been in the news for the last few weeks and this area is really kind of as the gateway for the conquest of the rest of the Donbas region by the Russians. So, the Russians believe that if they capture Soledar and they'll be able to encircle Ukrainian troops that are holding Bakhmut and then they'll be able to capture the remaining part of the Donetsk Oblast, which is the southern part of the Donbas Region. So, these areas are critical from that standpoint, but from a military standpoint there are no military installations there. The one other thing to note about Bakhmut is that it sits astride one of the main highways that connects the eastern part of the country with Kharkiv and then it goes on to Kyiv. So, there is a path that the Russians could potentially take forward. But given the difficulties that they've had, it's very unlikely that they would be able to prosecute that advantage and take advantage of any capturing that they be their Soledar or Bakhmut at this point.",

So, what you're seeing is the ability of the Wagner Group to use people like convicts and others that they've brought out of prison and from other parts of, in essence, the Russian underworld. And they're using them, they're employing them as fighters. On the other hand, you have the Russian Defense Ministry, which controls the Russian military, and they obviously want to take credit for it, because what is happening is their failure to prosecute.

We still see a 12 percent higher death rate in the black community, which signals that there's still some inequities that need to be addressed.We also are seeing increases in the overall incidents of certain cancer cases. We're seeing more breast cancer, more uterine cancer, more prostate cancer.

And I am heartbroken.\"Adding quote, \"I find some solace, believing she's reunited with her son, Benjamin.\" Now, Benjamin was one of her four children, he died by suicide in 2020. And Lisa Marie opened up about that grief and that loss, and what that was like in an essay over the Summer. And she said that her soul went with Benjamin that day. And she was never able to fully process that grief.  She wrote it in an effort to try to help others who were grieving over the loss of a loved one. Now, many other individuals took to social media over the past couple of days, one of them being Baz Luhrmann, who directed the movie about her father, \"Elvis\", in which Austin Butler won the Golden Globe for best actor earlier this week when Lisa Marie Presley and her mother Priscilla were in the audience when Austin took the stage to accept that award. Baz Luhrmann wrote this, \"over the last year, the entire \"Elvis\" movie family and I have felt the privilege of Lisa Marie's kind embrace. Her sudden, shocking loss has devastated people all over the world.\" Now, those are just some of the tributes earlier on Friday. We learned from a family representative, that Lisa Marie will be laid to rest at Graceland. That was the estate that her father lived at, that he left to her, and also Benjamin, her son, is buried there. Still, no word on autopsy results, toxicology. And we will keep you all posted on that as those developments come in. Boris, Amara?",
