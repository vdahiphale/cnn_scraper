This year, pink is out and lime green is in. From cosmetics retailers, this now TikTok famous deli in Charleston, even London Zoo got in on the action.

They didn't have that 2008 Obama moment that a lot of millennials had where they felt really excited about this candidate. They had Hillary in 2016, some of them, but most of them were too young to vote in that election. And then 2020, Joe Biden was not their top pick.
