And Bianna and Zain, the defense case here in the way they're doing this argument, they are trying to make it not as complicated as, you know, a mirror image. They are trying to say this is really straightforward. Michael Cohen lied to you. There's not enough evidence that the prosecutors have here to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt that Donald Trump wanted to commit crimes, wanted to protect his campaign, meaning a campaign finance violation. And right now, what defense attorney Todd Blanche is arguing as he's talking about Stormy Daniels, Gina Rodriguez, a publicist that was working with Stormy Daniels, the Access Hollywood tape, Keith Davidson, hush money schemes. What he's saying there is that Donald Trump is the victim. He was being extorted, that there were non-disclosure agreements made with people to keep them quiet. Women like Stormy Daniels, like Karen McDougal through the \"National Enquirer\", others, that all of that was Donald Trump being victimized because he was running for president and he was having to make payments ultimately to people like Stormy Daniels. But even if he did make those payments, which he did, they are denying that he had any sort of sexual relationship with Stormy Daniels. But even though he's made those payments, they're saying, don't believe Michael Cohen either. His personal attorney, Michael Cohen, he, too was trying to get money out of this. He's lying on the stand. And he was working as a personal lawyer for Donald Trump at the time in the same way that Trump put down these payments and other interactions in business expenses.

And even the defense team of Donald Trump was thanking them at the beginning of their closing summations today about how diligent they have been, that they've been there on time, that they've listened closely, that they're taking notes often in court of what is being testified to. At the same time, there are many recognizable faces in that courtroom, not just people who are celebrities or people on T.V. or people from film. There are also a number of people around Donald Trump who are quite recognizable politicians. His own children sitting behind him today, all except Ivanka Trump and Barron Trump, I believe, his other children are in court today to show their support for the former president. One thing that we see in this courtroom is still images of Donald Trump in the courtroom and then he speaks. And we have video of him coming in and out of the courtroom, but no video of the proceedings themselves. As much as the former president likes to say he is not being heard, he is not getting a fair trial, clearly the jury is getting quite a lot of opportunity to hear days of cross examination from his defense team, as well as these three hours of closing arguments this morning that still aren't over from his lawyer, Todd Blanche. The prosecutors, also, will be able to deliver their closing summation. And it's their case to prove here. They have the burden to try and make the case for a conviction of Donald Trump.",

They're going to say, well, maybe not. But we're not just doing this on the word of Michael Cohen. We have the receipts. We have a recording of Donald Trump and Michael Cohen talking about how to do this hush money scheme. We have Weisselberg dictating to the bookkeeper how to gross up this amount that was going to be paid back to Michael Cohen. And we have two jurors on the jury who are attorneys, as I am, and they know that when we get paid a retainer fee, we don't get paid extra to cover our taxes. That's just an absurd scheme to think that that's how a retainer is paid. But one of the things Katelyn mentioned about what just was argued about this idea that somehow Trump is the victim and he's being extorted, that's a really dangerous place for Todd Blanch to go, because he's basically saying, look, he didn't have sex with her. He was just being sort of blackmailed and he had to pay that because there's an election coming up. That's exactly the crime that he's charged with. So, it doesn't matter whether he had sex. It doesn't matter whether it was unfair for them to ask him for money in exchange to cover up the story. The only element is that he did defraud and actually, you know, cook the books, essentially, or had the books cooked on his behalf with the intent to deceive and that that intent also went towards committing another crime, which is the election cover up.

But it is complicated. I mean, it's a white collar case. The jury instructions are complicated and they get the last word so they don't know what they're going to have to rebut. Right now, they're scribbling and adding to their PowerPoint all of the things that they have to now attack that the defense is saying, you know, the jury is taking notes. The theory is that they 85 percent of them have already decided which way they're going to vote.

Oren,that's the first we've heard from the White House. Are we expected to hear from the president himself in response to what happened in Rafah? And what more are we learning about what that response could possibly be? OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT  Well, I don't know if there is a specific planned response from President Joe Biden to this Rafah strike, but his opinion, his perspective has been clear to this point that civilian casualties have to certainly be reduced in number and come to an end. The number of Palestinians killed, including women and children from Israeli strikes, has been absolutely unacceptable to the United States. And of course, there is no doubt that the next time Biden comes forward publicly in a press conference or takes questions, he will absolutely be asked about this and whether it does violate the red line he put forward. Now, he was talking specifically about a ground incursion into Rafah. That's not what we're seeing, at least in terms of on a large scale from what we're hearing. Of course, we have those reports now from eyewitnesses of tanks in central Rafah. But to this point, the U.S. has described Israel's actions in Rafah as limited. The concern, of course, was the risk to civilian casualties and the risk of worsening what is already a humanitarian catastrophe. Essentially, the consequences we saw of the Israeli strike on Sunday that killed at least 45 Palestinians and wounded more than 200 others. That's what the Biden administration was trying to avoid in urging Israel to carry out more precise operations. At this point, a U.S. official says there is no plan for an independent U.S. assessment of that Sunday strike. They're looking for information, more information, I should say, from Israel on what happened and how that all played out. So, waiting on that front, the U.S. has largely, over the course of the past seven or eight months, relied on Israel to carry out its own investigations and assessments and then pass that information on to the U.S. And that, as far as we know right now, is how this will play out. But clearly, the U.S. concern on Israeli operations in Rafah has been on-going, and this will only worsen or heighten that concern about the risks of Israeli operations in that area.",

He has said there was, quote, \"No crime but if there was one, they should have prosecuted it seven years ago when this all first happened.\" And as you noted, he also complained that he has to go first or his defense team has to go first. In closing arguments, the prosecution goes second. That is the case in every trial that is taking place across America today for every defendant and prosecution.

They have been mostly ignoring what has been happening in this Manhattan courtroom, letting the proceedings sort of take place without them weighing in.

Barak, what we just heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu is probably the closest we've seen of any form of contrition out of him as of late throughout this war, calling this a tragic incident here that's under investigation. We heard from Daniel Hagari that says this investigation is too early to conclude exactly what happened in that tragic fire in Rafah, but did say that the IDF and their munitions, what they described as precise munitions, were too small to have caused that blaze. How long do you think this investigation will continue? And as we see the operation go into Rafah and continue there, is this all contingent now in terms of what the response will ultimately be from the White House to what we saw over the weekend?",

And I think it will be very interesting to see whether they say that this still hasn't violated Biden's red line or indeed it did violate the red line. Barak, a good chunk of the international community was already against the operation in Rafah well before it started. And then to have this week, just to sort of see those images in Rafah of the tents, housing displaced Palestinians up in flames. I mean, those are really disturbing images.

And since October 7th, I think Biden himself and his advisers are much more forward-leaning when they talk about two-state solution, not only as this, you know, vague vision, but as something which is more operational. Not tomorrow morning, obviously, but this is part of Biden's exit strategy from the war. A hostage deal, ceasefire, some sort of a mega deal with Saudi Arabia, that includes a path toward two-state solution. This was not in the cards before October 7th.
