South Korea's joint chiefs of staff say North Korea fired at least one unidentified ballistic missile on Saturday, landing in the waters off the East Coast of the Korean Peninsula. This is Pyongyang's second ballistic missile launch of the year. This comes as North Korea warns of continuous and unprecedented strong responses if the U.S. and South Korea go ahead with planned military exercises. They're expected to hold nuclear tabletop drills next week at the Pentagon. So once again we're getting word of another missile launch by North Korea and we'll bring new more details on this story as they come in. The war in Ukraine is dominating the agenda at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, one of the world's largest and most influential domestic forums. Kamala Harris is leading a large American delegation there and is expected to deliver a major speech in just a couple of hours. In addressing the group on Friday, Ukraine's president pleaded with allies to hurry up with deliveries of the advanced weapons they've already promised. That includes dozens of heavy battle tanks recently pledged by the U.S. and NATO allies. Ukraine's military is widely expected to launch its own counteroffensive once it has those tanks. Friday Volodymyr Zelenskyy again called for Ukraine to become a full member of the European Union and NATO. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That while economic cooperation is OK, that security should come first and people should be mindful of that, thinking of the economic engagement that Europe, European nations have with Russia, the way that disengagement has happened, to ensure security now.

Now as Western allies debate more help for Ukraine, Kyiv is accusing Russia of using water as a weapon of war, draining water from a major reservoir Northeast of Kherson. And according to Ukraine, that could leave more than a million people without enough drinking water. The water levels have already dropped by more than seven feet. Officials say the move could also affect the cooling of the nuclear power plant which is in that part of Ukraine. Outgunned, outnumbered but going all out to win the war, that's the reality for many Ukrainian helicopter pilots as they take on Russian forces in outdated Soviet era aircraft.

Northwest Syria is probably the hardest hit of any part of Syria, which is mostly rebel-controlled.And it's not just one rebel group; there's multiple rebel groups -- you mentioned ISIS and several other extremist groups are in the area. So the first responders and the doctors on the ground face an immense challenge, just in -- in just servicing the local population. For us, we've been working through this war zone for a long time now so we have our channels in. We're able to get product directly into the hospitals and directly into the hands of the doctors -- and we're a doctor-led organization. We work with the doctors to make sure whatever we're getting over the border gets directly into the hospitals. But it's a challenge, no doubt.",

ICU supplies coming down and then we're going to see a lot of chronic diseases coming out from this earthquake, particularly kidney diseases because people that do survive are crushed under the rubble for quite some time. And lots of amputees. So I think, you know, the efforts, as you said, are dwindling and we're not getting a lot of survivors, particularly out of Syria anymore. But the fight for the life of these folks inside the hospitals are starting now. Folks are still hanging on by a thread. And this is when they need our support, so doctors can keep saving lives in the hospitals.",

Now this and the effects of all this, the injuries and so on, could last for decades.How long is the road to physical and mental recovery here? P. KOOSED:  We have a long road ahead. You know, right now we're very focused. The first I would say week we were focused on trying to go and obviously get as many people out of the rubble as possible, like Tamar just mentioned. Now we've shifted our thoughts and really our efforts to making sure we start the rescue efforts in the hospital. And we want to really get as many patients from critical condition to stable condition as possible over the course of the next number of weeks. From there, the real heavy lifting begins because it will probably exit the news cycle. But unfortunately, the need of millions on the ground will not stop, everything from base level camps, IDP camps, making sure there's enough shelter so people aren't dying of hypothermia. We're talking about amputees and making sure they can actually get limbs so they can function in a place that's not really very handicap friendly to say the least. And, of course, the mental problems you mentioned earlier, no doubt about that. The PTSD that all of these children will face and civilians will face is severe and will probably go on for decades, unfortunately.",

KOOSED:  Yes, I think we've established a supply chain and a platform for people to come and donate. Obviously, all of the donations to Save the Syrian Children are 100 percent going to medical supplies and to the shipment of those supplies into Syria, We're a 100 percent volunteer-led organization. So folks can help by going to www.savethesyrianchildren.org. Syria is experiencing some donor fatigue. It's an area that doesn't receive a lot of international aid, unlike Turkiye, which is so welcome, this help is needed in Turkiye as well. Syria has not been getting that sort of international attention. So the dollars go very far in Syria. We need more international attention, government attention, to go into northwest Syria, an area very hard hit by the earthquake. And we need to pay more attention to the 4 million plus people there affected there by the earthquake.",
