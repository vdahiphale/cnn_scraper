In response, Garland rejected claims of bias at the Justice Department. We're joined now by a Democrat who was in that hearing and asked questions of the attorney general. Congresswoman Madeleine Dean joins us now from the state -- commonwealth, I should say, of Pennsylvania. Congresswoman, thanks so much for being with us. Were you satisfied with how the attorney general answered your questions and those of your Republican counterparts? REP. MADELEINE DEAN (D-PA): Boris, good to be with you. And you know and you're reporting that we are in extraordinarily serious times in this country and around the world and we need serious people to deal with these things. We have a responsibility of oversight with the attorney general. But that's not what you saw today. You saw the Republicans using this as a sham hearing in order to attack the attorney general and his integrity and his independence all around Hunter Biden. This was absolutely the bidding of the former president in order to tear down the country's confidence in our independent institution, tearing at the very fabric of our democracy. Was I satisfied with what Mr. Garland said? Absolutely.

This is extraordinarily dangerous to them. Their lives are threatened. They had to open an office just to analyze the threats against their personnel. We know how dangerous this can be. After all, it's sad. But the very department that we were just talking to, of course, is involved in the prosecution of those who came to attack us, members of Congress. So it's very, very dangerous what is being done. And I want to contrast that with where we should be. We are about to shut this government down. Let me correct that. We are not. Democrats have been here month after month as the Republican majority and the speaker of the House can't get anything done. We passed legislation. Mr. McCarthy entered into a deal that was codified in legislation to fund this government.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the president. That's what we know. And what the attorney general did today was to say it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the investigations that are ongoing. Let's face it, it was a Trump-appointed attorney general, Mr. Weiss, who began the investigation during the Trump administration. They have been searching for four or five years to try to find some wrongdoing. They haven't done it. The Republicans demanded that a special counsel be appointed. Merrick Garland made him special counsel as soon as he asked for that. And now the Republicans don't like this Trump-appointed prosecutor because he hasn't done more to connect some wrongdoing to the president. There's just no evidence there, no shred of evidence.",

We're going to get back to the hearing now, which is ongoing. The House Judiciary Committee asking questions of the attorney general, Merrick Garland. Let's listen. REP. GLENN MAY (D-MD): -- reach out through the attorneys that represented Mr. Trump and have them comply and turn over documents, you refused to do so. In fact, the allegations are he, in fact, moved documents and tried to hide them so the Department of Justice couldn't get them. And that also led to the issue where Mr. Trump's lawyers ended up having to provide information and testimony about what had happened, which is highly unusual. But this scenario is highly unusual. We know that's the case because former Vice President Trump -- or Pence and current President Biden had similar issues. But they complied with the request by the Department of Justice, turned over the documents and so you didn't need a search warrant. But the news here is, I guess, if you don't comply with subpoenas from the Department of Justice, they will get the information. They'll get a search warrant and go get it. I know that because I've seen that in multiple cases in my career. There's no surprise. And there's certainly no tiers of justice with respect to what was done in that instance. In fact, the -- the fact that they took so long to do it I think is based entirely on the fact that he had been president. With respect to Mr. Weiss -- because this is the most recent version. I get why they're doing it. They want to try and build a case to impeach President Biden. The Weiss angle seems to be one of the ways they're trying to do that. As Congressman Buck said, everything the department did with respect to Mr. Weiss was correct. Because if the Biden administration had removed him when it came into power, there would be howls from the Republican side that you were derailing the investigation because Weiss was already on it. And if you brought in somebody new, they would have to start over again. The Senate Republicans, as you testified earlier, sought your assurances that you would let him continue going forward. And as you testified today, you've done exactly that. I want to be clear. I know the committee is talking about bringing Mr. Weiss into testify. They've brought all of these other people to testify who were part of an active investigation. But it is a horrible precedent to be bringing in prosecutors in the middle of an investigation that's about to go to trial, that's already been indicted, that's not the way the committee should be doing business. We should allow prosecutors to move forward. If we've got questions after the fact, we can raise them, as you pointed out. Mr. Weiss is going to issue a report at the end. Let's let them do their jobs and stop politicizing these cases. With that, I yield back. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): The gentleman yields back. The gentlelady from Indiana is recognized. REP. VICTORIA SPARTZ (R-IN): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield to our chairman to clear the record on something.",

There are probably some people that came on January 6th here, you know, that had bad intent.But a lot of good Americans from my district came here because they're sick and tired of this government not serving them. They came with strollers and the kids. And there was a chaotic situation because the proper security wasn't provided. That was a question that was answered why. Why would you debate it for 45 minutes on the floor and didn't stop the debate after the people broke into the capitol? But these people came. They were throwing the smoke bombs into the crowd with strollers with kids. People who showed up, you know, FBI agents, you have in my district, in my town, FBI phone numbers all over the district, please call, call them. People are truly afraid. And I just want to make that you are not aware that you are. And this is a big problem when people are afraid of their own government. And I'll share some other things. We're talking about justice system. I don't question -- you're probably not a bad person. I don't know you. But you're in charge of the department. And people right now feel -- I look at the Durham report and I called on millions of Americans, it's like KGB, the Durham report. But we have this -- you have a nice, you know, playbook. First, let's have a special counsel and then you don't have to answer any questions here. Then let's extend slow-walk investigation on the Hillary Clinton, on Hunter, everything is slow-walked. We move quick on Donald Trump, but you were slow-walking. Then, by the time, you know, that investigation and its statute of limitations expired and all of your agents need to be tested for amnesia. No one recalls anything. OK? You should probably start with your hiring policy. So no one held accountable, which was egregious what happened in that report when I read it. I can't believe it happened in the United States of America. This is my frustration. I'll be honest with you. Then it's very interesting, you know, regardless of what it is, even people in the Obama administration raise concerns. How can the president's son be serving in corrupt Ukraine and the oligarchs? We understand that it can undermine the one Ukraine policy. I think the concerns were raised and the Obama administration didn't do anything about it. These people are dying right now and Americans don't trust this president. So you -- I want to ask you one thing, you know, as you -- I don't need an answer because I know you're not going to. But I think you're probably a good American and you care. And a lot of the people are so afraid to cover up this stuff, I think in your department because they're embarrassed that what we became as a country to say that what our Department of Justice became. That allows Russians to do propaganda and Chinese. It allows them to destabilize our country. That is danger to our republic. It is significant danger. And I have one more question for you. I agree on corporate crimes even with Democrats that we need to do a better job. One more question for you. Do you believe that -- you know, you talk about rights to vote, but do you believe that only U.S. citizens should be voting in this election and doing anything to make sure that only eligible people vote in the elections?",

So I'm not -- I don't know every element of the model of legislation, but the general idea is, relatives or friends of the person have to go to a court and get some kind of adjudication, that the person is a danger to themselves or to others. Normally, relates to mental illness problems. It may relate to some others.
