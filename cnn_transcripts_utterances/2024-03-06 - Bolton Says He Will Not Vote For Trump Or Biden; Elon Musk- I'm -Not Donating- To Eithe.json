With his last Republican rival vanquished, even Mitch McConnell is throwing his support behind Trump. And Trump is making a head-snapping new demand. We'll tell you that in a moment. Also, Maggie Haberman will join me live, on what Elon Musk was doing, at Mar-a-Lago, as Trump is pleading with a judge for mercy, which for him means more time to cough up the many millions that he already owes. And tonight, the agonizing choice, to leave your home state, to terminate a pregnancy. Texas mom, Kate Cox, explains her deeply personal decision, ahead of a huge moment, in the national spotlight. She's President Biden's guest, at the State of the Union, tomorrow night. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. It's the sequel that most Americans didn't want. But apparently, it's the only thing playing. Super Tuesday has all but cemented the Biden versus Trump rematch, at the top of their party's tickets. Nikki Haley is out. And Mitch McConnell is apparently on board. More, on the outgoing Senate Republican leader, in a moment. But this is notable. 570,000 voters backed Nikki Haley, over Donald Trump, in the battleground states of Nevada, North Carolina, and Michigan. Remember that number because it could be very important, come November. 570,000 is more than double the gap that decided the race, in those states, four years ago. With that as the backdrop, the current and former presidents chose very different ways, to convince Haley voters, to join their team today. President Biden commended her for quote, speaking \"The truth,\" as the now presumptive Republican nominee bragged that he had \"Trounced\" her. Here in Washington, it was even enough, for Mitch McConnell, to fall in line, and finally endorse Donald Trump, something he has not done. The same Donald Trump, I should note, who attacked both the Senator and his wife, in vicious and racist terms, over and over and over again. It's also the same Donald Trump that Mitch McConnell hasn't spoken to, in three years, the same one that he also scorchingly denounced after January 6th. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): There's no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day. No question about it. The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their President. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Here tonight, Cameron Ward, a former Alabama lawmaker, has unique perspective on this issue, for two reasons. His past support of a 2018 law in the state that formed the basis of this ruling, and also has two children who were conceived with the help of IVF. And Cam, it's great to have you here tonight, because you and your wife, Lindsey, shared your own story about this. You called this a stupid ruling, you thought, by the State Supreme Court. But given this legislation doesn't confront what's at the heart of this, I wonder if you think it's enough tonight? CAMERON WARD, (R) FORMER ALABAMA STATE SENATOR: No, I think it's a band-aid approach. And I think the Legislature did the right thing. It was bipartisan. I have served with them for 20 years. And when I was over there, I've never seen a bill pass so fast. They wanted to fix this problem, as quickly as they could, or at least, approach to stop the problems that would occur, and allow for a long-term solution. So, I think they did the right thing. I think, long-term, they're going to have to -- probably have a constitutional amendment. But they're working on it. They're doing a good job on it.",
