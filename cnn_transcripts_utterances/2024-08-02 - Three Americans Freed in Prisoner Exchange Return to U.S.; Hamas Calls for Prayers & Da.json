Kylie, let's start with you described as a feat ofdiplomacy, Joe Biden suggests that it was his relationship with leaders around the world that helped effect this historic release. What further details do we have about what actually went in behind the scenes into this swap and just how long it took? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, well, his relationship with many world leaders, but specifically his relationship with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. All reporting reveals that the foundation for the deal that we saw come together yesterday, really started to be built in January, that's when President Biden made a phone call to Olaf Scholz. He said that when you come and meet with me at the White House, they had a scheduled meeting later that month. One of the things I want to discuss is Vadim Krasikov, that is, of course, the Former FSB Member who was serving a life sentence in Germany for murdering someone in Berlin in broad daylight. And previous to the conversations that occurred between Biden and Olaf Scholz in January, Germany had been resistant to actually including Vadim Krasikov in any sort of larger prisoner swap. But when they did, indeed meet in the Oval Office in the middle of January, according to a senior administration official, they had a conversation. And Olaf Scholz said to President Biden, for you, I will do this. And that is really what set off the next eight months of hurried, and challenging and dynamic efforts to try and put together a deal that included Vadim Krasikov for a larger prisoner swap with these Americans, who were still in Russia that the U.S. had been working in some cases for years to try and release. So, then there were months of back and forth between the U.S. and these other countries, Norway, Slovenia included in that to try and see which other prisoners those countries had of Russia's that they might be able to include. So, this was a really complicated months long effort. But that relationship between Biden, Olaf Scholz clearly played a central role. This is absolutely fascinating. And, Nic, let me bring you in, given the complete breakdown of relations between Washington and Moscow since the start of Russia's war on Ukraine. Why would Russian President Vladimir Putin agree now to a prisoner swap? What are your sources telling you? And who at the end of the day got the better part of this deal for one of a better phrase?",

We're going to speak to two foreign ministers of countries involved as we've been reporting there were a number of countries involved in the next 20 minutes. The Norwegian Foreign Minister joins me at the top of the next hour his counterpart from Poland, how they came to make this impactful but difficult choice. While Hamas calling for a day of rage as its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh is buried and mourned in Doha in Qatar. That funeral is happening this out the days after his assassination, you will remember in Tehran in Iran. Haniyeh who you see here on the right was heavily involved in the hostage and ceasefire negotiations that have been going on over the last 10 months on Gaza. But his was not the only high-profile targeted killing. The IDF also killed a senior Hezbollah Commander, the man on the left, he was killed in Lebanon on Tuesday. And yesterday, it announced the Head of the Military Wing of Hamas had been killed in July. Well, in the wake of these assassinations very specifically of the assassination of Haniyeh, we've heard threats and promises of retaliation from various figures across the region. And the White House Security Council Spokesman has just told CNN that the U.S. has heard the message. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's not clear what that retaliation would look like. Would it be a direct attack from Iran, like the one that we saw back in April? Would it be a coordinated attack from Iran's various different proxies? There is definitely not a sort of state of panic here at all. But we are starting to see preparations underway, if you will. We spoke to a hospital here in Tel Aviv that has cleared out an underground parking lot that can be used potentially, as a makeshift area to treat patients if there is an attack. We've also heard from the victory supermarket chain that is reporting a 30 percent increase in sales predominantly of canned goods, toilet paper, frozen foods. We have also heard from the Jerusalem municipality that has been urging people to prepare and to clean their shelters to make sure that they can get to a shelter within 90 seconds, which is the allotted time that they have been given to get to a safe place. And so definitely a sense that people here are getting ready, getting prepared. No panic, as I mentioned, but broadly speaking, regionally, no question that this is the kind of do or die moment, if you will, where everybody waits, to see sort of on the razor's edge as to whether this flows up into a much broader regional conflagration or whether the needle can be threaded in terms of finding a response that saves face for Iran and Hezbollah, but does not prompt a further escalation, Becky.",

This has really shifted the conversation away from ceasefire, away from negotiations, away from hostage release. And back to an area where it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu feels more comfortable, which is essentially trying to frame this as a conflict between Israel and its allies and Iran and its various proxies, the so-called Axis of Resistance. The U.S. very keen to avoid any kind of a direct confrontation with Iran, very keen to try to keep those ceasefire agreement talks alive, but they are now hanging in the balance with Hamas' lead negotiator assassinated, and leaving very little clarity as to how this would move forward. And the Qataris, who have also been a linchpin and main interlocutor in these talks, voicing a huge amount of frustration, that, you know, their efforts have essentially been -- by the assassination of Haniyeh.

I do want to just be very clear as well that his comments on that radio show were inaccurate.And you had heard John Kirby, the White House National Security Adviser saying a press briefing yesterday that no money was exchanged. No sanctions were loosened. In order to have that deal done. Of course, they did end up doing a prisoner swap. So, Russia was able to have some of their people get out as well. But I will also remind you that Donald Trump participated in a series of prisoner swaps while president as well, and he did let out other people, for example, in 2019 in a prisoner swap, some people were released from the Taliban, in an effort to get some U.S. members out of Afghanistan. So that's just one example of many. So, I want to be very clear there. But this prisoner exchange does undermine Donald Trump's repeated claims that he could be the only one to get Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan out of Russia. Clearly, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were able to do that. I think the timing of it as well, and just the months before the election, has gotten under Donald Trump's skin, and that's why you saw him do that interview. He also had written similar comments on social media. Now, as for the attacks on Kamala Harris, Donald Trump is not only, you know, not walking away from those very controversial comments and false claims questioning Harris's heritage, he's doubling and tripling down on them. And he's also having his running mate, J.D. Vance, defend him on these as well. Now, when I talk to Donald Trump's team about this, they say, look, they weren't expecting those comments to be made on Wednesday. But now that they have been made, they said he is not going to run away from them, and that they're going to continue to try to use this as a line of attack this idea that Harris is quote, unquote, phony. So, I think you can expect more of that in the weeks to come. And really, I think we're seeing Donald Trump revert back to his 2016 playbook as he tries to figure out how to define Harris.
