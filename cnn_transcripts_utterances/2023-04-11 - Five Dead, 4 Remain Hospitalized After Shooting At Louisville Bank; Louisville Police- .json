The congressman, the New Democrat representing that district, reciting the names of the members of his community now lost.That Congressman Morgan McGarvey saying yes, thoughts and prayers are very helpful at this moment. But he also says Washington should change the law so that guns can't rip communities apart anymore. Part of that call to action calling out Kentucky Republicans for what he called, quote, building a sanctuary state for weapons. We start our coverage right there on the scene in Louisville with CNN's Omar Jimenez. Omar, it was a remarkable presser, we learned a lot. We learned the shooter purchased the gun legally, an AR-15 one week ago. We learned it took 170 units of blood to treat the wounded at the local hospital. We learned that this bank incident and another incident yesterday brings to 40. 100 days into the year, 40 members of the local community, a small modest sized city have died of gun violence. The thing that jumped out to me, though, was listening to Dr. Jason Smith, the Chief Medical Officer at the local hospital saying they, quote, barely had to change the schedule in the operating room because they are so used to dealing with gun violence.",

We're not just tired of mass shootings like these but tired of the everyday shootings. And I think that represents more than just the sentiments of folks here, that represent sentiments of communities all across the United States, because of course, the mayor highlighted took the time to highlight that, of course, the five kills here was a tragedy.Of course it was. But then minutes after this happened, another man was gunned down, not too far away from where all of this unfolded in the bank just behind me here. That they are now at 40 people killed across Louisville. That this isn't just about these acute incidents, it's about a culture that needs to change. And that was reflected in the frustrations that we heard. That, of course, one, there's a policy side of this. But then, of course, another side is the everyday reality of those that are affected by this have to deal with it. The mayor in particular, Craig Greenberg said, you may think this will never happen to you. I used to think that. The sad truth is no one in our country has that luxury anymore as he went on to say that he had survived a workplace shooting not too long ago. And here he was having to hear the news of a friend who died in a workplace shooting. At the federal level, we also heard from Congressman Morgan McGarvey who says his frustration was that he doesn't feel they have the tools on the books to properly address someone who is potentially a danger to themselves or a danger to others in regards to firearms. Take a listen to a little bit of what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MORGAN MCGARVEY (D), KENTUCKY: I am a person of faith. I was raised in the church, we've raised our kids in the church. Please, if you are a person of faith, and you want to give us your thoughts and your prayers, we want them and we need them. Our community is hurting. But we need policies in place that will keep this from happening again. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The police chief says it was an AR-15 and she went on to say this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHIEF JACQUELYN GWINN-VILLAROEL, LOUISVILLE METRO POLICE DEPARTMENT: We have learned that the suspect in this incident was a current employee with Old National Bank. We have also learned that he purchased the weapon used in this tragic incident on yesterday on April the 4th. He purchased the weapon legally from one of the local dealerships here in Louisville.

Gentlemen, will sadly continue this conversation in the days and weeks ahead as we learn more about Louisville and most likely have to deal with this again somewhere else across this great country.With me in studio to share their reporting and their insights, CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Leigh Ann Caldwell at The Washington Post and USA Today's Francesca Chambers. So we have to, what I'll call blue dots in red states dealing with this. You have Nashville, Tennessee. You have Frankfort, Louisville, excuse me, Kentucky. The mayor of Louisville urging Frankfort which has a Democratic governor but a Republican legislature. If you won't pass state laws, statewide laws, give us autonomy, change the state law, so that cities, local communities -- and he was quite clear about it, he understands his state. He says they may view this differently in Paducah than they do here in Louisville, but I want the tools to do something, give them to me. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes, there's politicians and people in power in this country who want to do something about it. And then there's politicians and people in power in this country who don't want to do anything about it. And that is the situation that we're in and that we've been in for a very, very long time. It's interesting now that there are local calls to do something knowing that Congress has failed over and over again, to make any sort of big, meaningful changes to gun legislation. Of course, they passed something a year ago. And now every time one of this happens, what members of Congress say is, well, we passed this last year, that was a big lift. That's probably all we're going to get right now. And so it is interesting that in the south, you have Nashville and Louisville, who are the center of this gun rights movement or gun control movement right now.",

So that wisdom comes from the doctor there.But you mentioned Louisville Slugger, the bank is steps away from the Louisville Slugger Museum. I've been there, many of us have been there. It's steps away from where baseball is played. But look, one individual shooting, as we know now from covering Sandy Hook, and so many others is not going to make a difference. But is there a collective movement? Is there a collective time happening with the younger voters? And I'm struck by -- for the second time in a week, the governor of Tennessee, the governor of Kentucky both had someone very dear to them were killed in mass shootings and slain.

There has been a silence, but inside the Republican Party. Congresswoman Nancy Mace from South Carolina spoke up about it this week. But that silent split has long been there. Vice President Mike Pence is one of the few 2024 potential Republican candidates who came out and praised the judge's ruling. So he is taking the side and there is some room on the right without a doubt, there are many pro-life organizations that have been praying and pushing for this for a long time. But that is not where the majority of the country is. So politically speaking, electorally speaking, there's one thing that you can say about Donald Trump's instincts on things like this, is to be absolutely silent.
