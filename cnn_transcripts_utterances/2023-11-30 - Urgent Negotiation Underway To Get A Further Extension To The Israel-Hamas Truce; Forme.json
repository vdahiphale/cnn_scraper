      "sentences": "Hello, and a very warm welcome to the show, I'm Paula Newton in for Isa Soares. Tonight, urgent negotiationsunderway this hour to get a further extension to the Israel-Hamas truce that's held now for seven days. This bolstered by the presence of U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken who is pushing to extend that truce and influence the next stage of this war. We will hear from him this hour. And a man of immense power and influence. Former U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger dies at the age of 100, we look back at his life. Now, we are in fact in the last remaining hours of an extended truce between Israel and Hamas still waiting for the promised exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners to be completed. And yes, still waiting to see if those urgent negotiations are able to hold off the resumption of war yet again. Now, two female Israeli hostages were released earlier and are now back in Israel. And Israeli official says the hostages are being released in separate groups today because they were held in different locations within Gaza. Meantime, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken as we were saying, he's in the region, he is expected to continue to press for that all-important extended truce. He met with Israeli leaders in Tel Aviv in Jerusalem, then with the Palestinian Authority president in the West Bank, the U.S. is urging Israel to protect civilian life if it now launches a ground war in southern Gaza this time where Palestinians have been told to flee. We want to get more now from Ivan Watson who's been following all of these developments from Beirut. Good to have you on the show, Ivan. You know, each day, the hostage-prisoner exchanges, they follow a slightly different script, today, no exception, and yet the handovers, the truce apparently still holding. What more are you learning?",

So we don't really know where it's going to go from here. There have been -- there has been reporting from CNN that there were disagreements between Hamas and the Israeli government, up to the last minute about Hamas' proposed list of ten hostages to be released that Israel rejected a proposal when Hamas came with a list coming into Thursday of seven living hostages, and then the bodies of three of the hostages. And Israel rejected that, saying no, our deal has been these people have to be alive. And for everyone living, hostage release, then Israel would release three prisoners, Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. So the big question then is, can this be repeated again tomorrow? Can these warring sides continue their negotiations? There were a lot of positive comments from the Qatari mediators going into Thursday about the possibility of an extension of the truce. We're not hearing that same note of hope and optimism. Though, the top U.S. diplomat, Antony Blinken, he has been touring, he's been to Ramallah, he's been meeting with the senior Israeli leadership, with the war cabinet. And he has been saying that the truce has been a good process and he would like it to continue.",

Now, they've reported more than 110,000 acute respiratory infections, there is scabies, skin rashes, lice, we could go on and on. Dr. Ghassan Abu- Sittah is a British-Palestinian surgeon who you'll recall, was in Gaza for 43 days after the Israel-Hamas war began. Now, he operated in hospitals across northern Gaza during the Israeli bombardment, working in the most unimaginable conditions. He has since left Gaza and joined Isa in London on Tuesday. She asked him to describe what it was like, and we do want to warn you some of the details that you're about to hear are upsetting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GHASSAN ABU-SITTAH, BRITISH-PALESTINIAN SURGEON:  I'd had 30 years of experience in countless wars. And for me, the description is, they were a flood, and what I went through this war, it was like a tsunami. The sense that every day was worse than the day before in terms of the resources and the way they were dwindling, and the mountain number of wounded. Closer, by the end, 35,000. And as a parent, the just -- the sheer number of children, 45 percent. There were days when half of my list was children. And so, you're having to do more with less, day-in-day-out. Towards the end, when I was at the hospital, we were the only hospital functioning in Gaza city. We only had two operating rooms, we had over 500 wounded. Half of the work we did, we did procedures without anesthetic because we were running out of anesthetic procedures, and it just became just barbaric in terms of what we were having to perform, because we had to -- we had to do debridement and cleaning of wounds because they were getting infected, because we couldn't take them to the operating room. But we didn't have any morphine and we no longer had ketamine, which is a kind of anesthetic. And so, it just felt every day, you are sinking further and further.",

Just tell our viewers what you saw when it comes to children's injuries, and what -- how that's going to change so many lives? ABU-SITTAH:  So around 40 percent to 50 percent of my operating load was on kids, and these kids had horrendous injuries. Some of them had really disfiguring facial injuries. Many had amputations. I had done six amputations on children in one single day. All of these injuries are life- changing.

I think it really took the administration to intercede. And I think it's important that the president has the obvious impact also of creating some space and time for humanitarian pauses and perhaps to provide a pathway for more extended humanitarian corridors. I don't think we're talking about a cease-fire; I think that would be a tremendous victory for Hamas and a defeat for Israel and for the United States. So I think it is possible, since it's in the interest of both Hamas and the Israelis for now, to keep this hostage for prisoner channel alive. How long it can go is unclear. There are 160 hostages that Hamas still has, 30-40 IDF troops, adult civilians and women and children, I still believe, remain to be returned. So you could have another day, two or three of this.

Number one, you're going to have to not attack locations where there are densely populated civilians. And number two, you're going to have to allow for the continued surging of humanitarian assistance for the roughly half to two-thirds of Gazans who are now displaced from their homes, many of whom are now in the location where the Israelis intend to operate. So I think it's very fraught but I think it's important the administration had the Israelis' back for the last 54 days.

The problem is, right now, once Hamas returns all thewomen and children that they control, you are now into the prospects of returning Israeli soldiers. It seemed to me that the price for doing that is going to be exorbitant as far as the Israelis are concerned. Hamas is going to demand a certain kind of Palestinian prisoner, prisoners probably with blood on their hands. And they're going to demand an asymmetrical exchange. It won't be 3:1; it could be 10:1. And even if Hamas agrees to participate in returning some of the hostages, they are not going to return them all. They continue to be an insurance policy, in an effort to constrain, in fact delay in the hopes that, the longer they keep hostages, the more pressure the Netanyahu government will be under from the families of those hostages that are not returned.

He also holds the record, by the way, for the longest time spent abroad in diplomatic work, 33 days, to negotiate that Israeli-Syrian accord. But the Tunis engagement agreements, the embrace of Sadat literally led to creating the foundation that -- what would become the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. So a lot of credit and certainly in the Middle East, for Kissinger's diplomacy. He was persistent, he was smart, he was devious and he took advantage of trauma to turn it into hope.
