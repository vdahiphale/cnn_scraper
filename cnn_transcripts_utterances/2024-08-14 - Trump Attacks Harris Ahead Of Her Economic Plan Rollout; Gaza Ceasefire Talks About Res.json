      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, one of the things that Donald Trump sought out to do and his team sought out to do was to point to the fact that Americans who are still feeling some crunch with their wallet in terms of paying for gas, paying for groceries because of inflation, that they were reminded of inflation rates when he was in office, as well as interest rates, et cetera.Now, the reason why Donald Trump's team wanted to do this is for a couple of different reasons. One of them being the fact that they believe Donald Trump can still win in November, but that he has to focus on several issues in particular, one of them being the economy, the others being immigration and crime. And obviously, as we have seen, Donald Trump has had a hard time focusing on any of these issues since Kamala Harris became the top of the Democratic ticket. So, one of the reasons they did this event exactly was not only to talk about the economy, but also to link Kamala Harris to Joe Biden's policies. Remember, they're looking at these policies on immigration, on the economy, and they're looking at polling that showed that when Joe Biden was at the top of the ticket, that Trump polled ahead of him on these issues. So, they now want to link Harris to those same policies and say that those are her policies as well, hoping that Trump will poll ahead of Harris on those issues. Now, did he stay on message? Somewhat, yes. Here's what he said about the economy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Does anyone here feel richer under Kamala Harris than Crooked Joe than you were? During the Trump administration, is anything less expensive under Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe? Kamala has declared that tackling inflation will be a day one priority. Just think of it, for her, but day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago. Why hasn't she done it? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Clearly, it is getting to him that Kamala Harris has signed on to that no taxes on tips policy.I mean, here's the reality of what Trump did today, Wolf, which is sort of, you know, pre-butt what we are going to get from Kamala Harris on Friday when she is in that very same now very clear battleground state, North Carolina. Republicans thought they had really taken that off the map. With Kamala Harris back on the ticket, that has snapped back into battleground status in a pretty substantial way. Just look at the visits from the candidates and the money being spent. So, he's trying to pre-butt that a little bit and to lean into an issue where he has an advantage right now. And there was a new A.P. poll today that shows him with a seven percentage point advantage, 45 percent to 38 percent, over Harris about who can better handle the economy. Now, that's a better deficit for Harris than it was with Joe Biden on the issue of the economy. But, clearly, issue number one for voters is still an advantage category for Donald Trump.",

It's the economy and it's immigration. And all of it has to be tied back to Biden. I know we talked about Biden a lot today. He has to continue to do that because people cannot allow Harris to run as a disconnected figure. They can't believe that she just fell out of a coconut tree, as it were, and has nothing to do with Joe Biden, his policies, his results, because she is his number two. She has been billed as an influential adviser and policymaker in this administration.So, there has to be some Biden in this campaign. The less Biden there is, the better off she's going to be. That's why Trump's got to keep bringing it up. So, more economy is good, veering off is bad, but I think today was a step in the right direction.",

She does have a deficit in some states that are key to win.But what I do think is interesting, both North Carolina and Arizona are similar in that they're battlegrounds where the Republican is favored, but they have unpopular candidates on the ticket. So, to the point that Mark Robinson could actually help Democrats in North Carolina, Kari Lake could do the same in Arizona by turning out people who see her as polarizing and extremist.

And the complaint is that they don't feel that there's enough pressure on Netanyahu to sign on the dotted line. I know there isn't an actual dotted line and it's not going to happen that quickly, but they feel that there's not enough pressure on Israel to do the deal. And they're also, of course, pointing to the fact that the U.S. has just, you know, announced $20 billion more military aid to Israel, and they feel that does not look good when it comes to how the parties come to the negotiating table tomorrow in Doha. This looks like a make-or-break moment. It will hopefully make something positive, and it can defer any retaliation, but I always worry about the break of civility, that if these don't lead to positive momentum, that we could find ourselves looking again at some kind of escalation.

What we're seeing amongst working class Americans, what we're seeing amongst union groups is a very strong resonance with Harris, with Walz. I think that because she's able to tell her story of somebody who worked a low wage job, because you have Walz who served in the military, then took a low wage job in becoming a teacher and then a principal.These are people who understand, you know, what the cost of the pump is. These are people who understand what it means to actually pay attention to the price tag when you go to the grocery store. They are able to have this conversation a much different way than Donald J. Trump is. And I think that, you know, for this campaign, they've been very strategic about how they have shifted the narrative and the language because I think that what we heard a few moments ago, it is actually right. This is not in people's heads. They understand that the cost of things has risen. But I also think that they are looking forward to what actual plans can happen that can reduce those to make things more affordable. And that's what matters the most. So, this policy plan and agenda that Kamala Harris is laying out, I think, is really touching people. But more importantly, she is reaching working class people where they are, and they are a key element of her campaign.",
