Prosecutors were at least getting to the very heart of the matter, the $130,000 payment to adult film actress, Remy Daniels, and of course, the disguised reimbursement to Cohen. Wolf.",

Cohen also testified, and I'm quoting him now, Trump wasn't thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign. And Cohen added this, don't worry. Trump goes on to say. How long do you think I'll be on the market for? Not long, close quote. Let's go to CNN's Ellie Honig. He's over at the magic wall for us.

      "sentences": "Yeah Wolf, a remarkable morning of testimony from Michael Cohen, finally facing his former client, Donald Trump, face to face in the courtroom. A couple of things that prosecutors tried to do with Michael Cohen throughout his testimony. First of all, they've corroborated him at every possible instance. Any time possible, prosecutors have pointed to phone records, to text messages, to back up the story that Michael Cohen is telling to the jury. The other tactic that we saw prosecutors doing throughout the morning was fronting the bad stuff for Michael Cohen, getting it out there for the jury from the prosecution side. For example, at one point, the DA asked Michael Cohen, would you sometimes lie for Trump? And Michael Cohen said, yes, ma'am, I would. Now, Michael Cohen took the jury through his early days with Donald Trump, how he first came to Trump's attention, and he did things like renegotiating invoices, meaning refused to pay them for the most part, dealing with media relations, calling people to try to get more favorable news coverage, and then helping Donald Trump with his early on political ambitions.You hear Michael Cohen called the fixer. Well, this all is why. Now, there was a very important moment when Donald Trump decides he's going to run for president in 2015. And Michael Cohen testified that Donald Trump warned him at this point. Really important piece of testimony. Donald Trump said to Michael Cohen, according to Cohen's testimony, you know that when this comes out, meaning the announcement that he's running for office, just be prepared, there's going to be a lot of women coming forward. And in the wake of that statement, there's this really important meeting, August 2015, and we heard about this before from a prior witness, David Pecker, from the National Enquirer. Now we've heard about the same thing from Michael Cohen. Cohen said there was a meeting with the four of us where we discussed the fact that David Pecker and I, Michael Cohen, we'd be on the lookout for damaging stories about Donald Trump, try to make him go away. Now, to that end, Michael Cohen has walked the jury through three separate catch and kill schemes, one relating to a doorman, the second one relating to Karen McDougal. And now when we left off, Michael Cohen's right in the middle of talking about the Stormy Daniels payoff, which of course is the crux of the crime here. Now, there was a really important audio recording that the jury heard today of a conversation that Michael Cohen recorded between him and Donald Trump back in 2016 when they were talking about the Karen McDougal payoffs. Let's take a listen to that because it's a really important piece of evidence. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

And finally, Wolf, Cohen testified that Trump said it at the time, I want you to just push it out as long as you can, just get it past the election, because if I win, it will have no relevance because when I'm president, and if I lose, I don't even care. And this goes to the central point, Wolf, that the prosecution has been making throughout, that Donald Trump's concern here was first and foremost with the campaign. So Michael Cohen left off his testimony at a really important point, and he will resume about 10 minutes from now. Wolf, back to you. We'll kick it around at the desk.",

They're expected to call a few witnesses, but this is how they're going to make their case on behalf of their client. They're going to try to paint Michael Cohen as a liar who is out for revenge against his former boss. And they plan to do that not so much by even focusing on his criminal record, but instead through a multimedia presentation using clips from his podcast, excerpts from his book and his many, many, many interviews over the past six years where he has pretty much exclusively just attacked the defendant. That is his brand. So that is going to be a large portion of the cross examination. And it's a challenge for Todd Blanche because, of course, he wants to go at Michael Cohen. But you have to be careful. You don't want to go at him so hard that you throw sympathy to Michael Cohen. So this is a huge test. But this is effectively this will be the defense's case, which is why you haven't seen Todd Blanche do many cross examinations. He has been almost exclusively focused on Michael Cohen.",

That he said he felt on top of the world when he got praised. Now, that might counter to the idea of who he maybe eventually became after all of this. But there are all people in the courtroom right now, politicians who are hoping to be Trump pleasers as well, who are making their presence known.

These are people who want to show Donald Trump that they are loyal to him, because as we have heard Michael Cohen say, and as we have heard time and time again throughout this testimony, the most important thing to Donald Trump is actually having loyalty. Now, one of the things I do want to point out is that Trump had told some members of his team that he was upset that there were not more people there to support him. Also, not more people there protesting on his behalf in front of the actual courthouse. Part of the reason that they ended up kind of making these campaign stops to various areas in New York, trying to show there's all these people here supporting him.(CROSSTALK)",

Michael Cohen is going to put that into a shell company, this Essential Consultants LLC, and then that money is going to go over to Stormy Daniels. After this, they're going to get into really the heart of the charge here, which is the reimbursement mechanism, where basically Michael Cohen and Allen Weisselberg, and Cohen will surely testify Donald Trump, come up with this plan to repay Michael Cohen $420,000 to cover that $130,000, to cover his taxes on it, and to cover a bonus and a couple other smaller transactions. So this is the heart of the matter. They're trying to show documents. They're trying to tie it to other testimony that they heard from Gary Farrow. The other important thing that they're doing here, Wolf, and I just talked about this a moment ago, is they're fronting the bad stuff. And so they asked Michael Cohen straight up, did you lie on these bank documents? Yes, he did. He said, well, I wasn't going to write hush money. I just wrote, you know, vehicle to receive property rights or something like that. So every time that Michael Cohen lied, they need to front that.
