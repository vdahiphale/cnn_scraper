Basically, stay in place and stay there until it's time for you to take off.But, of course, we know that the coast guard plane was actually right in the path of the Japan airliner as it was landing. When the two planes hit there was that massive fireball. And, of course, we know what happened yet. At least five of the coast guard crew members were killed and everybody onboard the plane was able to evacuate with just seconds to spare. But the crucial question, did the coast guard pilot not know where he was or did air traffic control not know the actual location of the plane when they said to hold point. And why did none of the three pilots in the cockpit of the Japanese airliner not see that there was a plane in the runway, right in their path, and abort the landing? They have not found the cockpit voice recorder for the commercial plane. It's still sitting right there in the middle of the runway. A pile of medal and plastic. They have located the cockpit voice recorder for the coast guard aircraft. So, those are going to be the crucial questions as they search for more answers as to how all of this happened.",

And, oh, by the way, Hezbollah and Lebanese officials, this was not directed at you or a wider conflict. DAN SENOR, HOST, \"CALL ME BACK\" PODCAST: Yes. So. I think this operation, whoever did it, accomplished many things. One, Israel has made clear that one of its objectives is going after the senior Hamas leadership. He is among the most senior. Under Sinwar, Salah was one of the most senior officials. He was involved with planning October 7th. He's been responsible for many of the terrorist operations against Israel over the years. He himself served in an Israeli prison. And Israel has said for some time that Hamas can't do this on its own. That it is in coordination with Tehran and with Hezbollah and with the Houthis and with all these proxies around the region. And, sure enough, that was one of his responsibilities, was staying close to Hezbollah and staying close to Iran. So, getting one of these official outside of the Gaza, you know, war theater of operations and getting one that has such close ties to other actors in the regional I think sends a message. Even though Israel is saying, we're not going after you, proxies, and you, Iran. We're making it clear, we are going after the Hamas officials that are close to you. And I think most importantly it further isolates Sinwar. Sinwar is the ultimate leader, the ultimate architect in Gaza and I think they're trying to isolate him. They're trying to sow a lot of confusion. And if his senior commanders are getting taken out, whether in Gaza or around the region, it makes it harder for him to operate.",

Security Council resolution that was very critical of Israel, which really wigged out the Israeli leadership. There were many times President Obama and his team around him were very critical of Israel out in the open. And what the Biden administration's lesson from that is, is we have difference with the Israelis, but Israeli's an ally, Israel's a friend, Israel's a friend under siege.

You go to October of 2019, 66 percent. Now we're down to just 62 percent. So, we're seeing fewer people go off to college, perhaps because they're having less confidence in it. And on this very important question, would you say that collegeeducation is more of a gamble that may not pay off or a smart investment in the future? Back in 2016, 55 percent, it was a smart investment in the future. Now it's just 42 percent. More of a gamble that might not pay off, 43 percent. Now, 56 percent of Americans believe it's a gamble that might not pay off, guys.",
