We know the gun was in the backpack. But Lieutenant Willis just produced a piece of evidence for the jury, the journal of Ethan Crumbley. And, Kate, we had thought this journal was always in his bedroom, door shut, parents didn't know about it. Well, the journal was in his backpack, 22 pages. He talks about mass shootings, what he's going to do, all of his research on this. And he really researched this mass shooting he was going to commit.

This is the resistible force versus the movable object and it doesn't really satisfy any voter except for the core parts of those bases that are fully behind Biden and Trump, which is not where most voters are.The problem is for Haley, she is running out of some runway here and it's -- and it's an argument that within the Republican Party is not gaining a lot of traction because if a Ron DeSantis leaves the campaign, most of Ron DeSantis's supporters overwhelmingly go to Trump, and so on and so forth.

This was a negotiation between the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Ron Wyden, and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Jason Smith. And that means that the top Republican on the Finance Committee, Mike Crapo, has some concerned about this bill as well. There are some issues with work requirements that Republicans in the Senate are worried about. There is this issue about the expansion of the child tax credit that would mostly affect lower income Americans, John, that a lot of Republicans are saying could help the president in his re- election because, yes, you are giving checks to people who, you know, may or may not look at that as a reason to vote for you in your election.So, obviously, Chuck Grassley putting it very clearly there.
