The incident here has become so high profile, and there's a lot of sensitivity around it. The mayor here in East Palestine basically says look, we need this stuff taken care of. And these are facilities that can do it. And they are hoping that they can help the people here in East Palestine get rid of that stuff.That said, a lot of this waste is already moving out. The administrator for the EPA is saying that they are working through a process now to develop a full plan with Norfolk Southern that will take some time, some weeks before they will be able to finish that plan, so then they can know the enormity of the cleanup they have.

And I think people will slowly start to build confidence again. But it's going to take -- it's going to take some -- a while. People -- you know, it was such a shock to have that explosion in town, the fire afterwards to the venting of all these chemicals and then seeing sort of the dead wildlife that happened immediately after. And I think it's just going to take a long while. The administrator of the EPA meeting with business owners, students, teachers today really trying to reach out into the community now and assure people that they are on the right path.

And you can take a look at these chemicals.The third one is the one that the researchers have really zeroed in on, Acrolein. This is a chemical that is used to kill -- to kill animals, to keep certain plants from growing and spreading. It's toxic. And they're concerned about the levels of that, that it could -- and I emphasize the word could, could lead to health problems. Now, if this all sounds kind of murky, it's because it is. It is very hard to predict based on sort of what you're measuring what's going to happen in the future. So, here is what the EPA has to say. The EPA gave us a statement that said the long-term risks referenced by this analysis, meaning the ones by the folks at Carnegie Mellon and Texas A&amp;M, assume a lifetime of exposure, which is constant exposure for approximately 70 years. EPA does not anticipate levels of these chemicals will stay high for anywhere near that. So, in other words, the EPA is saying, look, whatever they are now we're trying to -- you know, that will dissipate. And we're trying to help those levels go down and for the chemicals to dissipate and so, people aren't going to be breathing this in for 70 years. But how long will they be breathing it in?

TikTok is responding for its part -- its part calling it a political theater saying \"we hope that when it comes to addressing national security concerns about TikTok beyond government devices, Congress will explore solutions that won't have the effect of censoring the voices of millions of Americans.\" Now, Canada, as well as the European parliament have followed through with similar measures to the one in the U.S., banning TikTok from their government devices. Now, there is a broader question here, which is how does the United States address the broader national security concern that multiple top U.S. officials, including the CIA director, have warned that this app is a national security threat? And that's because, of course, government phones represent just a small tiny share of the millions of users here in the United States who have TikTok on their phones. What we do know is that the senator for foreign investment in the United States, CFIUS, they have been working on a deal for the last several years that could potentially allow Chinese ownership to spin off TikTok or impose some more strict limits.

But if they lose, it sets a new standard for how we police misinformation on television.If they lose, many cable networks, not just Fox, but all of them are going to be held to a new standard when it comes to libel, defamation, and what they spew on air, particularly as it comes to the elections. And that's important if you think about timing. The trial is this April. That's right around the time where you're going to start to see some more candidates announced for the 2024 election start to think about putting together a candidacy. It's going to have a major impact on what's next for our election system and for the news media in America.",

I mean, it really is troubling that Fox News now, even though we suspect that it has shown in this sense to be an arm of the Republican Party giving away secrets to the Trump campaign to help them against Biden. But there doesn't seem to be any civil liability there.And remember, the bar for defamation is still so high. You have to show smoking guns. And that's not enough because that's not defamation. That's just unethical conduct. And because of that, I think in the court of public opinion, they are going to be hurt. But in a court of law, those -- they just won't be affected by this. All in all, though, still not a good day for Fox News's reputation.",
