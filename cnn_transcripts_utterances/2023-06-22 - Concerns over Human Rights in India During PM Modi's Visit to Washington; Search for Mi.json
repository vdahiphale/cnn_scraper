The leaders are meeting at the White House this hour and will address the media a little bit later on. In opening remarks President Biden praised the two countries cooperation on tackling key issues.

But I think President Biden said it himself in his opening remarks earlier today, the U.S./India relationship will be one of the defining relationships of the 21st century. And in his view, really, there is no major issue confronting the globe whether it's China, whether it's climate change, whether it's Russia, that isn't going to require some sort of buy in from India, the world's most populous country, its most populous democracy, and so I think that is a sort of his rationale for laying out this red carpet visit for Modi today. And you saw it on the South Lawn packed with people the way it has said there were 7000 people on the South Lawn today, and it's raining. So it's a significant number of people. There's the red carpet, there's the marching troops. This is the highest level of American diplomacy that can be extended to any world leader. But at the same time, I don't think you're necessarily going to see President Biden shy away from this issue of human rights. In fact, he really could not do that and really maintain any sort of credibility, particularly among Democrats in his own party.

What is also crucial Zain is the update that we received not too far from here from Canadian Forces face Greenwood. They are the ones that are in charge of those P3 auroras.

Because I think climate change is something that transcends any particular momentary issues. It's a problem that humanity has got to deal with over the next several decades, in a serious way. I do think that it is appropriate for the President of the United States where he or she can to uphold those principles and to challenge whether behind closed doors or in public trends that are troubling. And so, I'm less concerned about labels than I'm concerned about specific practices. You know, I think it is important for the President of the United States to say that if you have Uyghurs in China, who are being placed in mass camps, and \"re-educated\", that's a problem. That's a challenge to all of us. And we have to pay attention to it. I think it is true that if the President meets with Prime Minister Modi, then the protection of the Muslim minority in a majority Hindu India, that's something worth mentioning. Because, and by the way, if I had a conversation with Prime Minister Modi, who I know well, part of my argument would be that if you do not protect the rights of ethnic minorities in India, then there is a strong possibility India at some point, starts pulling apart. And we've seen what happens when you start getting those kinds of large internal conflicts, so that would be contrary to the interests not just a Muslim, India, but also Hindu India. So I think it's important to be able to talk about these things honestly. You're never going to have, things are never going to be as clean as you'd like, because the world is complicated.

Taiwan's defense ministry says a Chinese aircraft carrier sailed through the area Wednesday,remaining west of the median line dividing Mainland China and Taiwan. Taiwan is to develop forces to respond to the situation. The U.S. says on Tuesday, one of its coast guard ships conducted a routine transit through the Taiwan Strait. Tensions come amid concerns China could consider invading Taiwan. Possibility Taiwan's military is preparing for. CNN's Jim Sciutto has more in this exclusive report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Commanders of a Taiwanese mechanized infantry combat team lay out their battle plan. Today's mission, defending the Penghu Islands situated right in the middle of the Taiwan Strait from a Chinese paratrooper assault. In rapid succession infantry units storm a captured airfield. A column of tanks quickly follows. This maneuver is just a training exercise, but with a very serious goal of readying these forces to defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion. COL. CHANG CHI-MING, TAIWAN CHIEF OF OPERATIONS, FIRST COMBAT ZONE: In the event of a paratrooper assault on the Hmong airbase, our troops will be able to respond instantly and defend the territory. SCIUTTO (voice over): Exercises like this one are almost daily events on Taiwan's Penghu Islands. Less than 100 miles from Mainland China, they are a first line of defense for Taiwan against a Chinese invasion, home to Taiwanese Army, Air Force and naval bases. And not all operations for these forces are simulations. In fact, as I visited Penghu, four PLA Air Force fighter jets entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone. Taiwanese Air Force fighters from a gong airbase scrambled to respond. Before they fly, they are armed with live ammunition for combat. Lieutenant Colonel Bi Shi Quan -- big commands the coyote Squadron. LT. COL. BI SHI QUAN, TAIWAN AIR FORCE: Sometimes its reconnaissance, sometimes it is training. Other we're performing combat readiness missions here, the training has never stopped.",
