It's Friday, December the 6th, 8 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in New York.A flirtatious moment captured on a security camera may have given police a huge clue in their search for the killer of a healthcare CEO in New York. This image shows a man police are calling a person of interest, smiling at a female employee at a hostel that he stayed at before Wednesday's attack. A law enforcement source tells us that whilst he chatted with the clerk, she asked him to lower his face mask. The man reportedly paid in cash and used a fake ID, so it's still unclear exactly who he is. This new video shows him just blocks away from the scene, apparently walking to the site where he would carry out his attack. The CEO of UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, was gunned down on a sidewalk as he was headed to an investor conference. We have a video of the incident, but we warn you, it is graphic. Police say the gunman waited for Thompson before shooting him point blank in what they describe as a well-planned attack. A law enforcement source also told us the suspect arrived in New York on a bus that came from Atlanta. After the shooting, he fled the scene on an electric bike. Shimon Prokupecz tracked his next steps. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): The suspect entered Central Park here after the brazen early morning killing. We now know that police have reviewed footage of what appears to be the gunman exiting the park nearby on West 77th Street. And this new video obtained by CNN shows a person police believe to be the gunman riding westbound on West 85th Street.",

PROKUPECZ (voice-over): Police say employees at the hostel say the man almost never lowered his mask or hood. And a law enforcement official tells CNN the shooter used a fake New Jersey ID to check in a full five days before the murder. Another new piece of evidence, this video time stamped at 6:15 a.m. shows the suspected gunman leaving the 57th Street subway station just three blocks from the scene of the crime. 30 minutes later, Thompson would be fatally shot. Then there's the words delay and depose found on a live round and a shell casing at the scene. Are they signs of a motive? Police now exploring whether they are a reference to a derogatory phrase leveled at the insurance industry for denying claims. Investigators also have a water bottle from the shooter left behind at the scene. CNN learned earlier today that it yielded a single smudged fingerprint. Shimon Prokupecz, CNN, New York.

Second, I believe just from what I've listened to from news media reports and internet reports, I believe that this man had his schedule. I think this man knew his movements. And I think he posted up what five, 10 minutes before he walked out of that other hotel and walked around the corner and was in front of the Hilton. You know, I think that that's important.

MARSH (voice-over): House Speaker Johnson setting expectations for the meeting. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: This is a brainstorming session. MARSH (voice-over): Musk and biotech entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Ramaswamy have been vocal on social media about where the government waste is. VIVEK RAMASWAMY, TRUMP'S PICK TO LEAD DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY: There's a lot lower hanging fruit in terms of waste, fraud abuse, error, program integrity failures that you got to go after first. MARSH (voice-over): But Thursday was their first real strategy session with Republican lawmakers about where to start and how to cut Musk's goal of $2 trillion in spending, something budget experts across the political spectrum say is virtually impossible. Seventy percent of federal government spending, not including interest, consists of payments to Americans for programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and more. If those programs are spared, experts expect dramatic cuts to programs like food stamps, home heating assistance, housing aid, food safety inspections, and infrastructure.",

His attorney calls the allegations outlandish.Senior White House aides and Biden administration officials are reportedly discussing preemptive pardons for people who may be targeted by Trump after he takes office. According to multiple sources, there's been debate for weeks now over the use of pardons, even for people who haven't been formally accused of any crimes yet. One source says Trump's legal advisers believe Biden would be setting a new precedent with preemptive pardons, which the Trump team could take advantage of later on to help their own allies. Trump has publicly called for jailing people such as former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney and special counsel Jack Smith, who brought federal criminal cases against him. The president-elect accepted Fox Nation's Picture of the Year award in New York on Thursday night. During his speech, Trump detailed recent conversations with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, suggesting that his proposed 25 percent tariff on both countries is just the beginning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL-ELECT: I spoke with Canada and Justin came flying right in because we talked about 25 percent tariffs. That's just the beginning. I spoke the other day to the president, the new president of Mexico, very nice woman, and we had a very nice conversation, but she said, why are you doing this to me? I said, I'm not. I'm just putting a lot of tariffs on because you're allowing criminals to pour into our country and we can't allow that anymore. And it stopped. It stopped. It was so fast. It stopped.

But look, this is a clear indication that Yoon's own party is now prepared to impeach him. If you remember yesterday, they were against the vote and quite unified in that decision. But look, Yoon's approval ratings are just through the floor. They're at their lowest point, 13 percent. Polls found that 70 percent of South Koreans think that he should be impeached. We're also learning that national police have launched an investigation into Yoon and the former defense minister who encouraged Yoon to declare martial law. Look, there are labor unions on strike. Many people are expected to take to the streets tonight and over the course of the weekend to put pressure on Yoon to resign, or for at least the National Assembly to impeach him -- Max.",
