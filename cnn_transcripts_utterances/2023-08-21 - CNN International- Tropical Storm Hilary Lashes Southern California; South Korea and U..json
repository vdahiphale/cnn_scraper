And my estimate or guess is that it's probably going to be below tropical storm intensity. But we've seen tremendous amount of rainfall across this region at a time of year where we barely seen any rainfall in a lot of these areas. Because a lot of these areas across Southern California are desert regions or planes areas. But also those mountains tend to absorb a lot of that moisture. There's orographic lift. And some of these areas have seen in excess of ten inches of rainfall. And it continues to rain.And look at the size of this boulder on this highway with the utility truck next to it. It has really had some huge impacts all across Southern California even into southern Nevada as well. And portions of Arizona have picked up some heavy rainfall. There you can see ten plus inches of rainfall along one of those Transverse Mountain ranges just to the north of Los Angeles. Before it's all said and done there probably will be a foot or maybe just be a little more in some of the regions. Flash flood warnings out now. It looks like they may be discontinued not too long from now. But look at that plume of moisture. It's going to go pretty high into the Great Basin also crossing northern Rocky Mountain region. They need moisture in Spokane. Spokane has a terrible fire taking place there. But I think the moisture is going to stay to the south of that. This is the radar and there you can see some that precipitation making its way even into Montana. But we're not finished with Southern California yet. But we will be. It looks like by the afternoon you will see breaks in the clouds. It looks like the wind will begin to taper off. And it looks like generally a very abrupt transition to some much-improved weather as the remnants of what is now tropical storm Hilary continue to make its way to the north. Back to you guys.",

This is part of this creek bed here, but this type of scarring fire all over this region. The reason why this is so concerning is because this, once the water starts flowing here, potential flash floods, that just unleashes the ability for that water to flow rapidly without any type of obstruction.

Here's what he told CNN earlier about the storm.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEXANDER TARDY, U.S. NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IN SAN DIEGO: This is unusual anytime of the year but certainly an August. It's been a long time since a tropical storm with an actual intensity with wind speeds over 40 miles per hour made landfall in southern California. 1939 was the last time. So we're seeing a lot of unusual activity with the heavy rain and the wind, flooding and in desert areas we're seeing about a year's worth of rain in one day. So especially during the nighttime, in the early morning hours until we can assess how bad the roads are and where the damage is, it's not safe to travel in those areas. We're still seeing windy conditions with gusts 40, 50 miles per hour. We're still seeing some light rain across the area. Some of the mountain slopes in the images that were showing there, received ten inches of rain in the surrounding mountains of Palm Springs. And even down in Palm Springs locations have 3 to 4 inches of rain. That's just way too much rain. So the rivers are going to continue to run high. We're going to find some roads that are damaged tomorrow morning either covered with mud or even eroded from the heavy rain and the runoff. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

There were more than 30 different drills that are expected to take place. Not just live in the field drills, also computer simulations.But they are the sort of exercises that do angered Pyongyang every time they are held. Now we did see from state run media, in Pyongyang, that there was Kim Jong-un, the leader, overseeing what they called a strategic cruise missile launch. They didn't say when it actually took place. But the fact that it was released today on the same day as these trials are starting is really not a surprise. Very little comes out coincidently from North Korea. It's usually fairly heavily coordinated. So what we know at this point is, from the South Korean side, officials say they believe the report from North Korea was actually exaggerated. Pointing out it may not have been what they said it was. But certainly we are expecting to hear more from North Korea as we go forward over the next ten days during these drills. We heard at the end of last week, the intelligence agency here in South Korea saying, they had seen indications of preparations for potentially an ICBM launch -- an intercontinental ballistic missile. They said they've seen vehicle activity around missile production facilities. So they are certainly on alert waiting for some more significant response from North Korea against these drills. North Korea always says that these drills are effectively a dress rehearsal for an invasion. Whereas, the U.S. and South Korea say that they are defensive in nature. Is what they have said in the past at least and that they are needed for readiness. But it is a fact that we are seeing significantly more drills between the U.S. and South Korea over the last year or so. We also heard in South Korean police on Sunday that there had been a hacking attempt for these drills or at least back in February targeting some of the Korean companies and entities that actually were involved in these drills. They say that no military relayed information was taken but they do believe that North Korea was behind that hacking attempt.",

But not only in terms of women's football but women's sports. But here we had two first-time finalists who have become the new benchmark. For so long we've talked about Team USA as the bar for everybody else to match in women's football and the rest of the world has caught up. Sarina Wiegman, the England coach, said afterwards, yes, Spain were just the better side. And they are without a doubt, one of the most talented squads of footballers in the world. We have been talking about the players as individuals. The likes of two-time Ballon d'Or winner, Alexia Putellas. The likes of Irene Paredes. And of course, 19-year-old Salma Paralluelo, who has burst onto the scene very much at this tournament. And we've been talking about them at a club and European level but this is where for the first time at the senior stage they have absolutely ruled at the top of the game. They have gone from winning in under 17 Women's World Cup, to an under 20 Women's World Cup, to now getting their hands on the biggest prize in the space of just 12 months. And they have done it despite all of the unrest and turmoil in their camp. The questions being asked about the manager, Jorge Vilda, and his coaching methods.
