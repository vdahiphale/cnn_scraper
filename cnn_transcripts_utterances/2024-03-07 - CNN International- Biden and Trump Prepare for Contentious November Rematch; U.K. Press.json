These are the voters that they say are potentially gettable for them. They are the voters that they think have been sort of permanently turned off from Donald Trump. And we saw President Biden making an explicit outreach to those voters in his statement on Wednesday, where he said Donald Trump made it clear that he doesn't want Nikki Haley supporters. I want to be clear that there is a place for them in my campaign. Now, for the Biden campaign and the White House, there really is no separating out the events of Super Tuesday and the State of the Union remarks that are coming up for the president Thursday evening. The themes that really animate the president's general election argument are the very themes that we very much expect to see woven throughout his State of the Union address. Now, this is going to be the third State of the Union address that the president has delivered. But it is so important because this will be the last time that he gets this kind of audience and gets to speak in this setting before he faces voters again come November.

Scenes like this playing out in Port-au-Prince Wednesday. Banks looted, with ATMs smashed open, people scrambling to gather whatever they can, several police stations bombed out by powerful gangs who now freely stroll through the streets. The rising anger directed towards Prime Minister Ariel Henry. One gang leader in the capital threatening that if Henry does not step down, it'll mean genocide for the Haitian people. And it is most often the people who pay the price. We were in Haiti just before this recent surge in violence, people venting to us their frustrations, wanting Henry to go, and barricading their neighborhoods to stop would-be gang kidnappers. Perhaps the biggest indicator of dysfunction comes from the top. All of this happening while a major mystery looms. Where exactly is Prime Minister Henry? He was last seen last week signing an agreement in Kenya, securing the deployment of Kenyan police officers to Haiti, expected to arrive any day now. The \"Miami Herald\" says Henry then boarded a flight that went first to the U.S., then on toward Haiti's island neighbor, the Dominican Republic, for an indefinite stopover. But officials in the D.R. blocked his arrival. Instead, Henry's plane went on to Puerto Rico. The \"Miami Herald\" reporting that Henry was mid-flight when the Biden administration asked him to agree to a new transitional government and resign. The White House pushing back on that. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We are definitely not pushing the prime minister to resign. That is not what we're doing. But we have underscored that now is the time to finalize a political accord to help set Haiti on a path to a better future. CULVER (voice-over); Where Henry is now is not clear, nor is the direction of his country, which is increasingly under the tightening grip of gangs. David Culver, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They are doing the work of campaigning for him and we really do see this sort of stepping up ahead of the elections and I think it really goes some way to explaining why we don't see more Russians, even though there were more than expected turning up for Navalny.

But of course his campaigners are trying to find out exactly what happened there. And I think it's important to hammer home the points that Boris Akunin in that piece was making. That if there are two key tools to control the population, on the one hand propaganda, and on the other hand outright repression and intimidation. Where we are seeing the screws really tightening right now is with that blunter instrument, the repression, the intimidation. Because as we are now getting deeper into the third year of this very costly war, the Russian state simply cannot afford to lose control of its population. And I think that's why you see people like Yulia Navalnaya coming out, speaking to the European Parliament, saying the Russian people are your allies.
