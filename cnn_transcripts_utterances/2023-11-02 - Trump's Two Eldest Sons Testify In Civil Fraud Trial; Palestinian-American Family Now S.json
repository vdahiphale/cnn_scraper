They gave him, as a severance, a million dollars, matching up exactly what the fines and penalties were on the criminal case. If that's not a case of hush money payment, I don't know what is.

But also still continue to be worried about the other American citizens that are there.

Whether it was from going hungry because they couldn't get food, becoming dehydrated because there's no access to clean drinking water, not being able to get medicine or fuel or cooking oil to have a hot meal. On top of all these, constant airstrikes. Even in the town of Rafah, where presumably all of the foreign nationals who wish to cross are currently located. I don't think there's a safe space.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): I did not attach that for political purposes. OK? I attached it because, again, we're trying to get back to the principle of fiscal responsibility here. And that was the easiest and largest pile of money that's sitting there for us to be able to pay for this immediate obligation. So we're going to stand for that.

We just walked through what you all are going to vote on later today, House Speaker Mike Johnson choosing to link the Israel funding with the steep cuts to the IRS. And critics have said he's politicizing emergency aid. How do you plan to vote on this issue? REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA): Thanks for having me on, Jessica. I strongly support Israel. I'm voting no on this bill because it's not a bill to support Israel. It's a clumsy political stunt by an amateur speaker who's already in way over his head. The president has dismissed it out of hand with a veto threat. Senator McConnell, Senator Schumer have dismissed out of hand because it's not serious. I mean, for one, even though he talks about fiscal responsibility, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has already been clear that this will increase the federal deficit. This is not even an offset. What it is, is a condition. It is conditioning Israel's security for the first time in American history. And I do not support conditional security aid to Israel. It will establish a dreadful precedent, where every time Israel needs American support, it will be tied to the whims of American domestic politics. It is unserious. But unfortunately, it is part of a broader pattern from this rookie speaker where he is doubling down on MAGA extremism as opposed to a bipartisan path forward for governance. For example, after the horrendous mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine, he has rejected calls for bipartisan gun safety legislation and has offered thoughts and prayers instead. Similarly, he's now playing politics with Israel.",

Of course, they are innocent people and, of course, the Israeli Defense Forces need to uphold the rule of armed conflict.I would add, though, that Hamas should ascribe to the law of armed conflict, which it's, heretofore, refused to do. And that would mean releasing the hostages unconditionally. That would mean making a distinction between combatants and civilians by no longer using Palestinian people as human shields. That would mean Hamas would have to fight the Israeli Defense Forces without incurring devastating civilian casualties. So any calls for IDF to obey the law of conflict, which they are, need to be paired with exhortation to Hamas, which has, heretofore, rejected any international law, to also uphold the law of armed conflict.",

Tuberville said he is not going to back down, despite the growing public pressure. And the first time Republicans taking their anger to the Senate floor and insisting he drop his blockade. He says he will not. Now, there's also concerns that many of these officials are having to do multiple jobs amid this blockade.

A lot of Republicans that I talk to simply don't want to change the Senate rules, want to figure out a way to resolve this with Tommy Tuberville.
