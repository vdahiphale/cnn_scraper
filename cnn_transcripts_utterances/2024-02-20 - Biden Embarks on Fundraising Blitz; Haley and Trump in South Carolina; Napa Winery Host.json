      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, the Biden campaign is really building up a sizable campaign war chest as they are preparing for a very pricey race against what they expect to be there GOP opponent, former President Donald Trump. Those numbers that you ran through, $42 million raised in January alone. And the fact that they are ending the month the $130 million in the bank really are the latest sign that the party's donor class is standing behind President Biden, even as there are deep anxieties about his re- election bid.It all comes as the president is set to depart in just a few hours for a three-day fundraising swing through California. That will include events in Santa Monica, also Los Altos Hills in Silicon Valley, and San Francisco, where he's set to appear at a high-dollar fundraiser with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But it's - and one source has told me that that fundraising swing could bring in as much as $10 million. Really pointing to the power of those high-dollar fundraisers. But the Biden campaign has also been working up to churn out more donations from small dollar grassroots donors. January the campaign announced was actually the campaign's most successful month in fundraising from those small-dollar donors. Just to run through a few of the numbers that they're seeing, they found -- had 422,000 unique donors in the month of January alone, 97 percent of the campaign's donations have been under $200 since the beginning of the campaign, and they also have these reoccurring donors, 158,000 committing to donate each month. Campaign spokesperson, TJ Ducklo, said in a statement, quote, \"this hall will go directly to reaching the voters who will decide this election. That's reason number 355 million that we are confident President Biden and Vice President Harris will win this November.\" That 355 million is a direct jab taken at former President Donald Trump, who will have to pay that amount as a result of that New York civil fraud case. But really former President Trump has also been an animating factor for many of these donors. If you take a look at some of the fundraising appeals that the campaign has done, they brought in nearly $1 million a day in the three days after Trump won the Iowa caucuses. There was another event where the president had gone on to criticize Trump quite forcefully. That brought in $1.6 million. And when you talk to donors, that is really one of the animating factors that is also driving much of their thinking as they are standing behind Biden at this time for what's expected to be a very expensive race.",

So, that is an indication that her message has a broader appeal than just the average Republican voter. It's not uncommon, for instance, to meet people at her rallies, even in South Carolina, who voted for President Biden in 2020.But she's expected to continue to essentially tell voters that she's in it for the long haul. And part of that strategy has been confronting the former president, arguing Trump is too distracted to engage the voters that Republicans will need in a general election. She's also steady on resisting this pressure campaign from the Republican establishment to get out of the race. And then she also has her eyes on Super Tuesday. She has indicated that no matter what happens this weekend, with only five days to go until the South Carolina primary, she's also focused on Super Tuesday states. She has the money to continue to run the race, and then she's also on the ground in those states. She is in places campaigning in Texas, for instance, continuing to make her case to voters, Sara.",

Well, at a hearing last week, Willis testified that she reimbursed Wade for meals and trips.CNN's Zach Cohen is joining us now.

But the problem is, there was no paper trail documenting those payments. That's why the -- my interview with Stan Brody is important because it does corroborate at least part of Fani Willis' testimony that there was no paper trail because she used cash. And Stan Brody remembers when Fani Willis and Nathan Wade visited a winery in Napa Valley in 2023. And when it came time to foot the bill, Fani Willis pulled out $400 roughly in cash from her purse and paid for both her and Wade.Take a listen to what Stan Brody told me when I talked to him about his interaction with Willis and Wade.

So, I mean, you could just look at both of those things and say, who do you think's having the better day?I understand the concern about the polls. You see this actually for both candidates. But essentially, as this campaign heats up, you're going to have to make a choice between two very, very different people in two very different - very -- very different visions for the country and for the world. Donald Trump wakes up every day thinking about himself. He thinks about oppression. He thinks about revenge. He thinks about how to hurt other people. He thinks about how to get back at them.
