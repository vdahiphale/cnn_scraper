John Berman here, in for Anderson.Just moments ago, the Israeli government's full cabinet meeting on a proposed deal with Hamas ended. Again, the cabinet meeting just ended. We do not know what they decided on. According to multiple sources, these are the proposed points of a possible agreement. Hamas would free 50 women and children, mostly children, taken on October 7th. In exchange, Israel would release 150 Palestinians -- three for every one hostage -- and take a four to five-day pause -- Israel would -- in operations in Gaza. Reporting for us tonight, CNN's Alex Marquardt in Washington, Oren Liebermann in Tel Aviv, and Becky Anderson in Doha, in Qatar. Let's get right to Oren Liebermann in Tel Aviv with the very latest.

It is the expectation that this deal was going to be approved, but we don't have that word yet officially from the prime minister's office. I am checking my notifications here and waiting for it to come through, but it has not yet. This was a debate that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was leading as part of the full cabinet. It had already gone through the legal and political process through the war cabinet and then the security cabinet, but it needs the approval of the full cabinet because it involves a release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for a release of Israeli hostages.Netanyahu said, although it was a difficult decision to take a pause in the fighting, it was the right thing to do, urging the full cabinet to give it final approval. But there were some elements of his coalition, some of the far-right members who said they would vote against it. Still, they didn't have the votes to try to scuttle this deal, and that's why the expectation is that it was going to be approved. And we're waiting for a final statement here. It will be welcome news to many of the families who have waited for this moment, some sort of breakthrough that would allow at least some of the 240 or so Israeli hostages held in Gaza to be released -- women and children first. But in speaking to many of these families, they believe that this is a possibility to get to a larger breakthrough and begin the process of releasing more hostages. Crucially, John, as I just said, it is right now women and children. It does not include men. It does not include hostages who were Israeli soldiers.",

They have a very important role as the ones who speak directly with Hamas. They also engage, at the same time, with Egypt and the United States. The US, of course, doesn't deal directly with Hamas because they are a terrorist organization, so we are expecting a statement to come from Qatar. It is a possibility that it comes tomorrow because it is so late in the region. But, John, the US has been central to this process not least because you have American hostages who are involved, some 10 American citizens who are missing, believed to be hostages, a mix of men, women and children. One of the most famous cases is someone who was mentioned by President Biden a few days ago after a phone call with the Emir of Qatar, Abigail Idan, who is a 3-year-old in Hamas custody. She is turning four years old on Friday. So this has been so important for the Biden administration because of those citizens, but also because they have unique leverage with each of these players. And the senior most members of the Biden administration have been intimately involved with every step of this process since October 7th. We've just seen the top White House official for the Middle East, Brett McGurk, return from the Middle East, where he was continuing with talks. The CIA Director Bill Burns has been in the region speaking with Israeli and Qatari counterparts. And then the president himself has also played a significant role on the phone repeatedly with his counterparts from Israel, from Egypt, from Qatar. We heard from the White House earlier today saying that he usually gets updates multiple times a day jumping in where he feels appropriate on a personal level. So this is going to be something that we expect the US to continue to participate in. There -- we do believe that some American citizens will be among this first release of these 50 hostages. Hopefully, it will be more in the days after that. And that this framework -- these conversations will continue. Prime Minister Netanyahu saying two important things today, thanking President Biden for getting a better deal for the Israeli people, but also saying that the fighting will continue after this pause in the fighting. So we do expect those negotiations to continue, as Oren was just touching on. Even if, say, 50 to 70 hostages are released in the coming days, the vast majority of those 236 hostages held by Hamas will still be in Gaza -- John.",

And we won't let it happen because we stand for them.They're innocent. They've just been kidnapped from their house. We lost so much. And I can't help to remember my interview with Anderson, which I screamed there, it's been four days -- four days. And I was so emotional. And I couldn't see a reality when I see here over 40 days after and I'm still on the very same condition. But, you know, this is the reality, and I started to realize that unless I'm going to fight and fight hard, not only me, I mean, everyone beside me, so nothing will happen. This is why we're also putting a lot of push -- pressure on the government and on the cabinet that we actually first met only two days ago. This was the first time that we met them in person and that we really had a chance to talk and to speak our mind in front of them personally and officially. So I just want to hope that it did what it had to do and -- because I think that the family voices are so important, and they need to be heard. They need to be heard.

President Biden, as you mentioned, just landed here in Nantucket moments ago.We are still waiting to get a statement from the White House specifically on the contours of this deal. But it comes as President Biden earlier today had rejected this optimism that a deal would soon be reached and that hostages would soon be returned to their families. Now, the initial contours of this deal are expected to include around 50 people in exchange for a multi-day pause in fighting, four to five days potentially. But one big question going forward is, how many Americans might be part of that deal? The administration has said that there are about 10 unaccounted for Americans since Hamas' attack against Israel on October 7th. One of those Americans, who is believed to be held hostage, is that three- year-old American girl, Abigail Idan, whose parents were killed in that October 7th attack. Administration officials are hopeful that she might be part of this release. And we will see whether any other Americans might be included as well. But this deal comes after weeks of painstaking negotiations, involvement from US officials, including conversations President Biden has had himself trying to prod the negotiations along. As the US has said, they remain committed to not just getting those Americans out, but also more hostages with that number, around 240, believed to be held by Hamas.",

We are looking at Thursday, sometime during Thursday, that this release on, you know, of the hostages and of the prisoners, and the pause will start.

The Israeli intelligence services think that this is partially true, meaning there are some hostages that Hamas really don't know -- doesn't know where they are.But there are many hostages, several dozen, that they know very well where they are. And again, we have to remember, Hamas controls Gaza. So if some gangster family in the city of Rafah, in southern Gaza Strip, is holding a hostage, believe me, Hamas knows about this, and can get to those people. But now the question is when they'll have four-day pause, they can move around Gaza, whether they'll go to those people and tell them, listen, you need to give those hostages because we need to release them.",

We have been reporting that it will be children and women. But I think it was really interesting that he was specifying that it would be children and their mothers. We know of course of multiple cases of children who are being held hostage in Gaza, and who were taken hostage with their mothers as well. And so that may give us some indication of the families that are most likely to get out in this first round of hostage releases over these four days for those 50 different individuals.

Jeremy, thank you very much for your reporting.With me now is Rami Igra, former chief of the hostages and MIA unit of the Mossad. And retired U.S. Army Major General James \"Spider Marks\", a CNN Military Analyst. Rami, let me start with you. You've been skeptical of the possibility of this deal as it was being negotiated now that they have reached a deal. What are your opinions on it? RAMI IGRA, FORMER DIVISION CHIEF OF MOSSAD HOSTAGES &amp; MIA UNIT: Still is -- has been negotiated on the basis that the Hamas wants a ceasefire, Hamas wants to be to be saved from the Israeli military. On the other hand, the Israeli military is determined to eradicate the Hamas. It is not something that we want to do, it's something that we have to do. There is no way that Israel can continue living in any form with Hamas over the border. Now, this thing was reached because of viscerally public opinion and the belief that the moral duty that the government has is such that it is -- it overrides the main objective of this war. And the main objective of this war is to eradicate the Hamas. It is a very, very bad deal for Israel in many, many ways. First of all, militarily, it's not an easy deal. How are they going to restart the war in four or five days? Secondly, we know that the Hamas is going to play all kinds of tricks on the way trying to release less prison -- less kidnap personnel that it has. And on the second hand, it is not an easy deal of the Israeli internal front. Remember there are families that their loved ones are not going to be released. And there are families that have soldiers in the Gaza Strip and they know that fighting in the Gaza Strip in four days' time or in five days' time is going to be a lot more difficult than it is right now.",

Saying that, I don't see the Israeli military doing that if there's any more hostages to be had. And this is where we are, we are at a very difficult situation where this deal is a bad deal. But we have to go through it in order to release our people. And this is our moral obligation. But -- I mean, don't fret. I think at the end of the day, difficult as it might be.

And I can tell you, there were mixed feelings amongst the people we spoke to.I mean, everyone we speak to there has a terrible, tragic story. We spoke to one woman who'd lost her 16-year-old son, who was killed on October the 7th. And to make matters worse, her 13-year-old daughter was grabbed by Hamas militants and taken into Gaza and is being held as a hostage there. She was remarkably optimistic. But now is the time because of this deal in the offing as it was there and it's been approved now, of course, that her daughter would be coming home to her. So she's extremely optimistic and happy at that prospect. And very grateful to the Israeli government, she said for, for making that happen. On the other hand, there were other people there who were less enthused. I spoke to one woman from Kibbutz Be'eri, who was -- she said she was excited about the fact that 50 or more Israelis would be released in this hostage deal. But she was very upset that her own nephew, who's a 38-year-old man was not going to be in that group of abductees who would be released. I mean, you know, men are not people who Hamas have agreed to release as part of this deal. And so glad for the people who are going to get their loved ones released. But, you know, you have to remember that there are so many -- it was 236 people that the Israelis believe are being held hostage insight inside Gaza. We're talking about between 50, 70 maybe 80 at best could be released in this as a result of this deal. At least that's the estimates coming to us from the Israeli government. But that still means a lot of people, unfortunately, are going to be left behind being held by Hamas. And that's very painful. It's a constant trauma for people in Israel.",

They were put in a car and driven to Gaza. And a few meters before the fence, the car stopped. The drivers may have seen an IDF tank and Yarden then alone took the chance and just broke out of the car, opened the door and broke out and started running. The service was shooting at them. And Yarden was carrying Geffen (ph), the three and a half year old baby in her arms. And she understood that she couldn't run fast enough so she gave Geffen (ph) to Allan (ph) and said run. And Allan (ph) took Geffen (ph) and ran. And the last time we saw Yarden was when she was hiding behind the tree right there. And she was actually saving her girl, saving her baby girl and because she knew that Allan (ph) fast enough and she isn't.
