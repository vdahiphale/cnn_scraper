I said: \"What's the matter with dad?\" She said: \"Honey, his employer just told him they were dropping health insurance.\" What that does is deprive a man and a woman of their dignity.

And also doing what Jim Clyburn said on Sunday to Jake that he needs to do more of, and Clyburn is not the only person who is saying that. I mean, the Biden campaign understands full well that the notion of a Biden -- the Biden demographics, the Biden coalition is relying really heavily, or at least did in 2020, on people of color, the black community in particular. And he needs to shore them up. And the Clyburn criticism, which he gave in public, he also said that he told President Biden in a meeting at the White House was that the message is not getting through the MAGA wall. And this was a litany of accomplishments that Biden said that he is responsible for and his team is responsible for that helped the black community. And that's the kind of thing that the Biden campaign people who are allied with him say that he has to do a lot more of, not just dwell on some of the things that they couldn't get done for lots of reasons, but really hit the things that they could get down to try to raise enthusiasm.",

It was a good venue.I'm not going to pay much attention to the protesters or the two people who wanted to scream from the pews there, because that is one way to not curry any favor with the backbone of the Democratic Party, particularly black voters, to stand up and scream like you have no sense in Mother Emanuel, which is a hallowed and sacred ground. So, I do think that the president's response to that is what we know him to be. And there are some people who may be taken aback by the venue that the president chose to do this. This is a very hallowed and sacred ground. Many people don't know about the history of Mother Emanuel, but also the AME Church. Let's talk about that for a moment. The AME Church is one of the most politically active and organized churches and denominations in the entire world. I mean, from the bishops on down, the AME Church mobilizes on a very grassroots level. The church vans are gassed up, but they also allow individuals to come into their places of worship and have meetings such as this and share their vision for the future. And so this, all in all, was an amazing speech. He was able to hit his notes about the role that religion plays. We know who Donald Trump is, so you can cut back on some of that. We know Donald Trump is a loser. You don't really have to tell us that. But the fact that he came to black folk in South Carolina in Mother Emanuel AME Church and said, listen, I want you to hear from my mouth what I have done for you, and that is the only way you can cut through social media and the algorithms that Elon Musk plays with on a daily basis. This has to be the strategy for this administration. And I want to tell you something else. There's another name in that White House who can do just as good, if not better, than Joe Biden when they let her loose and let her go be free and do these same things. And her name is Kamala Harris. And I anticipate both of them being able to do these messages, have this messaging in venues such as this and actually make sure that it's not Donald Trump we're worried about, but the couch doesn't win this election in 2024.",

It was -- he took all of the credit for anything good that happened when Congress were writing the laws. He took credit for funding the HBCUs and making sure that the HBCUs were funded permanently. The other thing I wanted to talk about, I was really -- I was so happy when Biden was campaigning and talking about his son and his commitment to remove -- to find a cure for cancer. And according to the CDC, compared to other races, black and African- Americans are getting and dying from all kinds of cancers. They have the highest death rate for cancer overall. I want him to keep that promise, because everybody, Democrats and Republicans, would hold hands. They would be hand in hand in trying to eradicate this country and other countries of cancer. And there are people that are doing it, that are working, and I wish you would listen and really join efforts with them to eradicate.

It was talking about the White House's accomplishments. But this is certainly an area where advisers and campaign officials see it as a strength for him to connect with the voters directly.
