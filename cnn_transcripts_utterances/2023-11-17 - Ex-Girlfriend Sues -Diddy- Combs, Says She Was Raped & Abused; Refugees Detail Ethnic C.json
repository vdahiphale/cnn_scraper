      "sentences": "This morning, CNN has learned that the NYPD, the New York Police Department, is not actively investigating Hip Hop mogul Sean Combs after an ex-girlfriend accused him of rape, sex trafficking, and years of abuse. R&amp;B singer Cassie Ventura has filed a federal lawsuit against Combs saying he controlled her personal life, forced her to have sex with other men, among other things. Combs' attorney calls the lawsuit baseless and says his client vehemently denies the accusations.CNN's Omar Jimenez is here reporting on this. Omar, what are you hearing?",

And to give you an idea, I'll read part of their statement that for the past six months, Mr. Combs has been subjected to Miss Ventura's persistent demand of $30 million under the threat of writing a damaging book about their relationship, which was unequivocally rejected as blatant blackmail. Despite withdrawing her initial threat, Miss Ventura has now resorted to filing a lawsuit riddled with baseless and outrageous lies aiming to tarnish Mr. Combs' reputation and seeking a payday.Now, she is seeking unspecified monetary damages as part of this. But when you look at just the scope and the breadth of the allegations that are here, she clearly feels that based on what she says happened, she wants Diddy to be held accountable.",

Officials are right now allowing residents of one evacuated town in the south to quickly return home, but only to retrieve belongings before having to get out once again.Meteorologist Derek Van Dam is tracking this one for us. He joins us now. Derek, what are you hearing about the probability of the risk, and you can see what these tremors have done already there in those towns?",

It has dropped portions of the town by upwards of three feet or one meter.You can see that in this imagery below. But it really begs the question. Why in the world would, as magma pushes towards the surface of the earth, actually allow for the ground to drop like that? Well, it turns out that as the magma flows underneath the town of Grindavik, it is actually approaching the surface and stretching the Earth's crust. And as a result, the ground above actually thins. And eventually, we start to get that sinking motion in the ground, known as a ground deformation or a drop by upwards of three feet. And it's just incredible to see that. And what's even more incredible is that satellites have actually been able to detect this from as far away as space. You're looking at a satellite image. This is actually the town of Grindavik here. You can see the street grid there. And that shading of purple indicates anywhere from one meter or more, roughly three feet, of a drop in the ground. This is just absolutely incredible. You line it up, you can see that corridor of magma flowing right under the tunnel Grindavik. They are worried that lava will start to spew out of that particular brock -- breaking the ground, Kate.",
