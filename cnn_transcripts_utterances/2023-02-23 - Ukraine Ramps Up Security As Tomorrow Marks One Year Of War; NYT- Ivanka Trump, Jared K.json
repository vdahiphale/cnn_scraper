There's a U.N. resolution happening to mark this anniversary and to, again, call on Russia to pull out of this territory. But you're absolutely right about the level of speed they need for these weapons and the very different interpretations that Ukraine has versus its allies in the mantra that the allies say, we will be with Ukraine for as long as it takes. Because President Zelenskyy said most recently that, you know, that's wonderful and they're grateful for it. But they want to see this war wrapped up within this year. While Western partners, the NATO alliance are saying they see, perhaps, a much longer war unfolding and that they have to be in for the long haul. There are problems with the production of ammunition on this side. And we hear also now from the frontline militia group, the Wagner Group, on their side as well. But that needs to be ramped up. But what is clear is that, from President Biden on down, from members of the Congress, bipartisan, bicameral, there is huge support, including, of course, in Europe and in this alliance that is formed over the last year.",

Often. when this is -- especially Ivanka Trump, a daughter of a target, would be treated with kid gloves. I don't know if Jack Smith has kid gloves in his closet. And he is just insisting, you come in and talk to the grand jury. She did give some testimony to the January 6th committee, but it was tentative, a lot of I don't recalls. And as Evan was just mentioned, she's got a lot of information. And she was, in fact, as you remember, the person everyone was coming to, please make him stop on January 6th itself, not to mention the weeks before. So, she's got some good evidence to provide. He's saying, you've got to provide it. No special treatment.

I don't think that flies. But that's going to take longer to work through the courts because it's a newer question.
