He got briefed every day as vice president. He's been in the Situation Room. In fact, you know he knew the rules because you said so on page 226. \"President Biden was deeply familiar with the measures taken to safeguard classified documents.\" And Joe Biden told us he knew the rules. Mr. Armstrong said this earlier. Joe Biden was deeply familiar with it. You're exactly right, because he told us, when Jack Smith goes after President Trump, Joe Biden says, how could this happen? What data was in those documents that could compromise sources and methods? It's irresponsible. So Joe Biden knew the rules. He knew the rules. And Joe Biden told us he knew the rules.

But -- and it did not support -- and it supported a criminal prosecution if he were not president. You found there was no evidence to support a criminal prosecution. And the story here is simple. President Biden identified classified documents in his home and other places and told Archives about them. The independent Department of Justice under Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed you, a former Trump political appointee, as special counsel to fully investigate these circumstances and authorized you to prosecute criminal misconduct.
