And that is what the President is going to underscore today by calling back to the January 6th insurrection, and also explaining why the President, the former President Donald Trump, poses a threat to democracy. Now this is an extension of his 2020 bid for the White House where he talks about battling for the soul of the nation. But also going back to his reelection video last year where the first few videos and images were about the January 6th insurrection and his calls for freedom and protection of American democracy. All of this campaign officials say has only become more urgent.In a statement, the deputy campaign manager for the Biden-Harris campaign said the following, quote, the President will make the case directly that democracy and freedom, two powerful ideas that united the 13 colonies and the generations throughout our nation's history have fought and died for remain central to the fight we're in today. As you mentioned there at the start, John, the location of this speech is important. It's against the backdrop of the reference Revolutionary War site of Valley Forge. And the President is going to highlight George Washington and how he willingly gave up power after two terms as president making the contrast to the former President Donald Trump not wanting to accept the 2020 results. He's also going to talk about political violence, and again, the January 6th insurrection ahead of that third anniversary tomorrow. But all of this goes to show that the campaign really sees this as the key priority to going into 2024. It's the President's decision to jumpstart this 2024 election year with these remarks on January 6th, and the threats to democracy. They're also laying the groundwork for the weeks to come releasing a campaign ad in key battleground states on this issue.",

We're told by senior advisors that this closing message comes really in two parts. The first is urging supporters and not to be complacent. They've all seen the poll numbers. And there is a concern among Trump's senior advisors, that because there's such a wide margin that people won't be necessarily motivated to come out in caucus.But those margins only exist if people actually caucus not just talk to pollsters. So they really want to get people out there on caucus day. Now, the other thing that we are told is that this is going to focus really beyond just the primary and into the general, a big topic today. And with him focusing on Biden asking Iowans, are you -- were you better off four years ago, under my administration, particularly when it comes to the economy, than you are now? And if the answer is, yes, then let's skip all this other stuff, put me back in, I'll go back to the White House. And I'll do for you again what I already did. And that's the messaging there. Now, of course, we are going to wait to see if he's going to respond to Biden's arguments that he is a threat to democracy. I will say in the past. He's just tried to turn the tables on this argument saying Biden himself is the threat to democracy. And when it comes to January 6th, as we know, he has embraced the January 6 rioters, he has said that he would pardon some of them as even issue a government apology. So unlikely we're going to see any kind of different reflection there.",

And that is because all of these election systems are different. And there's a lot of questions being asked as to what exactly this means, how exactly this can be done.For example, in Illinois, that filing went to the State Board of Elections. In Massachusetts, it went to the Massachusetts Ballot Law Commission. As we know, in Maine, it was the Secretary of State who made that decision. It was the courts in Colorado. All of this is really gearing up for that Supreme Court having to weigh in, and that is what Trump's team is expecting now. I will tell you, as I've said time and time again, his legal team believes that Trump will be on the ballot in all 50 states. But I have heard recently from allies of Trump's that he has shown some concern that if this goes to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court might actually rule against him to show that they aren't pro-Donald Trump.

I mean, it wasn't too long ago. This is very recent history. And public perception has been warped by people who go on \"Fox News\" who circulate lies on social media, on talk radio.

In fact, Sara, yesterday, I spoke to that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who likes to try to take the lead on messaging.And when I asked her about democracy, and about January 6th, which obviously, she's quite passionate about, she turned the answer to the economy. Listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): What happened on January 6th was, a manifestation of an assault on the personal freedoms that we have because it has assaulted the Congress, the Capitol, the Constitution of the United States.
