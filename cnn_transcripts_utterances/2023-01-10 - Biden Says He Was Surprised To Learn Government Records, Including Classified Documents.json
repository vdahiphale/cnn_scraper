I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there were any government records taken there to that office. But I don't know what is in the documents. My lawyers have not suggested I ask what documents they were. I have turned over the boxes, they have turned over the boxes to the Archives and we are cooperating fully, cooperating fully with the review, in which I hope will be finished soon.

In terms of material, there may be ten documents on the special access programs, but they're finished products which are for clues but not sources and methods. When you compare that against what President Trump held, 60 odd top secret documents, there's a lot more clues there.In terms of control, these were locked in an office that perhaps only Biden and his team had access, to where with Mar-a-Lago, this is a common storage space with boxes that common workers could have access to. In terms of intent, as you've explained, President Trump perhaps might find himself charged with obstruction because he went out of his way to prevent these documents from being retained, which means he had an endgame. It could very possibly be the actions of President Biden's staff but he seems to say he doesn't know about it. Either way, the numbers themselves, the metrics and the clinical evaluation makes it less of a potential hazard for sources and methods, as what we saw in Mar-a-Lago.",

And it is one of the first acts of the speaker, Kevin McCarthy-led House, as we get a clearer picture of what comes next for House Republicans after the brutal speakership battle. Joining me now to discuss, former GOP Congressman and CNN Senior Political Commentator Adam Kinzinger. Nice to see you today, Adam. It is interesting, first of all, most people saw that screen flash for a moment and had a bit of a deja vu and thought, oh no, are we back here again at a long speakership vote? It is not that but this was truly a test today. Before we get into that, though, I am really curious to hear your take on the news of the day, President Biden speaking and addressing from Mexico City that there were classified documents found in a private office. He has not asked his lawyers about what is in it, they handed it over immediately apparently to the Archives and there has already been some preliminary report handed over to the attorney general, Merrick Garland from a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney who is a holdover in Illinois.

And I heard it yesterday and somebody is saying, basically, look, he was vice president at the time, he shouldn't have had access to this material, which is patently false.But there is no excuse for either side on this but I do think former President Trump has a much different case and, again, justice will do nuance, they do nuance far better than politicians do.",

So, that is what is ominous about creating a whole new committee that says anybody that is under investigation, now we are going to get after the investigators.I worry about any kind of a chilling effect this put on the execution of justice. Are we targeting individuals now who are out doing their job? If you believe that there is corruption, for instance, in the DOJ or in government agencies, that is what the oversight committee is for. This seems like an extra layer.

And we already know we have come to think about even in the campaign platforms and looking ahead to even November and let alone beyond, there were conversations about what would happen if Republicans became the majority and the tit-for-tat of removal from committees, as we saw, for other reasons, by Democrats as well. Swalwell was reacting to that today as payback. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA):  They are planning to stake me, Adam Schiff and Ilhan Omar off the committee is and put George Santos, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar back on committees.

That is why you don't have legitimate debates really anymore.I am a little concerned with what happens if now, let's say, I'm on the floor and I go talk to somebody that is politically very different, could be a good story, but in the base, it could be like, why is Adam talking to somebody on the far-left?

The Chinese government is very tightlipped about how many people are dying due to the current COVID surge that's followed the reversal of their zero COVID policy, especially when it comes to deaths in major cities. We are seeing totals that are very, very low if at all showing up.So, what we wanted to do was look at satellite imagery and available open-source material including videos to see if we can establish patterns across the country and we are able to do that. We looked at multiple cities. Eventually we came up with six cities where we could identify funeral homes that had more activity now in terms of vehicles, people outside, compared to the same time last year. We then took videos that were taken inside of those facilities and we could see how crowded they were.",

I just want to underscore a point that you made, Samuel, because, you know, officially, officially, just over 5,200 people in China, according to their numbers, have died since the beginning of the pandemic.And that compares in the United States to just over a million. But just 5,000 they say have passed, but your reporting actually has a very different projection. In fact, it projects by international experts, they put the death toll at the 5,000 number per day.
