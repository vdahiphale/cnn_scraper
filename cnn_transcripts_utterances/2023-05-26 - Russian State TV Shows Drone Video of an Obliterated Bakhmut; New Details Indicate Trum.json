Ukraine accused of striking a vital hub for Putin's military while Russia resorts to pictures of rubble to convince the public to get behind the war.Plus, burning through billions. The Treasury Department warning it only has about $39 billion left in cash as of tonight. Janet Yellen moving the debt ceiling deadline. And an update to a story we first told you about upfront, a $2 million fine, and possible jail time after a Chinese comedian made an innocent joke about the communist party. Is Xi Jinping's crackdown us beginning? Wait until you see tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, an aggressive strike. New video into OUTFRONT showing thick, black smoke rising above what is believed to be the Azovstal steel plant in Russian occupied Mariupol. Officials there say Ukraine hit the city with a long-range missile. Now this is tactical, but also hugely symbolic, in terms of the strike. You'll remember, right? This is where Ukrainian troops during that deadly standoff with Russian forces for weeks last year, the Azovstal steel plant. And now, Mariupol has become an important staging and for Russian forces in southern Ukraine. It's crucial for them is a constant flow of Russian military convoys moving through the city. So Ukrainians strike changes the game for Russia there. And in Russia, state media is right now doing something different and new. I want to show you the drone video they're showing and state TV right now. This drone video is from Bakhmut, and it is the hellscape that Bakhmut is, and we will keep playing it here. I mean look, you watch every night, so you know that this is a hell zone. But in Russia, to show this kind of Russia is quite a different propaganda take, right? This is the part. I mean, they're showing this, complete and utter to see direction. And the reason this is different is you may remember what we saw in Mariupol. You remember when Putin was there back in March to tout victory? Look at this, the buildings that you saw, and what they put out. Look at that, intact, lights on, people living comfortably in apartments. Russia hastily rebuilt and dressed up buildings in that area so that it would look like this was victory, that it was a happy, normal city. People liberated, living their lives. Well, of course it was propaganda, it was a lie. This is the reality of what happened in Mariupol, right? There was incredible destruction there. But the question tonight is, why are Russians now being shown Bakhmut, the hellscape of war. It is unclear, but that drone footage is airing, as a nuclear saber- rattling is getting louder now. Just listen to this Russian propagandist. He is suggesting that Putin has no choice but to use nukes in order to get President Biden to take his threat seriously. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSSIAN PROPAGANDIST (through translator): He said Russia won't do anything. RUSSIAN PROPAGANDIST (through translator): Yes, that's true. RUSSIAN PROPAGANDIST (through translator): Which means that they have doubt that we will do anything. So, we need to smash them with nukes.

And says nuclear apocalypse. But the key caveat there was that Russia will only preemptively strike if the U.S. provide Ukraine with nuclear weapons, which is obviously not on the table.

CNN got rare access to a key component in Ukraine's air defense, the German made Gepard anti-aircraft system, known as the Shahed killer. Time is essential, radar operator Oleh tells me. There maybe 3 to 4 targets, and we need to destroy them one by one. The computer system makes it as easy as possible for the gunner to succeed. Ukrainian forces gave us this, what they share, shows the Gepard destroying several Iranian made drones, in this one even shooting down a cruise missile late last year. It's part of Ukraine's increasingly affective, mostly Western supplied layered, short, medium, and large range air defense. Including the U.S. made Patriots, they both Washington and Kyiv say have managed even take on the feared Russian Kinzhal hypersonic missiles that can travel ten times the speed of sound, and which Putin claimed were invincible. The commander of Ukraine's joint forces tells me system supplied by the U.S. and its allies are making all the difference. We have the means that can fight Kinzhal and ballistic missiles, as well as cruise missiles and strikes, he tells me, and the percentage is constantly increasing, now the efficiency is over 80 percent. And as Ukraine's army gears up for large-scale counteroffensive, strong protection against it from the skies will be crucial. The company and say they fully understand the effective air defense will be critical to the upcoming counteroffensive, not to do to protect critical infrastructure and ammunition dumps, but to defend advancing forces as well. The enemy will throw all available forces to reduce the combat potential of our offensive, the general tells me. The success during the advance and liberation of Ukrainian territory will depend on high quality or defense. And civilian lives on the ground depend on it as well, to prevent attacks like in Dnipro where once again so many were harmed. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He certainly someone who can make mistakes, communicate serious mistake and launching this invasion and expecting a rapid victory. And that clearly didn't happen. He has found himself in a war that was for more difficult than he has anticipated.But I think at the same time, I think we need to not underestimate Putin. He has adjusted since the initial phase of this war went so poorly, and he has adopted, essentially, a strategy of attrition, where he's hoping slowly to grind down Ukraine's resources, to use of its manpower, use a pit stop of munitions, and exhaust the West political patience with this war. And right now I think Putin thinks who's winning, but the strategy is working overtime. So we need to be careful about underestimating him as well. He's clearly not someone who has a low level intelligence. I think if anything, the danger with Putin is that he has been in the presidency for so long, and a so deeply familiar with a wide range of issues that he's not very receptive to advice from his advisers, from people who might challenge him, and force him to examine some of his assumptions.

The number of these lobbyists feel as if they're being squeezed. Now, other lobbyist say, look, the code of the lobbyist, if you shut up and contribute. Also, some of them wonder like, look, war being strong-arm to contribute? We know whether this is good or bad for DeSantis, they'll tell you, it is a fact. He's going to do what he wants to do. So they know they have to give the money, but they also know that on the other and even if they give it, their projects might get vetoed in any way. Incidentally, more than $100 billion budget has yet to be delivered to DeSantis, when he gets the lineup with the veto authority in Florida. It gives him a tremendous amount of power. And just weekend, better said just yesterday, there was a group full of DeSantis fundraisers, many of them lobbyists, who were dialing for dollars, there are networks on his behalf, to raise some of this money that one of $8.3 million fundraising haul that he announced.",
