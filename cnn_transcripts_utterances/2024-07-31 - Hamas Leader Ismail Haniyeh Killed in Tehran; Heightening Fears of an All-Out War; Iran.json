But Hezbollah has yet to actually acknowledge that he was killed.Regarding the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, we are seeing a statement from Hezbollah saying that he was one of the great leaders of the resistance in our present era. And he said that -- the statement goes on to say, we in Hezbollah share with our dear brothers in the Hamas movement, all the feelings of pain over the loss of this great leader, the feelings of anger at the enemy's crimes. Now, of course, if you take the hit, the strike in Beirut yesterday, and in the early morning of the hours, the assassination of the Hamas leader in Tehran, it certainly amounts to a serious escalation of the situation. And we did here at a press conference by the Iranian ambassador to Beirut saying that Iran does not seek war, but does not accept that the region falls prey to Israel and the United States.

Talk to us a little bit about the capabilities if it is, in fact, Israel that did this, the capabilities to do something like that.COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST AND AIR FORCE COLONEL (RET.):  Yes, Jessica, this is one of those areas where intelligence plays a key role with precision strikes like this, it makes all the difference. And when you look at the way in which the Hamas leadership who was cornered in Tehran, you know, yes, they were guests of the Iranian regime but the Israelis clearly knew where they were living. They knew probably more about the structure of the house than the people who were living there. And that becomes really critical because what the Israelis did was they used a weapon system that was extremely precise, that went in and took out Haniyeh and his bodyguard and nobody else as far as we know at this point in time. So, what this means is that the Israelis are basically saying we can find your leadership wherever they may be and we can destroy them if we choose to do so.",

So, you have, in essence, three different proxy groups that are directly in conflict either with Israel or with the West. All of them have connections to the Iranians.And the big connection is that many of them are -- well, all of them are funded or supported in one way or another, either through money or training or both by the Iranians and specifically, by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. So, the IRGC is really a critical component to all of this. The IRGC, in essence, is masterminding a lot of the attacks that these groups put together. They're at least working in concert with them, to some extent. And then, what happens after that is the IRGC is really looking at extending Iran's influence throughout the region. So, these proxies serve as a means of really extending Iranian influence. They've done it very much in Iraq. They're doing it in Syria. And of course, what they're trying to do is they're trying to tie down Israel in what amounts to a two-front war.",

And if the polls move in a way that is separate from purely the excitement of having a new candidate and kind of the high of the last week.I think what you saw also was, I'm seeing shades a little bit of her announcement in January 2019, where it was an electric announcement, lots of people, but what Kamala's always been very, very good at is when she controls the variables and she's able to like have a lot of preparation, the prosecutor in her. I think she's able to succeed. What she gets on her back foot a lot is when she has these unkind of prepared interactions with her supporters, other candidates like Tulsi Gabbard on the debate stage. So, that's going to be the tell for me when she starts doing interviews. Maybe a debate, but -- maybe she can get through that with canned lines.
