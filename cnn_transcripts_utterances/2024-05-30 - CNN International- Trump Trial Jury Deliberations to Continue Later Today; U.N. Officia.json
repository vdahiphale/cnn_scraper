Jurors met for more than four and a half hours on Wednesday as deliberations got underway. Before being dismissed, the jury sent notes to the judge asking to hear a readback of critical witness testimony, including from the former National Enquirer chief, David Pecker, and Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen.

Yesterday was the first time that these 12 jurors were able to speak to one another about the case of what they've been hearing for the last few weeks. And also you've got to think that some of this testimony was at the very beginning.We're talking about on April 20th, around that time, that David Pecker actually testified. So they need their minds refreshed as to what was actually testified to. So in terms of this initial meeting, I think it's very crucial, because this is the first time, remember, that Donald Trump, David Pecker, and Michael Cohen are in the same room talking to each other about what this plan is, what this conspiracy is going to be of catching and killing these stories that ultimately led off to the payoff as well as the reimbursement to Michael Cohen. So it leads me to believe two things. Number one, they're listening to the judge's instructions in terms of accomplished testimony. We know Michael Cohen is an accomplice to this, so they can't just rely on his testimony. They need corroboration, so they're looking for that corroboration. So that's one. Second, remember that Michael Cohen does have credibility issues. So in order to deal with those credibility issues, the prosecution urged them, look at corroborating testimony. So here, by listening to the testimony of Michael Cohen, what he has to say about that meeting, and listening to the testimony of David Pecker, who was also in that meeting, of what he has to say, they're comparing the testimony of both of them. But tonight -- this morning, they'll hear that testimony. I assume that there'll probably be another question later on this afternoon, and we'll get a better idea of where this jury stands.",

I think what I want to see this morning, Max, and I was in the courtroom yesterday when that buzzer sounded, it kind of made everybody a bit nervous because it's a loud sound in the courtroom, and you just know that's a message from the jury, that they have a question or a statement that needs to be made in terms of whether they reached a verdict or not, is that I want to know what specific from the jury instructions do they want to hear, because a 55-page jury instruction was read to that. Do they want to hear the concept of reasonable doubt? Do they want to hear what the law is? Do they want to hear what accomplice instruction is? Do they want to hear about the conspiracy instruction?

A mayoral candidate in Guerrero State was gunned down at his final campaign event before Sunday's election. Video shows Jose Alfredo Cabrera greeting supporters as someone points a pistol at him and fires off several rounds. Cabrera died at the scene.

In recent days, several organizations say this year's election cycle is the most violent in Mexico's recent history. Now, NATO's foreign ministers are meeting in Prague right now with an eye on their future support for Ukraine. That's happening after Moscow threatened to ramp up its missile production over NATO's growing support for Ukraine's strikes inside Russian territory. Multiple NATO countries said this week they're OK with Ukraine using weapons supplied by them to hit at least some military targets across the border. The U.S., which gave Kyiv long-range missiles like these, has been opposed to that, but yesterday, the U.S. Secretary of State hinted at a possible shift, saying Washington will adapt and adjust its policies. NATO's Secretary General says he's fully on board with Ukraine's strikes inside Russia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL: According to international law, Ukraine has the right to self-defense, and self-defense includes also the right to strike targets outside Ukraine, including legitimate military targets in Russia.

Russia spends nearly 7 percent of its GDP on defense, with plans to go even higher, far more than the U.S. or any Western nation. Even if Russian weapons are lower quality, an old military adage says that quantity has a quality of its own. When Russia burned through its own supply of artillery ammo too quickly, North Korea sent millions of rounds that made their way to the front lines. Iranian Shahed drones have expanded an already deadly Russian arsenal, and the Kremlin wants more. The U.S. effort to produce weapons at the speed of war took precious time to close the gap. For years, the U.S. relied on decades-old plants like this one in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to make artillery rounds, a World War II-era defense industrial base that suddenly fell far short. This new artillery plant is part of a surge in weapons production that isn't done yet, with pressure on the U.S. to supply Ukraine's military as it modernizes its own. SEN.
