John and Sara are off today. This is CNN News Central. So, will Donald Trump soon be allowed to say a whole lot more about the crimes that he is charged with? That is a central question in the fight playing out today in an appeals court over the gag order against Trump in the federal elections subversion case. Trump's legal team is saying and arguing in court that this gag order violates his First Amendment rights and hurts his ability to campaign for president. But the judge in this case has said that Trump can't say just whatever he wants, especially when it comes to targeting court staff, potential witnesses and Special Counsel Jack Smith. CNN's Evan Perez is outside of the courthouse. He is joining us once again. Evan, what are we going to see playing out? What arguments are they going to be making?",

Elie Honig is a CNN senior legal analyst and former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.Elie, obviously, this hearing is ongoing right now. And Trump's attorney thinks the gag order would be unconstitutional. And the judge seems to be hitting on a dynamic that's important here. The judge saying you think the outcome should be exactly the same whether or not there's a political campaign underway, to which Trump's attorney replied, yes. So, bottom line, all that, do you think this is getting upheld here?",

      "sentences": "I do, if I have to predict. I think the court of appeals will uphold the gag order, because it's really important to understand this is not just a yes or no. This is not just can Donald Trump talk about the case or not. The actual gag order that's in dispute here is quite narrow. The district judge, the trial judge, Judge Chutkan, I think, wisely rejected DOJ's original proposal. DOJ originally came to her and said, we want to prevent Donald Trump from saying anything disparaging about anyone with anything to do with the case. That's too broad.And the district judge properly recognized that. Instead, she's issued a very narrow ruling that just says, you can't talk about court staff. You can't talk about the specific attorneys and their staff. And you can't talk about, in a way, that targets a potential witness in this case. But anything else, according to the gag order, is okay. You can criticize DOJ. You can criticize the Biden administration. You can say you're innocent. You can say these charges are bogus. And so I think when the court of appeals looks at that, they're going to say it properly balances the First Amendment interest Donald Trump has with the need to protect the proceedings.",

So, to me, it's even more narrow, and I think that one is likely to survive as well. But, again, it's the same considerations.But Donald Trump does have a right to speak and to speak in a negative way about the charges against him. You can criticize the judge. You can criticize a prosecutor. I was criticized in public by people who had prosecuted plenty of times. Sometimes you have to just take it. But the most important thing to guard here are victims, witnesses, your jury pool, and your staff.",

They've now lost court cases in five different states. They've lost when they tried to get every secretary of state of individual states to throw Trump off the ballot on the 14th Amendment.The fundamental problem here is, yes, the 14th Amendment says if someone engages in an insurrection, they're disqualified. The problem is we don't have a procedure. The amendment itself says Congress has to pass laws to tell us how this works. In 150 years, Congress has not passed any such laws. And what's not working is this effort to make up some procedure now and then apply it backwards. And that's why I think we've seen Democratic secretaries of state, Jocelyn Benson in Michigan, Republican secretaries of state, Brad Raffensberger in Georgia, a guy knows something about insurrection, he's been on the short end of an insurrection, they've all said, no, sorry, we can't do it. Then the 14th Amendment, people tried to go to the courts. They've now lost these five cases. I think they're doing more harm than good to their effort here, because, in a way, they're playing right into Trump's hands, they're playing right into this narrative of they're trying to knock me out through the courts, they're trying to deprive people of a chance to even vote for me at the ballot box.",

And the Constitution does give highest priority to what we call political speech, whether it's people protesting at the Supreme Court, protesting in Congress, and candidates themselves. I actually think he's right that, as a candidate, and this applies to any candidate, not just Donald Trump, but you do have a heightened First Amendment right.

We crossed the border fence at about 9The main purpose was to see the exposed tunnel shaft that the IDF had unveiled only a day or two earlier, see what we could see with our own eyes and learn or try to understand what was underneath. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LIEBERMANN (voice over):  We go in under cover of darkness. And as we cross the border fence, it's lights out across the Gaza Strip. Escorted by a tank, we switch into an armored personnel carrier for the final stretch. Even through a night vision screen, you can see the magnitude of the destruction on the streets of Gaza City. We offload at the Al-Shifa Hospital, pick our way along Ibn Sina Street, or what's left of it. We have to keep our lights off most of the time or risk exposing our position. CNN reported from Gaza under Israel Defense Forces escort at all times. As a condition for journalists to join this embed with the IDF, media outlets must submit footage filmed in Gaza to the Israeli military censors for review. Now, at the hospital compound, we wait inside a structure to make sure the area is secure before moving the short distance to the exposed tunnel shaft. And here is the entrance. You can see what looks like a ladder access into it. And as I step over here, it's very difficult to see how far down it goes but it looks like there's almost a central shaft for a staircase and then the shaft of it disappears then down into the darkness. We move around the opening for a better look at the shaft itself. What's clear from here is this is meant to go deep underground. Which direction does the tunnel go? MAJ. NIR DINAR, SPOKESPERSON, IDF:  We assume that the tunnel goes out and it has another corridor to this way.",

Inside, the video shows a spiral staircase, and as the camera orients itself, it moves forward into a tunnel. The tunnel makes a sharp left turn and at the end of another path, with concrete walls and an arched concrete top, a metal door they say they have not yet opened because they fear it's booby-trapped. IDF spokesman Admiral Daniel Hagari says some of the Israeli hostagestaken on October 7th were also brought through the hospital. He says the body of Noa Marciano was discovered 50 meters from the compound. REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, SPOKESPERSON, IDF:  We have evidence that they were holding hostages in Rantisi, but also we have evidence that they were bringing them to Shifa Hospital. We're still looking for the places they might have held them. This is not proof of a Hamas command center or headquarters underneath the hospital but Israel continues trying to build its case that Hamas uses the sanctuary of the hospital for cover, which Hamas and hospital officials have denied. The IDF's ability to continue its operation in Gaza and the credibility of Israel are at stake here as the number killed in the fighting surpasses 12,000, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The IDF says one of its missions is to destroy Hamas. But with international criticism mounting, Israel has to show the terror organization is using Gaza's civilians and infrastructure as cover to justify an ongoing war. (END VIDEOTAPE) LIEBERMANN (on camera):  Now, we couldn't see how deep the tunnel shaft itself went. It was simply too dark. And there wasn't a great angle to see the depth of the shaft. But the IDF says it goes down 10 meters, so about 33 feet or so, and then the tunnel itself continues for another 55 meters, more than 150 feet, before it reaches that metal door. Kate, obviously an incredibly important question, what's on the other side of that door, and are there more tunnels down there? If so, how many, and where do they lead?",
