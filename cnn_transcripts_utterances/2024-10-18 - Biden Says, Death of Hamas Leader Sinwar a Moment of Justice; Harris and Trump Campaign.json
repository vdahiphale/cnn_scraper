Listen here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  The death of the leader of Hamas represents a moment of justice. He had the blood of Americans and Israelis, Palestinians and Germans and so many others on his hands. I told the prime minister of Israel yesterday let's also make this moment an opportunity to seek a path to peace, a better future in Gaza without Hamas. And I look forward to discussing Iran.

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, it was a relatively brief statement that the president delivered to the press. He mentioned the situation in the Middle East, the desire for renewed push for a ceasefire. That desire echoed by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also spoke this morning.But President Biden really took the opportunity to hail the alliances and the shared values of the U.S. and Germany. That was really the underpinning of this visit that was supposed to be a state visit and got downgraded after it was rescheduled for this week following Hurricane Milton. And President Biden also referencing the need to continue supporting Ukraine, which is also going to be toward the top of the agenda for both his meeting with Olaf Scholz and his team, as well as with other European leaders set to take place a little bit later today, with Ukraine's success stalling out on the battlefield and another treacherous winter at war approaching. We've learned that the U.S. remains opposed to a key element of Zelenskyy's victory plan, which is to use U.S. or U. K.-made long range missiles to strike territory deeper inside Russia. The rationale being that the U.S. believes that there's limited chance for success of that strategy with many of those targets outside current long range capability and the likelihood very high for collateral damage. So, I'm told expect no concrete policy decisions on Ukraine from that meeting that is expected to happen today. But, of course, they will also be discussing the situation in the Middle East. That had been one of the discussion points already on the agenda, of course, with renewed urgency, given the death of Yahya Sinwar. There is shared belief among allies that there could be a diplomatic off ramp that is within reach now more than ever. The question, of course, Kate, is how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sees it.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, it's certainly a tactical victory that the Netanyahu government here in Israel is celebrating, as are very many Israelis. I mean, Yahya Sinwar is the man who is blamed for, you know, contriving this terrible attack on October the 7th last year against so many Israelis, more than 1,200 people killed. And so there is jubilation amongst many Israelis that he's dead. And that's something that, you know, Benjamin Netanyahu and his government is taking credit for.But Netanyahu is also saying that this is not the end of the war. It may be the beginning of the end. He said, but it's, it's not the end. He's called on Hamas to lay down their weapons and to release the hostages and he's issued guarantees to Hamas fighters who do that. But there's a sort of sense of wishful thinking about it in the sense that Hamas has within the past few hours released a statement, a senior official, basically saying they will be eventually victorious and offering no sense at all in that first statement after the death of Yahya Sinwar, that they're prepared to back down, release the hostages or compromise on any future negotiations. And so, yes, it is a possibility that this death of or this killing of Yahya Simua will be a turning point. It could make a difference in terms of the structure of Hamas, in terms of getting those hostages out. But it's not a certainty. And so we'll see in the hours ahead and in the days ahead what actually happens on the ground, whether this will be a pivotal moment or whether it's just, you know, another milestone along the long and bloody conflict that we're currently engaged in.",

You heard one joke there from Kamala Harris at the end about Donald Trump criticizing Detroit in Detroit. Both candidates will be in Michigan today.And let's just talk for a second about Detroit. This was the 2020 election, President Biden versus Donald Trump right there. This is Michigan. You can see Joe Biden won Michigan by more than 100,000 votes. Let's focus on Detroit, though, for a second. Wayne County, all right. In Wayne County, Joe Biden won big, 38 points, but Donald Trump won 30 percent of the vote, 260,000 votes. That was actually better in 2020 than he did in 2016. He had 29 percent of the vote there and 228,000 votes. So, Donald Trump actually improved in Wayne County and Detroit there. We'll see how insulting Detroit impacts that going forward. I want to tell you about where both candidates will be today, though, because a few hours apart, they're both going to be in Oakland County, sort of the suburbs of Detroit. This is important. This may be where the 2020 election was decided in Michigan. It might be where 2024 is as well. You can see President Biden won in Oakland County, the Detroit suburbs, by about 14 points, okay? Go back to 2016 and you can see Hillary Clinton won there, but just by eight points. So, that increase for Joe Biden is what helped him push ahead in Michigan State that Trump won in 2016, but Joe Biden won in 2020. All right, let's bring in CNN's Chief National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny for the excitement that we're getting in the mitten today.",

She'll be with Kamala Harris on the campaign trail, the first time we have ever seen Vice President Harris with Michelle Obama, the former first lady, campaigning together. They will have a stop in Georgia next week before that on Thursday, I believe.So, look, the bottom line is we all remember when Michelle Obama at the Chicago Democratic Convention urged people to get out there and to do something. Well, she is actually doing something herself, and she's going to be campaigning to try and get that early vote in. But, John, there is no doubt you can just feel the intensity here increasing. This race is deadlocked, both sides pulling out all of the stops. All-hands-on-deck moment, and now Michelle Obama is included in that roster",

And the judge overseeing the case rejected a request from Trump's team, legal team, to block the public release of the documents for now an appendix we're talking about related to Special Counsel Jack Smith's expansive immunity filing. What Trump wanted was to have it all held and delayed and be released after the election. So now what?CNN's Zachary Cohen is tracking all of this for us. Bring us up to speed.

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, we could get a sense of what Jack Smith has to back up his criminal case against Donald Trump, the receipts, if you will. You know, these are things like grand jury transcripts, things like notes from FBI interviews that Jack Smith and his team have conducted over the course of their investigation. That's what we're looking for to come out publicly today.And it remains to be seen exactly what will be allowed for the public to read, right? We do expect a good portion of this to be redacted, because that was negotiated beforehand between Trump and Jack Smith's team, but we are looking for new details about Jack Smith's investigation, whether or not he has the goods to back up those allegations that Donald Trump leaned on state officials and that he spread widespread narratives of voter fraud and knowingly as a political candidate to overturn the 2020 election results. That's really the crux of Jack Smith's case against Donald Trump. And as you mentioned, Donald Trump and his attorneys really did try to keep this appendix from coming out before the 2020 election. They argued that releasing this now would amount to election interference and was politically motivated, at least it would be seen that way by the public. The judge, Judge Chutkan, the judge overseeing this case, actually decided the exact opposite. She said that not releasing this information would be perceived as election interference. She wrote, it is, in fact, Trump's requested relief that risks undermining that public interest. If the court withheld information that the public otherwise had a right to access solely because of the potential political consequences of releasing it, that withholding could itself constitute or appear to be election interference. So, ultimately, we're going to have to see what exactly is in this appendix. But remember that filing two weeks ago that Jack Smith did file under seal or did release in this case outlined how he alleged that Donald Trump was pressuring Mike Pence, conversations, details about their conversations in the capacity as running mates. It detailed his conversations with different state officials. So, we'll have to see exactly what this reveals, new details about those conversations and the evidence that Jack Smith has to bring criminal charges against Trump.",
