To which Mr. Trump replied, no problem, I'll take care of it, Cohen says. Cohen said that meant he was going to pay him back. Trump is going to pay David Pecker back because David Pecker and the National Enquirer are the ones negotiating this deal with Karen McDougal, according to this testimony. After the call with Trump, Cohen says he followed up with Pecker in another call to confirm the details. Cohen is now reading more texts that he sent with Dylan Howard, who is the editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer and also the National Enquirer/AMI/Trump Organization point manned on squashing the Karen McDougal story.

      "sentences": "Yes. Anderson, we have two people here, Michael Cohen and Donald Trump, who are both very reactive, people and to some extent a loose cannon. And we know that Donald Trump's attorneys had really tried to brief him on not reacting to Michael Cohen, the way that we saw him react to Stormy Daniels, we saw him mutter under his breath.The judge had to pull him aside or pull his lawyer aside. He was cursing at certain points. They do not want him doing this with Michael Cohen. They believe that will give Michael Cohen some kind of indication that he's gotten under Trump's skin, which will urge him on. They have told Donald Trump to just remain focused, to not have any reaction. Now, of course, as I noted at the beginning of this, these are two people who are loose cannons. They often are very reactive. So whether or not he can sit through hours of this kind of testimony without reacting remains to be seen. But right now, it seems as though he is following some of his attorneys' advice here to try and remain disconnected and not have any indication of how he is feeling in response to this testimony. COOPER: Yes. Kristen, Dylan Howard texted, according to Michael Cohen, he agreed to do that, that they were worried that Karen McDougal was going to go on ABC, on GMA, Cohen says they had a concern that story was going to find its way to ABC, meaning \"ABC News.\" They're saying that McDougal's team rejected the initial offer and we're told to get back to them by the EOD by the end of day with a reasonable offer. I want to bring in Adam Kaufmann. He's a former executive assistant district attorney for the Manhattan D.A.'s office. Adam, just, I'm wondering what you think prosecutors so far are getting what they need. ADAM KAUFMANN, FORMER EXECUTIVE ASST. D.A., MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE: I think -- thanks, Anderson. I think they're certainly trying to get what they need. You know, I echo the points we've just heard about a lot of what we're hearing right now about catch and kill, about Karen McDougal, has nothing to do with the crime, which is the falsification of business records. So again, what they're doing is they're sort of taking Cohen through points that are already corroborated by others. So that when it comes down to focus on the specific crime, which is the falsification of the record, you know, the sort of testimony about the micromanaging, about Trumps involvement in everything will be largely corroborated and supported by all of that other testimony. They're also bringing this out to show that the intent to defraud, which is part, an element of the crime, that there was this intent to influence the campaign, which is both part of the intent to defraud, but also is necessary to show the campaign finance violation, which would elevate this from a misdemeanor to a felony. So I think they're trying to build a lot of support around the center of the case, which there's some weakness there in that, you know, the falsification is something that Trump didn't do himself. It was done by others and not by him. So I think by trying to build everything around it, they're sort of compensating for an essential weakness of the case. Not that it's not provable, it's just weaker than other aspects of the case.",

I'm wondering, what would you make of how Michael Cohen is actually testifying? We're told that he has not been looking at the jury as he answers questions.And I'm wondering, as a prosecutor, I mean, I talked to a jury consultant a couple of days ago regarding someone else's testimony. The jury consultant thought, whatever seems more natural for somebody, maybe not to be staring at them all the time when they're testifying at the jury all the time, that might make some jurors uncomfortable, but maybe kind of going back and forth between talking to, you know, to prosecutors, talking to the jury, I'm wondering what you make -- does it make -- I mean, is it a problem you think that Michael Cohen isn't looking at the jury?

Ideally, the witness will, you know, focus on the person asking the questions.And then if it's a short answer, probably maintain that eye contact. If it's a longer answer where there's sort of explanation, maybe pivot and turn to the jury a bit and express it to the jury. But, you know, the natural thing for most witnesses when they're being questioned is to focus on the person asking the questions. So I think that makes sense to me that he's doing that.",

I know some people have opined that the prosecution didn't really need him. I really disagree with that. I think that they had to call him for this case. He's at the center of it. He's the one that created, you know, to the extent you want to talk about a false document, the initial false document was Michael Cohen's invoice.That's what's received by the employees of the Trump Organization. And they're feeding off of that as they're making their entries in the Donald Trump records. So, you know, the falsity of that document and why that document was made to be false, to have that false recounting of the services provided, that's crucial to the precise theory of criminal liability.

Again, he expressed anger. But what Michael Cohen is going through are things that other witnesses have testified to and Michael Cohen has spoken about publicly many times, things that are somewhat easily corroborated because there's so many other people involved and they're not central, these -- what he's testifying to, these lines are not central to the criminal charges. What is going to get more complicated is once we get into the Stormy Daniels hush money payment and the reimbursement, and it's really just Trump and Cohen who are the only two, maybe Allen Weisselberg, who have knowledge of that. So right now, our colleagues reporting inside, if he appears relaxed, he's doing pretty well. Again, this is the easy part. It's going to get a little bumpier from here.",

I'm going to pause for one second.One of the concerns that I had, I expressed, Mr. Trump, was that if he goes, there's a series of papers that can relate to you. You can kind of tell that everybody involved in this knows that they have something to hide. The question is, are they hiding it from the public to help Trump get elected? Part of it, hiding it to protect Trump's family or trying to hide it from investigators. Now Cohen says, I didn't know what those stories were. Nobody was discussing that.

What you do have, though, in Michael Cohen testifying is someone who was there who can say, I believe this to mean unambiguously that he was asking me to engage in conduct, to, you know, to hide or, you know, suppress information about this conduct.More importantly, the wonderful thing about audio recordings is that they bring people into the room in a way that transcripts or even eyewitness testimony cannot.
