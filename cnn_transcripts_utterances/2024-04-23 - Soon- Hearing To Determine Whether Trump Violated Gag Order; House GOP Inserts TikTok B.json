And so I'm curious to see how the defense ends up trying to discredit this -- this sort of key player, right? Because they've not denied that all of this has -- I think the big thing that is that they have not denied that this has occurred. They've not -- they have not denied all of this.

On the other hand, right, as you said, there's not really the expectation there is the possibility that he could be jailed for this. Is that likely going to happen?When I talk to legal experts, they say no. So, yeah, we -- we don't really know and how Donald Trump takes these. Is he going to take this as sort of more of an art, more bolster for his argument that this is all politically motivated? I think that's probably likely. And so does this stop him from continuing on?

It had support for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. The Senate should start debate on the bill today. A final vote expected on Wednesday. That vote could also determine the fate of TikTok in the U.S. after House Republicans put in a ban on TikTok into this foreign aid package. Senators could try to strip the TikTok legislation out, but it is considered unlikely at this point. CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us live from London and Marc Stewart is with us in Beijing. Clare, let me start with you on Zelenskyy and his meeting with this congressional delegation.

But I think the optics of this visit by this bipartisan congressional delegation were important showing to Ukraine, but also crucially, I think to Russia as well that there is this long term bipartisan support for Ukraine still in the U.S. We see clear signs on the battlefield recently Russia has been betting against that.And, you know, I think a moment that really exemplifies those upticks was this very, very symbolic gift given to President Zelenskyy by a Republican -- Democratic Congressman, rather, Bill Keating from Massachusetts.

And this is such a complicated sale. This is not like going to the store and buy a gallon of milk or a candy bar. If we look at TikTok, its value, among other things, is its algorithm. This electronic digital tool to know exactly what we want to see and its something that TikTok may not want to part with.

Ten crew members were killed after two Malaysian navy helicopters collided in mid air during a military parade rehearsal.

Good one.Look, this is why we have 40 million people that are under this freeze alert or frost alerts, frost advisory, I should say, and it encompasses large populations, but anywhere from the Hudson Valley southward into portions of New Jersey, south eastern section of Pennsylvania, you can see the freeze warnings. That means that locations there have either flirted with that freezing marker dropped below it. So, of course, that's for sensitive plants very, very difficult conditions, but most locations above freezing, that's why we have the frost advisory. You don't necessarily need freezing weather to have frost on your plants. But look at these temperatures and they're going to get back better from here. And I say that with all confidence because where we're located, 75 in Atlanta, that to me for weatherman or a meteorologists, that as a picture perfect Tuesday in my opinion, partly cloudy skies for much of the east coast. This is high pressure giving us the clear skies. So a lot of radiation cooling at night, that's why we have the cool temperatures. Rain and storms across portions of the Great Lakes. My home state, Grand Rapids, Michigan, getting some rain right now, maybe hail and damaging winds with some of the thunderstorms that pass through. But let me focus your attention a little further south where the storm prediction center just updated this location between Wichita Falls, Abilene and east of Lubbock. That's an area where we have a slight risk of severe storms, all thanks to the cold front clipping that particular location. And then we focus our attention towards Thursday and Friday. This is tornado alley, not tornado valley. And that's located across the nation's heartland. Heads-up, Oklahoma City, Wichita Falls, damaging winds and tornadoes possible for the second half of this week, Kasie.",
