      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, epic failure, dysfunction, humiliation and inability to govern. And that's the most charitable way to describe the congressional Republicans right now, a stunning series of mind-boggling defeats and cell phones. And minutes from now, Senate Republicans will almost certainly torpedo the most conservative border bill before them in decades.Plus, a win for quote, none of these candidates. Nikki Haley loses Nevada's non-binding primary even though she was the only candidate on the ballot. Her campaign insists it's full steam ahead. And the Trump campaigns own existential moment. All eyes are on the U.S. Supreme Court hearing to hear arguments on whether Donald Trump can be disqualified under the constitution insurrection ban. A sign of just how serious the former president takes this. He's staying out of Washington, uncharacteristically trying to avoid a political spectacle. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start right here in our nation's capital where Senate Republicans are about to kill the border deal. The very kind of tough on immigration policy that they themselves demanded. The reason it's simple. It's what Donald Trump wants. He'd rather rant on the campaign trail about the unprecedented surge of migrants than let his party rewrite antiquated laws in the hopes of starting to solve the border crisis. If it were only today's vote, it would be tough enough, but it's not. The collapse of this immigration deal is only piling on to a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day for congressional Republicans. There was the hyped vote to impeach the homeland security secretary. It failed. And it's later a standalone package for Israel also failed. Speaker Johnson is new to the job and maybe didn't learn one of the cardinal rules of the House. Don't put anything on the floor unless you definitely have the votes. Well, moments ago Johnson took questions from our reporters, including our own Manu Raju. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We saw sitting speaker have a difficult time, getting the votes to do that. And the only real major accomplishment seems to avoid a national debt default that this Congress was able to accomplish. And now you're dealing with huge international and domestic crises and in unable to deal with those as well. And that has caused enormous frustration in the ranks.

It's divided government, which is what Speaker Johnson just acknowledge there. And yet, with divided government, that means you don't get everything you want. It means that in the Senate border deal, which is a compromise. That's probably the closest that Republicans are going to get to something they want.

Remember, McDaniel was a huge ally of Donald Trump, helped him win Michigan in 2016. In fact, she was appointed to the RNC by him in 2016. And as head of the RNC helped pay for his legal bills until he announced that he will be running a third bid for the White House.But in recent years, he has turned on her and started in 2020, when he has complained privately. He didn't think the RNC or Ronna McDaniel had enough safeguards in place essentially to help him challenge the election in 2020. He complained that she held debates when he didn't want there to be debates. He complained that she didn't pay enough of his legal bills. And more recently, they were complaining Trump and his team about the lack of fundraising that the RNC had. They released pretty dismal numbers in the last week. So, as you have said, Ronna McDaniel telling Donald Trump that she will step down if and when he is the nominee. But the really big picture here is clear. Donald Trump didn't like Ronna McDaniel anymore. Ronna McDaniel is stepping down. Donald Trump didn't want a border deal. There is no border deal, or at least likely no border deal. Every single thing that Donald Trump is trying to get right now from Republicans. He is getting. He is taking full control of the party. It feels exactly like it did in 2016, as he inched towards the nomination there. And it should be clear, Republicans, even those who were not fans of Donald Trump all seem to be falling in line.",

And you know, talk to people at the RNC they argue, might not be wrong about this that when there is an active primary going on -- donors give to the campaigns, they don't give to the party.OK, fine. But more importantly, it's just -- it's actually amazing that she hasn't gone sideways with Donald Trump so far. I mean, she's, I believe the longest serving RNC chair. He picked her. She was chair of the state party in Michigan. He wanted her in there. She got in there and she's trying to do as much as she can for him. But at a certain point, everybody goes sideways with Donald Trump because it's almost impossible to live up to the things that you want.
