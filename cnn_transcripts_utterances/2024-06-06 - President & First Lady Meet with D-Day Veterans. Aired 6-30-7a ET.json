We are marking, of course, the 80th anniversary of that day. We are awaiting President Biden.He's going to deliver remarks at any moment at the Normandy American Cemetery in northern France on this, as we've noted, 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion. About 73,000 U.S. troops took part in that invasion on June 6, 1944. Some 2,400 Americans died that day, and many of them are buried at the cemetery where the President is about to speak. The White House releasing a presidential proclamation yesterday that read, in part, quote, \"On the 80th anniversary of D-Day, may we thank these service members for their bravery and sacrifice. May we honor their heroism, which liberated a continent and saved the world. And may we recommit to the future that they fought and which many died for.\" Our panel is back, and we are also joined by CNN Chief International Anchor, Christiane Amanpour. She is live for us in Normandy on this very solemn day. Christiane, good morning to you. Very grateful to have you and your perspective, your reflections on this day and what it means as we face a very uncertain future across the world?",

Of course, at the time, there was significant involvement from the Soviets at the time, and he has attended in the past, is my understanding, not welcome there today.",

Ken, I'm so grateful to have you on the program. I'd just like to start with your reflections as we see what are really our final remaining veterans, those courageous men who stormed the beach that day.",

      "sentences": "You know, Kasie, thanks for having me. This is one of the most important days in American history. It's certainly one of the most important days in world history. This is the greatest cataclysm in the history of the world. More than 60 million people were killed. This is the greatest invasion in the history of that, and we began our film at the end of the 90s to air in 2007 because we were learning that we were losing 1,000 veterans of the Second World War a day in America.I am sorry to say that that number is way, way down, and there are only a handful of people who have that direct memory, and we wanted to find out what it was like this day. You cannot imagine the scope. It is beyond our kind of comprehension, and the thing that matters to me most is that we were there not for empire. We weren't there to acquire territory. The farm boy from Nebraska is not there to get something. He's there for an idea, which is to liberate people from authoritarianism, to liberate people from tyranny, the people who had taken over Europe. And it's one of the most magnificent moments in human history, and what happened that day is beyond comprehension. There are three phases. You know, first, the airborne gets dropped behind, the 101st and the 82nd. Then there are over 11,000 bombers that are supposed to soften up German targets. Then there's going to be in phase three, five, beach landing. The British are going to take gold and sword. The Canadians are going to take Juno and have a pretty hard time of it. Utah, Americans are there. Teddy Roosevelt, Jr., with just a cane, marches ashore. It's Omaha that's the big problem. It's a wide beach. It's the biggest beach. The tanks that are set off just go right to the bottom of the sea. A lot of the LSTs are swamped. I mean, the heroism of the people that then, in the face of withering fire, get up on that beach and begin to move. Someone just said, you know, Americans began to improvise that day. The ships were ordered to stay out at a certain length so they wouldn't run aground. They moved in so that their guns could break up the German emplacements. Enlisted soldiers and officers alike began to take matters into their own hands. Somebody said, look, we're getting murdered down here. Let's go up there and get murdered. And it opened up a beachhead. And the thing -- it is -- you cannot overstate. And all you have to do is look at all those crosses, all of the Americans that were left there to understand the significance of this moment and this day. The fact that the chances are that there'll be anyone left in a few years who was there, who can remember it, is a sad moment and I think forces us now to invest even more energy as forces of authoritarianism are again on the eastern borders of Europe, again threatening us.",

He earned a Purple Heart there. And I think I was struck both personally when our family went through this loss, but also now looking at these men here, that people who are my age, you know, I'm not yet 40, are going to be the only ones that really have, we're going to be the last ones that have the opportunity to have a personal connection to people who were there that day.And I'm just interested to know your reflections on what that means for how we need to talk to the upcoming generations that are not going to have the opportunity to understand just what those stakes were, just what these men and women, some of them, went through and fought for in this just absolutely momentous, cataclysmic world event. It seems like a really significant loss. [06:50:14] BURNS: It is indeed. And I think we live in perilous times, not just because of the rise of authoritarianism, Kasie, but also because we are all now, with social media, kind of independent, free agents. And the thing that we practiced in the Depression and then perfected in World War II was shared sacrifice. And that's what those men, those old men now, who can need help, some in wheelchairs, some, you know, with canes, they were 19 years old. I've got a 19-year-old daughter right now, and I want her to understand that at 19, people were risking their lives. There were 5,300 boats in that armada. There were 176,000 soldiers. There were 2,000 landing boats. And the sheer scope of this thing is so important to understand and then to personalize, to say it isn't just arrows on a map, but their individual lives, like your grandfather, like my father, like other people who were involved in these things, and that we have so few of these great patriots. I mean, this is the moment when the greatest generation's reputation is cemented. They had survived the Depression and all the hardships. And that practice permitted them to say, it's not about me. It's about us. And, you know, us is the tiny, lowercase, two-letter, plural pronoun that also, when it's capitalized, is the U.S. And that's what my entire professional life has been about. And in that space, in that sacred space, is the story of the better angels of humanity. And I can't think of anything than what it would be for a 19-year-old kid to get off a landing boat and make it up there and eliminate that pillbox, destroy those guns, and make an inroad into Europe, so that on June 6, by the end of August, you are in Paris, and you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. There's not a better story in the history of the world than this one.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it's absolutely incredible. Ken, we went back to see how this was being written about from a leadership perspective at the time. And back in 1944, just a month or so after this invasion, in Foreign Affairs, they wrote about the differences between among the European and American leaders at the time. And they say that it has repeatedly been pointed out France was far less fortunate than Great Britain or the United States in her political leadership. The men who were patriots first and politicians second were rare, almost non- existent again in France.The salvation of Great Britain and the United States has been that at critical moments in their history, a benign political providence has provided leaders who were not only intelligent, but courageous. Courageous. How important is that kind of courage on the world stage today?",

But our panel is also here. Cedric Leighton, I know you had family members who were involved in this war effort. Your final reflections as we wrap up here.COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (Ret.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yeah, Kasie, one of the things, my dad was involved on the intelligence side. He was an army intelligence NCO at the time. And one of the things that he noted was how quickly the radio traffic blossomed and all the networks came up in terms of the logistical networks on the German side, on the French side, on the British side. And everybody was talking about D-Day. As soon as all of these things happened, all of the movements occurred with the flotilla of ships, over 7,000 ships that showed up, the over 14,000 airplanes. All of that became part of a major logistical movement. And as Ken was mentioning, there are so many different aspects to this. This was a major logistical feat, major intelligence feat. And we actually had insights on the intelligence side that gave us the plans of what the Germans were going to do and gave us the plans for their fortifications. And that made a huge difference.",

Again, as we wrap up here, the sticks for him?EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Well, look, remember, the portrait in the Oval Office that Biden put there in the center spot is of FDR. He sees a lot of connection to him, both in terms of the fight for democracy and in terms of the economic programs that he's won, the new New Deal, essentially, in his mind. But the points have been made by Ken, by you, and by your grandfather. These -- these people, this is not a theoretical exercise for them. This is the way -- the fading memories of World War II and of the Holocaust, we see things that are coming back now in ways that reflect that we are starting to forget about it. A lot of people have not had that direct experience. Go back to, you know, Hannah Arendt talking about the banality of evil. This is what happened then happened. It's real. It happened with human beings. Human beings haven't changed that much. And it's one of the things that we are facing as a country and as a world is whether we're going to repeat, whether, as Biden says, history just rhymes, right, quoting that Irish poem. What we're going up against here in this moment for America and the world is something that we all need to grapple with because that is not -- it's only 80 years ago. It's really not that long.

And while history seems like linear, D-Day was not always assured to be a success. Dwight Eisenhower carried a message in his wallet that said that he would deliver in the event of a retreat, which said, if there is any blame, it's all basically on me. And that kind of leadership is, I think, what we've been somewhat lacking in recent years.",
