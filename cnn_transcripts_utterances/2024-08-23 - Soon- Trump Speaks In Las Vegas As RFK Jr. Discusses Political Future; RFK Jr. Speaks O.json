      "sentences": "Even before the Republican National Convention in July, there were talks taking place between Donald Trump's orbit and RFK Jr.'s campaign. And part of that was really led by Donald Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. He was really the leader, I'm told, behind a lot of that back-channeling, trying to see if they could find a way to get RFK Jr. to end his campaign and endorse the former president.Two other big names who have been involved in that are also Tucker Carlson, someone who, I'm told, has a close relationship with RFK Jr., but also this man named Omeed Malik. He's a businessman. He was a former RFK Jr. donor. He's also donated to Donald Trump's campaign and is close to both Donald Trump Jr. and Tucker Carlson. But all of that aside, look, the thinking within Trump's world was, there's a lot of questions for months over whose candidacy would RFK Jr. hurt more. Would it hurt then - President Joe Biden and Donald Trump's campaign more? And now a question between whether it hurts Trump or Harris. I'm told that when Biden ended his campaign and Harris became really the successor, it was clear that she was going to top the Democratic ticket. That is when the majority of people on Trump's team decided, yes, we want to seek that endorsement. So again, this was a long time coming. Now, part of this as well is, keep in mind, RFK Jr., obviously, running - had been running as an independent, ending his campaign right now in this major speech, but he's been polling pretty well, nowhere near the way that both Donald Trump and now Harris are polling. But like, for - in - for example, in Arizona, he's polling at 6 percent. In many of these battlegrounds, he is sustaining a good number of voters who want to - wanted to support him. And so the Trump team's thinking here is that if they can siphon enough of those voters away from Harris and that somehow this endorsement (INAUDIBLE) ...",

KENNEDY JR., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: ... in the battleground states, I would likely hand the election over to the Democrats with whom I disagree on the most existential issues: censorship, war and chronic disease. Oh, I want everyone to know that I am not terminating my campaign. I am simply suspending it and not ending it. My name will remain on the ballot in most states. If you live in a blue state, you can vote for me without harming or helping President Trump or Vice President Harris. In red states, the same will apply. I encourage you to vote for me. And if enough of you do vote for me, and neither of the major party candidates win 270 votes, which is quite possible - in fact today our polling shows them tying at 269 to 269 - and I could conceivably still end up in the White House in a contingent election. But in about 10 battleground states where my presence would be a spoiler, I'm going to remove my name, and I've already started that process and urged voters not to vote for me. It's with a sense of victory and not defeat that I'm suspending my campaign activities. Not only did we do the impossible by collecting a million signatures, but we changed the national political conversation forever. Chronic disease, free speech, government corruption, breaking our addiction to war have moved to the center of politics. I can say to all who've worked so hard the last year and a half, thank you for a job well done. Three great causes drove me to enter this race in the 1st place primarily, and these are the principal causes that persuaded me to leave the Democratic Party and run as an independent, and now to throw my support to President Trump. The causes were free speech, a war in Ukraine and the war on our children. I've already described some of my personal experiences and struggles with a government censorship industrial complex. I want to say a word about the Ukraine war. The military-industrial complex has provided us with a familiar comic book justification like they do on every war ...",

It's hard to make sense of. Johanna Maska, what do you see in all of this as this rambling speech goes on and he launches attacks against Democrats? JOHANNA MASKA, FORMER OBAMA WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF PRESS ADVANCE: Well, look, he's reminding us who he is. I mean, he's the troubled son of a famous politician who has had drug problems, problems with women, nefarious business dealings with Venezuela. I mean, there were a lot of questions about his intentions in this campaign from the get-go. He is not ready for primetime and certainly not ready for the presidency. I mean, he's never held elected office, but he got some momentum because a lot of Americans didn't want Trump and they didn't want Biden. And I think we have to be careful as Democrats not to demonize the views of his supporters. There are a lot of people who are skeptical of modern medicine right now. We don't need to demonize them. We need to seek to understand, we need to go after those followers. I don't know if there's people in, you know, Pennsylvania who are following exactly what he's saying, but I think, you know, he's reminded us who he is.

And then later today, we know you're going to see Donald Trump back in Arizona holding a rally just a couple minutes outside of Phoenix. And they have touted having a special guest there. I think you can anticipate that you will see RFK Jr. there later with him there. Now, Donald Trump is going to be here shortly to talk about his policy pitch on tax, no taxes on tips, something that is very important to workers here in Nevada. There's a reason that he announced that pitch first in Las Vegas back in June and then he's back here today to talk about that. One thing as well that you'll hear him do is criticize Kamala Harris for what he says is stealing that proposal.
