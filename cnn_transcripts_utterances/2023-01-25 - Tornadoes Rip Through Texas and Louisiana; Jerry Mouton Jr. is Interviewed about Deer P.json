The individuals described the intense moments when they were hearing loud noises. And you can see that the metal is completely mangled. The roof is completely collapsed.

The German federal government announcing it will bolster its military support by delivering 14 of these Leopard 2 tanks.CNN Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann joining us this morning, as well as CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson, who's live in London.

      "sentences": "Well, we have heard officials here say that Germany is a sovereign country that will also - that will make its own decisions. But we've also seen how this has played out and the timing with which it has played out. Last week Germany openly stated that it wouldn't send its own Leopard II tanks or approve other countries sending it until the U.S. announced its own decision. And despite a U.S. pressure campaign to get Germany to give that approve, it now appears this is playing out basically with the same timing, a German announcement and this week, perhaps even in just a couple of hours, an announcement from the U.S. that it will send its own M1 Abrams tanks. So, the timing of all this can't be ignored, especially on top of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asking for tanks for months now.Now, it's a different question in the timing of when these will arrive. Poland, Finland, other countries have said they're ready to go to sending Leopard II tanks. Of course, that still requires training and maintenance. So there is time there. As a question for when will the U.S.-made tanks arrive, we hope to learn more about that. But our understanding is, these may take much longer. First, Ukraine has to train on a number of new systems, and that now includes, as we've just learned, Leopard II tanks. But there's also the patriots, the U.K. tanks and other systems that they still have to learn on. So in terms of when we might see U.S. made M1 Abrams in Ukrainian hands on the battlefield, that still may be months away. But, Erica, Jim, as you said, we will learn more hopefully either today or in the coming days here. SCIUTTO: Nic, this has echoed some other debates about weapons systems there where you have some public disagreement and then a coming together here. I wonder, based on your conversations, is the view here that this is mostly about a show of unity, giving Ukraine what it says it needs right now, as opposed to a sense that these tanks, particularly in small numbers, will actually change the course of the battle there?",

You know, as we look at where things stand, I have to say, I was having this conversation with my producer Laney (ph) yesterday before we knew about even the Pence documents. And we were saying huh, I wonder if any of the former presidents are also looking to see if they may have anything home -- at home just as a preemptive strike. We do know representatives for former presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama say they turned over all classified documents as per the rules for National Archives when leaving office and they have no plans to conduct additional searches.

Look, the reality is that people in these positions, the president, vice president, certain members of Congress, they need access to classified documents and they're not able to just review them in a SCIF, like some members of Congress, like run down the hall and take a look. It's a very mobile job they have. They're in the Air Force One, Air Force Two. They need to be able to see documents and briefings and things like that. So, you know, we're worried about the perception, are we going to have a special counsel here? Are we going to treat this case fairly? How are we going to do that? What we need to be doing, and I hope - what I hope Congress will focus on is, how do we fix it? Do we overclassify things? I think we do. Do we need to have a better way to track who has documents and how to recover documents? I think that's right. So, hopefully that will become the focus in the months ahead -",

Does that matter? TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, WHITE HOUSE BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": It should matter. But when you have a slim four vote majority in your own caucus, it's going to be very difficult for Kevin McCarthy to hold a similar standard for Democrats and Republicans. And he's going to be accused repeatedly of hypocrisy when he, you know, attacks and calls out Democrats, when he calls out President Biden for his handling of classified documents but doesn't do the same about president - former President Trump, when he calls out Democrats for alleged misbehavior and he ignores the things that are happening within his own caucus, with people like Rep.
