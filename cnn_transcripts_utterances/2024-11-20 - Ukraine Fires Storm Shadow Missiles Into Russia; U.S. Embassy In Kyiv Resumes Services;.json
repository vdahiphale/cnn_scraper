Ukraine targets Russia with British made missiles tomorrow. Some embassies in Kyiv close over potential airstrike fears. Adani arrest warrant. The Indian billionaire indicted on fraud charges in New York tied to allegations of bribery back home. Tycoon on trial. Jimmy Lai defends himself in a Hong Kong court while facing a life sentence under the new national security law. And cruising into 2028. We'll speak to the firm offering a four-year long luxury escape that conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, another major escalation in Russia's war on Ukraine. There are reports that Kyiv has launched British supplied Storm Shadow missiles at targets inside Russia for the first time. U.S. officials say Ukraine targeted Russia Tuesday with American-made longer-range missiles. Meanwhile, the U.S. and some European nations closed their Kyiv embassies on Tuesday for security reasons. U.S. Authorities said it received intelligence of a possible air attack, though the U.S. embassy say services have now resumed. And U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirming the White House has approved sending anti-personnel mines now to Ukraine. Nick Paton Walsh joins us now. Nick, they won't have closed these embassies without some form of credible intel. It underscores, I think, the rising level of both tension and threat level just in the last few days.",

Yes, the United States have supplied missiles to Ukraine that were fired into Russia. A startling policy decision there by the Biden administration in the last 48 hours and does appear to have been joined by the United Kingdom's Storm Shadow missiles hitting Kursk, according to some reports in the last 24 hours as well. Some social media videos coming from Russian locals there, saying they found fragments. That, potentially, that sense of escalation may be contributing to the fast decision, the stock decision by the U.S. embassy to shut its doors today. The first time it's done that since it relocated prior to the start of the war, that now appears to have passed, that concern with Ukrainian officials, perhaps suggesting some of the anxieties may have been heightened by Russian misinformation about a mass scale attack, but still serious enough warnings that NATO allies shut their doors as well. Here's what we know. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice-over): Ukrainian special forces fighting up close and taking prisoners. Rare footage of them still inside Russia's Kursk region, where British Storm Shadow missiles were claimed to have hit Wednesday, these fragments found by locals. Just hours earlier, American supplied ATACMS missiles also plowed into Russia, marking a stark new escalation in the war. Yet, it was also in Kyiv that fear grew.

Now, we're also following Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, who's been indictedon bribery charges in New York for his alleged role in a multibillion- dollar fraud scheme. This, according to the U.S. Justice Department. They allege Adani and seven other executives promised more than $215 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure energy contracts worth more than $85 billion. Bloomberg says the chairman of Adani Group is Asia's second richest person behind Mukesh Ambani. Jacob Frenkel is chairman of the Government Investigations and Securities Enforcement Practice at the law firm Dickinson Wright. Jacob, always great to have you on the show. Just to give our audience a sense, this is sort of the equivalent of an Elon Musk or a Jeff Bezos in this country being indicted. For me, the first question is, why does the United States care about what took place in terms of alleged bribery back in India? And why now if it's alleged to be tied to events in 2021? JACOB S. FRENKEL, DICKINSON WRIGHT PLLC: Well, Julia, great question. Great to be back with you. I mean, the short answer to your question is the U.S. takes interest when a U.S. company is involved, particularly a company that's traded on the U.S. markets. The bribery scheme that the U.S. government alleges. Let's also be mindful, it's not just the Department of Justice that has brought a case, but the SEC also brought two related cases, but involves a U.S. company with securities traded on the New York Stock Exchange. And during the bribery scheme, the government alleges that the U.S. traded company was actively involved in conducting a note offering that raised $750 million including about $170 -- $175 million from U.S. investors. You also have financial institutions that were involved in victimized, and from a U.S. government perspective, you all -- I mean, so we're really talking about here issues involving U.S. investor protection, integrity of company, doing business on U.S. capital markets, and the whole idea around the bribery enforcement -- or anti-bribery enforcement is ensuring fair competitions for companies that operate under jurisdiction with anti- bribery laws. Then you add on to that, during the government investigation, materially false and misleading statements were being made to the grand jury, the FBI and to the SEC, where, I should say, false statements, but also acts to obstruct the investigation. So, if anything, all that was done here was adding fuel to the fire around a real high-profile bribery scheme.",

But we are now seeing the pressure on both sides really reaching a boiling point. We saw committee Republicans on the Ethics -- the Republicans on the Ethics Committee block the release of this report. That's what sources tell us after their nearly two-hour meeting earlier today. And then you have Democrats who are doing everything they can, including trying to force this House floor vote to try and leverage their efforts and force Republicans to vote on this. So, both sides are really pushing as hard as they can, but the Ethics Committee is not going to meet again until December 5th. And the question is will there be any movement between now and then? Gaetz was on the Hill today meeting with Senate -- Republican Senators, trying to argue and say, please give me a chance. Let me go through the confirmation process as Trump's nominated him to be his attorney general instead of just ruling it out right away. Senate Republicans want to see this report. The Senate Judiciary Committee has requested to see it. We don't know if they've seen it yet. So, there's just a lot of balls in the air here.

That was for organizing an unofficial primary election back in 2020. And if you take it in whole, it is part of a much broader crackdown that has been underway here that has very seriously transformed the political culture of this city, where people are afraid, I would say, argue to speak up and criticize the city and national authorities, that the opposition groups that used to be very vibrant here have all but disappeared, opposition politicians either in jail or have fled. Independent newspapers like Apple Daily, Jimmy Lai's newspaper, have been shut down after being raided by police. So -- and even one person who tried to hold up a protest sign outside the courtroom on Tuesday, very quickly escorted away by police. So, even holding up a sign in the city, which was considered part of the culture five, six years ago, all of that has gone in what the Hong Kong and Chinese authorities would argue has been an effort to restore stability in this international financial hub in what critics have said -- have argued is a crackdown on democratic freedoms that used to exist here.
