So it's not as if that would be something that would be surprising or not contradictory.NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, listen, I think Americans remember very well that the Trump kids were very successful. Some worked in the White House. Kushner, obviously, worked in the White House. They have benefited greatly from President Trump being president. And Republicans didn't have anything to say about that when that was going on. Listen, Republicans are going to keep at it. They have been at this for many, many months. This idea that Biden is the head of some sort of Biden crime family, I think in many ways this was a bit of a dud. It's sort of what you would expect. Like, yes, he's at some business meeting or dinner and, you know, his dad calls and he's like, hi, dad, or whatever. I mean, it seems like, yes, I'm sure that Biden -- Hunter Biden traded on his dad's fame and his power and his name, but still, as of yet, Comer can get on TV all he wants and talk about, oh, well, we're going to see if there's evidence out there.

And there's a level of anger there that brought them to Donald Trump because he represented and offered to be their voice and to speak for them. And what has happened is that group has actually grown over time, and DeSantis, from the opening of his campaign, has simply not appealed to them. Here's someone with a very strong record in Florida. The voters have looked at this and said, why are you weaponizing government against companies you don't agree with? Why are you taking such an extreme position on abortion when you're selling yourself as a common sense conservative?
