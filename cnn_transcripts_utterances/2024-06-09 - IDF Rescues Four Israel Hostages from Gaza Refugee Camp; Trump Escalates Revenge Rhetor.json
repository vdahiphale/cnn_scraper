We have details on how the raid was conducted. Well, that operation taking a heavy toll on Palestinians with the reported death toll now said to be over 200. How the international community is responding. Plus, President Joe Biden commenting on the mission while abroad as CNN learns the extent of U.S. involvement, as protesters gather in Washington to demand a ceasefire. Four Israeli hostages are now free after an Israeli military raid on a refugee camp in Gaza. But there are questions about how many Palestinians were killed in the operation and how many of those were civilians. The IDF says the rescued hostages are in good medical condition, but were taken to hospital for medical examination. The four former hostages were reunited with their families in Israel on Saturday. The Israeli military released this video showing the emotional moments when their families and friends saw them for the first time in eight months. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also met with the former hostages and their families. He told one of them, quote, \"We didn't give up on you for a moment.\" And he vowed to get all of the hostages home one way or another. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And indeed, the scene in Nuseirat and the nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital can only be described as hell.The Israeli operation killed at least 230 people. And wounded more than 400, according to doctors in Gaza who spoke to CNN. The hospital was overwhelmed by the injured, many of them women and children. The corridors jammed with staff trying to treat the wounded with desperate relatives begging for attention for those awaiting care. The morgue is full. The dead, some shrouded in white sheets, others still in their blood-soaked clothing, were laid out on the ground, surrounded by weeping and praying loved ones. The rescue operation is being lauded by Israel's friends with little, if any, reference to the Palestinian death toll. But the reaction elsewhere was one of anger. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council and the E.U.'s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, described reports of what he called another massacre of civilians as appalling. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from Beirut.",

Israel will not do a deal that commits it to a permanent ceasefire at the outset. And Hamas will not do a deal that does not see Israel committing itself to a permanent ceasefire at the outset. So unless that circle -- that circle can be squared, if you like, then there isn't going to be a deal. And we have seen this over months and months of on-off negotiations. And I suppose, you know, it brings to mind the old saying that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. They are continuing to have the same talks and they are continuing to remain apart on the same issues when it comes to getting a deal done. And so with or without this operation by Israel that saw it rescue four hostages and also a large number of Palestinian deaths as well, according to the Palestinians, it's unclear that that will complicate matters and the negotiations any more than they were already being made complicated.

They tried to set up a contrast to when Trump was there five years ago and missed some opportunities to recognize fallen American soldiers. One more opportunity awaits today when President Biden will visit the Aisne-Marne Cemetery outside of Paris, where he will pay his respects to the American war dead. You may remember President Trump declined to visit that cemetery when he was here. At the time, weather was cited as the concern, but then his comments about American war heroes was later reported and revealed as one potential reason why he decided not to go. As far as how this helps or hurts President Biden, well, independents right now still favor President Trump over Biden by a pretty sizable margin, but it could be a few weeks before any change in Biden's low approval rating are reflected in the polls because it takes a little time for, you know, the messaging from trips like this to really sink in and then for some of that data to be collected.

Earlier in the week, he was in Arizona and had a fundraising swing through California. And then on Sunday, he's going to be holding a rally in Las Vegas where temperatures are potentially dangerous for his rally goers.This event is going to be held outdoors at Las Vegas' Sunset Park. And the Trump campaign is trying to take extra precautions to make sure people are safe. The temperatures currently showing that it could reach 104 degrees on Sunday. And due to that, they are doubling the amount of emergency medical staff planned on the ground for this event. They're also going to have 38,000 water bottles that they'll be giving out to attendees. They'll have misting fans. They'll also have more magazines to help speed up the security process. But look, these -- these precautions come after 11 people were transported to the hospital on Thursday around his Phoenix, Arizona town hall. And keep in mind, that town hall was actually indoors. This event is going to be outside. And so it's very much a concern for the Trump campaign. Now, I also just want to bring your attention to some of the rhetoric we've heard the former president using over the past week. He's done a series of what I would argue are friendly interviews in the days after his conviction. And Donald Trump has really escalated his rhetoric seeking revenge on some of his political opponents. Now, one of the interesting things I find about this is that in these interviews, some of the hosts have tried to get him to take a step back from that language. However, Donald Trump is doubling down. Listen to what he told Dr. Phil on Thursday. DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTIVE U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Retribution is going to be through success. We're going to make it very successful. We have to bring the country together. The word revenge is a very strong word, but maybe we have revenge through success. Well, revenge does take time.

People don't necessarily notice this, but the way the world is currently speaking about the situation makes it so that Hamas doesn't have a lot of incentive to reach a deal. For them, they are, you know, they are terrorist organization. Sinwar, known as the butcher from Khan Yunis, is a terrorist who does not care about the hostages or his people. And so for him, the fact that there's international pressure on Israel makes it so that his situation is pretty good. And he doesn't necessarily need to reach the ceasefire deal if he sees that the world is going to pressure Israel to end the war either way. And so I do believe it was important to get more pressure on him and on Hamas, which again, the American government is trying to do, and I believe is doing all that they can.

They called it the People's Red Line, symbolizing what they believe is President Biden not sticking enough to a red line that he drew with the Israelis regarding the incursion of Rafah. So this red banner was two miles long in 100-foot sections. It was unfurled, and protesters ringed the entire White House complex earlier with that banner. That banner is now on the ground here laid in rows, but it had a lot of writing on it, messages, signatures. That was part of the visual earlier today.

But, you know, Anna, it's important to note that when we're talking about propaganda messages coming from South Korea, we're not talking about old-timey Cold War stuff. We're talking about South Korean soft power, K-pop, news bulletins, audio of those news bulletins that come from the loudspeakers talking about human rights abuses perpetrated by Kim Jong-un's regime in North Korea, heard for as far as 20 kilometers northbound into North Korean territory. So, what exactly precipitated this? Two things. We had 300 trash balloons come from North Korea late last night into early this morning. One balloon, we have a photo of, landing smack dab in the middle of the Han River in the heart of Seoul. About 80 of those 300 balloons actually made it into South Korean territory. And then on Thursday, we had a South Korean group decide to send 10 balloons of their own, Anna, northbound towards North Korea that have slices of life of what it's really like in South Korea with those flash drives you were talking about. Now, we did manage to speak to the founder of that South Korean group. Here's just a slice of what he told us before the balloon launch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PARK SANG-HAK, FOUNDER, FIGHTERS FOR A FREE NORTH KOREAN (through translator): We send money, medicine, facts, truth, and love, but to send filth and trash in return, that's an inhumane and barbaric act.",

      "sentences": "So, Anna, to give you some perspective, we're here in Paju, South Korea. We are standing on the unification bridge in Paju, which is one of the last places you can go as a civilian before you head into North Korean territory.This is one of the bridges when there have been very rare unifications between people in South and North Korea, where those diplomatic moments have happened. Those, of course, fewer and fewer nowadays, but we're going to be here waiting to see what, if anything, we hear. And it's worth noting before we go, Anna, we've been on this story for days. We've been walking around the countryside that borders the DMZ, and I thought it was so notable when we spoke with a farmer on Thursday who said he wants this to stop. He wants this tit-for-tat, the South Koreans sending their balloons and the North Koreans retaliating with trash balloons, just to stop because he thinks that, you know, it won't lead to anywhere and that it's certainly childish. But at this point, we're just waiting to see where is this tit-for-tat going to lead, Anna?",

And you could maybe call him Carlito's kryptonite because Sascha's five and four head-to-head against Alcaraz, including a win in the quarterfinals of this year's Australian Open.So with the big three out of the way, we're starting to see a lot of these new big names emerge.
