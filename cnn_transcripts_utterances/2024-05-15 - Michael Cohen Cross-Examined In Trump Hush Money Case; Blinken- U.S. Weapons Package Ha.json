      "sentences": "All right, 5A key day in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday with Michael Cohen facing cross-examination from defense lawyers for the first time. Trump's lawyers attempting to use Cohen's own words against him and to portray him as a man bent on revenge against his former boss. Cohen being asked -- Blanche: \"On your first podcast, Mea Culpa, you referred to President Trump as a boorish cartoon misogynist, didn't you?\" Cohen: \"It sounds like something I would say.\" And later -- Blanche: \"You recall the first one in 2020 as a Cheeto- dusted cartoon villain?\" Cohen: \"That also sounds like something I said.\" And finally -- Blanche: \"You think you might have said 'I truly f***ing hope that this man ends up in prison.' Is that exact?\" Cohen: \"It sounds like my language on Mea Culpa.\" That, of course, is one of his podcasts. In direct examination earlier in the day, Cohen told the court about a conversation with Trump after the FBI seized Cohen's phone records -- and records in a search warrant -- his phones and his records. Cohen testifying that Trump told him, \"Don't worry. I am the President of the United States. There is nothing here. Everything is going to be OK. Stay tough. You are going to be OK.\" Joining me now is trial attorney Kelly Hyman. Kelly, good morning to you. Thank you so much for being here. Let's start with the conclusion of the direct examination because it did seem to have some of these critical details about the ultimate break that Michael Cohen had with Trump and the subsequent fire that he came in for from the former president. What do you make of that sort of last admission there that was made and how it may impact whether or not there's ultimately a conviction? KELLY HYMAN, TRIAL ATTORNEY:  Well, when we look at this we have to think when he was on the witness stand he was very compelling -- Michael Cohen. He answered yes or no questions and was direct and to the point. And he reached a point in his life that basically he said he made a decision to pick his family over Trump, which was a very compelling story. I mean, American people love a comeback story. Something that did wrong that now is going to do something right. And on the cross-examination, the defense counsel came in very, very hot and very, very hostile. His first question out of the box was talking about defense counsel and how Michael Cohen portrayed him on TikTok. The judge pulled him over and said why are you making this about yourself? Why aren't you making this about Cohen, which was potentially an error. And there was no aha moment during the cross-examination. There was no moment of oh, I got you on this. So ultimately, it was a win for the prosecution.",

So here we have, allegedly, the President of the United States basically saying don't worry about anything. Be loyal to me and you're going to get out of free jail card, which goes to the fact that potentially of the whole kind of conspiracy.

That Ukraine lacks the troops, lacks the ammunition because it's been slow in coming from the United States and from other allies and partners? Is that what Russia is doing, or is it part of a broader Russian campaign to attack at the north end of these hundreds and hundreds of miles long front line?And it's attacking Zaporizhzhia -- the southern -- toward the southern end of that front line. And is its real intent to distract and pull off Ukrainian troops from other areas and then push more offensively in the center in the Donbas region, which is what they've been doing earlier this year? The effective is very clear. They're taking ground. They're taking ground just over the Russian border. They're perhaps about 15 miles from the very outskirts of Kharkiv, which is Ukraine's second-biggest city. So this is -- this is not without potential consequence. An important supply route and an important moral point for the Ukrainians, and kind of reinforces for them how weak and vulnerable they are. They've had to move troop positions along that front line overnight and they said they've turned to now sort of saving the troops' lives and equipment and repositioning to more -- to sort of better positions.

Coming out against a former president.We're entering into the final stretch -- well, close to the final stretch of campaign season. House Republicans -- Trump is their guy and they are standing firm behind him. That's the first significance. The second thing is I think that Speaker Johnson sees some political expediency and political benefit in terms of going down to Manhattan and defending the former president so sharply. And that's because we saw last week he had a first threat to his gavel. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene forcing a vote on ousting him from office. Former President Trump had expressed support for Johnson a number of times as Greene dangled this motion to vacate. We even saw President Trump put out a statement that came our right after the vote, but albeit still urged Republicans to vote to table this motion to vacate. So, clearly, Johnson sees that a good way to keep himself in office and keep himself protected from a conservative coup is aligning himself with former President Trump. He may be looking to try to keep his grasp on the gavel come next year and think that Trump could help him do that. So it's sort -- the significance is two-part. A) Johnson sees himself and his future tied to Trump. But also, this is sending a signal that House Republicans are behind President Trump.",
