But the truth of the matter is, it has to be, you know, if you have this much control, this much power, which CrowdStrike ends up having, then they have to be extra careful. I will say that it's not the first time we've seen something like this in the year. You know, we had the AT&amp;T outage, which was ultimately caused by a software update. So, people are not double checking these things. I understand the systems are incredibly complex. The complexity grows every day.

We're checking the numbers on the Democratic Party's top choices to possibly, if it happens, take over the ticket.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [08:43:07] KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: CNN's Isaac Dovere has new reporting this morning. Here it is. \"Multiple leading Democrats tells CNN that they feel caught in what one described as a 'doom loop' with every move to keep President Joe Biden in or push him out further destroying their chances against Donald Trump.\" This is just as sources also say that top Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, have told Joe Biden that the polling shows that he cannot defeat Donald Trump at this point. Biden has questioned that read on polling publicly before all of this. And one source says that he has been defensive about the polling privately since all of this. So, what do the polls say? Let me bring in CNN's Harry Enten for more on this. Harry, lay the groundwork. Where is Biden polling right now? What is everyone - what are they looking at?",

So, what we have here is, every single day of the 2024 calendar year, Joe Biden has been trailing Donald Trump. One hundred percent of the days. On any day you take a national average, Joe Biden has been trailing Donald Trump. Compare that to where we were back in the 2020 campaign, where every single day up to this point in the campaign Joe Biden was ahead of Donald Trump on 100 percent of the days.",

The benefits to President Biden were the Covid pandemic. You had completely high vote by mail. That's something that was unheard of, unprecedented in the history of our country. Those factors will not be the case this November.What you really saw during the convention this week was that Republicans were really focused on voters who typically don't vote. They don't really turn out in most elections. They're eligible. Maybe they're even registered. Specifically, younger men. I think if you're looking at places like Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, you're talking about differences of 11,000 votes, 22,000 votes. Those numbers will absolutely matter. And so I agree with you in terms of the intrigue, in terms of the television spectacle here. But at the end of the day, you still have to have that operations in place to turn out those voters.
