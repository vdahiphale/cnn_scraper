Just ahead, the Women's World Cup is starting to feel like a memory but the controversy over this unwanted kiss will not go away. We live in Valencia.A drama unfolds on two fronts in just two hours as the cases against Donald Trump and his allies enter a new phase and a migrant crisis in Lampedusa. The Italian government is looking for a solution after a record number of migrants arrived over the weekend. But first, we've got some breaking news into CNN Britain's National Air Traffic service warning the international flights may face delays due to what it's calling a technical issue. This is a live look at the planes above the U.K. NAT right now priority getting planes in the sky on the ground as opposed to the other way. The National Air Traffic System on NATS says traffic flow restrictions have been applied in order to maintain safety but U.K. airspace isn't closed. NATS says engineers are working to find and fix the fault and planes are being landed manually which of course slows the whole system down and has a huge knock on effect, probably to other countries as well. We'll keep across that for you. In the coming hours Spain's Football Federation would have what it calls an extraordinary and urgent meeting. It comes after FIFA suspended Federation President Luis Rubiales for 90 days after he kissed star player Jennifer on most of the Women's World Cup. Medal ceremony for its part of the Federation is defending Rubiales who is called the kiss mutual it's accusing most of lying and is threatening legal action against her. Jennifer Hermoso has said repeatedly that the kiss was not consensual. Her teammates on the 2023 World Cup winning squad and dozens of other athletes say they won't play for Spain until Rubiales is fired. Amanda is with us. It's extraordinary how long this is taking how much investigation into something that is you know, we've all seen and how the player seems to be getting the blame so far? AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yes. And up to this point, the Spanish Federation, the RFEF have stood by their man, Luis Rubiales he's been President since 2018. But he's a UEFA, Vice President of European football's governing body but it is now being reported that the Interim President after Rubiales was handed that suspension Petro Russia has called this meeting. They've said to evaluate the situation in which they find themselves and to look at the decisions or actions that have been taken. We don't know the form that the meeting will take. We don't know how long it will take. But it is a step that the Spanish football federations have taken. And there was always an Astros for a lot of people there at that final and watching around the world over Spain winning this World Cup because of the complaints over many years, multiple complaints about the setup, the organization's the structures, the treatments, around the players, and the coaches that haven't been taken seriously. They've been brushed under the carpet. But I think the thing that has made what has played out over the last eight days makes so many people sick to the stomach is how it has played out the utter defiance -- Rubiales.",

The stuff to celebrate that we saw play out in Australia and New Zealand. It just shows so how so far we have to go. But at least these questions aren't -- .",

      "sentences": "Yes, you know, I mean, this is a really astonishing number of people. The problem though is kind of twofold at this moment. Because that 4200 people that's a record that arrived on the island of Lampedusa, many of them arrived from Tunisia because there are no rescue boats out there.The Italian government has sequestered three of the NGO rescue boats for breaking various laws that they put in place to try to stop them from rescuing migrants. And so you've got the boats actually arriving. That's why these numbers are so big. That's why the photos and images are just so astonishing. Now the Italian government under Georgia Maloney reconvening this week after the long holiday break, they say they're going to look at two different things. First of all, they're going to look at maybe for the first time ever ways to allow people to immigrate legally into the country. That's never been a priority. Certainly not one that Giorgio Maloney has campaigned on, certainly. And the other thing we're going to look at are faster ways to deport people once they figure out where they're from, and if they're not from refugee producing countries to get them out of there. But they're really calling on the rest of Europe to help you know, Italy is the most porous longest water border in all of Europe. And the problem we've been saying that telling this story for years and years now the problem is always that it leaves one that has to deal with it and they want the rest of Europe to help. But you know, there's inclement weather coming that will stop the boats for the short term, but the season is just underway now. The boats will be coming for a very long time, Max, still.",

She met with the Chinese Commerce Minister on Monday calling the discussions very open and pragmatic.She says they reached a number of agreements. Let's bring in CNN's Beijing Bureau Chief Steven Jiang with more. I mean, there's one thing that two countries do agree on and that's that the economies are intertwined and dependent on each other.",

Now she is scheduled to have a press conference on Wednesday evening at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport, where Boeing has a large facility. There is also talk about her visiting to Shanghai Disneyland, of course, to highlight the success of such bilateral economic cooperation. But the challenge for her of course, is her agency. The Commerce Department is also the one that's been issuing a growing number of export controls targeting China, especially in the fields of advanced computing and semiconductors. The Biden administration, of course, has recently proposed to restrict American investments in these fields as well. So all of that greatly angering the Beijing leadership with Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader himself increasingly talking about a self-reliance in key technologies to free China from the American chokehold, because as he puts it, America is out to get China to contain China's rise. So renowned, of course, is going to make the argument to her counterparts that the export controls out of national security concerns is very narrowly focused accounting for only 1 percent of Americans export to China. So there's still a lot of room for growth for cooperation. But that kind of argument may not be very convincing to her Chinese counterparts when it comes to difference between de-risking as American officials have been putting it versus decoupling, but what's helping her mission of course, is the Chinese economy is facing its strongest headwinds in decades. So the Chinese leadership has been putting on this more business and investor friendly face at least outwardly so that gives them a more wiggle room to really stabilize this economic relationship, Max.",

      "sentences": "Max, this is going to be quite a pivotal day for the criminal cases against Donald Trump related to the 2020 election. There are two cases one in the state of Georgia and one in Washington D.C. brought by federal authorities.Both of the hearings today started at the same time. And they are both being handled by federal judges today. So in Georgia, a federal judge will be looking at part of the case that the District Attorney has some of the evidence that she has already. And then in Washington D.C., the federal judge there will be checking in with the lawyers on both sides, essentially laying out a timeline potentially for a trial in that case against Donald Trump in federal court, that federal court case against Donald Trump in D.C. The timeline has not been set, but it's quite possible. That will be one of the first trial dates we get out of all of the criminal indictments against Donald Trump for next year, or potentially even at the end of this year, which is what the Justice Department is asking for there. But here in Atlanta, this proceeding we have today related to the state case against Donald Trump and 18 others in the state of Georgia, we're trying to interfere with the election result here. What are happening in this courthouse are the judges taking a look at whether the case can move from the state system into the federal judiciary, because Mark Meadows and potentially others were Federal officers at the time of their activities after the election the things they're accused of doing that are now alleged crimes. What's happening in court is there will be evidence presentation, there will be witness testimony, and there will be discussion of the things that Meadows was taking part in including setting up phone calls with Donald Trump and officials in Georgia. And the judge may not make a decision today on what to do with the case. But it's an important moment where we get to see a little bit of a mini trial for the first time, Max.",

It all stems from this kiss after the country's World Cup victory player Jennifer Hermoso insists it was unwanted despite Rubiales claims.That it was mutual so with all of this controversy, how long can Luis Rubiales last? Atika Shubert joins us now from Valencia, Spain and a closer look. How to say Atika, so many items are managed earlier? So many people from outside the country so baffled not just what happened but the response and the defiance within the Spanish football industry particularly at the top.

Because while we are seeing a lot of a very aggressive defense by the Royal Football Federation, the Spanish Football Federation for Rubiales. We're also seeing many players and coaches actually condemning him.I mean, not only have the Spanish women's team now, refuse to play until he either resigns or is removed, but we've seen coaching staff resign as well, complaining against what he has done against this incident. So I think there are deep divisions here and it marks a turning point. I mean, Spain has already made great strides in women's rights legislation, gender legislation, but this is clearly an incident clearly shows that there is still a deeply entrenched views, particularly on women participating in sport. So it will be interesting to see what happens in about two hours' time. When, the Federation meets with the regional heads whether or not they continue to defend Rubiales or whether we're going to see some of those deeper divisions within the Federation itself, Max.",

Now those are the first steps to suspending him here in Spain. So what's likely to happen in this meeting is debate about what to do next, what are the next steps? There is also the possibility that this could have international repercussions whether or not this gets out to other regional bodies in Europe such as UEFA. These are all things that are possible and are likely to be discussed in that meeting. But the key is whether or not Rubiales will in fact, stay. At the moment, he is not even acting as President. There is a Vice President acting in his place because of this FIFA suspension. But that's not enough for his detractors who say that he must be removed completely.",
