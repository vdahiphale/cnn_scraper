The authorities first saying that they believe there was about five events that were still active, still spewing again lava hundreds of feet into the air. Now they say it's about three events that are still going. At the same time, the authorities do say there still is a lot of activity going on. And they say there could be new vents and new fissures opening up across that fault line that is going on there, with of course, a magma tunnel that goes all the way to the Atlantic Ocean.So, the authorities here definitely still very much on high alert. They've cordoned off the immediate area. Then you have that town of Grindavik, which has been so affected by all this. It was evacuated a long time ago. The residents have now been told that they can't go back until at least Christmas which of course, isn't really that surprising considering something that looks like the Gates of Hell has essentially just opened up in their backyard. Nevertheless, as of right now, luckily, no one has been injured in this eruption and the authorities do say that they have the situation under control, Kate. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Trump acknowledged there was an uproar over his comments at that rally in Iowa last night. He also insisted he has never read Hitler's autobiographical Mein Kampf.Just to let you know what that says, this is what Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf in 1925, all great cultures of the past perished only because the original creative race died out from blood poisoning. CNN's Alayna Treene is following this story from Washington DC. Alayna this has stirred a lot of fear amongst those in this country who are immigrants. What more can you tell us about how Donald Trump is handling this? and whether or not you think we're going to hear comments from him about Colorado?",

Well, Sara, I mean, as you pointed out, Donald Trump defended the comments that he had made at that rally on Saturday and over the weekend, likening immigrants to poisoning the blood of the country comments that the White House and other critics were very quick to condemn and argue for parroting the language of Adolf Hitler. Donald Trump pushed back on that criticism arguing that he had never read the Nazi dictators. manifesto.Take a listen to what he told people in Iowa last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's crazy what's going on? They're ruining our country. And it's true that destroying the blood of our country, that's what they're doing. They're destroying our country. They don't like it when I said that, and I never read Mein Kampf. They said oh, Hitler said that in a much different way. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And from my conversations with Donald Trump's team, they've continued to push back on the comparisons between his language and -- or the former president's language and Adolf Hitler. And again, arguing similar things that Donald Trump said last night that this is a very different type of scenario.Now, I do just want to point out as well, we know that Donald Trump has leaned in to very violent anti-immigration rhetoric in the past in the lead up in his past campaigns to 2016, and also, in 2020. He tried to invoke fear in voters, particularly when it came to the border and immigrants. It was a strategy that his team believed worked well. And he's doing that again now except his rhetoric has become even darker and even more violent. And I think it's also important, Sara, to just point out how the broader Republican Party is responding to this. We saw some Republicans like Senator Susan Collins and Senator Mike Rounds, reject what Donald Trump had said. Susan Collins called it deplorable. Others though, had deflected and some even argued that Donald Trump was right like Senator J.D. Vance have a very strong Trump ally, who argued that what Donald Trump had been saying was accurate. And so, you know, we're still seeing how the greater Republican Party is responding to this, but Donald Trump is definitely doubling down on those comments, Sara?",

But we know what they've been saying in the past, which is essentially, if Israel wants more hostages released, there needs to be a permanent ceasefire. Now, given the pressure on Hamas, you have half of the population of Gaza believed to be starving right now, with heartbreaking images of people fighting over the scraps of supplies, even climbing on to aid drops, you have obviously the uptick in civilian casualties, which is putting the pressure on Hamas and also on Israel. You had the accidental shooting death of three Israeli hostages over the weekend.So, Israel coming back to the table now, which is a shift in position for them. Will Hamas also shift in position? One thing that they're asking for, if there is going to be any sort of prisoner swap is for heavy hitters to be released. Heavy hitters, meaning potentially men who are charged with a crime here in Israel, as opposed to women and teenage prisoners that were handed over in exchange during the last round of, of a hostage release, which took more than a month to put together by the way, that deal didn't happen quickly. So, this is being happened. This is all happening right now with the help of intermediaries in Qatar, we understand -- and Hamas is one of the top leaders of Hamas, supposedly in Egypt right now, getting this message relayed to him, these negotiations according to an Israeli official Speaking to CNN here in Tel Aviv, this this type of deal will not happen quickly. People would love to see it happen as soon as possible. Certainly, the families of those Israeli hostages, and frankly, families on the Palestinian side as well would love to be reunited with their loved ones, but it's going to take some time, and the two sides still remain very far apart. But at least they're talking and at least there could be the possibility of a badly needed pause in fighting Israel offering potentially Sara a week, a pause for starters, and potentially even two weeks depending on the number of hostages released 129 believe to be in Gaza right now, 121 of them still alive, Sara.",
