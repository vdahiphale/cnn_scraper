What more do we know about that? And are we now, if in fact it is true, that we see him endorse Donald Trump? Could we see the two of them together on the campaign trail?",

And I do think it wouldbe probably very likely you'd see him on the campaign trail in various areas like Arizona, where they think it could give Donald Trump a real boost. Now, when it comes to RFK shopping around endorsements, one thing to note is that I asked Donald Trump specifically if he would be interested or even thought about giving an administration role to RFK. And he essentially said, yes, he had thought about it. Now, overall, I will say that, yes, when Joe Biden was in the race, it was a huge concern for both Democrats and Republicans. But there was still some concern, even among Democrats, that he could siphon votes away from Kamala Harris. And you're hearing some democratic grumbling today, even, that Democrats didn't do enough to try and garner RFK support or his base, that that could help Kamala Harris in the long run. Obviously, we don't know how this is going to play out. And even Donald Trump's team doesn't know. When you're talking to them on background about how this potential endorsement would work, no one is saying, OK, if he endorsed us, we'd get immediate six percent. They are just talking about handfuls of votes here and there. But again, we're talking about an election that right now feels like it could be determined by handful of votes. And so that is why you were seeing so much effort from Donald Trump's team around this. And I do want to note one thing. They have been very coy. Generally, they're, you know, talk a lot about what is exactly is happening with this endorsement, not going beyond this idea that they are just in high-level talks. And that could be because RFK has likely talked to both sides and they want to make sure that this is 100 percent before they get out there.",

That's kind of one of the great myths ofAmerican politics that the voters are out there saying, well, as soon as I see a white paper, you know, about highway infrastructure, I'm going to make up my mind. You know, it's just not true. And we've known this both in practical experience and actual research for decades that voters make a big decision. They say one candidate goes in a kind of general direction, the other candidate goes in a different general direction, and then I'll leave it to them to work out the details when they govern. But in this case, because Donald Trump is the kind of candidate who really defies talking about policy. This is -- he is very much a post-policy candidate. He runs on feelings and emotions and anger and revenge. And his party, which is my former party, no longer functions like a political party. It functions like a cult of personality. And you can't have an argument about policy with a cult of personality. Remember that the Republicans in 2020 didn't even bother writing a new platform. They just said, whatever Donald Trump says is our platform. There's no point in asking Kamala Harris to say, wow, if that's the case, then, you know, here's my plan for, you know, housing -- you know, increasing housing starts in 2026. That's a -- that's a -- that's a fool's errand to try to make that kind of argument. And I'm glad she avoided it.",

In the U.K., nobody would ever care about that. It's much more about the actual policy of the prime minister -- of the potential prime minister. Just in terms of, you know, personality and character, we're going to see all of that on full display in a couple of weeks at the debate.

And I think that's wonderful. I wish both parties would do that. But the Republicans are now the sort of dour, dark, you know, we need to get away from our allies and NATO sucks and Russia is not so bad. And I mean it really is a remarkable self-own by the Republicans that they have allowed the Democrats to become the party of foreign policy, the party of national security, the party of American patriotism.

And you look at some of the things that Kamala Harris talked about in her speech last night, this idea of being tough on immigration. Obviously, she is the daughter of immigrants, but she made it very clear that she's tough on immigration. And this idea that she does support the bipartisan border security bill.

In addition to those states, she could possibly even lose there if she does win in others, like Arizona, in Georgia and North Carolina. And all of them seem to be more or less in play right now. North Carolina, specifically is what we're talking about, given that your state's governor introduced Kamala Harris last night. Joe Biden put a lot of money and focus on winning that state and he wasn't making any inroads.

Now we've seen a change, and many are attributing just the bump that Kamala Harris has had in the past month as that being one of the major factors too, that now you have a younger candidate, someone who's different in at least one party. And, Steve, the focus is now on Trump being the candidate who was, you know, president in the past. He's now going to be the oldest candidate running for president with Joe Biden out of the race.

In North Carolina, I think there's a sense among Republicans that this is still a slightly red-leaning state. They feel like that they have enough voters. That even though it's a purple state, it's very close that the numbers are with them. They eked out a victory last time of 73,000 votes. They think there's enough people there.
