A Russian jet bombs its own side leaving a huge crater. British Deputy PM Dominic Raab resigns over bullying claims. And later this hour Manchester United crash out of Europe again. While millions of Muslims around the world celebrates the Eid Al-Fitr holiday, there's word of yet another temporary ceasefire for Sudan, but it's unclear what is actually happening on the ground. Video released by Sudan's armed forces shows fighters marching through an area near Khartoum. Nearly a week of fighting has left millions there without food, without water or power. And 70 percent of hospitals in the capital remain closed. Earlier Sudan's armed forces leader appeared on television to address the violence but made no mention of a new ceasefire. The military later said it would comply with the 72-hour truce announced by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces if the RSF does the same. Nima Elbagir is following developments for us from London. Great to have you on, Nima. Here we are again. This is a situation where we've seen three failed ceasefires. Now I guess both sides attempting to see another ceasefire through as Eid Al-Fitr holiday begins, but reports of the military making their way near Khartoum painting a very different picture on the ground of whether this is actually plausible.",

And those are the reports that we're receiving from around the capital, around the administrative capital which actually falls on either side of the banks of the River Nile. Khartoum Omdurman and Khartoum North, so it doesn't really feel like what we're hearing on the air is actually being implemented on the ground, and if anything, the fighting today is being described as the most intense.

Well, a huge blast in the Russian city of Belgorod left behind a 20-meter crater in the city center. That's according to the regional governor. Moscow says the explosion in Belgorod, which is close to Ukraine, was caused by an accidental or emergency drop of munition from a Russian air force jet. Two women were injured. Meanwhile, we're getting reports of new attacks on Ukraine's capital. The Ukrainian Air Force says at least 12 drones were launched over Kyiv earlier today breaking 25 days of calm, according to one city officials.

Now we don't know the details of what kind of ordnance it dropped, where it was going, but certainly this is -- for the Russians it's a bit of an own goal. Belgorod is a town that has actually been struck by the Ukrainians over the last year, since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion, and it's significant that all the Russian towns and cities around the Ukrainian border and within Russian occupied Ukraine are canceling mayday celebrations because of the violence that is spilling over into Russia.

Deputy prime minister is not a formal constitutional role, but Raab is a big beast in British politics and in the governing Conservative Party, having held the roles of foreign secretary and Brexit secretary. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak launched this probe several months ago to address complaints about Raab's bullying behavior. Raab had committed to resign if the inquiry made any finding of bullying whatsoever. So Raab resigned Friday, but said the report was flawed and in setting the threshold for bullying so low this inquiry is a dangerous precedent. He said that ministers must be able to give direct critical feedback on briefings and submissions to senior officials in order to set the standards and drive the reform the public expect of us. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak accepted the resignation and responded in a letter, writing, \"As you say you had rightly undertaken to resign if the report made any finding of bullying whatsoever. You have kept your word, but it is clear that there have been shortcomings in the historic process that have negatively affected everyone involved. We should learn from this how to better handle such matters in the future.\" Raab's resignation is the third from Sunak's Cabinet since he became prime minister in October, 2022. The others, Gavin Williamson and Nadhim Zahawi had to resign because of allegations of bullying and a lack of transparency over tax affairs, respectively. This is a difficult look for a prime minister behind in the polls who committed to a government of integrity in his very first speech as leader of the country on the steps of Downing Street.

That is on Sunday night in the U.S., Monday morning in Asia and here in the UAE. You do not want to miss it. Right. Unacceptable. That is the line. That is the succinct description of Manchester United's performance directly from their manager after the club's quarter final loss to Sevilla. Amanda Davies is here with more on this very disappointing result for Man U. Great to have you on, and let me tell you, your own manager throwing such shade something definitely went wrong.",

As a Manchester United fan who has invested so many hours and so much love inthis team, I would much rather have just had a whole lot more from Bill Weir, because I found that discussion absolutely fascinating. But, yes, there are so many questions about what is going wrong at Manchester United, almost as many questions that we're asking about what's going wrong with the planet. We're going to be looking ahead to that in a couple of minutes in \"WORLD SPORT,\" but we've also got some heartbreaking news of the England women's captain Leah Williamson, who has been ruled out of the women's World Cup with less than three months to go. So we've got an update from her. She's been speaking out for the first time and that's coming up in a couple of minutes.",
