They don't have to worry about paying right now while this plays out in the courts and interests won't accrue. But there's a couple other constant questions that I think borrowers need to know about. First of all, this could delay some student loan forgiveness for some borrowers that are pursuing that. This could delay this by months. And second of all, you can't actually switch into a different loan plan right now. And so some experts are really worried about new grads. They just graduated and they might not be able to get into a plan that helps lower their payments before their first bill is due this fall.",

I first want to start with a new FOX News poll that has Kamala Harris leading donor Donald Trump in your state by two points, though that's within the margin of error. What do you think will ultimately determine where Georgia lands on election night? BOBBY SAPAROW, FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR GA GOV. BRIAN KEMP: Yes, I think it's important to notice, as someone who works on campaigns, that I view polls more as trends less than fact. So obviously, it's trending that Kamala Harris has made this a serious race. And Georgias a very tough state for either -- for both Donald Trump or Kamala Harris to win. But I think the main point that Donald Trump should focus on is the economy and getting Kamala Harris to actually articulate what her agenda in policy positions are. I think, as Georgians and Governor Kemp's done a fantastic job of talking about the economy. He got us through Covid. There's a lot of great policy points that he hit on during his 2022 race. But what Donald Trump needs to focus on and I think the message he needs to try and hit voters with is, are you better off today or are you better off four years ago? And I think if he can do that, he'll get right back on track and I think he'll be in a good position to win. But to your point about the poll, two points, you know, Kamala's up two points, we're playing a little bit of catch-up, but I still think Georgia's Trump's to lose.",

I can't speak on why President Trump did it, but I think there's a new approval number out for Governor Kemp today that had him at 64 percent.I think everyone in the state knows Governor Kemp's the most popular elected official here by a pretty good margin. And I also think it's important -- and I listened to the clip of Governor Kemp before. He said for over a year, he would support the Republican nominee. He's continued to do that and kept his promise. But one of the things I think is also important is Governor Kemp in his political operation have created a great ground game that was created back in 2022. That I think will be very important for the Trump campaign but also top-to-bottom candidates across the board, for that turnout operation to come into full effect and have a huge impact on Donald Trump winning the state of Georgia.",

There was higher turnout for both Republicans and Democrats. There was less -- less wait times to vote, which is a big gripe that Democrats have had since 2018, that I think will bring confidence to the 2024 election. That President Trump should feel confident that the outcome of this race will be -- will be safe can secure.",

There's also been Stacey Abrams and the Democrats who have been harping similar messages.I think the point of it is the Governor Kemp believes the election was legitimate. Obviously, in elections, not everything is perfect. But I think the Election Integrity Act helped voters. And I hope Georgia voters are hearing this. It created a great opportunity to prove that elections are safe and secure. But also the University of Georgia conducted a poll in the 2022 election, 99 percent said there was no issues, 97 percent had under five-minute wait times, and over 90 percent said they felt it was safe and secure. So I think it's a positive momentum for the 2024 election just to show that voters should feel confident that this election will be secure and safe, and that there shouldn't be any issues with there being any, quote, unquote, \"cheating\"",

The deaths have been reported in New Jersey Virginia, Florida, Tennessee, New Mexico, New York Illinois and South Carolina. And, Brianna, the CDC has been investigating this outbreak since last month. And July is when Boar's Head recalled seven million pounds of its deli meat. And so, Brianna, this is becoming something that is of concern. The recalled products contain the established number 12612 on their packaging. So that's what you went to look for inside the USDA mark of inspection. If you have any recalled products in your refrigerator, throw them out.

And so their illness wasn't reported. So this outbreak could possibly be larger than we realize. And that's why, again, it's important to check your refrigerator, look for any recalled products. If you do have recalled products, keep in mind, refrigeration does not kill the stereotype so that's why it is important to throw out anything that's been recalled.",
