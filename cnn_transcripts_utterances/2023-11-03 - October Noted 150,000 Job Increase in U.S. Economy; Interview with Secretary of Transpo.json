      "sentences": "Well, it's hard to read too much into going from one month to the next month. The overall pattern, of course, is extraordinary job growth and the extraordinary fact that unemployment is and remains below four percent. To get to your question about infrastructure, what excites me is that we have infrastructure work we're launching today that will be creating good jobs throughout this decade.Some of the projects that we have underway. There's more than I think 31, 000 just on the transportation side alone. Some of them will be done in one construction season. Simple, relatively small projects. Others rebuilding an airport terminal or the Hudson Tunnel that we're starting work on today, those will be generating good paying jobs for years because they're so complex. So, this isn't just an investment in one season. It's not just about goosing demand. It's about long-term investments in the capacity of this country with a lot of jobs created along the way.",

Republicans -- the government, by the way, as you gentlemen, both those about to shut down again in a couple of weeks unless something is done about it. Republicans over the summer and through the last almost shut down, were trying to pass some measures that would claw back some of the money from the infrastructure bill. How does that complicate what you're doing?",

And as the secretary said just a minute ago, we already have 38,000 projects going on in the country, rebuilding roads and bridges and airports and ports, waterways, high speed internet, clean energy economy. For example, we're breaking ground today on the Hudson Tunnel because we want to fix the Northeast Corridor. The president thinks that we ought to have world class rail.So, it's a little bit curious to us that some folks on the Republican side and the House on the Hill actually want to make rail go slower and be less safe and not help people get to and from where they're going. So, we hope that they don't make the unfortunate decision to try to leverage a government shutdown and stop this progress that we've made. As the Secretary said just a minute ago, since the President's been in office, created 14. 5 million jobs, that's a lot of money going into people's pockets to build generation of wealth. And that's what the president talks about when he says that we're going to make a better America.",

That means investing in things like ports. Today we're announcing 41 port projects around the country from a slack water harbor on the Arkansas River to improvements in -- for some of our biggest container ports like Newark or Long Beach, California.But what they just voted through committee and what House Republicans want to do would take a hundred million dollars out of the funding for our port's programs. I don't know why you would do that. It also shorts our FAA systems, equipment and technology by about $500 million compared to what the president put forward. I just don't know how anybody who's been on an airplane lately would think this is a time to do less on aviation.",

The idea that people who are gay can be turned not gay, and this is something that's been widely discredited and considered dangerous over time. And back then he's quoted as saying, \"Homosexual behavior is something you do, it's not something that you are.\" And since he's been confirmed as speaker just last week, he did an interview where he talked a little bit about this. I want you to listen to what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER:  When the Supreme Court issued the Obergefell opinion, that became the law of the land, OK?

A beautiful boy and girl, twins, two years old. And our family deserves to be protected. It deserves to be supported, just like every American family.Most Americans get that. Most Americans believe that. I will admit it's a little bit difficult. Driving the family minivan to drop our kids off at daycare, passing the dome of the Capitol knowing that the Speaker of the House sitting under that dome doesn't even think our family ought to exist. But that's one of many, many reasons why I'm grateful to live under the protection of the Constitution, which according to the Supreme Court established our right to have that family, and serving under a President who is making sure that everybody is included and protected, including families like mine.",

And if you really are pro-family, if you care about families, if you want to support families, then you have to support things like the president's push to have insulin be $35, which we were able to do for seniors and would do for everybody if House and Senate Republicans hadn't blocked it.If he really cares about families, maybe take another look at the child tax credit, which cut child poverty in this country in half. And then when they let it expire, because people like Mike Johnson were against it, the child poverty rate doubled again. Let's talk about what it really means to support families, whether it's LGBTQ plus individuals or any other family in America trying to get through life. All I can do, from the seat that I'm in, is try to support American families with better infrastructure. Whether it's the 2nd Avenue subway that we're going to be doing work on today, the Hudson Tunnel that hundreds of thousands of people count on to get to where they need to be in the New York area, or the supply chains were improving that they go into how a family puts a box of cereal on the table.

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, I think -- you know, for me, the headline in that speech was he repeatedly said that this was a Palestinian only operation, e.i., Hezbollah wasn't involved. Iran wasn't involved. The Palestinians kept it secret.Now, of course, he's going to make all sort of rhetorical attacks on Israel and celebrate what happened on October 7th, and that's all to be expected. But will he actually engage in a full-scale war with Israel? I think right now, the conventional wisdom is that's unlikely. There are a bunch of reasons for that. One, the last time it happened, it was sort of a draw in 2006 when Israel fought Hezbollah. Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, who we just heard from, certainly derived quite a lot of, kind of, praise in the Arab world for effectively handing a bit of a stalemate to the Israelis in 2006. But it was very damaging to Lebanon, billions of dollars of damage. Now, Lebanon has had a, you know, as you know, Kate as -- in an economic freefall right now. And so, I think the appetite for a war with Israel is surely less than it might be otherwise. But you know, one -- what could change things is if the Gaza war goes on for weeks or months, you know, the pressure on Nasrallah might rise. But I took away from that speech that there was no kind of definitive. We're going to declare a war on Israel. And he was at pains to say that they had nothing to do with what happened on October 7th.",

We heard from the FBI director just this week that the October 7th attack is serving as a big boost to terror groups. This is how Ray put it, we assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration, the likes of which we haven't seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate several years ago. This speaks to the need of just -- for Israel and allies of not just taking out Hamas, but taking on the Hamas ideology. How hard is this?",

You know, if you go back to the 9/11 era, you know, bin Laden was always talking about Palestine and the Palestinian issue and all his public statements. And since then, jihadist terrorist groups that -- at that issue has receded in favor of sort of the anti-Shia message that we saw from Isis. But clearly, as the FBI director, Christopher Ray, and others who testified just this week said al Qaeda, ISIS, other groups are seizing on the Palestinian issue again and they're using it for propaganda purposes.And I think their statements speak for themselves that they're certainly very concerned about it, and we've seen a rise in antisemitic incidents around the world. We've also, of course, seen Islamophobic murder in the United States of a six-year-old boy. So, on both sides of the issue, in the United States, where is kind of elevated emotion and that may lead people to violence.",
