A 71-year-old man is facing attempted murder charges for Wednesday shooting attack. Officials have described the suspect as a lone wolf. He apparently told police he was motivated by his disagreement with the government and its reforms. Prime Minister Fico is still hospitalized and in serious condition. He's had several surgeries. The Slovak President-elect said Fico is conscious and able to speak. Our Fred Pleitgen just now from the capital of Bratislava with the very latest.

Now, as you've already pointed out, this man apparently had disagreements, says the government here put it, with a lot of the government policies. One of the things that of course, internationalized this all this a little bit, is that one of the main disagreements that apparently he had with the government was the fact that the Fico government was cutting off aid to Ukraine, which of course, right now fighting against Russia. So, therefore, they believe that all this is politically-motivated. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): After getting shot five times in broad daylight, Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico's condition remains difficult, officials say, even though the wounds are no longer life threatening. (on camera): This is exactly the place where Robert Fico was shot, and you can see on that tree over there that there is a hole with a forensic teams appear to have carved something like a projectile out of the bark. Now, he suffered several gunshot wounds and had to be air-medevaced into a hospital nearby.

Donald Trumps' lead attorney is attempting to hammer away atthe credibility of one of the prosecution star witnesses, trying to portray him as a serial liar, determined to exact revenge on the man he once said he'd take a bullet for. Michael Cohen being grilled by the defense once again at Trump's hush money trial in New York. Cohen questioned about all of the times he previously lied under oath, also, whether he held a grudge against Trump because he wasn't given a job in the Trump White House. Trial is at a critical phase. Trump's former fixer will be the last witness for the prosecution, not clear whether the defense will call anyone to the stand, but we are in the final days. Joined now by criminal defense attorney Joseph Tully. Good to have you on, sir. Clearly, the intent today of the defense was to diminish Michael Cohen's credibility. We expected this going into the trial, and to do so, they brought up a number of instances, including instances where he was charged with perjury in 2018, where he lied when he met with the special counsel in August 2018 as well as other instances. Did in your view, the defense hit their mark in undermining his credibility or were his answers sufficient?",

So, kind of cuts both ways. And in my view, such cross-examination had to be very delicate, and you want to keep it very compartmentalize, where you know, you want to show that Michael Cohen is a liar and that Trump isn't.

Thank you very much Now, we turn now to the gang violence that has been raging now for weeks and months in Haiti. The capital Port-au-Prince has been cut off for more than two months Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds more have been kidnapped, including more than 20 children. Right now, the country is being led by a transitional council after the prime minister, if you remember, he resigned last month. On the ground civilian contractors are preparing for a Kenyan led international security force to basically arrive and attempt to restore orders. A small force, I should add, but it's not yet clear when that will be. The U.N. says the humanitarian situation, it's cataclysmic Roughly 5 million people are going hungry and aid groups say that getting help to those in need is increasingly dangerous is something we have heard from the World Food Programme here on the show. My next guest is a photographer who has just returned from Haiti where he's been documenting life of the millions of civilians trapped amid the violence. Describing Port-au-Prince, he writes, the city I knew and I visited for the last 14 years is not a full-blown war zone in many areas. Streets where we drove 12 weeks ago are now empty and under gang control. No go zones. And photographer Giles Clarke joins me now. Giles, welcome back to the show. I mean, you were in Haiti. My team tells me until Sunday, I believe. So, just lay out what you have been seeing. As you heard there, the U.N. is saying the situation is cataclysmic. Is that a fair assessment in your view?",

And gangs have just wiped through complete areas and burnt houses and displaced 95,000 the last month alone. So, it's impossible for them to find work.

Court now back in session after a lunch break. Our Jessica Schneider joins us now. And Jessica, in addition to going after his overall credibility, citing past instances of lying under oath, the defense zeroed in on a phone call in October 2016, which Cohen testified to earlier in the week to say that was when he told Trump that a payment had been made to Stormy Daniels, in effect, taken care of.

And in particular, not just his credibility, but specific testimony that he's given about, you know, the heart of this case, the Stormy Daniels payment. So, you know, this is a line of questioning that started before the lunch break and it continued after the lunch break. I mean, basically the takeaway is that Michael Cohen had previously testified during the direct examination when prosecutors were asking him questions that he had spoken on October 24th, 2016 to Donald Trump via this phone call to Keith Schiller, who was Donald Trump's security guard body man. That they had talked about, sort of, the Stormy Daniels deal and it potentially being done or almost done. Interestingly, when the defense got up today, they had text messages that showed an exchange between Keith Schiller and Michael Cohen in the moments before that phone call was made. And the text messages were actually about something completely different. Apparently a 14-year-old prankster had been texting Michael Cohen and Michael Cohen was getting very flustered by it, frustrated, annoyed. So, he pinged Keith Schiller, Keith Schiller said, call me. And then there was that phone call in question. It was about a 96 second phone call. So, the defense's point here, which seems to have, you know, resonated in the courtroom was that, are you sure that this conversation was really about Stormy Daniels? You had just been texting about this 14-year-old prankster. Michael Cohen came back and said, well, it was about both. But Jim, I mean, that definitely cast some doubt on Michael Cohen's previous testimony. You know, it wasn't the only time he had testified about Stormy Daniels. So, does it completely kill the prosecution's case? Of course not. But it does start to, probably of all the lines of questioning we've seen so far, I think it gives the biggest doubt to jurors. Huh, is Michael Cohen telling the absolute truth here? And did he have these conversations with Donald Trump like he says he did about the Stormy Daniels payment? It just -- has that cast that doubt in the jury's mind,",
