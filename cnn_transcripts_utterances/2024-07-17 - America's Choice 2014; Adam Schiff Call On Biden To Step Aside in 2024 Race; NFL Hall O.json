My co-anchor and good friend, Brianna Keilar is live for us in Washington, DC.And here in Milwaukee, it's day three of the RNC. Tonight, former President Trump's new running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, will take center stage to deliver the most important speech of his political career thus far. It's notable, Senator Vance is the first veteran on a major party ticket since John McCain back in 2008. The theme tonight is Make America strong once again, with a heavy focus not only on border security but foreign policy as well. Today, Republicans will feature some of Trump's staunchest supporters, as well as a slate of former servicemembers and Gold Star families. Let's get the latest now from CNN is Kristen Holmes and Alayna Treene. So, Kristen, what more should we expect from night three at the convention?",

This is going to be kind of an outline, or at least trying to build up Donald Trump's foreign policy credentials, even though he doesn't really like to talk about foreign policy on the campaign trail.Now, the most notable speaker, as you mentioned, is going to be Senator JD Vance. This is really his big debut. Yes, he's done some interviews since he was picked to be Donald Trump's vice president but this is his first time on the national stage, talking to the people. Now, the other person who's very interesting is who's going to introduce him, which is his wife, Usha Vance. She and herself is a fascinating human being. She met him at Yale Law School. She was a trial lawyer. And she is somebody that he has credited with almost all of his success. Now in addition to the two of them, you're going to hear from Don Jr., Trump's son, obviously, staunch supporter, also big ally of JD Vance. Kellyanne Conway still advises the president, was in charge of his 2016 campaign, as well as Representative Matt Gaetz, big ally, Nancy Mace, et cetera. But again, big highlight tonight, big person everybody's watching JD Vance.",

      "sentences": "I do. So I've spoken with someone who helped work on the remarks. And they essentially said the big focus for JD Vance tonight is about telling his life story. And I think anyone can agree, whether you like JD Vance or not, that he has an incredible journey. You know, he grew up in a poor Rust Belt town in Ohio. He came from a very unstable childhood, his family struggled with opioid addiction, all things he talks about in his book, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"But then he went on to become a Marine. He went to Yale Law School. He was a successful venture capitalist, and he's only been in the Senate for a year-and-a-half. And now, he is Donald Trump's running mate. And so, he's going to talk a lot about that. Now, Kristen also mentioned a big focus on foreign policy. That is actually an area where JD Vance does very well. It's a key focus of his. And I think you can hear -- you'll hear a lot of his populist messaging when it comes to that. But of course, an area where him and Donald Trump agree mostly, and you can expect that everything he is going to say are things that the Trump campaign has looked at before, make sure they're aligned on and that they'll be, you know, embracing when he talks. I do want to read a quote for you though, very briefly, because I think this just encapsulates how they're thinking about this. So the source familiar with JD Vance, his remarks told me if you want to crack suburban women, get them to watch the screen adaptation of Vance's memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" His life story is so powerful, expect a lot of focus on his bio and life story. So again, I think you're going to hear him really trying to pull on those personal stories, kind of like what we saw last night with some of the other speakers.",

I do want to ask you about foreign policy, because that's where the focus is shifting tonight, with a keynote from the vice presidential nominee JD Vance.He seems to favor this more isolationist America first view, specifically on Ukraine. What does his nomination tell you about Ukraine policy and a potential second Trump term?",

      "sentences": "I mean, vice presidents don't matter all that much. Trump is what matters. And luckily, I have four years of a Trump presidency to go off of. And in that four years, Putin invade Ukraine. And the reason was, you know, this is this is hearsay but I'm sure everybody's reported on it, what did he tell Putin? He said he would bomb Moscow if they invaded Ukraine. He was a real tough talker.Peace through strength actually matters, and the strength part is what's difficult. You have to say uncomfortable things and you have to be willing to put your money where your mouth is. Trump proved that over and over again. He proved it when he when he took out Soleimani from Iran, for instance. And, you know, he proved it when he escalated in Syria, Sometimes you have to escalate in order to deescalate, and to beat ISIS so that you can pull out in a manner that's responsible. He did not have a disaster in Afghanistan the way Biden did. So when I actually look at Trump's foreign policy, I'm generally pretty happy with it. I don't see it as isolationist. I don't see it as retracting from the world. You know, he says a lot of things that make allies uncomfortable that because he's trying to get them to do more, and that's a good thing. I'm unclear on where on where the vice president stands on these things. He seems unclear on it. But in the end, it's what Trump believes. And, look, you cannot go back to a pre-World War II world where wars of conquest are OK and we just greenlight them. Because you know what you're gonna get, a lot more of them. And then your children will not have the same global economy that we have now. So there's a divide on that, right. I'm on one side of it. There's other Republicans on the other side of it. There's Democrats on both sides of that. That's always been a divide in American politics. It will continue to be and we're going to continue to have those discussions.",

When Obama was giving Ukraine, you know, blankets, Trump was giving them weapons.So I'm not as worried about the Trump presidency. It again it sure J.D.

I don't even want to have that possibility in mind. What we need to be doing, what we should all be aligned in doing. And I think we are, this is pretty bipartisan, is making sure that Taiwan is impenetrable. You want to make it so costly on the Chinese to even think about invading Taiwan that we don't have to make that decision about whether we'd actually go to war over it.Now, it's worth noting, the economic consequences of an invasion to Taiwan are massive, massive for the world, right? Ninety percent of the most advanced semiconductors are produced there. And that's not changing anytime soon, that's not just some infrastructure that you can just create all of a sudden. And, look, we have this argument with colleagues, I guess on both sides, all the time. You have to understand global economics and the reason you have all the great things you do for the last 80 years ever since D-Day. And it's because America led the world. And if you retract from that, your kids will have a much a much poorer and less prosperous lifestyle than you have. And that's the debate we're going to continue to have. That's why American leadership is important. It isn't -- and this is why I say to my friends to, you cannot call it America First when you basically are allowing and greenlighting China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, North Korea to run the world economy, and run the world and dictate everyone's actions. That's America last. That'll continue to be a debate.",
