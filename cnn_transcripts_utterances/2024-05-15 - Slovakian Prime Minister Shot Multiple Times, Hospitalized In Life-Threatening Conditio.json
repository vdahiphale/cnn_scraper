Right now, we're told he's in the hospital in the life-threatening conditions. Here's a photo of him being carried away on a gurney just a short time ago. The latest reports say the shooting happened after a government meeting earlier today. Slovakian officials say the suspect was detained at the scene.A manhunt, meanwhile, is underway in France after gunmen ambushed a prison van, killing two guards and freeing a notorious inmate. Three other guards were wounded in the attack. Interpol has put out a red notice for the fugitive. And in Ukraine right now, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he's postponing all foreign engagements, at least for now, as Russia makes gains in the eastern city of Kharkiv. Take a look at this. A powerful Russian aerial weapon known as a glide bomb hit this apartment building. The U.S. is hoping a financial infusion of military aid can stem the losses. The Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, announcing an additional two billion dollars in military financing for Ukraine. CNN's Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Payton Walsh is near Kharkiv. Nick, how critical is this moment for Ukraine? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "All right. It's a deep, deep grave situation north of Ukraine's second- largest city, Kharkiv. And it's getting worse, frankly, day by day. We're now five or six days on from when the Russians first crossed the border again and what some dubbed a third invasion heading from their territory into parts of Ukraine.They'd been kicked out nearly two years ago now. And in fact, it's depressing to be here, not far from Vovchansk. And just remember how two years ago this was a frontline area, and then we saw the Russians pushed out because their supply lines essentially had crumbled. Now, they have their act together it seems, and have on mass crossover. We're talking double digits, possibly a village as they claim to have seized. Vovchansk, the key town north of Kharkiv, on the border, that's really the focus of the fighting. Ukraine's military making an admission that they had to \"execute some kind of tax call withdrawal,\" but saying they put their forces in better positions around it. Essentially, suggesting the Russians have pushed them back a little. And a police chief inside the town has been reporting today hearing extensive sounds of gunfire in and around the town there. So, a lot moving around Vovchansk. Russia clearly coming at this with extensive resources. Ukraine is struggling to respond in kind. Remember, that the lay of the $61 billion of U.S. aid for about six months has already had an impact across the frontlines in the east. And now, we're seeing it more acutely where they're being frankly outgunned by Moscow. Without the artillery, they can't stop advancing forces. Desperate need too for F-16s in the air here as well. The situation is so grave that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine has canceled his forthcoming trip abroad. There were hints he was going to Europe. Remember, so much of his job still is going around his allies shopping for aid, making the case for continued and better support for Ukraine. That is now not going to happen for the days ahead because things are so acutely bad here. Clearly, Russia has in its sights, the second biggest city Kharkiv. Still pretty far out but its guns might soon be in range. And remember too, all of this distracts forces from frontlines that have already seen Russian advances over the past days or weeks, in some cases too, a new phase of the war here utterly desperate. And one, frankly, that the slowdown in U.S. military aid is significantly to blame for. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Staryi Saltiv, just north of Kharkiv, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Most of the operation in Rafah right now is still on the outskirts of the city and still pretty, you know, relatively targeted, at least that's what I hear from both Israeli and U.S. officials.

And I think that Sullivan's message to Netanyahu is going to be, listen, you have two choices here.You can go to Rafah which will be a -- maybe a tactical victory, but also maybe a strategic defeat.

President Biden and former President Trump agreeing to debate at CNN's Atlanta studios on June 27. In just a few weeks. That's the earliest televised presidential debate in American history.But while Trump agreed to Biden's terms, including that there'll be no audience, this is what's new. He's calling up President Biden to face him not twice, but four times, saying \"there should be more than just two opportunities for the American people to hear more from the candidates themselves.\" Earlier this hour, President Biden's principal deputy campaign manager told me that's off the table at this time, saying the president did not mince words when he said two debates.

The Trump campaign has been very frustrated behind the scenes with how the Commission on Presidential Debates has been running. That's what they've been telling me.And part of it is because -- is that they want as many debates as possible, as I said. And they want these to be earlier. They think that if they wait too long until they get up to the election, that many voters will already be casting their votes via early voting that the debates won't matter as much.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, host of CNN's \"CHASING LIFE\" podcast. You are what you eat. GUPTA (voiceover): We all know the foods that we eat every day affect how our bodies function. But it also turns out food is deeply connected to how well our brains function as well. Look, we're all unique, but there are some rules that can help lead to a more well- nourished brain. Omega Three-rich foods, like fatty fish and almonds, that can be helpful for cognition. High fiber and folate-rich foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, probiotics and fermented foods, and yogurts, they can help reduce anxiety and depression. Also, the serotonin and foods like bananas and the tryptophan and salmon or pineapple can make us feel happy and calm. On the other hand, some foods can hurt our moods. The risk for depression and anxiety can actually increase with ultra-processed and sugary foods like donuts and candies or fast food.",
