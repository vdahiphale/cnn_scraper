It is 2:00 a.m. here in Atlanta, 8:00 a.m. in Gaza where we're waiting to see if more foreign nationals are able to cross the border into Egypt. Now for the first time since the war began, the Rafah border crossing opened Wednesday to several 100 foreign nationals, including aid workers, who had been stuck at the border. The U.S. State Department believes about 1000 Americans and their families are still in Gaza and trying to leave. Here's U.S. President Joe Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Local hospital officials say at least 80 people were killed.The U.N. Human Rights Office said the scale of devastation and high civilian casualties, \"could amount to war crimes.\" The IDF says a Hamas command center was the target. CNN's Clare Sebastian is covering all of this for us from London. Good to see you, Clare. And I want to turn to that situation at the border.

The U.S. has said that it expects to see more people certainly when it comes to foreign U.S. in particular passport holders leave in the next several days. We know from sources in Qatar that the deal that was brokered encompasses everyone, as we understand it that holds foreign passports that is in Gaza and wants to leave.So, the expectation is that they will very slowly be allowed out. Slow being the operative word because we know from the U.S. Secretary Blinken say that Americans and their families' number around 1000. That's third country nationals number around 5000. So, the 361, who were allowed to leave on Wednesday is a small number of that. It is though a fluid situation. Case in point, we weren't actually expecting any Americans to be allowed to leave on Wednesday, a couple were allowed. It is also very cumbersome. It was very cumbersome and bureaucratic, even before this conflict to get through the Rafah border crossing. You need permits from each side. It could take weeks to get them and we know that it is even more so now because Egypt is vetting everyone who goes through the backdrop to this as, of course, the Egyptian fear that they could end up being inundated by a flood of Palestinian refugees coming in to the Sinai Peninsula. So, a very tightly controlled process and separate, of course, from the ongoing Qatar brokered negotiations to get those more than 200 hostages out of the Gaza Strip. We know now very clearly that the U.S. and potentially others believe that this process is being complicated by the accelerating Israeli ground and air offense if President Biden at that fundraiser that you just showed him out on Wednesday was interrupted by a protester asking him about a ceasefire and did say that he supported a pause in Gaza \"to get those prisoners out.\" There is no sign at the moment than any kind of pause is happening quite the opposite.

Now, of course, there are protocols, Li was the former number two leader, as you mentioned, so a service arrangement or announcement surrounding his death differ, those reserved for former top leaders like Jiang Zemin, when he died late last year.But perhaps more importantly, historically, the death of a popular former leader tends to become a galvanizing moment, uniting people and not only in their grief, but in their sheer frustration, grievances and discontent about the current regime, and sometimes, of course, that has led to protests and arrests, including in 1989. That's why we are seeing extremely tight security in central Beijing today, and censors going into overdrive on China's already very much tightly-controlled social media platforms, and our conversation right now, of course, also being censored. A lot of people are still in disbelief as you can imagine over the sudden death, because he was so young, just a few months after his official retirement. And this theme that seems to have emerged from a lot of the comments, sometimes subtle, sometimes not so subtle is the stark contrast between Li, a highly-educated, reformed mind, a technocrat with humble beginnings to the current strongman leader Xi, under him, as you said, served for decades, as normally, the number two beside himself, increasingly sidelined with the two. Not seeing eye-to-eye, a lot of policy issues, and with Xi, of course, re-asserting the party's absolute control over every aspect of the Chinese society, including the economy which was supposed to be Li's portfolio. You know, Li really saw himself becoming ineffective, meeting resistance for a lot of things he supported. Like the private sector, like continued openness to the outside world. So, in that sense, observers say, Paula, that people are not just mourning his passing, but the loss of their last glimmer of hope of what China could have been under a different leader going in a different direction.",
