Ukrainians watching those images will, of course, know that that is what they endure every single night across the country.But this is extraordinary series of drones trikes not overtly claimed by Ukrainian forces. They've simply said obliquely, their air force that the tranquil backwaters of Moscow are no longer so. But this appears to have been, according to Russian officials, three drones, two taken down by electronic jamming. Some of the damage there, another shot down. And the Russian claim is that no lives were lost, no injuries, no fires even started as a result. But Moscow City, an upscale, almost financial district, where some of the elite would live in glass towers. A symbol, I think, perhaps, of how so much of Russia's population hasn't been impacted by the war much, although so many, too, have lost their loved ones in the fighting here. But at the same time as these strikes were ongoing, Ukrainians again being hit by Russia's often indiscriminate bombardment, more acutely in Sumy, in the north of Ukraine, near the Russian border. Two dead, 20 injured when multiple strikes hit a high rise dormitories and an educational establishment. Also two here in Zaporizhzhia city. Two dead, two injured, in rare strikes that appeared to hit civilian targets as well. This comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the front lines in the east near Bakhmut on what Ukraine calls its Special Forces Day, again showing solidarity with troops on the front line. And his counterpart, Vladimir Putin, met African leaders in a summit in Russia, where there is sort of an African bid to launch some kind of peace initiative. Frankly, a bit far-fetched. But Putin gave some rare comments, I think, on the possibility of negotiation, saying that a ceasefire, one of the things mooted in this peace summit, is something hard to implement when Ukraine's on the counteroffensive, as we're seeing here, too. Bear in mind that ceasefire at this point would probably concretize a lot of the territorial gains Russia has made and that it looks possible it may lose if Ukraine goes increasingly on the counteroffensive. [07:05:11] Ukraine is pushing forwards in the south near where I'm standing here, and has launched strikes just in the last 24 hours on a key railway bridge that brings supplies up from Crimea to where I am. That's often a harbinger of potential future moves on the battlefield. They seek to cut supplies off ahead of that. So a lot moving here, certainly, but overnight tolls on the Ukrainian civilian population and a rare moment of disquiet for Russian civilians in Moscow's elite too.",

She was in Haiti working for the charity El Roi. She was abducted along with her child. And this was actually on what they call as the campus of this charity close to Port-au-Prince.Now, they announced this abduction on their website for El Roi. And in a statement, they say that, \"Alix is a deeply compassionate and loving person who considers Haiti and her home, the Haitian people her friends and family. Alix has worked tirelessly as our school and community nurse to bring relief to those who are suffering as she loves and serves the people of Haiti in the name of Jesus\". Now, U.S. officials say that they are aware of this abduction. In a statement to CNN, also said that the U.S. State Department and our embassies and consulates abroad have no greater priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas. It is interesting here that the U.S. had already asked for all Americans to leave Haiti. They made that call again on Thursday on the day that this nurse and her child were abducted. But also they made it seem as if it was much more urgent for Americans to leave. And that is because they also evacuated nonemergency personnel that worked for the U.S. government there from Haiti. Now, this is unfortunately, a state of terror that so many Haitians live in day after day. Many people are released, sometimes for no reason, sometimes for ransom. But clearly this is a dangerous situation for this family. The charity at this hour saying that they are asking for everybody's prayers and they are also asking for privacy. Erica, Amara? WALKER: All right. Terrible situation. Paula Newton, thank you for staying on top of it. Extreme heat fueled violent thunderstorms in the Northeast Saturday. Strong winds ripped through the D.C.

You saw that in the way that they were able -- without much detection, to get into the emails of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, the U.S. Ambassador to China, Nic Burns and others.And these new techniques are very hard to detect. So the debate in the administration has been, do you wipe it all out when you find it, but then you're alerting the Chinese that you have found it and they may have time to re-infect these systems with better hidden methods. Or do you just sit and watch this code and try to move against it only in a time of crisis? So they wouldn't have time to come back in.

The order moves key decision-making authority outside of the chain of command to newly formed panels of independent military prosecutors, and those panels will handle cases not just involving sexual assault, but also domestic violence, child abuse, murder and other serious crimes.Joining me now is Meghan Tokash. She's a former federal -- former, rather, judge advocate general, former commissioner on the Secretary of Defense's Independent Review Commission on Military Sexual Assault.

That is that the people who investigate these crimes and the military prosecutors who will prosecute these crimes must have expertise in dealing with special victims. They have to have the emotional intelligence. They have to have the prosecutorial discretion to be able to decide which cases should go to trial, which cases should not go to trial.So, it remains a mystery as to how the heads of these offices were, in fact, vetted.

These changes are historic and sweeping, but they are only as good as having uniform prosecution standards that are applicable to all of the services because what you don't want to happen is to have a disparity in services where, say, the navy is using a probable cause standard to refer a case to trial, but the army is using evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction as another prosecution standard.It doesn't serve victims of sexual assault and related offenses and ultimately, it does not serve the American public.

In recent years, between 2018 and 2020, alcohol-related deaths rose by 12.5 percent among men compared with 14.7 percent among women. So, the gap in alcohol-related deaths among men versus women is narrowing, and this doesn't appear to be solely due to the COVID-19 pandemic because when researchers eliminated the year 2020 from their data, they still had similar findings.And the researchers are now calling for more study into what could be driving these deaths. It could be related to how some people turn to alcohol to cope with stress or other factors, but these findings are really a remainder that if you choose to drink, watch how much. The CDC recommends limiting yourself to no more than two drinks a day for men and no more than one drink a day for women. That means within a week, men should have no more than 14 drinks and women, no more than eight. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
