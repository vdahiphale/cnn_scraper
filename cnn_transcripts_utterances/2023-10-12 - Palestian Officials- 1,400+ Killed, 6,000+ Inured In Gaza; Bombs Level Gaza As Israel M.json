U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken leaves no daylight between the U.S. government and that of Israel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The message that I bring to Israel is this. You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself. But as long as America exists, you will never ever have to. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think it's very important for us to see the secretary coming to visit us and to have President Biden in a very emotional speech. We need that. We need that support. We know we have the friendship of the U.S.And today we are in the process of coming together. We're going to have a unity government. In about an hour, we will vote in the Knesset about our new government, including members of the opposition. And we starting to get ready for the retaliation. Yes, we are in pain. But we also understand that we have to fight back. We have seen the brutality. I don't know if you have shown the horrible picture. But every day we see more and more pictures of whole barbaric behavior. We never believed that in a Jewish state, after 75 years of independence, we will have to see, it seems that we started the Holocaust in World War II. And all of a sudden, it's happening here, more than one thousand innocent victims. BASH: We're going to show that in a minute. But I do first want to ask about, one of the first things that you mentioned which is going to happen later, which is the formation of a national unity, or emergency government I should say, and it is with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, National Unity Party leader, Benny Gantz. It's basically a war cabinet. I think it's probably the best way to put it. And you can correct me if I'm wrong. But in practical terms, does this mean the end of the Netanyahu government?",

And we thought that's it, from now on it will never happen again.And you know, in less than a week ago on another Jewish holiday, we were caught by surprise. And also, the number of casualties, you know, the fact that it's more than one thousand civilians, you know, babies and the kidnapped. You know, Hamas kidnapped one year old baby. A Holocaust survivor at the age of 86. And the brutality, you know, raping women. You know, I don't want to go into details, but that thing that it's like a whole movie. So yes, I can tell that we are in shock. And we are not getting now into fighting about who is to blame and why it happened. We are united now winning the war.

So, I think seeing those innocent people staying there, it will be a mistake.We urge them to move out to go south. And what you mentioned about Egypt, you know, it's up to the Egyptians to decide how to handle it. But still within Gaza, there is place for people to move. It's not going to be permanently.

We have witnessed a stunning attempt in some corners to blame the victims, dead Jews.At Harvard, a letter addressing the Hamas slaughter, a letter co- signed by 33-student groups contained this line, the apartheid regime is the only one to blame. The most charitable reading of that letter is that it tried to provide context and failed a test of moral clarity. There is no charitable reading of this next image. This is a post from the National Students for Justice in Palestine, their Instagram account. A particular attention to the paraglider in the right corner. The general call for protests is prompting real life security concerns. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is in Brooklyn. And Shimon, all NYPD forces have been ordered to show up in uniform tomorrow.

They came together, they say because they were angry over the statements that were made by the college president in support of Israel. And so, they wanted to gather here, they say to show their support for Palestine, and they're against what's happening.You can see some of the signs here. On this side, let me be frank, let me just show some of the signs on this site here. The bombing of children is not self-defense. And so, we're hearing chants like that, from this side, saying free, free Palestine. And then on the other side, where frank was just showing you, are supporters of Israel. Just about a handful or so that are gathered on this side, of course, the college is open. There are students you could see that are coming through here, leaving the campus going to the other side. But this is the other side of it. It's been peaceful. And most of the folks here on each side holding signs. And then you could see, there's a lot of extra police officers here and law enforcement officials. There is officers behind frank here, and they're just standing around.
