An exclusive interview with a central witness in the Donald Trump classified documents case. He tells CNN that he handled boxes of the documents without realizing it. Israel's prime minister vows to push ahead with a military offensive in Gaza, as President Biden warns it could cross a red line. Dozens are injured and passengers are said to have flown through the cabin after a flight from Australia to New Zealand suffered a so-called technical problem. And the Princess of Wales apologizes after admitting that she edited a photograph of her and her children. All that coming up. But we begin with a CNN exclusive. A longtime employee at Donald Trump's Florida resort is speaking publicly about the classified documents case for the first time. Known in court documents as Employee 5. Brian Butler worked at Mar-a-Lago for 20 years. He told CNN that he handled boxes of classified documents without realizing it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN BUTLER, \"TRUMP EMPLOYEE 5\" AND FORMER MAR-A-LAGO EMPLOYEE: And then, what happened is Walt left before me and he never goes directly to the plane. He's either in the motorcade when he goes there with the boss, which the former president. And I remember telling him he left the club with -- I didn't know what he had in his vehicle, but he waited for me at a nearby business and I told him I would tell him when I was leaving Mar-a-Lago. So, I left Mar-a-Lago. I texted him, hey, I'm on my way. He followed me. He pulled out and got behind me. We got to the airport. I ended up loading all the luggage I had and he had a bunch of boxes.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, there's a couple. I think the first thing is that we've all heard a lot about, Lynda, and that's this issue of immunity,presidential immunity. What does it mean? It means that Trump people are arguing that the president is absolutely immune from prosecution. And what that would mean is that if any act that the president was involved in while he was president, right, that would certainly immunize him, shield him, prevent any prosecution against him. And so, that's something we know that the Supreme Court of the United States is considering. The Supreme Court, the highest law in the land, nine justices, it would take five to shield the president, right? It could be, you know, buy it -- all you need is five. So, you can have a five, four vote. I think the conventional wisdom though is that the immunity argument is a bridge too far. And so, that means that while the president may have some immunity or limited immunity, it is allowed to say that president could essentially do whatever he wants, whenever he wants and get away with it with impunity. So, the Supreme Court will rule, but that'll be a critical argument here. The next argument very briefly involves the Presidential Records Act. But it's important to note in making that argument what you're essentially records that are stored while you president, remember, even though you get to store records as president, they are those records that is property of the government. And so, you cannot take them on your own. So, I just don't know how much weight or merit that argument will have, but I think those will be the two upon which the president's team predicates any motion to dismiss this case.",

However, multiple Israeli officials say that the offensive is not imminent. In the past few hours, the U S. State Department has said that Israel has not shown the U.S. a humanitarian or a military plan for Rafah. It comes after Joe Biden said an Israeli invasion of Rafah would cross a red line. This as the head of the U.N. makes an urgent new appeal to honor the spirit of Ramadan. He's calling for a ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and the lifting of any obstacles standing in the way of humanitarian aid.

Sometime during that flight, passengers reported a sudden movement that threw passengers across the cabin. One passenger described it as a mid-air drop. Several emergency medical teams met the plane upon landing. About 50 people were treated for injuries. 12 were sent to hospital for additional aid. Well, joining us now for more on this as CNN's Tom Foreman. Tom, this certainly sounded like a frightening experience.

It could be a weather issue. It could be an icing issue. It could be some sort of personnel issue. There are all sorts of things that could be involved, but this gives no clue. What we do know from the passengers is that it was a very dramatic event, as they describe it, with no warning. They were cruising altitude around 40,000, 41,000 feet. And for a few seconds, they said this plane just nosed over like it was a roller coaster and started plunging downward. People flew upward. Some of the witnesses said there was blood on the ceiling from people smashing into the ceiling, a really very, very dramatic event that happened all at once, no warning before, and nothing strange afterwards.

And as Trump started to push back onthis bill that's making its way through the House, this proposed bill that would ban TikTok in the United States if it were not spun off from its Chinese parent company ByteDance. Trump is now saying he's worried that if TikTok is banned in the U.S. that its users would make their way to platforms owned by Meta, which as you can hear from that statement, those comments from him, he clearly does not like. Trump has for a long time had a contentious relationship with Meta. He was banned from Facebook after the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, although he's back on the platform now. He's also accused Facebook of censoring conservative voices, although there's now really evidence that that happens. But, you know, I think Trump is really signaling here that he is back on the TikTok perhaps as a way of trying to hurt Meta.

You can see that the buildings aremade out of bamboo covered in mud and people's handprints they've put on the wall as decoration. But it's also, of course, incredibly poor and everyone here is essentially in debt to a local landowner. And they have to work night and day, seven days a week, just to pay off that loan and to survive. KOSHILA SADAY, BONDED LABORER (through translator): We are bonded to work for our landlord. The whole family is working for the landlord. We work for him, and our children also work for him. We also want for our children to get proper education and for them to be able to earn and take care of themselves. CHANCE (voice-over): A London-based NGO called the Freedom Fund has been working with the Harawa Charawa for more than a decade. They have helped the community organize and advocate for their rights. In 2022, the Harawa Charawa received a major victory, Nepal's prime minister announcing the liberation of the Harawa Charawa people. It marks the first time the government formally acknowledged the issue of bonded labor affecting them. Still, despite the declarations, progress has been slow. LEGENDRA SADAY, GENERAL SECRETARY, NATIONAL HARAWA CHARAWA RIGHTS FORUM (through translator): From the day the government announced our freedom, we have been facing more serious problems. People like us now have nowhere to go to look for work, and we are compelled to go back to the landlord to ask for work. When we go there asking for work, the landlord now chases away with sticks.",

They are staying here on their own will. They have no pressure whatsoever to continue to stay with me and work for me. CHANCE (voice-over): But for Fulfu Latiyah (ph) and Koshila (ph), it's a dilemma. Their concern, like that of so many parents around the world, has less to do with their own future than their children's. Their hope is that with education and organization, the debt that should have been worked off generations ago won't be shouldered by the next. Matthew Chance, CNN, Nepal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Hanako Montgomery reports. But staying with the Oscars, it was partly about the after party. It is reported that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce made a star appearance at Madonna's post-awards party. As the Eras Tour sweeps the world, we are getting a better understanding of how cities hosting Taylor Swift benefited economically. In particular, fans spending big on hotels, food, and beverages. The MasterCard Economic Institute has calculated that restaurant spending rose by 68 percent within a two-and-a-half-mile radius of the venue. Spending on accommodation jumped 47 percent. In Kansas, the institute estimates that nearly two weeks' worth of spending happened within just two days at the local restaurants near the stadium.

      "sentences": "So, what we've been looking at the MasterCard Economics Institute was a way to be able to find from the more granular data exactly what theimpact was by location, the time of day, and to give a sense of how much more spending than you would have normally seen around the surrounding areas actually would be. And that's where the numbers that you quoted actually come from. In particular, I think it's interesting that you saw, that major uplift in spending, of course, at restaurants, accommodation, even within the 10-mile radius, ended up being over 30-plus percent stronger when we looked at the data, for example, from across cities in the U.S., and that was on average. Many of them were actually significantly above that number, while some were below. What we're thinking, of when you think about what it means for this particular region in Asia-Pacific, how we can translate some of the results over to what we see, say, in Singapore, is that we're likely to see something around that level, maybe even higher in terms of the overall uplift on spending on accommodation, on restaurants, but also even on things like retail spending for those looking for the merchandise, looking the bracelets or the outfits to be buying. And then while they're out there in the stores, to potentially be buying even more. And on top of that, not just being, say, folks that are living in places where the concerts are taking place, like, say Singapore, but also people traveling in to buy the tickets for the concert, but also to come in spending on the accommodation too. That should mean a lot more of the cross-border travel story is really what we should be watching for. And we should thinking about the extra uplift to spending that otherwise would not have happened. And that's where I think the key focus on stronger economies that can come from having more of these experience-led events is exactly what we've been seeing around the world, and it has been repeated in the Asia-Pacific region too.",

      "sentences": "Well, the way to think about this is in post-COVID environment, there have been many things that been quite disorientating over exactly where weare and what consumer preferences are longer-term, given we had effectively a bungee jump in the global economy where we jumped off the bridge in 2020, 2021 we started to make that comeback. But just like in a bungee jump, we lost orientation over exactly where we stand on many factors, including things like consumer preferences towards experiences versus things. Now, initially, we would expect that the experiences end would be doing much better because those were the very things you could not do during the relatively more restricted periods during COVID times. But actually, long-term, it seems to be sticking too. That's the message we're getting from the data we look at, for example, in the United States. And when we think about this from the perspective of the Economics Institute for what's going to happen in Asia-Pacific, that persistence of experiences demand, even over and above things spending. And we know last year, for example, exports growth around the world in goods was relatively weak, that focus on the long-term of providing more of those really special mega events is a big deal. We're seeing that even, for example, being commented on and something that say cities like Hong Kong want to be replicating to help support their economy as well. And it looks like with the excess savings that had been building up over the years during COVID that the extra money that is sitting there for enough consumers enables them to go ahead with these experiences related spending, and I think that preference looks like it is here to stay even in the longer-term.",
