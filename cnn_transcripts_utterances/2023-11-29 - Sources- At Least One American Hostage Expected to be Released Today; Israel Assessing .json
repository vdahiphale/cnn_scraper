Every day, there's nervousness will there be more hostages coming forward? Will there be a delay? And there have been delays in previous days, as we all remember, or will this go smoothly, more hostages will be released, more aid will go into Gaza. And we'll see what happens. But I got to tell you that there's a lot of tension right now, maybe more so today than in previous days, because it's unclear how Hamas is going to behave and what's going to be going on. So it's going to be a dramatic, important day to be sure, one way or another. But let's hope the temporary pause continues. So that more Israeli hostages, women and children especially those are the ones that Hamas is releasing as you know, will be able to come back home to Israel, Dana.",

And the early indications, according to reporting from our colleague Kaitlin Collins, and Alex Marquardt is that it is expected that at least one American will be included in this group, leaving Gaza today.Now this comes as the White House has said that there are two American women that they believe fall into the category of those who could have been released in this negotiated release. But the White House has not provided names or updates on their conditions. And they're being quite careful with what they say because they want to make sure that everything goes according to plan. If you take a look at what happened with the release of Abigail Adan that four year old that had been held captive since the start of this October 7th attack. It was not confirmed that she was included in this hostage list until the Red Cross physically had her in their hands. That is likely something that will happen today, as the U.S. wants to make sure that everything goes according to plan that these hostages are safely out of Gaza. But sources have said that they believe that there will be at least one American citizen included in that hostage release today.",

It is 10 Israeli women and children on the sixth day of this truce here and we expect to see them 30 Palestinian women and children released from Israeli prisons. As of right now this is the extent of the truce and the agreements so far. But the Qataris have expressed quite a bit of optimism that it will be extended at least a day or two. That condition the Israelis have placed on it is they'll extend it another 24 hours. The truce on the humanitarian aid going into Gaza for every 10 Israeli women and children released from captivity here. A senior Israeli official also said they're evaluating the possibility of extending the truce so that the strongest statement we've seen from the Israelis so far, Wolf will probably learn more after we see the hostages released.",

And what the state wants to do is also offer a diplomatic approach simultaneous that will correspond with the military approach. Because what we've seen, at least in the first half of this war, is that the number of victims is too high, both on the Palestinian side and on the Israeli side. And the continuation of only militant approach will not bring peace. It needs another diplomatic angle in the same time as well as trying to defeat Hamas. But we talked about the day after the war the first thing that needs to be done in order to see real change is to strengthen the Palestinian authority. Doing so needs to come through recognition, recognition through the UN Security Council that will immediately recognize Palestine. And this stage next to work on removing all militant groups and taking down the arms of any militants group existence, and to work with the international community to strengthen the values of peace within the Palestinian community reconstruction of Gaza, and to start working towards a diplomatic approach for a peace with the Israeli side. So both sides need to work simultaneously. And the Israeli side needs to bring a diplomatic approach to end this conflict. On the Palestinian side, it needs to take down all militant groups, and work as one state as well, and both sides work together we can see real change.",
