      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Bianca Nobilo in for Max Foster in London today.Just ahead, the U.N. warns that there is no safe place left to go in Gaza as tens of thousands of people search for shelter in Gaza's southernmost region. Israel is continuing to strike targets right across the enclave. Then Ukraine's president will make a last minute plea to get the U.S. Senate Republicans to back an aid package his country desperately needs before winter. Plus, burning questions remain over the fate of a veteran journalist who vanished while on assignment in Beijing. Nowhere safe to go. The U.N. Relief Chief is warning of an apocalyptic situation as Israel intensifies its airstrikes and expands its ground offensive in southern Gaza. This new satellite imagery shows dozens of Israeli armored vehicles operating in the south, but the fighting continues in northern Gaza as well. The IDF says its troops have completed the encirclement of the Jabalya refugee camp, calling it a raid on a Hamas command center. Meanwhile, the Israeli military says given the challenges of urban combat, an estimated ratio of two civilians killed in Gaza for every militant is, quote, tremendously positive. According to the Hamas controlled health ministry, nearly 16,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the war. And now we're learning of the possibility of thunderstorms and flash flooding in the area that could make an already desperate situation worse. CNN's Ben Wedeman joins me now live from Jerusalem. Ben, tell us to what extent is Israel directly targeting the areas that has told civilians to evacuate to in Gaza.",

      "sentences": "Bianca, if we go sort of back in the timeline, originally, of course, the Israelis advised everybody in the north of Gaza to go south of Wadi Gaza. Basically, normally they would go to places like Khan Yunis and Rafah, the two largest cities in the southern part of the Gaza Strip.But now, particularly, Khan Yunis is being shelled fairly intensely and around the clock. So they're being told to head toward Rafah. And what we've heard from the Israelis, they want people to go to an area called Mawasi, which is on the coast. It's a small village which traditionally has been out of the line of fire. The problem is, according to a variety of U.N. officials and others with relief organizations, this is an area that does not have any infrastructure, has no shelter for the hundreds of thousands of people that might be expected to go there. There's no food, there's no water, there's no sanitation facilities available, and therefore, we have a situation where people are being sent somewhere, there's just no way that they can survive. And as you can see here in Jerusalem and down in Gaza as well, it looks like it's going to be raining shortly and they have no cover. In fact, we heard from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, that's a U.N. agency here, that an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold. Bianca?",

The U.N. says people are settling in the streets and setting up tents in empty spaces across the city since most of the shelters are full. The U.N. is warning of overcrowding and disease. Meanwhile, not enough aid is coming into Gaza. The U.N. humanitarian office says only 100 aid trucks came through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, and that is well below the daily average of 170. Larry Madowo joins us now live from Cairo. Larry, tell us about the current humanitarian challenges that are being faced because of Israel's renewed offensive, its targeting of the south, and now we're learning some extreme weather.",

The U.N. humanitarian coordinator has said that the U.N. and NGOs alone cannot meet the needs of a population of more than 2.2 million people, especially based on the drip feed of fuel that's coming in.The Israelis said last night that they allowed 180 humanitarian aid trucks to come in at the request of U.S. officials and in coordination with Egypt. But only about 100 is reported to have been received inside the Gaza Strip. Even that is not, nowhere near enough. During the week long truce, about 170 average were coming in, sometimes up to 240, bringing in food and fuel and water and medicines and winter weather gear. None of that is coming in. I was at the Rafah border crossing, Bianca, just hours before the truce expired, and there were hundreds of trucks waiting to get through from the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing into Gaza. A lot of them are still there today. Their driver's been there for about 10 days who still have not been able to get in. And so many people on the Gaza Strip are on the edge, really, with nothing. No food, no fuel, no water for their families.",

That is according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which says the 25-year-old man was killed by fire from the Israeli military. The clashes follow the death of another man during a raid by Israeli Defense Forces at the camp near Jerusalem on Monday. The Palestine Red Crescent Society says 17 people were injured in that operation. Now, to the war in Ukraine, where Russian shelling has killed two people in the city of Kherson, that is according to local officials. And this comes nearly 12 hours after Russia hit Kherson overnight, targeting residential buildings and a humanitarian and distribution center. Ukraine's Interior Ministry says Russian missiles and drones also struck a village in the Donetsk region, injuring people and destroying residential buildings there too. With Ukraine's U.S. lifeline hanging by a thread, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will push for more aid during a remote classified briefing in Washington. The Biden administration wants Congress to hear firsthand what is at stake with a U.S. funding bill for Ukraine still stuck in limbo. The White House is warning that the U.S. will kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield without approving it. Our Lauren Fox joins us now from Capitol Hill. Lauren, is the expectation that this address from President Zelenskyy has any chance of moving the dial for the Republicans that do not agree with supporting this bill?",

But there's still plenty of room for the language to be watered down in the final text. And that comes as a watchdog report shows a massive attendance at the summit this year from fossil fuel companies. More than 2,400 people connected to that industry signed up. That's quadruple the number from last year. And a major announcement from U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry at the summit on Tuesday. He's unveiled a new American-led international initiative promoting nuclear fusion, a potentially revolutionary form of clean energy. In India, six people have died as tropical Cyclone Michaung lashes the eastern coast. Police officials say that dozens have been rescued from the heavy rains in the city of Chennai. Cyclone Michaung made landfall several hours ago in southern India and evacuation efforts remain underway at this time. The death toll following the eruption of a volcano in Indonesia has risen to 13. This as search and rescue efforts continue. Officials say three climbers were found alive on Monday, but 10 remain missing. The Marapi volcano erupted on Sunday. And after the break for you, the Israeli military faces new questions about civilian casualties in Gaza. The IDF says it believes they've killed around two civilians for every Hamas militant in Gaza since the ground offensive began.

The AFP also reported that an Israeli official confirmed that about 5,000 militants have been killed.The IDF has also announced the death of three more soldiers since the ground offensive in Gaza began. And that brings the total number of IDF deaths to 72. To discuss this further, let's bring in CNN's Alex Marquardt who's live in Tel Aviv for us. Alex, you've been in many war zones, so remind our viewers about the difficulty of actually trying to ascertain any kind of numbers, like those to which the IDF are referring, and what you made of this confirmation of this civilian casualty estimate from the IDF?",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianca, I think when you hear the words tremendously positive about this conflict, it is bound of course to raise eyebrows. We all know how difficult it's going to be to confirm any of these numbers.One of the reasons it is so difficult is because groups and journalists don't have access to Gaza. We can't get into Gaza if we want to. So we are essentially relying on the Ministry of Health numbers that are coming out of Gaza. They're also being reissued by the Ministry of Health in the West Bank and Ramallah. And we have noted throughout this conflict that that Ministry of Health is controlled by Hamas. Now, we should note that in past conflicts, that those numbers have essentially been echoed by the United Nations and by Israel, by the United States. And so they have been seen in the past as somewhat reliable. But let's take a look at the numbers that are being discussed right now. Israel hasn't come out with the exact number of militants who they believe to have killed. Although you heard Conricus there confirming what the AFP had reported that is believed to be around 5,000. And then the Ministry of Health death toll that we've heard most recently is around 16,000. But if those numbers -- if -- you could imagine that there could be a ratio that is more than two to one, that if say Israel had killed 2,000 or 3,000 militants and the death tolls around 15,000 to 16,000, you could actually see a ratio of around five civilians for every one militant. But it is quite remarkable that Israel sees the extraordinary level of civilian death even if it's just two civilians for every one Hamas militant, as tremendously positive. Now, of course, this is just one spokesman who's not, you know, speaking for the Israeli government, but it certainly did raise eyebrows at the very least, Bianca.",

And it does appear poised to get even worse according to the Israeli meteorological service.They say that the -- there's a possibility of thunderstorms, the rains intensifying throughout the course of the day and the evening, and even the possibility of flash floods. And that could mean -- that could have disastrous consequences in the Gaza Strip. There's an estimate that as many as much as half an inch, or I believe that's around 1.5 centimeters of rain could fall in the Gaza Strip. As you know, so many people have been displaced in Gaza. 1.9 million, according to the United Nations. Many of them, hundreds of thousands of them, are not in shelters. They're camped out. They're sleeping in the streets. They don't have shelter. They don't have aid. They don't have medicine. They don't have food or water. Many of them are suffering from disease or other types of injuries. So as if the situation wasn't already bad enough in just a couple hours or over the course of the next few hours, you could have around 2 million people who are displaced contending with a lot of water falling on the Gaza Strip.
