      "sentences": "Hello everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday.I'm Fredericka Whitfield. And we begin with the U.S. Supreme Court issuing a critical 11th hour ruling protecting access to a common abortion drug, at least for now. The high court freezing a lower court's ruling on the drug mifepristone which had placed debilitating restrictions on its usage. Well, the drug is the predominant method for ending pregnancies in the U.S. widely used for decades taken by millions of women? The decision sets up the most consequential abortion related dispute since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. A new appeals process must now play out. A process that could take weeks or even months. CNN's Ariane De Vogue is following this major decision. Ariane, the court's brief was left unsigned, and the votes were not disclosed. Why?",

      "sentences": "Well, you make a really good point here because it really shows what the Supreme Court did. The Biden administration went to the Supreme Court and asked for emergency relief. This lower court had put restrictions on this abortion drug.The Biden ministrations wanted the Supreme Court to lift those restrictions while the appeals process played out. So the Supreme Court in that order that you referred to agreed to do so. It did not rule on the merits of whether the FDA had the authority in the first place to approve the drug. It simply said that right now that drug could remain widely available in the states that allow abortion while this appeals process plays out. So that means that not only is the drug widely available, but the moves that the FDA made in the year since of approval to ease access, those will also remain in place. For instance, you can get the generic, that the drug can be mailed to you. It can be used up to 10 weeks in pregnancy. All that now will remain in place as this case continued. And as you said it would have taken five justices to grant this emergency relief and we don't know where all the conservative justices were. We only know that Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito they would have ruled against the Biden administration. So for now, this case returns to a very conservative federal appeals court, which has already said it will hold hearings in May, and it's going to really dig into the issue now. Really look into what we call the merits of the dispute. Then it will rule and then most likely, Fredricka, this whole thing is going to make its way back to the Supreme Court. But for now, this abortion medication drug is widely available in the states that allow abortions.",

More than 400 people dead in just a week of battles as two of Sudan's top generals fight for power.

They've been able to pull out diplomats and even other countries, citizens of other countries from the Gulf Region.We've just seen one vessel arrive in Jeddah so that came from Port Sudan in the east of Sudan. But this is supposed to be day two of a three day ceasefire in Sudan that's supposed to be part of coinciding with the Eid holiday at the end of Ramadan. But even during the cease fire fighting has still been going on, especially the capital Khartoum. Two places where it's mostly concentrated -- around the presidential palace and the general command headquarters. That's where the army headquarters is situated. And this fighting is still ongoing between the Rapid Support Forces, the paramilitary group and the Sudanese army. So not quite a quiet Edi -- the three day weekend that the ceasefire is supposed to have held so for a lot of people a lot of concern. But that Sudanese -- evacuation for these Saudis is just the first of a number of countries that are arranging to get their citizens, especially diplomatic staff out of Sudan, the U.K. telling CNN that an evacuation is not imminent. But the U.K. prime ministers held an emergency meeting of what is called the COBRA squad -- COBRA meeting to arrange and talk about this situation. The U.S. says it's still too dangerous to arrange for a private evacuation of private U.S. citizens out of Khartoum even though there are arrangements in place if it were necessary to evacuate diplomatic staff and to secure the embassy in Khartoum. I want to play for you, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary talking about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: When it comes to Sudan, this is a warning, a level four warning that we provided to them many months ago, basically telling Americans who were there to leave if they could, and also not to travel -- Americans not to travel to Sudan.

And what it's doing is that it is really dismantling public education.And so you know, we know that Governor DeSantis is hateful and vindictive, and this is retaliatory for so many reasons. I mean, he bans books. He removes African American studies, right. This is part of what he's doing to gain national attention. And we know that he's also attacking Disney, so Floridians are not surprised that he's attacking this vulnerable population. But what it does is this is part of his relentless crusade to privatize public education. He just passed this bill HB-1, which opens the floodgates on vouchers, and he's privatizing our schools. He doesn't want children to have access. He doesn't want to have children -- for children to get, you know, high quality public education. And so he's doing all these things to push back on people, and we've even seen it with his law that he's trying to pass as well. That is a union busting bill. He doesn't care about workers. He doesn't care about our rights, and he's trying to take away people's rights in the state of Florida. And this is how he does it. He attacks teachers. He attacks vulnerable communities and he attacks public education. WHITFIELD: So Karla, I wonder what are teachers telling you, because I mean, who doesn't you know, remember, you know, while in the classroom sometimes lessons take a turn right because of a thought or a question, an inquiry that a student might make and what are teachers now saying about how they handle, you know, when, when a student has an inquiry, you know, that is any that encroaches on any of these topics that now have restrictions. How has it changed the mood? The tenor, the feeling in their classroom between teacher and students.",

You know, we, believe in the Socratic method of teaching and we want to ask questions, and we want children to also or our students to ask us questions as well. And so what we know, even with these book bans, it is creating a chilling effect where teachers are now scared to talk about authentic real history to talk about real issues that are happening in our community, and so what it's doing, it's watering down education. It's dumbing down education. It's also privatizing education and, of course, it's vilifying certain communities. Again, we know that he's out for a run, but what he's doing is that he's attacking the most vulnerable people. He's attacking children. He's attacking teachers, he's dismantling public education, and that's not what Floridians want. This is the most restrictive government that we've ever been a part of that we've ever witnessed and it's fascism.",

They have added that they are continuing to roll out upgrades, software upgrades for the vehicles for their customers, as well as even sending out steering wheel locks for impacted owners at no cost.So you are getting a level of reaction from these manufacturers. But really, let's remind viewers how all of this started this week when attorneys general in 17 states in addition to the District of Columbia as well. So you have 18, sort of top cops in jurisdictions asking the federal government to issue a recall saying that these two vehicle manufacturers have failed to respond in the face of an alarming increase in vehicle thefts throughout the country. Really just pick your jurisdiction Fred, just in Los Angeles alone an 85 percent increase in the theft of these cars and what these authorities are arguing in their letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is they are, they say that certain vehicle models manufactured between 2011 and 2022, whose easily bypassed ignition switches and lack of engine immobilizers make them particularly vulnerable to theft. Let's get a little bit more specific here. According to that letter vehicles such as the Hyundai Santa Fe and Tucson as well as the Kia Forte and Sportage when equipped -- when equipped with turnkey ignitions are roughly twice as likely to be stolen as other vehicles of a similar age. We're talking about those vehicles that don't have that typical push button ignition. And that's what's concerning for officials here, especially with this TikTok trend that has led to vehicle thefts and especially young people, stealing these vehicles recording themselves doing so, going on joy rides. And that is what's leading to some accidents that have claimed at least eight live. So certainly concerning for jurisdictions and concerning for close to 8.3. million -- or the owners of that many vehicles, Fred.",
