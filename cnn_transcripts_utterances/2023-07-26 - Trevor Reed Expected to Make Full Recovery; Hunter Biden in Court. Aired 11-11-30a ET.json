They have made a lot of allegations about that, but haven't actually been able to prove that Joe Biden at all benefited from what Hunter was involved in. So these questions are going to continue. We have already seen David Weiss, the U.S. attorney overseeing the Biden probe tell the Hill that he is willing to come testify before House Judiciary coming up in September, in October. So there are going to be questions again about what the scope of this investigation was. And there are also going to be questions about the claims from these IRS whistle-blowers that there was some kind of political interference or preferential treatment of Hunter Biden. Weiss has already knocked down some of those claims in his letters to the Hill. But it's very clear that Republicans have more questions about this. And House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has made some of his most pointed comments to date suggesting they may pursue a potential impeachment inquiry of Joe Biden related to these financial questions. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  The more this continues to unravel, it rises to the level of an impeachment inquiry. What that simply provides is that the American public has a right to know. And this allows Congress to get the information to be able to know the truth. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think you need to look in a different place. That is 100 percent beyond the authority that any judge would have.

      "sentences": "Hey, John.So we have gone through a lot of the process in this case and the judge asking a lot of questions. But she's really now homing in on these plea agreements. Remember, there are two separate cases here. One is the tax case. Those are the misdemeanor charges. So they have run through the specifics of that agreement. He also has the gun charge, right? That's the felony charge. That's a serious charge. It carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. They are two separate agreements. And the judge is focusing in and pointing and saying the Hunter Biden, so do you understand that the four corners of this tax plea agreement does not include specifically this gun diversion, which would allow him to not avoid -- to allow him to avoid prison time? And she's saying, if you don't have immunity from other charges, are you still willing to plead guilty to these tax misdemeanors? And he said, \"No, I will not.\" His lawyer stood up and also weighed in and said that -- confirming that he would not plead without immunity to any other charges. And that could include charges beyond just the gun charge, but also any other potential charges out there. So she's really wanting to make sure he understands that that's the agreement. Then we went to the prosecution. And one of the prosecutors, Leo Wise, he had said to the judge that these two agreements stand on their own. And that's when she said to both sides, help me understand this. You're both saying different things. She said, do you guys need to speak to each other? They agreed that they did. The judge left the bench, and both sides have been talking for some time now. It looked like they were wrapping up that conversation. So they might have some additional communications with the judge starting up again soon. But we're waiting to see if both sides, the defense and the prosecution, are now on the same page moving forward or is there is still a disagreement here and if the judge is going to have to get into that. But it's certainly a wrinkle that people didn't foresee coming today, because the Biden side and the prosecution were on the same page heading into this. Now, it could be that the judge is just trying to make sure that Biden understands the terms of this deal. But another interesting element here is that the judge had already established by going back and forth with both sides that, under the rule of the criminal code that this case is being brought, the judge could only accept this plea deal. She had made it clear on the record that she could not say she didn't like it. She cannot say, I think the charges should be something else. The way that this deal was presented to her, the tax deal, is that she would have to accept it. So that was an issue here. Now, she said that she's not bound by any sentencing here and the prosecution was on record today confirming that they are going to recommend probation on the tax evasion charges. But we still have a ways to go here in the sentencing with this kind of unforeseen hiccup before we actually -- excuse me -- not sentencing -- in this guilty plea process before we actually get to Hunter Biden entering a plea. That has not happened yet. We're still waiting to see if they come to some kind of resolution of what he would actually be pleading guilty today and what the terms of this plea agreement would include.",

That would violate the entire spirit of the agreement.But it sounds to me, based on Kara's reporting, like the question is, would Hunter Biden be covered, immunized for other offenses? Because, sometimes, in these plea agreements, you will have a provision in there that says the defendant is going to plead guilty to A, B, and C, and will not be charged with any other information that is currently within DOJ's knowledge or understanding. Sometimes, that provision is in an agreement. Sometimes, it's not. Sometimes, it's understood and so -- but not written, in which case you would want to put it on the official court record.

      "sentences": "Well, one of the things I think you guys are, I think, putting your finger on a thing that we sort of identified from the minute this plea agreement was announced.The Hunter Biden team was especially sensitive to mentioning the gun charge as part of this overall agreement. And one of the things that we know is that the -- in the case of Hunter Biden, he caused himself all of these problems by going out. He did a book in which he admitted that, when he bought this gun, at the time that he bought this firearm, he was actually addicted to drugs, which is a paper violation, but it is a serious one. It's a felony. And so one of the things that I think will have to be addressed as part of this hearing is, beyond the two misdemeanors that he's pleading to, there are going to be these terms that are governed -- that will govern how that gets resolved, how that gets taken away. The government is saying that, if he agrees to certain stipulations, certain conditions that the judge will lay out as part of this hearing today, then that gun charge goes away, like it never happened. And so I think one of the things the judge wants to make sure and clear of here is, beyond just the two misdemeanors, is that Hunter Biden understands what he's agreeing to, because, at any point, obviously, this guy in charge could come back if he fails to satisfy the terms of that agreement. And, again, we still don't know exactly what those terms will be as laid out by the court and by the prosecution, but this is -- the gun charge certainly is the thing that was the most serious thing that was handed, that was hanging over Hunter Biden's head, as the two sides were trying to work out this agreement in the last few months.",

It sounds like they're sort of furiously consulting, which happens. And if they can get it worked out, then the judge, I think, is going to want to make a record here.

BERMAN:  I think we should be totally transparent to our viewers here, because we're trying to figure out what is going on. Kara Scannell was in the courtroom, did a great job explaining it. This is a plea agreement before a federal judge. Usually, this goes a certain way. Obviously, this case is so unusual because you're dealing with the child of the president of the United States. We have never seen anything like this before. And there is enormous political pressure on everyone involved, including the federal judge.
