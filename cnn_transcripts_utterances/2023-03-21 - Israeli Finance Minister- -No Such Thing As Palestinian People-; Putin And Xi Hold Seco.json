But when we look at the damage that is done to Israel, there are five dimensions of fighting this revolution. One is in the Knesset hoping that some members of Likud will understand well Bibi is taking them this right wing, extreme government is taking them. The Supreme Court is still has a lot of power, then the protest in the streets that going stronger and stronger from week to week, then the economy. And the last one is what you asked about the American relation is really the message from the President of the United States to the Prime Minister.

If he will come with a change in Israeli policy on China, which is so important to President Biden, he could have got a welcome meeting.

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce another rate hike on Wednesday, which could shake the already delicate financial system. CNN's Matt Egan is in Washington DC for us. There are two stories here, isn't it? The state of the stock markets who are watching the Fed, they want to know whether the Fed is going to increase by perhaps a smaller amount than they otherwise would have done. They'll have certainly factored in some sort of rate rise. So that's one story.

And importantly, Janet Yellen is talking about how the federal government is willing to play a big role to try to put this fire out. Because remember, all of the depositors at Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank were rescued even above that $250,000 insurance limit. And today Janet Yellen said the federal government could do the same thing, if other small banks face runs on their own deposits. And if officials believe that there's a risk that this is going to infect other banks, I think that was previously implied. I think she went a little bit further today in her comment. Janet Yellen also tried to stress that what is going on right now is miles away from what we saw during the great financial crisis, listen to what she said about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: Our banking system is sound. Even as it's come under some pressure, as I indicated, this is different than 2008, 2008 was a solvency crisis.

On the other hand, they don't really want to do anything that's going to make this banking crisis worse.
