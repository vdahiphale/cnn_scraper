Speaking about this -- not taking place necessarily in EU borders right now, but in his words, in future EU borders. So this is being seen as a symbolic move by the European Union to showtheir commitment, their support for Ukraine's ambitions to hopefully one day join the European Union. That was certainly the message from Kuleba saying this is a message in itself of that support from the European Union. Josep Borrell talking about what they're all set to focus on today. They are looking at the peace plan put forward by President Zelenskyy. But he was careful in highlighting that this isn't in technical terms, an official or formal meeting because it isn't taking place in EU premises, but rather this is an opportunity for European Union foreign ministers or at least some of them, to meet with counterparts in Ukraine to discuss those peace proposals ahead of a future European Foreign Affairs Council Summit. But of course this does come off the back of controversial decisions in the U.S. Congress. Of course, we saw that emergency budget passed by Congress, but without any provisions for additional funding for military support for Ukraine. That has certainly sparked concern in Ukraine, but also in the European Union. We heard yesterday from Josep Borrell speaking in Ukraine. He said that this was a concern that the European Union would be stepping up its support in response to this. But we've also heard from Dmytro Kuleba, speaking today. In his eyes, he feels that the U.S. support for Ukraine hasn't been shattered and they are still working on this. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They will never, you know, agree to peacefully withdraw from any territories or withdraw at all. So he sees this as something that will go on for years and years.And he's trying to frame his argument as sort of a peace offering -- as you saw there in that clip. But it is entirely possible that we go through all of these negotiations and at the end of them, Robert Fico is actually not the Prime Minister of Slovakia. That's because there's seven parties that actually reached the five percent threshold to get seats in Parliament. He had not ruled out earlier -- and if we can bring up the results -- working with a far-right party called Republic -- you see them there at the bottom. They didn't reach the five percent threshold.

So it's as simple as that.So his opinion may not have changed. Robert Fico's opinion may not have changed, but the reality is that obviously, in order to govern, it will probably have to soften his stance. You also have the progressive Slovakia party, the party that had the second highest number of votes. They are dead set against Robert Fico. They say the leader of that party, whose name is Michal Simecka, says that he will do whatever he can to make sure that he is not in government. He says he's already going to start talking to the other party leaders to try to prevent something. So again, it's possible that we go through all this. Robert Fico can't find enough partners and you actually have a government that looks very, very different in Slovakia. One other thing that I should also mention, we've got some reaction from Ukraine. Nothing ground breaking.

China's outbound international flight capacity is down around 50 percent. That is still much lower compared to other countries. And international flight fares are still really expensive. They're much higher compared to pre-pandemic levels -- compared to 2019. Look, China's economy is struggling. It is struggling still to recover after the pandemic after zero-COVID. So many people across China are reluctant to splurge on these splashy, expensive holidays overseas. And so the Chinese who are going abroad, they're choosing cheaper destinations. Cheaper destinations in the region like Thailand, which has become the top choice. In fact, it became a top choice for Chinese travelers after introduced recently a visa free policy.
