Sources telling CNN former Vice President Mike Pence testified for more than five hours before a federal grand jury on Thursday.Prosecutors want to know about Pence's direct conversations with Trump leading up to the riot. Trump repeatedly pressured Pence to block the certification of the 2020 election and keep him in the White House. The grand jury appearance by Pence marks the first time in modern American history that a vice president has been compelled to testify about the president he served under. The suspect in the Pentagon leaks case will remain in jail for now as the judge considers bail. Prosecutors argued 21-year-old Jack Teixeira still poses a threat because of how many documents he allegedly access a trove of weapons they found in his room and his alleged history of violent threats. CNN's Jason Carroll reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): The detention hearing got underway with Jack Teixeira's father first taking the stand. He told the court he would not hesitate to report his son if he was released on bail in his custody and broke any rules the court impose. The defense argued that 21-year-old Air National Guardsmen is not a flight risk nor a security risk and that Teixeira did not intend for the classified information to go beyond the chat room where he had shared it. Judge Hennessy challenge that notion, someone under the age of 30 has no idea they put something on the internet that could end up anywhere in the world? Seriously? He had no idea that would go beyond the little people on the server that is like someone arguing I pulled the trigger but I had no intent to kill him. Prosecutors argued Teixeira could still have access to hundreds of documents. The defense filing (ph) asserts Teixeira no longer has access to those documents, saying prosecutors are exaggerating their clients threat. Four documents filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office Wednesday argued Teixeira should not be released on bail claiming he poses a serious flight risk writing, he could take refuge with a foreign adversary to avoid the reach of U.S. law. Prosecutors claim the information Teixeira allegedly access far exceeds what has been disclosed on the internet. The filing also includes pictures from the search warrant executed on to share his bedroom. The photos show a gun locker next to his bed containing multiple weapons including an AK style high capacity weapon handguns, shotgun rifles, and a gas mask. Prosecutors say law enforcement also found a smash tablet, laptop and a gaming console in a dumpster at the home. Prosecutors say Teixeira also obstructed justice by telling those he was communicating with online to delete all messages. And if anyone comes looking don't tell them expletive. Prosecutors also questioned why Teixeira was a candidate for the Air National Guard given his history surrounding guns. The Pentagon is defending its procedures. BRIG. GEN. PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: I think it's important not necessarily to take the actions of one individual and somehow paint a picture that that indicates a systemic breakdown.

In Jerusalem tens of thousands of right wing protesters marched in front of Israel's parliament on Thursday in the first big public rally to support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's controversial plan to overhaul the judicial system. Since January, there have been massive protests against that plan, which opponents say would weaken the independence of the Supreme Court. Here's CNN's Hadas Gold reporting from Jerusalem. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera): For months, hundreds of thousands of Israelis had taken to the streets of Israel to protest against the traditional overhaul plan the Israeli government has put forward that would give unprecedented power in the hands of the Israeli parliament over the Supreme Court. But this protest is something different. These protesters, they are in favor of the judicial reform. They say their voices haven't been heard as much in the Israeli street. So that's why they're coming out here in front of the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli parliament, because they want their voices heard by the parliamentarians. They want these reforms. These reforms to go through. They say that this is what they voted for in those November elections. They say the right wing parties won the majority. And this is what they want heard. For the people out here, they say this for them is democracy. They want more power in the hands of the people. Now Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had suspended the legislative process on these reforms after the most massive general strike in Israeli history. But the Israeli parliament is coming back into session next week. And some of the right wing ministers have said that no matter what these reforms will come back onto the table, no matter what the negotiations might be happening behind the scenes, and for these protesters here, they say that's what they want to happen. They say no matter what it is their votes that won the majority November and they want these reforms done now. Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The spacecraft possibly accelerated toward the moon's surface as it was running out of fuel. Four months after the spacecraft launched from earth, engineers waited anxiously for word of touchdown on Tuesday. It would have been the world's first lunar landing for a private company of a commercially- developed space craft. But it never happened. iSpace said its system may have miscalculated the last distance to the surface. Takeshi Hakamada is the founder and CEO of iSpace. He joins me now from Tokyo. And thanks for doing so. Now you've said that you are not ultimately disappointed in what happened. That you are proud of the mission. And of course, the journey itself did provide you with a lot of data. So, what lessons were learned for next time? TAKESHI HAKAMADA, FOUNDER/CEO, ISPACE: Well, even though we did not complete the successful landing on the lunar surface however, we have already completed eight of the (INAUDIBLE) successfully. We said ten. And then also, we almost get close to the surface. And then we gained many of the flight data, half (ph) the flight data during the mission. That is very great asset to improve our system for the next missions.",

Half of them, he says, should be women. He also wants young people included. What these meetings do is they look at recommendations to make to the Pope and they vote on those proposals. Now this is something that has been going on since 2021 in the Catholic Church all around the world, listening to lay people, that is, people who are not priests and nuns, what are some of their concerns. Those concerns now come to the Vatican in October and from that the proposals are made to the Pope. It is something that women's groups within the Catholic Church have been pushing for for some time to have a vote at the table.
