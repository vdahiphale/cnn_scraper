We will never know the exact number of people that were killed when Storm Daniel dumped unprecedented levels of water here, busting to dams and entire neighborhoods washing into the sea, into the Mediterranean. In the absence of any proper coordination between Libya`s two rival governments, ordinary Libyans have been doing what they can, including donating blood. And they`re also aware of the divided country that they live in. MUSTATA RAJABANI, BLOOD DONOR (through translator):  We feel sorry for those who lost their lives. And we ask God almighty that he take pity on the others. Unfortunately, we hate to admit that this catastrophe has highlighted the fact that we do not have a state capable of dealing with a crisis of this scale.",

Libyan State Media say 891 buildings are completely destroyed there. Another 211 buildings are partially damaged and 398 others submerged. So this brings to almost 15% of buildings in Derna that were affected by this flooding. The African Union Chairperson is calling on other African member states, the international community to offer more support because that`s what so many people need here. At the same time. The U.N. warning that about 40,000 people have been displaced. And as they`re on the move, they are exposed to landmines and explosive ordinances of war after more than a decade of conflict in the country. So it`s just a mixture of the most terrible conditions possible. Larry Madowo, CNN Nairobi. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The canal was built more than 100 years ago and it connects the Pacific ocean to the Atlantic ocean. It`s a valuable shipping route that saves vessels a lot of time and a long, more dangerous journey down around the Southern tip of south America. Let`s go to our CNN International Correspondent, Patrick Oppmann, who explains how we might all be affected by the water levels on this 50-mile route. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The Panama Canal is running low on water. A persistent drought caused in part by the El Nino weather pattern has left water levels dangerously depleted. Now, the global supply chain is under threat as the holiday season approaches. The 80-kilometer waterway connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and is a vital route for transporting goods, handling an estimated 5% of world trade. The canal was completed in 1914, revolutionizing how goods were used to supply goods could be transported and further expanded in 2016 to meet the skyrocketing demands of global commerce. But over the last 20 years, decreasing rainfall has reduced the water level of Panama`s Lake Gatun from 27 meters above sea level to 24 meters. Canal officials have imposed draft restrictions, forcing ships to lighten their load. A ship`s draft limit is the minimum depth of water it can safely navigate. And if a ship is carrying too much cargo, it risks getting trapped in the canal. Since May, ships have had to reduce their cargo by as much as 25%. The Panama Canal Authority has also limited the number of vessels authorized to enter the canal each day. Creating a bottleneck with some ships waiting as long as 14 days to get through. As of Tuesday, 116 vessels were waiting to pass. The canal`s administrator warns the number of authorized vessels could decrease further when the drought continues into next year. This has led to rising freight costs which are likely to continue in the months leading up to both Christmas and the Chinese New Year. The Canal`s administrator has said the drought could wipe away $200 million in revenue in 2024. And he says they may need to build a new dam or connect the canal to another nearby lake to keep water flowing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
