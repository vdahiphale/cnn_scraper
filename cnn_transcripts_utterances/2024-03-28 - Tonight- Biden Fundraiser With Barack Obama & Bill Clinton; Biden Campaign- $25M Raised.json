We'll bring you all the breaking details from the first hearing since the judge allowed Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis to continue spearheading the case, which the former president's legal team is trying to get dismissed.Plus, three presidents and a queen. If you count Queen Latifah. That's who will attend an unprecedented star-studded fundraiser for President Biden tonight. It's already brought in millions of dollars. But will those dollars translate into votes? And I did it my way. (VIDEO PLAYING)",

The campaign is clearly capitalizing on this rare joint appearance by the three presidents, one sitting and two-former. And this is a notable political moment for several reasons.First of all, you can't understate the importance of the money here. This is a campaign that had already ended the month of February with some $71 million of cash on hand. That was a double the amount that the Trump campaign had. And now they get to make a significant add to that pot of money and resources. And secondly, there's just the symbolic significance of seeing these three presidents sort of banding together to take on the former President Donald Trump and trying to stop him from returning to the White House. Now, sources have told CNN that President Biden has been in regular touch with both former President Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. And that those two former presidents have also been in pretty regular contact with senior White House officials like Jeff Zients or Steve Ricchetti. And when we see, Dana, tonight's conversation moderated by Stephen Colbert, we expect that the two presidents are basically going to be lending President Biden a hand in helping explain to voters, sort of the stakes of the election upcoming in November. The idea here, of course, is that quite literally, there are no two other people that can better understand and explain to people exactly the importance and the urgency that the Biden campaign sees heading into November as they expect a rematch between President Biden and former President Donald Trump.

That the law is correct here in the way that the D.A.'s office has interpreted it. And that Donald Trump was making false statements that were -- false statements that were lies after the 2020 election. And that is the core of the criminal activity, the criminal conspiracy that they alleged Trump is at the top of. Now the judge didn't say what he's actually going to do here.

We can just toss this indictment out right now. But I think one of the points that prosecutors made is that a tweet itself does not have to be a crime. A statement itself does not have to be a crime that the way the racketeering law works in Georgia.

Falsity is not a viewpoint that is protected. The Trump attorneys then say, no, the government doesn't get to decide what is true and what is false.Look, good effort on the Trump team, but this is not something that is going to carry the day. But look, the Trump lawyers, they have an obligation to file every action for their client. And I'm told that in addition to the perpetual delay strategy, they're playing a long game here. They have to file these motions to preserve them for an appeal. So hypothetically, this goes to trial. There is a conviction.

They're necessarily hanging their hat on this argument.But as Paula said, and as one of his senior advisers told me, look, Donald Trump is paying these lawyers a lot of money. They are being paid to exhaust every single avenue possible and to really fight for that end game, which is to delay this trial as long as possible and delay this path that November election.
