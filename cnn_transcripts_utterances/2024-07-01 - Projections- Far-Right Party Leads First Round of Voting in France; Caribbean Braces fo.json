The U.S. president's family is urging him to stay in the race, but new polling shows many voters disagree. And tracking Hurricane Beryl. The Caribbean is preparing for a dangerous Category 4 storm. We are live in Barbados with the latest. And we do begin this hour in France, where the far right has come out on top in the first round of Parliamentary elections in a blow to President Emmanuel Macron. That projection prompting thousands to take to the streets of Paris Sunday, voicing their opposition after the strong showing by the National Rally Party. Now, initial estimates show National Rally leading with 34 percent of the vote, followed by the left-wing New Popular Front coalition, in second with 28 percent. Now Mr. Macron's centrist alliance is in third, in fact, with about 20 percent. The French leader, who called the snap elections, says a, quote, \"broad, clearly democratic and republican rally is needed in the next round.\" But the National Rally's Parliamentary leader, Marine Le Pen, says democracy has spoken, adding that the second round, set for next Sunday, will be decisive. Now, National Rally leader Jordan Bardella says the vote shows the French people want change and urged voters to remain mobilized. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JORDAN BARDELLA, NATIONAL RALLY LEADER (through translator): The vote they will cast next Sunday is one of the most decisive in the history of the Fifth Republic. Clearly in the view of the results, the presidential camp still largely projected (ph) today is no longer in a position to win. And the high score of the far left raises major concerns.

Because we have three blocs, and among those blocs, R.N. is ahead, but the two other blocks then have to -- to find some kind of solution to prevent this from happening. And that's -- I think there'll be lots of pressure, either from Macron candidates or from some of the left-wing candidates, to withdraw in order to block the R.N.

So they would -- at the end, I think it would -- will be much violence also in the streets. Because a lot of the other half of the population would not support the government.

People are very prepared for this hurricane, as a matter of fact. As I speak to me, it is raining ever so lightly. But Barbadians are prepared, because as of, perhaps, about 12 hours ago, we were told that this was going to pass very close to Barbados. As it stands, it's still closing in on the Windward Islands in the Southeast part as an extremely dangerous Category 4. So we haven't really felt the major effects as yet, but it is raining. There has been some pick-up in wind. But Barbadians are, indeed, prepared for this. Only two days ago, we held the finals of the Cricket World Cup, and there was indeed a danger that, that final might have been under threat. However, the weather was perfect.
