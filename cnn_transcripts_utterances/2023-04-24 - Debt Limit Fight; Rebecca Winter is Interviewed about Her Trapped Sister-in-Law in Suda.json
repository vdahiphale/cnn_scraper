But, you know, is he going to put forward something that will hold together his caucus? Yes, I suppose he will. But it's going to be a lot of deep cuts. It's going to put a lot of people in a position of having to cast some really unpopular votes. A lot of his marginal members, people would won in pro-Biden districts, of which there are about, what, 14, 15, 18 of those members, they're going to be in a really tight spot.

The fighting has been going on now, this recent fighting, for 10 straight days. Some phone lines are down. Some internet connectivity is unstable. And there has been looting because of the lack of police forces. Thankfully, electricity and water have been returning in some areas. The United States is not planning an operation to evacuate American citizens who may want to leave. They say it's too dangerous to do that now.Among those trapped in Sudan, an American teacher and her 18-month-old daughter. Trillian Clifford, you see them there, that's her daughter, Alma. They are caught and they are following U.S. orders to shelter in place and to ration food and water. Her family in Massachusetts is increasingly worried, of course. They say she's made a make-shift shelter under her coffee table to hide whenever they hear gunfire and explosions. So, Trillian's sister-in-law, Rebecca Winter, joins us now. Rebecca, good morning.

First of all, it was very slow to adapt to online shopping. Even as more customers were moving online, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was really focused on just getting people to stores so it missed online shopping.Of course you face a lot of competition from Amazon. But also big box stores like Walmart and Target, TJ Maxx, Home Goods, more shoppers are going to those chains, not just online. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond didn't keep up. And then a few years ago it made the decision to get rid of a lot of its big name brands, which were drawing customers into stores. And it switched to private label brands, which customers weren't familiar with. The move completely backfired and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond actually reversed course. So, you look at its - its sales the last couple of decades, climbing in the '90s, into the 2000s. Then they peaked in about 2014, began to tumble.
