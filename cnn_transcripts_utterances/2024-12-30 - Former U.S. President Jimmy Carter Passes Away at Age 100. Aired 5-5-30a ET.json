Let's talk about inflation. Inflation was -- the inflation of his period, of his time was not his creation. It was in large measure a result of the -- of the oil crisis of his time that was created by the Islamic Revolution in Iran.It was also a product of a -- of some mismanagement on the part of economists who were missing changes in the basic needs of the economy. What did Jimmy Carter do? Jimmy Carter hired as Fed chair somebody he knew who would put up interest rates in order to bring the inflation, the double-digit inflation rate down. Number two, he tried to get the hostages out through negotiation. Those negotiations didn't succeed initially. And so, what did he do? He decided to embark in a risky rescue operation in Iran in 1980 to bring them home. That rescue operation failed. The American people lost confidence in his ability to handle the Iran hostages issue, not at the very beginning, but only after the failure of the Iran hostage mission. It was a mission that he didn't micro-manage. He took the advice from the U.S. military, it was a courageous, smart effort, but it didn't work. And finally, Jimmy Carter pushed for fiscal conservatism as a Democratic President. He wanted a balanced budget. That put him up against the great Senate liberal lion, Ted Kennedy, and Ted Kennedy ran against him for the nomination of the Democrat Party. Ted Kennedy didn't win, but Ted Kennedy's effort, which came very close to toppling Carter, damaged Carter. So, Carter entered the race against Ronald Reagan already a damaged candidate. So, in both -- in all three cases, Jimmy Carter was a victim of his own political courage.",

He also calmed Mid-East tensions, brought together Israeli and Arab leaders at Camp David, opening the door to the Israeli-Egypt Camp David Accords. He normalized relations with China, weakened U.S. ties to Taiwan in a vain hope Beijing would weaken ties with Moscow. But after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, the last year of his presidency, he toughened his Soviet stance, backed the Afghan Mujahideen in a war against the Red Army. The same year, 1979 Islamic revolution in neighboring Iran dealt Carter a double domestic blow, spiked oil prices and led to a humiliating failed raid -- Operation Eagle Claw in April 1980 to rescue Americans captured by the theocratic revolutionaries in Tehran.",

In 1994, he was the first former U.S. President to visit North Korea, met Kim Il-Sung, the grandfather of today's leader Kim Jong un, at a time of U.S.-North Korean tensions, won concessions on North Korea's nuclear program, dialing back tensions for a decade. But 1994 was his big year of high profile peacemaking. In September,he went to Haiti. Raoul Cedras, the Caribbean nation's unpopular leader, was holed up in Port-au-Prince. Carter convinced him to step down quite literally, as the U.S. 82nd Airborne troops were inbound aboard Black Hawk helicopters ready to remove Cedras by force. Carter won the day, saved lives. The U.S. troops landed as de facto peacekeepers. And later that year, Carter went to the dark heart of Bosnia's violent ethnic civil war, met the nationalist Serbs in their mountain stronghold Pollic(ph), tried to stop their bloody, murderous siege and shelling of the capital, Sarajevo, to bring an end to the killing that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives during horrific ethnic cleansing. Success came slowly in steps. Carter helped initiate a short Christmas ceasefire, and by his presence, pushed the horrific conflict toward greater international attention.

Over 300 total severe storm reports, including 58 tornado reports.That system is now offshore for the southeast, but we still have some of it lingering across portions of the Great Lakes and the northeast. You can see some rain here across Vermont, New Hampshire, down through Connecticut, and then some rain and snow sliding in from Michigan and into portions of Ohio. The next system out to the west, this is bringing very heavy snow. But yes, this system itself could have some big implications on new year's eve for other parts of the country. You've got the Winter weather warnings in effect in several of these states. We could be looking at, at least 6 inches to 12 inches in some of these spots obviously even higher amounts once you go up in elevation. But that system again will traverse its way across the country later today and into Tuesday, and then eventually by Wednesday, sliding into portions of the northeast. And then this begs the question, OK, so, what does the new year's eve forecast actually look like for some of these areas? If you've got some outdoor celebrations in Cleveland, Chicago, New York, several areas of the Midwest and the northeast could have some rain and snow mixing in. Doesn't mean you can't get out and enjoy it, just you're going to have to bundle up for those specific festivities. New year's eve itself in New York City, we are looking at rain showers, Paula, but at least temperature-wise, it should be nice and mild.
