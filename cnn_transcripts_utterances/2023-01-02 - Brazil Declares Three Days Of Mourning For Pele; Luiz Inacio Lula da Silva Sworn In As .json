In just a few hours, a massive wake will be held in the city of Santos. Pele's coffin currently being moved to that area. When it arrives, it'll be placed in the middle of a stadium where he played most of his career. Thousands of people are expected to show up and pay their respects. It is a much needed moment of unity and a country in a time of uncertainty. Stefano Pozzebon reports from Santos in Brazil.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST (voiceover): How do you mourn a legend, a person who always brought so much joy to everyone who saw him? These football fans in the Brazilian city of Santos do it their own way by laughing and cheering. This is the old guard. Those who had the privilege of watching Pele play more than 60 years ago and now are preparing to say goodbye. Some show off their tattoos. Others hold on to old tickets as if they were relics. In his last match, the stadium was jammed. Everyone screaming, chanting. When Pele left the pitch, it all went quiet. It was silence. And then half the people left. Because why stay if you don't see Pele? But in a city where everyone has a story about the legend, here is someone who knew the man himself. A true lover of the game. Cosmo Damieu (ph) founded the first supporters club in the city back when Pele was playing. POZZEBON (on camera): It's a mixed feeling of celebrating the life of the player for being sad because your friend died. Yes. You have no idea how much I would like to say come back, King, and be with your people. This piece of land is your house. POZZEBON (voiceover): The city of Santos has declared seven days of mourning to remember Pele. And outside the old football stadium, the tributes are endless. Inside, everything is ready. Here is where Pele's body will lie for 24 hours. POZZEBON (on camera): Like a circle that comes to a full close. Pele's final farewell will be in the same ground where he gave so much joy to his fans. Back then hundreds of them will be cheerful in these stands that are now silent, mourning the king of football. POZZEBON (voiceover): As the new year begins, one last peek at history. One more final whistle for the greatest of them all. Stefano Pozzebon, CNN, Santos, Brazil. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled his case a mistrial, clearing his path to run for reelection, but moving over his new political era, threats of violence from his predecessors supporters. CNN's Julia Vargas Jones with more on the transfer of power from the outgoing president, Jair Bolsonaro.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JULIA VARGAS JONES, CNN PRODUCER (on camera): Brazil had been holding its breath for the past two months, but today the country was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief. That's because outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro had said he was not going to accept the result of the elections if he lost. His supporters took to the streets, blocked highways, and marched to military headquarters, asking for a military intervention. But instead of resisting the transfer of power, Bolsonaro himself left the country on Friday, leaving for the United States and leaving the door open for the new administration to focus on the future. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office for the third time today, but stepping into a very different Brazil than he left when he left office in 2010. This is a country that has a sluggish economic performance, skyrocketing levels of inequality and poverty. And Lula speaking to his supporters that went to greet him in Brazilia today, he got very emotional speaking about hunger. Food insecurity has always been a topic that very close to Lula's heart. And he told a story of a man he saw in 1989, his first presidential campaign, when a sign that said, help me please, I'm hungry, and how that shaped his political career. Today, Bolsonaro's absence also contributed to that tone, to that emotional tone that even for Brazilian standards was quite high, quite emotional. Lula getting tearful many times throughout the day. Instead of being received by the outgoing president to get the customary presidential sash that we do here in Brazil, he was handed over this sash by a group of people representing Brazil's diversity. This was a very famous indigenous leader, a black woman, workers, a young black kid. All of this a nod to what the priorities of Lula's government will be for the next four years.

How do you think the country might change under Lula? ERIC FARNSWORTH, VP, COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAS AND AMERICAS SOCIETYWell, thanks, Michael. It's great to be back with you. And Happy New Year to you and your viewers. It's a sea change for Brazil. There's no question about it. Lula has already gotten off to a fast start. He's talked about he wants to govern for all of Brazil, not just for those who voted for him. He wants to be an inclusive president. He wants to be somebody who clearly brings the country back together after a very divisive and very ugly presidential campaign earlier at the end of last year. But the challenges you have pointed to are real. The wounds continue to be real. And, you know, the memory that many people have of Lula when he was president the first couple of times at the beginning of the century was when Brazil was in a different place politically, economically, the global economy was doing much better. There were resources to spread around to the impoverished and that for the things. So Lula has raised expectations very high. The question is, will he be able to meet those? If he doesn't, how will the public respond?",

This takes the opposition outside of the constitution in terms of their own prospects for change. And it really opens the door to charges that the whole thing is just politics anyway, not according to the constitution.That gives Maduro a stronger position. Of course, he's been welcomed now, re-welcomed across the region in Brazil for the inauguration of the Brazilian president, in Colombia, other places as well, where he had been ostracized. So, his position has strengthened. And, you know, the Venezuelan people are supposed to have elections in 2024. Maduro may even move those up to 2023 this year to try to catch the opposition in disarray and try to receive another mandate. I would argue his other one is the one he's under now is not free or fair, it's illegitimate. But, you know, if he's the only one who's running, it's hard to make that case going forward, particularly if they're international observers, et cetera. So, it's a delicate time for the opposition.

All the Taliban really has to do to support terrorist groups is to do nothing, to be passive and let them not only keep sanctuary but to plan and plot and organize. There's any number of members of, and depending how you count them, anywhere from 10 to 24 different terrorist groups that we in the intelligence community used to consider Al-Qaeda partner organizations. Those are organizations that were very much alive with Al-Qaeda and the Haqqani Taliban network, which itself is a part of the Taliban.Its chief, Sirtajuddin Haqqani, is the current Acting Interior Minister of Afghanistan, and they've really allowed an opportunity for these terrorist groups to take advantage from the labor force that's there, from those seeking sanctuary from countries they're fleeing and operating against from terrorist groups from Taliban fighters who are out of work to former government fighters who are out of work. So the opportunity for these groups to continue to form and organize and plot is very challenging when the United States no longer has the infrastructure for intelligence collection on the ground that came with having an official presence there for several years.",
