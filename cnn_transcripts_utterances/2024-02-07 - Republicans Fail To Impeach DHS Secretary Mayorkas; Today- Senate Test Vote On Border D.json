Those three congressmen brought the vote to a tie. That is, until Democrat Al Green, who had been absent after recovering from abdominal surgery, appeared at the very last minute, rolling into the chamber in a wheelchair. He's still in hospital garb and without shoes to cast a decisive last vote. What a scene. And look, we haven't even gotten to what else happened with the Republican Party yesterday, the likely nominee, Donald Trump, declared not immune from prosecution for trying to subvert the 2020 election. There's that border security bill full of conservative priorities that's set to tank in the Senate.And the Republican National Committee, the actual party itself, has so much less money than they normally do that their head, Ronna McDaniel, announced she's going to quit and will likely be replaced by someone who led stop the steal efforts in North Carolina. That person, of course, handpicked by Donald Trump. There's a lot. Let's bring in Max Cohen. He's a congressional reporter for Punchbowl News to talk about all of this. Max, good to see you. You were on the Hill yesterday as this all went down. I mean, can you describe the scene? Al Green being led in, in a wheelchair in hospital scrubs, and I think we should just underscore for people. This was a bill that House leadership, the new Speaker Mike Johnson, was pushing on Israel aid. He couldn't get that through. And then of course, this is a House Republican led effort to impeach Mayorkas. This isn't something they had to do, something and they wanted to do and they couldn't pull it off.",

And still went through with them. It's really mind-boggling managerial strategy of the majority and its honestly evocative what we've seen throughout the entire 118th Congress with this Republican majority, a very slim majority, mind you, but they've repeatedly shown internal infighting will sink some of their top priorities.Just quickly on the vote itself, on Mayorkas, I was right off the House floor. The vote looked like it would narrowly pass to impeach Mayorkas. And then as you described, Al Green emerges from an elevator in a wheelchair. No one knew that he would be there that day except maybe Al Green and Democratic leadership, most staffers I talked to expected him to miss that vote, the three Republican no votes would actually not sink it, but it really was a dramatic moment. Staffers were totally stunned and you saw that clip of Mike Johnson gaveling in. He was incredibly frustrated because this is a priority for him",

You know, this is a temporary setback, but we do expect Mayorkas to be impeached as soon as next week.Scalise is undergoing cancer treatment back home in Louisiana. But I believe leadership is going to say, we need you back. Mr. Majority Leader, welcome back and vote. And that will not sink it. So in the end, Mayorkas will end up being impeach, but the fact that as you said in your opening, they didn't have to do this now. They knew Scalise was out, they knew it was tight. Why not wait?

It's incredibly thin with all the retirements and vacancies. He has no margin for error on most votes. But even with that being said, you know, there are these errors, which seems to be keep popping up. He might face a motion to vacate in the coming months depending on what happens with government funding, he's in a tough spot, but even people in leadership were working with Johnson are questioning why he keeps, you know, failing on a very public stage with these unforced errors",

No one can accuse James Lankford of being a moderate or centrist, and he's been completely hung out to dry by his fellow Senate Republicans on this issue.They've abandoned his border bill. And I was at that press conference yesterday with Mitch McConnell on the Republican leader in a stunning reversal of his own -- of his own desires. McConnell knowledge, this bill is dead. This is a bill McConnell push for, he gave Lankford the power to negotiate it. And even though McConnell supports it, and noted that the Border Patrol Union supports the bill, which he thinks is a big sign. He knows that because Donald Trump is opposed to it and crucially because Mike Johnson has pledged to never bring it to the floor, they can't move forward. What we will see those soon is that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will try to move that national security supplemental, Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan funding to the floor with, without being attached to the border funding. That's the next step in the Senate.",

Because clearly one of them is how many Palestinian prisoners should be released from Israeli jails? The other is the potential length of a ceasefire. Am I missing anything? How do you understand the landscape of the back and forth here? GOTKINEFirst would be women and civilians and children. And then we would see soldiers and then bodies released by Hamas, and then Israel would release also minors and other Palestinian prisoners. But then Hamas would also be wanting to see some high-level prisoners being freed as well, perhaps those that Israel would describe as having blood on their hands. So the broad parameters are there in terms of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and also more humanitarian aid going in and some kind of ceasefire. But as I say, the devil will be in the detail in terms so the kind of prisoners that Hamas is demanding be freed. For example, if they are just too high level for Israel to countenance and also the amount of pause or complete ceasefire that Hamas will be demanding in order to get a deal across the line. Of course, Israel has its own red lines as well. At some point, there is hope that they will meet in the middle. So bit weary optimism now perhaps, Kasie, that a deal can be done at some point in the near future.",
