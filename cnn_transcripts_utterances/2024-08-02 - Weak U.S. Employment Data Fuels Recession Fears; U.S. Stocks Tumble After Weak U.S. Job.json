Jobs jolt, stock markets fall as weak U.S. employment data fuels recession fears. Retaliation ready, Israel bracing for attack as Hamas political chief is buried in Qatar. Overwhelming evidence the U.S. says President Nicolas Maduro lost the presidential election in Venezuela, while his government accuses Washington of a coup attempt. And Marchand Magic, France's Olympic gold hero, completes one of the most audacious double wins in swimming history. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, call it the jobs jolt that rocked global markets, a disappointing read on U.S. employment, triggering a steep sell off on Wall Street and a rise in bonds, all signaling fresh fears over a greater than expected slowdown in the U.S. economy. The U.S. adding just 114,000 jobs net last month. Missing expectations by a wide margin and adding to a month's long slowdown. It also followed a number of other economic red flags this week, including mixed tech earnings, dismal manufacturing data, and signs of weaker consumer spending. I can tell you stocks did finish off this session lows, but the Dow and S&amp;P dropped well over 1 percent. The NASDAQ fared worse and is now down 10 percent from recent highs. That's the technical definition of being in a correction. Context, of course, key. U.S. stocks were at record highs just a few weeks ago, and U.S. economic growth is still strong overall. Today's report does, however, and has led to a frantic round of finger pointing and criticism of the Federal Reserve for not cutting rates this week. JPMorgan and Citigroup now believe the Fed will cut by a total of 1 percentage points this year, if not more. Richard Quest, It's here. Richard, shoulda, woulda, coulda are the last words of a fool. The question is, was the Fed foolish not to cut rates yesterday?",

And so, yes, the reality is, as inflation has come down, so real interest rates adjusted for inflation are now much more heavily towards tightening and the question of whether or not they've stomped on the brakes too hard. Julia, look at this graph and you'll -- it explains why we are where we are. All the interest rate rises that we have had over the last two years or so, they've had a cumulative effect. They've built up in the system more and more to the point where it's almost an irresistible force. There you see it. It's an irresistible force down on the economy, because there's a monetary lag, as you know, between 9 and 15 months.

      "sentences": "Julia, this is arguably the largest shift of U.S. forces to the region we have seen a Since thebeginning of the war back in October. According to a statement just released a short time ago from the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered a carrier strike group to the region, the USS Abraham Lincoln. That's currently in the Pacific. It will replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group, which is already in the region. In addition, there will be destroyers and cruisers capable of intercepting ballistic missiles that are headed to the region. Although, the Pentagon, at this point, is not specifying which warships will be headed. And they're going not only to the Middle East, but also to the Mediterranean Sea. From that perspective, it's worth remembering that U.S. destroyers in the Mediterranean Sea intercepted ballistic missiles that were part of the Iranian barrage that was fired back in April against Israel. So, they have shown their value in that capability before here. So, they, too, will be operating both in the Mediterranean Sea and in the Middle East to intercept this anticipated Iranian retaliation. Also, worth noting that Austin -- or rather the statement from the Pentagon says Austin also ordered a fighter squadron to the region. Fighter jets have been used to intercept Houthi attacks against ships and others in the region over the course of the past several months. So, we have seen these capabilities operate before. What is noteworthy is the amount of them sent right now. And, Julia, that speaks to what the U.S. is anticipating here. We have spoken with officials here over the past several days who say this might be like April 13th when Iran launched ballistic missiles and drones at Israel, or it could be much larger than that, including a coordinated attack with Hezbollah against Israel, with the Houthis also against Israel, and potentially, Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria firing on U.S. forces in the region. All of that is on the spectrum of possibility, and that's why the U.S. is sending this level of forces to be ready for as much of that as possible. In terms of the timing, we have seen the rhetoric from Iran, we have seen the rhetoric from Hezbollah, and officials say they're anticipating that a response could come sometime in the coming days here. This is something they're watching very closely, trying to pick up on any intel that gives them a hint as to where this response might fall on the spectrum of possibilities as they look to prepare for it. President Joe Biden promised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. would boost its defensive forces in the region here. As it tries to help Israel, making clear that this is for defensive purposes and this is not some new attack that the U.S. will try to carry out. The U.S. trying to live up to that commitment, the Biden administration trying to live up its -- to its commitment to stand by Israel for what it calls its defensive needs. And this is what the U.S. is showing here. Julia.",

In addition to Wall Street's losses, European stocks also suffered. Germany leading the decline, down over two and a quarter percent. And if that was bad, Asia was worse. We saw sizable losses across the board, with the Nikkei down almost 6 percent. The Japanese topics has also had its worst day in eight years. And it wasn't just stocks, actually. U.S. bond yields fell to their lowest point this year and oil prices tumbled on slower growth fears too. Let's get some context. Joining us now, Jason Schenker, is the president and chief economist of Prestige Economics. Jason, welcome to the show.

So, to say that this is catastrophic is a little bit too far. But I think what analysts are worried about is that this is the camel's nose under the tent and there's a lot more to come against that, right, the idea that there's never just one cockroach, that there's going to be more bad jobs data to come. There's also the idea that one report does not a trend make. And so, we're going to be watching that next jobs report more closely than ever to see if this is the outlier or if this is the trend and if things are going to get worse.

There's this thing called the sum rule where if the unemployment rate goesup more than half a percent in a year, it's a signal of recession. The same thing is true if we look at the ISM, where the below 50 for a period of time is a signal of recession, but that's been weak for a while. And so, you have now two data points two days in a row that could mean a recession is brewing, but we're coming out of very exceptional times. And so, this might be one of those times where that rule also finds an exception. It doesn't mean there's not risk, it doesn't mean a recession couldn't happen, but we still have about 8.2 million open jobs as of the month of June and jobless claims are below 1.9 million. So, considering the totality of the data, the Fed is probably still going to be a little bit worried about inflation. By the way, if the market freaks out by the fact that this report is, whatever, 60,000, 70,000 fewer jobs than expected, it's not a big delta, right? Imagine if this had been a negative number, what would have happened, right? But this wasn't negative. It was still a positive addition, but rate cuts are coming.

Some of this is really great. The lifting of two of their colleagues on a bar, which you'll see in a second is great. Firstly, what do you make of this? And secondly, how difficult is it to stay fit in space? How hard are some of these maneuvers, Leroy? Oh, look. This is it.",

We are scheduled to exercise for two hours a day, and that includescardiovascular, you know, doing an exercise bike and/or doing a treadmill. Of course, in zero-G you need a harness and rubber bungees to hold you down onto the treadmill to use it. We have resistance exercise devices. And so, all that is very important to keep your circulatory system, your heart in shape and also your muscles and your bones. And so, two hours of exercise a day, pretty much didn't miss many days. Only when you get super busy. But, you know, having fun like these guys are having, these folks are having up on the station that's a lot of fun. It's easy to do gymnastics and zero-G, a lot easier. You know, I wouldn't personally try it on Earth. But yes, you could see the fun they're having and it's pretty easy to do those kinds of things.

BELL (voice-over): The controversy over Khelif's gender has been fueled in part by her disqualification from the 2023 World Boxing Championships, after the International Boxing Association says she and another boxer failed an unspecified gender eligibility test. But the IOC cleared Khelif and the other athlete to fight in the Paris Games, casting doubt on the test that was previously used by the IBA, which was stripped of its recognition as the official boxing body for the games by the IOC for corruption and financially related issues. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said she didn't think the fight between Khelif and Carini seemed fair and raised her concerns with the IOC. GIORGIA MELONI, ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): I think that athletes who have, let's say, male genetic characteristics should not be allowed to compete in women's competitions, and not because we want to discriminate against anyone, but to protect the right of female athletes to be able to compete on equal terms. BELL (voice-over): And some spectators say they wish that the IOC had done more to head off a potential backlash before the fight began.",

He's in such red-hot form, sparkling form again the pool on Friday, just powered his way to a fourth gold medal at these games. And nobody has more goals as of right now at these Olympics. His latest gold coming, this was in the men's 200 meters individual medley. He also did it, just for good measure, in an Olympic record time of 1.5406 seconds, just six-hundredths of a second, in fact, of the world record time of the American Ryan Lochte. This gold adding to his triumphs in the 200 meters breaststroke, the 200 meters butterfly, and the 400 meters individual medley. Marchand, who attended Arizona State University over here in America, he could be far from done too. He could -- Julia, he could win two more golds if he competes in additional team events. What a story le roi. I'm using my French high school skills here. Le Roi means the king, and he's proving to be just that ever so regal at these games. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEON MARCHAND, WON 200M INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY GOLD: It's been unbelievable. Four gold medals is not what I thought I could possibly do. I was trying to try to win one at first. I had four chances of doing it. So, after the (INAUDIBLE), I was really relaxed by the crazy race that I just did. Four gold medals is -- yes, just -- I didn't know it was possible (END VIDEOTAPE)",
