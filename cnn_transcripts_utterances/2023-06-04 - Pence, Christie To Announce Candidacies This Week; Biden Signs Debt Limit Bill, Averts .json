Of course, all of these candidates are seeking to be the alternative to former President Donald Trump. He was the only candidate who was not in Des Moines on Saturday for Senator Joni Ernst's annual roast and ride. That is a political event featuring a side of barbecue, some motorcycle riding, as well as political rhetoric. Now, it is clear these Republican voters, most of the ones we talk to say they are indeed looking for a change, they are indeed looking for someone, the strongest candidate to win back the White House and defeat Joe Biden's policies. It's unclear, of course, at this point, who that may be. But one of the contenders, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, she made the case to voters, why she believes her time is now. FORMER GOV. NIKKI HALEY (R-SC), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've got to start doing this in a way that we can win a general election. It's time for a new generational leader. We've got to leave the baggage and the negativity behind. We've got a country to save. Don't complain about what you get in a general if you don't play in this caucus, because it matters.",

Of course, he is the leading contender at this point.

She has been making the case for the last several months here, in fact, holding more campaign events than most any other candidates. But she certainly is trying to make up for some ground here, trying to really get her name better known among these Republican voters. But as the summer begins, as the field grows, there is no doubt, Republicans are hungry for change, but they're also open to considering a wide variety of candidates. Iowa, of course, has a great tradition of humbling front-runners and evaluating challengers. That's exactly what Nikki Haley hopes happens.

Now, in that statement, President Biden, he highlighted and really thanked House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's Republican counterpart over there in the house for his efforts to try to get a deal through. We know they spent a lot of time on the phone and in meetings, trying to get something passed. And of course, now they're there. Now, on Friday, we heard from President Biden in the Oval Office, where he was really right to get the last word in this weeks' long discussion. He talked about what was in the bill, what was not in the bill that didn't get chopped up, as well as the importance of bipartisanship in this negotiation period and getting this bill done.

Of course, the White House says that they want to strengthen and deepen ties with that meeting. And on Thursday, as you can see on the screen here, the White House meeting with prime minister of the United Kingdom, a really U.S. ally and they're going to have a full schedule that includes an official meeting as well as a press conference.

And I wonder if, what would it take for President Biden to shift the narrative and start to get credit for things like inflation, that is cooling. Still high, but cooling job growth, which is strong, which was evidenced by Friday's job report, and a consumer that still continues to spend. LYNN SWEET, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, CHICAGO SUN-TIMES: Well, we'll know Monday. The markets will probably have a positive response, certainly not a negative response to the deal. And President Biden, I think, pretty cunningly, isn't looking for massive credit. That helps him keep his relationship with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Doesn't hurt him to make it look like McCarthy did well on this thing. It's part of, I think, a craftier plan, and maybe a smarter plan, looking ahead to working with the Republican-controlled House.

On the face of it, they say that it's anti-Putin Russian fighter who is normally fight on the side of Ukraine here in Ukraine.
