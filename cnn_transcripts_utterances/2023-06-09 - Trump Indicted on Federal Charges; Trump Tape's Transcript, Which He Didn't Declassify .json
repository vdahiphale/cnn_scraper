      "sentences": "We have not heard a whole lot, John. And one big reason why is the halls here are empty. Other than tourists and reporters, there's pretty much who are occupying right now. Members of Congress are gone, probably much to the relief of a lot of Republicans who have not yet weighed in on the news that Donald Trump has, in fact, been indicted on federal charges.We have not heard from the Senate Republican leaders. Mitch McConnell, silent. John Thune, number two Republican, silent. There have been Trump supporters who have issued tweets in his defense, including Republicans Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, showing the divide within the upper ranks of Republican leadership over how to deal with Donald Trump. McCarthy rushing to Donald Trump's defense last night, indicating they planned to use the power of the house to go after the Justice Department. Saying in a tweet that it is unconscionable for a president to indict the leading candidate opposing him. Joe Biden kept classified documents for decades. And he says, I, and every American who believes in the rule of law stand with President Trump against this grave injustice. House Republicans will hold this brazen weaponization of power accountable. Now, just to be clear, it was not President Biden who indicted Donald Trump. It was a federal grand jury led by a special counsel that led to this indictment of -- to Donald Trump. And also, you're seeing an effort to try to compare Joe Biden mishandling classified documents with what happened with Donald Trump. But we know from Trump's own attorneys it's much broader than that. It involves issues of obstruction of justice, other charges as well beyond just the handling of documents. And we also have not seen any of the charges at all. And even as Republicans are vowing to try to go after the Justice Department, it's unclear exactly what they mean by that and whether they'll use the power of their subpoena power to try to go after the special counsel. But there are some Republicans who are speaking out against Donald Trump, namely some of those Donald Trump critics, like Senator Mitt Romney who just issued a statement saying that, by all appearances, he says, the Justice Department has exercised due care. He said, it afforded Donald Trump the time and opportunity to avoid charges that would generally have been -- not been afforded to others. He adds, the allegations are serious, and if proven, would be consistent with his other actions offensive to hit the national interests. So, it really just shows you the divide that continues within the Republican Party. We'll see how people -- members speak when they return to Congress next week. We will be asking questions about what they plan to do next and how they plan to respond. John.",

What happens to Former President Trump both legally, and then what kind of political trouble does that spell for him, or does it become a political boost? And that's what a lot of these candidates are waiting to see.And so, we are seeing in their response to what's happened in the last 24 hours. We're starting to kind of see the contours of how they want to respond to this. What kind of needle they're going to thread. And if you just listened to Manu talking about what the House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, said, you noticed that language, the weaponization of the Department of Justice, of the federal government against the former president, against Republicans. That is a talking point that we hear over and over again from Republican leadership on the Hill, but what we are now starting to hear from these Republican presidential candidates as well. So, you turn to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, he tweeted out a statement about this as it was unfolding, and he talked about ending the weaponization of the federal government should he be elected, that's what he believes this is, that the former president is being targeted. Senator Tim Scott, from South Carolina, saying something similar that he believes that the DOJ has been weaponized. That he would look to clear all of that out should he be elected. And then you hear the former vice president there in that clip you just played where he is talking about both that no one is above the law, but also, that, you know, that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. But it was interesting in his statement, he said that the American people, as you mentioned, should judge for themselves. And it went on to say, if this is the weaponization of the federal government or if this is something else. Sara.",

We did hear from Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Sara, again saying, no one is above the law. He wants to see what's in the indictment.

So, candidates are being cautious at this point, that might be prudent. But as we see more about this indictment, as we read the transcripts that Paula Reid unveiled this morning, it's clear that there is a mounting -- there's mounting evidence against Donald Trump. And I would tell these Republican candidates, take this opportunity and take it for two reasons. One, Donald Trump is vulnerable now. And you can either go after him for misdeed whether he's done that or not. And yes, there is the presumption of innocence, but you have a political opportunity here. And also, you can highlight that Donald Trump has too much drama. He's distracted and he can't beat Joe Biden. If your message is one of winning, this gives you an opportunity to do so. Also, for congressional or Senate Republicans, talking about weaponization of the DOJ starts to sound a little bit like defunding the FBI. It cuts at the anti-crime message that Republican have skillfully put on Democrats in the last cycle.",

Look, they rally behind Donald Trump on the first indictment in New York because it was seen by, not just Republicans, even a lot of Democrats thought it was a largely political indictment that if it weren't Donald Trump, this wouldn't happen. This is different. What may happen in Georgia is different.They can take this opportunity, if they choose to. And again, you don't have to attack Donald Trump for wrongdoing. You can say, he is distracted, there's too much drama, and we need to win. And they can be cautious in this -- in these initial hours. But as we see more evidence. As we hopefully hear from DOJ, and Mike Pence is right, we need to hear from the attorney general on this. This provides them the opportunity. Greensboro, this weekend, is the perfect opportunity for a Mike Pence or Ron DeSantis to make that case and to make that break.",

Even before that, we have already started seeing some of his supporters gathering near his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach.CNN's Randi Kaye is standing by. She is there. She's joining us now. Randi, what are you seeing there? RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kate, we are seeing some police presence here at Mar-a-Lago, which is just behind me. Also, we are seeing a fair amount of media. What we're not seeing yet today are protesters. There were a couple of dozen protesters here yesterday evening as soon as news of the indictment broke. We had a chance to speak with some of them, and they were telling me that they believe this is a witch hunt, that's a common refrain that we hear from the former president. Also, that's it's politically motivated. Political garbage is what one of them said to me. And then another suggested that these documents, these classified documents that were found here at Mar-a-Lago, were actually planted there. So, that is what we are hearing from some of his supporters. And of course, we know that this is ground zero for this case. 15 boxes of documents were removed. Also, more than 300 documents marked as classified were removed from here. But as we spoke with the supporters about that, they did not budge on their full support for the former president. Listen.

But we still have a large part of the eastern half of the country under these air quality alerts.And what you're looking at right now is the over 50 million Americans that have these alerts. But I'm going to highlight an area, you can see from Indiana to Ohio, Pennsylvania and parts of Maryland, that is for the smoke. Now, you look where I'm actually centered over, Atlanta, this is an air quality alert for ozone. The difference being that ozone is the pollutants that we receive close to the surface from, let's say, driving vehicles or the industry in this area. So, there's a different reason we have an air quality alert in Atlanta. But one thing's for sure, improvement all around. We still have some thick haze out there in some certain locations.
