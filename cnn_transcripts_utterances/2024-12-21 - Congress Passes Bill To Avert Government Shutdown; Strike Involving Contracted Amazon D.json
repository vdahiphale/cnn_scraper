After a very chaotic 24-hour scramble on Capitol Hill, Speaker Mike Johnson brought a stopgap bill to the floor late Friday that did not include a debt limit suspension. The bill passed with only 34 Republicans voting against it, and all but one Democrat voting for it to pass, even without President-elect Donald Trump's request to suspend the debt limit included in the bill, Speaker Mike Johnson called the vote a win that will set them up for when Trump returns to the White House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): This is America first legislation, because it allows us to be set up to deliver for the American people. In January, we will make a sea change in Washington. President Trump will return to D.C. and to the White House, and we will have Republican control of the Senate and the House. Things are going to be very different around here. This was a necessary step to bridge the gap, to put us into that, that moment where we can put our fingerprints on the final decisions on spending for 2025. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, that really left legislators scrambling to come up with something that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle could support. What's in it? As you mentioned, it's going to be a stopgap bill to fund the government through March, and what that means is that Congress is going to have to do this all over again in just a few short months, but now under President Trump's watch. And it's also got about $100 billion in that much needed disaster relief for those who are still recovering from extreme weather over the past few years, as well as a ten billion Farm Aid Bill. What's not in it, most notably, is a suspension of the debt limit, and that really tees up a fight with President Trump coming up in the next several months.

So, we take a look -- again, you can clearly see the one in the northeast, that one's actually going to be ending as we go through the day today. It's the one on the west coast that really starts today and will ramp up as we go through the next few days. So, let's begin in the Northeast. You can see we still have some snow ongoing, states like Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and even into New York City. Yes, if we zoom down in closer, you can see we've actually got some pretty decent snow bands moving through the city right now. So, if you've got some travel plans, whether that is by air or on the roads, keep that in mind that you are going to have to contend with that stuff. Other areas where we may see some air delays are also going to be along the Great Lakes, places like Cleveland, where you're still going to have potentially, some of that Blake effect snow as we go through the rest of the day today and into the evening hours, looking at some of the snow that's already falling. We have several locations that have picked up five even six inches of snow. Now, I want to make it very clear for the folks who live in these areas, five and six inches is not that big of a deal. But remember, folks, you have people coming from Florida, Texas, a lot of southern states, to these northern cities that are not used to driving in four to six inches of snow. So, keep that in mind too. You could end up having some problems on the roadways from people who just simply don't know how to drive in these conditions. It's also very cold, so that snow is not going to go anywhere anytime soon. It's also very windy, so it's taking some of that snow. It's blowing it into higher totals, maybe 810, inches in some spots, because it's piling up. One thing to note too, it's going to be a while for some of these areas before they finally start to see those temperatures rebound. New York, for example, doesn't even get back to normal until the end of the upcoming week. Out West, quite the opposite story. Ahead of rain and snow, we're having temperatures that could actually be awfully close to record breaking in some spots because of how warm it is.",

Has been doing that for years, and the workers are saying it's enough, it's time to cut a deal, and they're insisting that Starbucks do that.My understanding is that one of the major sticking points in the Starbucks negotiations is just as simple as wages, that Starbucks is proposing a wage increase that's lower than inflation, which means, from the workers lived perspective, they're getting a wage cut.

By beat the odds, I mean, FEMA reports that 40 percent of small businesses don't recover following a natural disaster, and so, we are this kind of creative, resilient, strong community trying to beat those odds, and we are helping each other, and many, many individuals across the whole nation are helping us in western North Carolina. So, we feel -- gratitude. And at the same time, we really, really needed this federal spending package to pass, because so much more is needed.

We lost all of our equipment, all of our inventory, and offices, everything. And, you know, so it's been this path to really try to rebuild our community. There is -- there is been a lot of loss here. And, you know, there is a lot of beauty in that as we rebuild. Beauty and the support that we're receiving, I mean. But also, there is still parts of town that are covered in debris. And, you know, we're just trying to do our holiday shopping and errands around town and things like that, you know, driving around some really horrific scenes still. And that -- and that's parts of town. There are other parts of town that are doing well. You know, downtown is open again, and visitors are starting to come back, which is wonderful.

And, you know, despite being less than 200 miles apart, these schools, they had not played each other since 1991. And this game, though, dominated by Notre Dame.

That run actually tied a school record. The Irish would end up winning 27-17 to get their first ever playoff victory. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
