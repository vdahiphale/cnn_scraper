The vice president also picked up another Republican endorsement today, this one from Alberto Gonzalez, the attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, who called the former president, \"perhaps the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation\" in a POLITICO op-ed today. As for the former president's choice of associates, he is in the spotlight on two fronts tonight. There's right-wing agitator, Laura Loomer, who he has been traveling with to the debate and yesterday to 9/11 remembrances. She's been criticized by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of all people for a racist tweet about the vice president's Indian heritage. We will have more on that coming up. There's also new reporting from national public radio on this guy. His name is Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, who's an ally and yes, federal prosecutors describe him as a White supremacists and if the mustache didn't lead you to this conclusion, a Nazi sympathizer. He was convicted of participating in the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Also, according to NPR, he has twice spoken at the former president's Bedminster Golf Club. Again, according to NPR, one was a fundraiser for group that supports Capitol riot defendants. This is a video message from the former president that played at the event. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And now, in front of a Trump supportive audience. So getting the cheers, getting the laugh lines that he wanted during the debate. Now, in this rally form.Now, Donald Trump went on to say, as you noted, that he had won the debate, that he had a monumental victory even said that polls show that he had won with women and independents, as we have shown CNN polling did not reflect that and most polling that we have seen did not reflect that and most conversations that we have had with Republican operatives, with Republican allies of Donald Trump's did also not reflect that. They were talking about a couple of conservative straw polls from conservative networks that said that Donald Trump won the debate. He also went on to say, that the moderators were unfair. He talked about that at length. And then essentially said that he won, so Kamala Harris wanted that second debate, that's why he wouldn't be doing yet another debate. I cannot stress enough to how many Republicans that I've talked to. These are people who want Donald Trump to win in November, who have hold me. They were disappointed in Donald Trump's performance on that stage. I even spoke to a number of advisers of his who said that they were nervous during the debate. They were nervous while he was speaking during the debate. They were concerned what it was going to look like. Now, they have since said they don't believe it's going to move the needle that much, but clearly tonight, Donald Trump reacting to that. We'll see him tomorrow. He's giving press remarks just outside of LA, where his golf club is, and we will be there hopefully able to get some questions in about not just the debate, but also as you mentioned, him traveling with Laura Loomer.",

And that's, you know, it's something that may not have been very clear at the time. But when you, you know, rise to the sort of 10,000 foot view, which is what this documentary does and join all the dots, it becomes quite chilling. A.

I followed you. Facts. O'SULLIVAN: You know when you're posting this stuff that it's going to start a debate? NESA E.: Yes. O'SULLIVAN: And that's kind of the point? NESA E.: Kind of. Yes.
