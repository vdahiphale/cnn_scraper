      "sentences": "You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. Good evening.There is a new deadline and new back and forth in the latest indictment of former President Donald Trump. The federal judge overseeing Trump's election fraud case has responded to a court filing from Special Counsel Jack Smith that came in last night. Smith wants a protective order after Trump posted this social media message late last night. It says: \"If you go after me, I'm coming after you.\" Smith wants the judge to limit Trump and his legal team in terms of what they publicly discuss about the sensitive evidence in the case and the judge has now given the Trump team until 5:00 PM Monday to respond. Minutes ago, the judge denied a request from the Trump lawyers to push back Monday's deadline. Smith had called it an unnecessary delay. And joining us now to talk about this is Jim Schultz. He's a former Trump White House lawyer. Jim, thanks very much for joining us. We appreciate it. Let's start with what the judge is saying here. There's now a deadline of 5:00 PM on Monday for Trump's legal team to respond. This is going to stand after the judge denied a Trump motion to push it back. They wanted this to be pushed back until Thursday, it sounds. Is that -- how does that Monday deadline sound to you? And what do you make of everything that's transpired over the last 24 hours? You have Trump on social media last night putting out this threat, essentially, one day after he was arraigned in Washington. I would imagine as a former Trump attorney, you would have advised him not to put that out there given that this judge on Thursday was admonishing him to be very careful about intimidating witnesses, trying to communicate with witnesses, and other things that he might do that could damage this case.",

So those types of things are going to be separate from that freespeech argument, but I do expect motions on this and I do think that the judge, and you'll see these motions play out likely in January- February of next year after discoveries played out on this case, and after the defense has gotten a look at what the prosecution has. And I think in that January-February timeframe, there's going to be a lot of motions filed by the defense on this case, I think that's one of them and she is going to want to be thoughtful, this judge is going to be thoughtful about writing on these issues, making sure that when they go up on appeal, that whatever her decision is sticks.",

This ain't the way to do it, but it sounds like he's actually threatening people with physical harm this way. Now, interestingly, the special counsel said to the judge, don't even wait for a hearing, impose the protective order, because it can be modified at any time. You can have a hearing later. They can say, you know what conditions they want, but we want to push the send button and start giving them to discovery and we need reassurances the discovery won't end up on Truth Social.

We have not seen her compete since the Tokyo Games.And the only reason, Jim, you're not seeing all this packed behind me, this is the merch area, normally this would be just absolutely crowded. In fact, let's whip the camera that way. The only reason you're not seeing all the crowds is because they haven't been allowed in yet. There's still half an hour before they can be allowed into this arena, but you see them right there by the door, so many of them just so excited to come here and see all of these amazing athletes compete. Now, Biles is registered for all four events. Two years ago, she shocked the world at the Tokyo Games when she withdrew from her events after suffering what's known as the twisties, that mental block and also spatial block where they can't tell up from down when they're flipping in midair, and that's kind of important if you're an elite gymnast. She received backlash on social media during that time, some people accusing her of abandoning her teammates and of showing a moment of weakness. But her supporters saw it as a testament and proof on - of the demands on elite gymnasts that even the best of the best can't always keep up. Now, I spoke with so many fans just excited to see the greatest of all time back at it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
