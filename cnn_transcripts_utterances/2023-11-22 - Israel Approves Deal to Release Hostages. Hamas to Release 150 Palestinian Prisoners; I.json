Now, the government overwhelmingly backed that deal after a six-hour-long cabinet meeting that one official said grew tense and at times was emotional. Now, the hostages to be freed are expected to be women and children. In exchange, Israel will pause its air and ground campaign against Hamas for 4 days.Hamas says 150 Palestinian prisoners, also women and children, will be released from Israeli jails as part of the deal. Now, Qatar delivered the proposal following weeks of continuous negotiations and now says the humanitarian pause will be announced within the next 24 hours. Hamas says the deal involves the entry of hundreds of trucks carrying aid, medical supplies and fuel into Gaza. And earlier, the Israeli prime minister's office said the deal was set to include Red Cross visits to hospitals, and the Israeli government will be sent to the families of hostages who are now, as you can obviously imagine, anxiously waiting to find out if their loved ones will be among the dozens set to be released.

The details of the deal, as we now understand them, are 50 women and children released from captivity with Hamas for the exchange of Palestinians, women and teenagers held in Israeli prisons. And the opening of the Rafah border for more fuel, including, for more aid, including fuel to be brought back across that border, crucial for humanitarian efforts, of course.And in a statement from the lead negotiator in Qatar, Dr. Mohamed Al- Khulaifi, he said, and I quote here, Qatar's aim since the start of this escalation has been to find ways to adjust. Reduce tensions, stop the bloodshed, protect civilians and protect a regional spillover. The international community must now seize the brief window of opportunity to generate further momentum for the diplomatic track, recognising it as the only viable route to ending the conflict in both the short and long term. Qatar's statement earlier suggests that the pause will start within around 24 hours from now, it is 6.30 in the morning here, local time. And this statement from the lead negotiator went on to say, Qatar's priority now is to ensure that the terms of the agreement are respected while redoubling our efforts to secure a long-term ceasefire. And this statement includes the term redoubling our efforts to secure a long-term ceasefire. End the conflict. End the war. And work towards lasting peace through a comprehensive political process. Perhaps not a surprise that Qatar would be seeking a long-term ceasefire in this statement. After all, that has been its position from the outset of this conflict. Becky Anderson, CNN, Doha.

Hamas has to be weakened. It has to be eliminated. It has to be destroyed as much as possible. And it has to be removed from power inside the Gaza Strip, so it can never carry out the massacres like it did on October 7th.On the other hand, the heart is bleeding for these hostages. And the thought that 50 of them can come home now, that children, there's 30 under the age of 16, 17, that elderly, that mothers, that women, if at least just that, we can get those back to Israel. That is what the heart wants. And I think that this clash is going to be very, very difficult for Israelis in the days ahead, because they want to see Hamas continue to be weakened.

There's four Israelis, at least two alive, two that we don't know who were taken in 2014. They held on to an Israeli soldier from 2006 to 2011. This can be years long. A decade, if not dealt with as soon as possible. And therefore, the military campaign on the ground put Hamas under pressure.The fact and the threat against its continued survival in regime and leadership, and the threat against the leaders themselves who are hiding in some bunker somewhere underneath the Gaza Strip, they felt that pressure. And that's why they wanted to make this release in this deal, because now it gives them a reprieve. It gives them a break of just a few days for them to regroup, rearm, redeploy, re-entrench inside Gaza. And that's why they wanted to make this release. And that's why they wanted to make this release. And that's the concern here in Israel, because the mission's not completed, right? Israel's been operating just in northern Gaza, not yet in southern Gaza. There's still thousands of Hamas fighters, three brigades. The Hamas leadership is still alive and intact in the south. And therefore, if Israel wants to continue with this mission of taking out Hamas, it's going to have to continue on the ground in the southern part of the Gaza Strip.",

And then what's stopping the Europeans and the Americans calling up the prime minister here in Israel and saying, listen, you've stopped already for 5, 6 7 days. What's the point in reengaging? Let's find another solution to this.But I think that Israelis also understand is that while this is a break in the fighting, it's a lull, the overarching mission here of taking down Hamas still remains, right? What happened to Israel on October 7th is still shakes every Israeli to the core. And I think the world understands that these type of Hamas ISIS-like groups cannot remain surviving, cannot remain in power in Gaza. And therefore, I have to hope that we can get back as many hostages as possible.

Now, the U.S. believes it's possible that three Americans could potentially fall into this category of the 50 women and children that could be released in the coming days. That could also potentially include 3-year-old Abigail Adan.She is an American citizen whose parents were killed in that October 7th attack by Hamas. The U.S. says that they are working tirelessly to ensure the release of all American citizens who have been held hostage, and they are hopeful that after this initial release, that the U.S. will be able to release them. This can provide incentives for Hamas to release more hostages as well. But this all comes as the administration, the White House, has been in constant contact with leaders in the region as they have been working through these negotiations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that President Biden himself had gotten involved and that he believed the president had improved these negotiations. The president had spoken with the emir of Qatar twice last week. Qatar, of course, acted as a key mediator in these talks between Israel and Hamas. And now the U.S. will be closely watching to see how many Americans will be included in this initial release. Officials say it'll take about 24 hours to implement the deal before they can begin seeing these hostages released.

RATUSHNYY: I think that he was a person all this time. Maidan just helped him to conduct this transformation. COREN (voice-over): On the 21st of November, 2013, a few hundred people gathered at Maidan, Independence Square, to protest against the government's decision not to sign an association agreement with the European Union. Then-President Viktor Yanukovych had ditched closer ties with Europe and pivoted towards Russian President Vladimir Putin. Within weeks, the protests swelled as thousands of people took over Maidan. Police violence intensified over the next three months, until riot police, using live rounds, opened fire, killing more than 100 protesters. OLHA SALO, EUROMAIDAN PROTESTOR (through translator): The youngest of them was 17. The oldest was 82. There were people from all over Ukraine, from different professions, different education. I think this is a collective mission of Ukrainian heroes, and they all died of the same violence. COREN (voice-over): In the following months, Putin would occupy Crimea and covertly back separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Maidan set in motion a series of events that would reshape Ukraine and alter the course of history.",
