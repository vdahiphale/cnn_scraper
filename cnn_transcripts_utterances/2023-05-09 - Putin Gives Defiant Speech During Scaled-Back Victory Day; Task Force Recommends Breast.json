It's worth pointing out that this is more medium and long-term not pulled directly from DOD stocks, so this will take some time to arrive in country. One other element here that's interesting is equipment needed to integrate all of Ukraine's different air defense systems. So, some of their older Soviet-era equipment like S-300s as well as what we just saw not only get into the country but be used for the first time, and that's the advanced Patriot system.We got one of our rare looks at U.S. training on Patriot systems for Ukrainians as well as German and Dutch trainers for Ukrainians. And this is the final stage of validation in mid-April before it went into the country. And we have already seen how effective the Patriots can be. For the first time, according to Ukraine intercepting the Russian Kinzhal ballistic missile known as the killjoy according to NATO, this was a missile that Russian President Vladimir Putin said was impossible to intercept. Ukraine just proved otherwise. So, you see how important this is especially the long-term commitment, John, to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to fight back against Russia and for that counteroffensive that we all expect is looming.",

The annual military parade to mark the Soviet Union's triumph over Nazi Germany was also noticeably scaled back this year. Russia usually never misses a chance, especially on this significant anniversary to flex its military might. Well, this year, here's what's -- was -- here's what was noteworthy.Take a look at your screen. There was only one tank on display, and it was a Soviet-era tank no less, seen on the left side of your screen. During last year's procession seen on the other side of your screen, you can see a much larger procession of more modern tanks. The size of the crowds at this year's parade was also visibly smaller. Here you can see a side by side the difference in Parade participants. Roughly 4000 fewer troops this year than last. CNN's Matthew Chance is joining me now for much more on this. Matthew, you were at last year's parade. What sticks out to you about this?",

There were definitely fewer troops, as you pointed out.But you know, I think it's important to remember that it was still a major show of Russian strength. I mean, the centerpiece of this military parade, as it is every year, was still Russia's intercontinental ballistic missiles. They were paraded across the cobbles of Red Square just like they are every year. And it's a potent reminder of the nuclear threat that Russia poses, of course. But yes, you're right, it was a much -- it was a much smaller presence, otherwise. There was that one tank, as opposed to the columns of tanks we've seen in previous years. Now, that may have been for security reasons but it's there's a whole load of speculation that this was actually because Russia -- Russian armor is getting such a pounding in the field in Ukraine, that they weren't able to muster enough armor to bring onto Red Square. That's probably an exaggeration but the fact that Russia is currently digging in in Ukraine, or waiting for the Ukrainian counteroffensive that we've been talking about. You know this is an indication that they don't have an excess of weaponry that they can just throw onto Red Square, sort of at will. And so, I think that's potentially quite significant, Kate.",

That is the new recommendation just coming out from a key group of medical experts. These draft guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is lowering the recommended age to begin regular mammograms by 10 years.CNN's Jacqueline Howard has the details on this and she's joining us now.

But now, they're coming down stronger on this saying all women should start breast cancer screening at age 40.And we already know that it's estimated that nearly 13 percent -- 12.9 percent of women born in the United States could be diagnosed with breast cancer at some time in their life. And I spoke with task force members, they said that we are seeing an annual increase in breast cancer diagnoses in this country. So, that's why they're recommending to start screening for average-risk women at age 40 to catch cancers earlier, which will reduce the risk of dying from the disease and enhance their survival. Now, another important note, Kate, other groups have already been recommending to start mammograms in your 40s. So, this is the task force kind of catching up with what other organizations have been saying, and what as a society some doctors have been telling their patients to do is to start in your 40s as well.",
