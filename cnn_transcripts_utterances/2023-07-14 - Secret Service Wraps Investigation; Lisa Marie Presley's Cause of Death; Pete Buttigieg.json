That's not the case here it sounds like from the report.Two ways that it might still contribute though. One is that what I just described earlier can be painful. And opioids, other medications can mask that pain. Someone may go to the hospital a it later as a result. And the second thing is, opioids can also further slow down your intestines. So, a blockage that was already unfolding could have been made worse. But the idea that the opioids themselves led to the death, they're saying that did not happen here.",

The severe weather also causing thousands of flight delays and cancellations on top of that. The air travel system doesn't seem to have enough bodies to deal with the disruptions.Joining us now is Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Mr. Secretary, thanks for your time. I want to start with what Kirby called the irregular operations events. If climate change is clearly only getting worse and we're seeing it across the country right now, what can the administration do, what can airlines do to address something that doesn't seem to be going away or lessening anytime soon?",

      "sentences": "Well, there's no escaping the fact that when you have more severe weather events, both been happening more often and them getting more severe, that's going to affect every form of transportation. We're assessing what those northeast floods have been doing to the roads in New York state and in particular in Vermont. And of course that's going to affect flight operations. So, there's - there's a reality in front of us that, you know, we're doing everything we can in the long run, fight against climate change, to stop this from getting any worse than it has already gotten.We also have to face the reality at hand. That's why, for the first time ever, under President Biden's bipartisan infrastructure law, we have billions of dollars in a fund that is specifically for resilience. So, with a road it means, if a road is getting washed out annually by what used to be considered a 1,000-year flood, instead of putting it back the same way it was year after year, let's move it, let's redesign it, let's make it safer and more resistant to floods or droughts, wildfires or whatever the biggest threat is. But on the aviation side, too, we have to prepare for this. Now, the other remark that he made that I agree with is, you can't control what the weather is going to be. You have to work on everything you can control about how quickly the system will recover. And I will say that I've been struck by the improvements compared to one year ago that we've seen in the national airspace where we had dramatic storms and disruptions hitting our major hubs, but the system recovering in a way that we would not have seen a year ago. Today, cancellations are below 2 percent and we've seen them come back to that more quickly than they would have a year ago in terms of dealing with those severe thunderstorms. And that's part of what we're closely watching, making sure that airlines are positioning themselves to recover. And then making sure we're doing everything we can on the department side and FAA side to make the system for flexible.",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly we have worked to make sure that there is excellent communication between the FAA and all of the airlines. And, look, we have a complicated relationship with the airlines, right? We are often coming down on them hard when it comes to customer protection, at the very same time that we're working side by side with them to try to make sure that flight operations are going well. We are their regulator from a safety perspective, as well as a competition perspective. But we're also working to make sure the U.S. aviation sector, its interests are being protected in international markets.So, look, there's always going to be a sometimes very intense push- pull between us and the airlines. But as a regulator, first and foremost, we're going to focus on making sure that passengers are protected. And as a general rule, I think that when we have good, strong rules for the airlines, the airline sector ultimately benefits, too, because the public is more confident in what they're getting when they buy that ticket.",

      "sentences": "We are concerned about that. We have some open investigations right now. But I will say, the airlines are scheduling more conservatively than they were before. That's one of the things I pushed them for - pushed them on last year when even on so-called blue sky days, where weather wasn't much of a factor, you're seeing all these delays and cancellations that were completely unacceptable.They've got to have schedules that they can serve with the assets that they have. If they don't, that's obviously unfair to passengers who get left in the lurch and it could also be an indication of an unfair competitive practice. In other words, if an airline is trying to gain market share by selling a schedule that they can't actually back up in a particular route pair, that's a competition issue and that's another reason why, as a regulator, we're watching very closely. MATTINGLY: Can I ask you -- I want to get to Bidenomics and the economy in a second, but I do have one final question for you on airline travel. The idea of pilot shortages has been a significant issue. There are a couple proposals on Capitol Hill right now in the FAA authorization bill. One to increase the retirement age for pilots I think from 65 to 67. There's also, I think, proposals floating around about easing the number of hours that would need to be flown to some degree. Do you support those? Are you in favor of them right now?",

But the bottom line I'll say is that anything that emerges needs to put safety first. And we can look at a lot of different strategies and policies, but we can't do anything that would weaken safety for passengers, for airlines. That's always going to be our top priority as a department.",

As a matter of fact, that's extraordinary, especially where you consider where we've come from. Under President Biden's leadership, more than 13 million jobs created. That's never happened under any president in anything close to this period of time.And something that matters a lot to me coming from the industrial Midwest, a lot of those were manufacturing jobs. The kinds of jobs we used to be exporting overseas. You know, I've got a lot of respect for him as a business leader. But, remember, one of the core elements of Bidenomics is putting a focus on the middle class and working people. Making sure that the economy grows from the bottom up and the middle out. And that's, obviously, not always the same priority you're going to see in the investment banking community versus how important that is and how central that is to what President Biden in this administration are about.",
