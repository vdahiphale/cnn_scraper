      "sentences": "Welcome back to a special edition of the CNN NEWSROOM live from Tel Aviv.Here in Israel, officials are on edge right now as they warn the United States that they're prepared to launch -- and I'm quoting now -- a disproportionate attack if, if Hezbollah in Lebanon harms Israeli civilians with strikes. Sources tell CNN that the Iranian-backed militant group is planning to attack Israel with or without Iran's help. Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida. He serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. I know you're being fully briefed on what's going on over here in Israel. How real is the threat of a regional war breaking out right now? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL):  Thanks, Wolf. Thanks for having me. Thanks for being in Tel Aviv. No, the threat is real, obviously. That's why you see the entire apparatus of the United States government, State Department, DOD working over time with our allies in the regions, why it's good to have friends. That's why Joe Biden has focused so much on that, to try to prevent a regional war. This, of course, is because Iran and Hezbollah are threatening a disproportionate response. Israel the last couple of weeks, obviously, has been taking out the people responsible for October 7, not mass strikes in Lebanon or in Iran, but that's now what Iran and Hezbollah are threatening Israel, major strikes on the civilian population. And so, hopefully, it doesn't happen. Hopefully, this can be contained. But, yes, in the event -- I agree with the Israelis. In the event that Hezbollah or Iran strikes the Israeli population, Israel should respond disproportionately.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, we should always be concerned about that, but why is it always on Israel? Here we go again with the same conversation. It's Israel. It's Israel.So, Iran and Hezbollah, they get to have a disproportionate response to Israel taking out the leaders, the murderers of October 7, individuals, not civilians in the population, not taking out Iranian infrastructure, not taking out infrastructure in Lebanon. They get to now have a disproportionate response to that, but then we say to the Israelis, you don't get to respond in the same way. And so, look, I -- ultimately, we want to do everything we can to prevent a regional war. But I do think Israel should continue to communicate and needs to do what they can militarily to eliminate these threats on their border. Otherwise, this is just going to continue. We may pause it for a period of time now, and then it will heat up again in a couple of weeks or months. So, Israel needs to do what it can to show Iran and Hezbollah that you just don't get to attack Israel for free. BLITZER:  Would you support a preemptive Israeli strike?",

      "sentences": "You know, Wolf, you will remember this story well, right, the drama and, in fact, the hope from so many that, when that search-and-rescue was launched, that these crew members would be rescued. They were not.At issue since then, Wolf, for the families especially, has been two things, right? Could this have been prevented, and, obviously, did our family members suffer? Did they know what was going on? And this lawsuit now filed in the United States, $50 million lawsuit from Paul- Henri Nargeolet, his estate, his family, alleges that both things are true. And I want to read you just one statement from that lawsuit. And it says: \"While the exact cause of failure may never be determined, experts agree that the Titan's crew would have realized exactly what was happening. Common sense dictates that the crew were well aware that they were going to die before dying.\" Now, Wolf, you and I can well imagine the terror and, obviously, the horror that the families may be feeling. This lawsuit alleges that they know this to be true because the crew itself dropped the weights, meaning they aborted this dive about 90 minutes in. And, for that reason, they alleged that they know that their family members were suffering. I will point out that OceanGate that ran this whole mission has declined any kind of comment. And the fact that, at this point in time, investigations are ongoing, again, so many things, so many questions to be determined as this investigation continues. And, Wolf, there are people in these kinds of submersibles still, maybe not these kinds of ambitious projects, but it's an important question that has to be answered here as to why this tragedy happened.",

The U.S. is leading in overall medals, while China has now taking the lead in gold medals with 28 right now.And, today, Team USA will look to add more gold to its haul on the track. American star Noah Lyles is chasing Olympic glory in the men's 200-meter final set to kick off in just a few hours. If he wins, Lyles will become only the 10th man in Olympic history to win both the 100- meter and 200-meter races at the same Games. CNN anchor and correspondent Coy Wire is joining us now from Paris. Coy, Lyles clinched a really heartbreaking -- a heart-racing victory, I should say, in the 100 meters for his first gold. Can he do it again today?",

And if he can claim that 200-meter gold as well, he'd be the first person to do it since the legendary Usain Bolt. Only nine other men have done it.

He looked like he was done, rounding the final turn, fourth place, about five meters behind the leader.But then his face full strain, gold grill and all, and he takes it. Other runners ran out of gas. Quincy Hall did not, 43.40 seconds. Now the 26-year-old first-time Olympian from Kansas City has a gold medal to match his gold grill. Now, finally, Wolf, you have to see this. The future of athlete performance and recovery is now. Nike and Hyperice teamed up two years ago to create these game-changes you may have seen some of the Olympians wearing not yet available to the public. First, this vest impacts the thermal regulation. If you're hot, you push a button. Vest gets cold electronically, no ice, no water. These things get to 30 degrees Fahrenheit within minutes. And if you're cold, you push another button and it warms you up, keeps you warm like an HVAC for your body. These boots, they get the blood flowing in those ankles, this compressor here. Wolf, it's incredible. These athletes, LeBron James was asking for one. And they're like, we don't make size 16, LeBron. You're going to have to wait for that, Wolf. (LAUGHTER)",
