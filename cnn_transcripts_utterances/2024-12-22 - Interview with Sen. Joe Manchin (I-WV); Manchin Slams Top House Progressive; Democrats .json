(END VIDEOTAPE) RAJU (on camera):  Good morning. Welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Manu Raju. Crisis averted, at least for now. What does it mean for when Donald Trump takes power in just 29 days? This past week, the president-elect sent Washington in a spiral as Congress nearly careened into a government shutdown to meet his last ditch demands. Ultimately, though, his most important demand was not met to raise the national debt limit as lawmakers punted on that issue and instead extended government funding until mid-march, along with providing billions for natural disaster relief and aid to farmers. All this means there will be major fiscal battles and critical deadlines early in Trump's second term. But why did Trump wait so long to make demands that many in both parties believed were just impossible to meet? And what does it say about his hold on his party as he plots an ambitious agenda with the narrowest of majorities in the House? Now, Trump threatened to primaries against any Republicans who dare to defy his 11th hour push and called out one GOP hardliner, Texas Congressman Chip Roy, as, quote, very unpopular and accused him of, quote, seeking cheap publicity. But Roy liked 37 other Republicans who voted in opposition to Trump's efforts, shrugged off Trump's attacks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX):  Everybody with half a brain understands we've got to constrain spending if we -- if we want to save this country. So this was a giant step forward. And I think, you know, credit to everybody. And we had some, you know, a yo-yo here. And I had some fun, you know back and forth with the president yesterday.",

Good morning. We are all getting a little bit of rest after quite a chaotic week. I'm trying to at least. You know, this is what's been interesting actually, is that Trump actually has not said anything about the end result here, which was to keep the government open, did not meet his last ditch demands. He's actually he made a lot of comments from Wednesday to Friday, even said -- suggested shut down the government under Biden, fine, as long as it's done under Biden and not done under my watch.

I found -- you probably found on the Hill this week, too. There were a lot of Republicans who did not mind the idea that government was being outsourced from them. the elected representatives of the people to Elon Musk, because Elon Musk is successful. Elon Musk can turn around businesses. Elon Musk has built things people didn't think were possible. What's Congress ever done? I found almost nihilism from members of Congress about their own ability to solve problems versus the possibility of just handing problems to Trump and to Musk and having them say what to do, having them act on it.

But there really aren't that many places to cut the federal budget that they're talking about from mandatory spending. So this is going to be incredibly complicated for them to figure out.

In just 12 days, he'll need the support from nearly every single Republican in the house to win the speakership, and a number of GOP hardliners tell me they're uncertain whether they'll back him. My panel is back with me. So, Olivia, you're talking to these Republicans all the time. And here just to remind viewers about the math, it is very difficult to become speaker of the House given the narrowness of the GOP majority -- 219 to 215.

And that's a scary prospect for him.And Matt Gaetz is also threatening to come back if the ethics report is going to be released, which CNN broke, that it will be. So I think Johnson is in a tough spot. The other side of this is that Trump world isn't particularly happy with him right now, and we heard from a Trump adviser who said if he faced a challenger, Donald Trump would not jump in and try to help him.

So all of these ideological debates are nice, but where the rubber really hits the road is going to be in a presidential primary in 2028. And beyond that, it just doesn't have much effect, you know.

It had Donald Trump run as the -- I'm going to balance the budget by cutting Medicare guy, h wouldn't have won. He ran as the I'm going to cut taxes on tips. I'm going to side with the longshoremen on automated ports. That worry they had, the existential worry is that he's just -- he's just running as a social conservative with a bunch of populist economic policies that they believe in. But when they campaigned about him, voters don't hear from the same channels. And also voters associate a lot of them with the modern Trump Republican Party. They didn't eight years ago, but eight years, you know, for a lot of voters, they've only known a anti-wall, at least rhetorically, anti- populist anti-elite Republican Party.
