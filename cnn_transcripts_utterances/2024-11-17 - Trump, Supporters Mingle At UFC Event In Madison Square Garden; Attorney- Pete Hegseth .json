Do you see, Colonel, any of these issues getting amplified or perhaps worsening under Trump's second administration?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think it's certainly possible, Amara. And one of the key issues here is the fact that there are several flashpoints that you mentioned. You know, the cyber-attacks, like the Volt Typhoon attack against U.S. infrastructure starting out in the Pacific but then it broadened to both military and civilian infrastructure throughout the United States. You have the South China Sea and Taiwan, as you mentioned. Plus, the fact that China is really going into a lot of the areas of the world that were previously dominated by the U.S. And Latin America is a case in point in this case. You have a port just north of Lima called Chancay, which has a large Chinese development effort going on right now. And what they're doing is they're building the largest container port in South America, right there in Peru that will benefit China because it shortens the trade time between -- the transit time between Latin America and China itself. So, those are the kinds of things that are going on. These flashpoints are ones that are inevitable.

CNN's Nada Bashir has more now from London. Nada, what are you learning? NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): We have been hearing from sources and Lebanese officials who have said there is some sense of optimism around this latest attempt to secure a ceasefire between Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israel. This ceasefire, according to sources proposed on the table, would outline a 60-day cessation of facilities that would eventually, hopefully, lead to a lasting ceasefire between the two parties. But of course, questions as to where things stand currently. As you mentioned, we are continuing to see devastating airstrikes across Lebanon in the country's capital, Beirut. We are seeing an expansion of Israel's ground incursion in parts of southern Lebanon. And we've previously heard from Israeli officials, including Israel's defense minister, rejecting any notion that Israel would agree to a ceasefire with Hezbollah unless Israel's military aims have been fully met. And similar messaging, of course, to what we've heard in Gaza with regards to the stalling ceasefire talks there. But officials have told CNN that Hezbollah is considering the proposal currently on the table, that there are extensive discussions taking place between Lebanese political officials in Beirut, and that they could potentially see an official response as early as Monday night. But of course, the situation in Lebanon and between Hezbollah and Israel is still very much in flux, particularly as we continue to see the sixth straight day of airstrikes targeting parts of Beirut. What is crucial and what we are hearing from officials familiar with these talks is that this current proposal on the deal, on the table put forward by the U.S., stands within the parameters of UN Resolution 1701, which essentially ended the war between Lebanon and Israel back in 2006, and would crucially stipulate that the only armed groups that should be present beyond the Litani River, beneath the Litani River in southern Lebanon, should be the Lebanese army and UN peacekeeping forces. That would mean a removal of any Hezbollah militants in this area. That is something that Israel has been pushing for whether we see an agreement, that remains to be seen.",

We've certainly seen that with the targeting of parts further deeper into parts of southern Lebanon, including in the area of the village of Chamaa, where we've seen a shrine, essentially to Saint Peter, being destroyed by Lebanese forces. It's our understanding that the Israeli forces, rather, were pushed back following Hezbollah fire. And we are continuing to see Hezbollah rocket fire targeting Israeli territory.

Those are the two prongs. What was flagged and specifically said by the judge is that if he's behind bars, he won't be able to tamper with witnesses. Whereas if he's outside, there's evidence that he might.Well, now he's providing evidence that even behind bars is conduct. Even behind bars, he's still trying to get at those witnesses. So how can the judge say, OK, go on your own volition, even though it's this beefed-up package for bail, the proposal, including 24-hour security and monitoring in his own home. Is that really going to stop him? If being at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Center can't, I expect this to be denied, especially given these new allegations.",
