Victim and grievance is one thing that populace strongmen do. But it also does make a mockery of the Republican Party's traditional plan to represent the party of law and order. There seems to be no speedbump with folks saying maybe it's not a good idea for the nation or for our reputation to nominate someone who's been indicted 91 times and could be convicted before the election.

They are using the same language that Trump does. So when Donald Trump gets indicted, not only do Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis not go after Donald Trump, which they would for any other candidate for any other office, they use the same rhetoric, a weaponized system of justice, two-tiered system of justice, things like that. So if this is smooth skating for Donald Trump over the next two months, the DeSantis and Haley campaigns, essentially, it'll be a Zamboni to make sure there was no crack in the ice for Trump.

Listen to what she was just saying in that interview just now. People don't want to worry about MAGA. She's trying to create a bridge for the people who might be a little bit soft, who might say, we should maybe have a plan B, maybe we should be with someone else. And the way she has gone about Trump. It's not personal attacks. She has talked about the chaos but she's also talked about, it's got to be about the future, it's got to be about you, the people, instead of attacking him directly. And she's made more substance of attacks. I actually believe that is going to show. And that is how women have to campaign. There's a whole lot of research behind it.

For his part, Trump picked up endorsements from two former presidential rivals. In Florida, Senator Marco Rubio, and North Dakota's Governor Doug Burgum announced their support for the former president. Joining us now, Congressman Zach Nunn, who represents Iowa's third district. Congressman, thanks for being with us. Iowa voters will be caucusing in a few hours. You have chosen to remain neutral at this stage. Why is that? REP. ZACH NUNN (R-IA): Well, Anderson, here in balmy Iowa, where it's almost 30 degrees below zero with the windchill, I think we will get the most important endorsement possible this caucus season and that'll come directly from the people of Iowa. Our job in Congress -- this is my first term -- has been to be a great ambassador and getting some of these candidates to spend time with Iowans. And here's why this is so important. It's at the church rectory, it's at the high school gymnasium tonight, the neighbors will talk to neighbors, not only on social media or in line. This is an opportunity to actually talk with each other and say, these are the candidates who have spent time, who have echoed my concerns and want to see a better government and a secure border and better country, let's make that championship tonight. I'm very excited that Iowa gets to be the starting line for what will become a great race to become the next chief of the United States.",

And we are seeing people across the political line here really getting engaged with candidates who spend time here. Candidly, I wish the Democrats would come back to Iowa and spend some time talking to Iowans here. Because this is really a ground-up opportunity for voices to be heard at that grassroots level verses a top-down approach, like will probably see in South Carolina where a candidate is designated. So the endorsement process here is part of it. More importantly, tough races like ours mean that we've got to have a voice for what's important in America being represented in the White House but also in Congress.

Let me tell you this. Whoever walks away from Iowa tonight will start a great stride towards taking back the White House and doing things that are important for my voters. And that is border security, whatever political party you are, improving the economy, driving down inflation, and here in Iowa, very importantly, making sure our farmers and our farm communities are taken care of.

The communications director tells CNN they are gearing up to make the November election fight about, quote, \"more freedom and more democracy in America.\" CNN's M.J. Lee is at the White House for us. So what are people there saying about this process? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Anderson, tonight, obviously, kicks off the Republican primary contest. There are no votes being cast for Democratic candidates. But tonight still has everything to do with President Joe Biden because it is the beginning of the process of determining who the president will face off against come November. Like so many people who have been paying attention to the 2024 cycle, most Biden campaign advisors and people in the Biden world believe, for the most part, that it will end up being Donald Trump that the president faces off against in November. I am not saying that there are not folks who cannot foresee a scenario where something wacky or something unexpected happens but, for the most part, the preparations that are underway right now for the general election are about the president facing off once again against Donald Trump. I will tell you, there is a bit of a sense of impatience in the Biden campaign for the Republican process to really move forward. They would like for the country and more voters to sort of start seeing this reality that they think is real, which is that Donald Trump will be on the ballot in November. Their internal campaign research shows the majority of undecided voters at this moment in time still do not believe it will be Donald Trump. Advisors that we have spoken to say that, for the most part, this is because people are still pretty tuned out of the election. But they are very antsy right now. They are very eager to draw the contrast between President Biden and former President Donald Trump. That is why we hear them talk so much about what the first four years of the Trump presidency looked like and making so many warnings about what the second Trump term could look like. In the meantime, they are also making all the preparations that they feel they need to have a strong fight in the general election. That includes fundraising. We were told by the campaign, in the fourth quarter of the last year, they raised some $97 million. And they had more than $100 million of cash on hand. They had $117 million to be precise. Those are resources that the campaign very much expects will eventually go towards battling it out against Donald Trump come November -- Anderson?",

It could also answer some lingering questions that we have, including how strong Donald Trump's grip on the GOP base really is. Could Nikki Haley leapfrog Ron DeSantis as the strongest Trump alternative in this race? And will the Republican field shrink following the Iowa caucuses tonight?
