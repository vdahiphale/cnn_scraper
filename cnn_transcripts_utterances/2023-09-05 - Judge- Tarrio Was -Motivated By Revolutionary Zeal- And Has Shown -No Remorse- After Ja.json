His pleas, for mercy, fell on deaf ears, as the federal judge, who imposed the sentence said he had no indication of remorse. Plus, the world's two biggest pariahs, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un soon to meet, for an exclusive summit, for dictators. What U.S. Intelligence says that they believe they're plotting? And also today, Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, returned to Capitol Hill, as some of his fellow Republicans even, are raising concerns, about his health. What he could say behind closed doors, to them, tomorrow? I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. He pleaded for leniency. And he ended up with the longest sentence, of anyone, who has been charged, with the deadly attack, that happened, on the Capitol. 22 years, for former Proud Boys leader, Enrique Tarrio. And it could end up remaining the longest sentence of all of those. During the hearing, today, the federal judge, Timothy Kelly, who I should note, was appointed, by former President Donald Trump, scolded Tarrio, and said that he was quote, \"Motivated by revolutionary zeal,\" while slandering the father of our country, referring to George Washington. He called Tarrio, the ultimate leader, of a seditious conspiracy, to overthrow the U.S. government, by force. I should note that Tarrio was not actually even in Washington, on January 6th. But that's because he had been arrested, two days before the attack, and was ordered by a judge, to leave the city. Prosecutors say that he did help create a command structure that he was in touch, with co-defendants, on the ground, that day, as the attack unfolded. He is now the final Proud Boys leader, convicted, of seditious conspiracy, to receive his punishment. For more on this, let's go to CNN's Senior Justice Correspondent, Evan Perez. Evan, obviously, one of the longest sentences, of anyone, who has been charged, in the attack.",

As a matter of fact, he was arrested, for some previous alleged offenses. And the FBI, the U.S. attorney did that on purpose, because they were hoping, to try to get him out of town, and try to prevent any mass gathering, of Proud Boys. Of course, we now know that that didn't work. And one of the things that his lawyer said, today, in speaking to the judge, was that, he wasn't there. He wasn't in control, of this crowd, of Proud Boys. And he said that Tarrio was not a terrorist. He is a misguided patriot. And of course, the judge said, \"Look, this is something that you argued to the jury, and the jury did not buy it.\" So, in the end, that's one reason why you saw such a stiff sentence, for Enrique Tarrio, longer than any of the other Proud Boys, the other four Proud Boys that were sentenced, in the last few days.",

Officials say that the meeting could take place, this month, with Kim, traveling by armored train, from Pyongyang, across the border, to southeastern Russia. It would be a rare journey, for the North Korean leader, but one that he has taken before, back in 2019, as you see here. Despite warnings, from the Pentagon, the National Security Council says they do believe negotiations, between those two nations, are quote, \"Actively advancing.\" Joining me now, to discuss, former CIA officer, Will Hurd, who is also a 2024 Republican presidential candidate.

And that's emboldening a nuclear terrorist. I hate the fact that Trump sat down with Kim Jong Un. Biden, couple of weeks ago, saying that he would be willing to sit down with him, without preconditions. I think that all plays into Kim Jong Un's willingness, to engage with the Russians. This is also a sign that things in Russia aren't going to Vladimir Putin's liking. And what I would be doing, under my administration, is, all the equipment and weapons that we have promised, to Ukrainians, that the rest of our Western allies have promised them? Get them to the Ukrainians, as quickly as possible, for them to continue their counteroffensive. Because, this is a sign that Vladimir Putin can't do this himself. This relationship has usually been the other way around, where the North Koreans are getting weapons, from the Russians. And this is a statement of how bad the situation is. And then, we should be helping the Ukrainians, to double down. And I would even say, letting them have the equipment, where they can continue and do strikes, inside Russia. And we, the Hurd administration would be very clear, what we consider to be preconditions, for success.

The three-judge panel, two of them who, I should note, were appointed, by former President Trump, wrote in their unanimous decision, today, that they were quote, \"Disturbed\" by the Republican-controlled State Legislature's actions. The newly-drawn map created one majority Black district, and boosted the share of Black voters, in a second district, from roughly 30 percent to 40 percent, but reduced it in another one. Alabama's Attorney General says he's going to appeal, and the case could end up, full circle, at the Supreme Court. Joining me now is Alabama Congresswoman, Terri Sewell. Congresswoman, thank you, so much, for being here. Court-appointed experts, I should note, are now going to be the one, who are drawing these three proposed maps. That's what they'll then decide on. It's not the State Legislature, like before. Do you have confidence, though, that they will be able to draw a fair map that accurately represents the State of Alabama? REP. TERRI SEWELL (D-AL): I do. I have to say, I was more than just disappointed that the State Legislature didn't even try, to adhere, to the Supreme Court's ruling. The Supreme Court was pretty clear. They said draw two majority- minority district, or something quite close to it. And as you said, it was one district, my district, they took from 55 percent to 50 percent. And then, they created another district that was around 39.9 percent. And definitely, that's not quite close to it. But you know what, Kaitlan? Today was a victory, for Black Alabamians, but also for all Alabamians. Because what we're fighting for is fairness, right? We want to make sure that irrespective of your race, or your ZIP Code, that every voter has an equal opportunity, for their voice, to be heard, in this democracy.

That, to me, is progress. And I know that it will affect not only Alabama, but we're waiting on Louisiana and Georgia, and it will have a ripple effect. And not just in congressional seats. Because what this case says is that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is alive, well and enforceable, Section 2. And so, Section 2 is about voter dilution. So, even in Jefferson County, where we have five commission seats, I think that you'll see a lawsuit, to try to see whether or not that violates the VRA Section 2, because there's so many African American voters, in that county. It has a big effect all around. And I know that John had some incomplete business, before he left this great Earth. And -- but he left us a wonderful roadmap, he and those foot soldiers.
