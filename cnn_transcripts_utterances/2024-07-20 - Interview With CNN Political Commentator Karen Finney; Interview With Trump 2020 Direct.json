On one side, the Republicans at their convention more unified than ever with allies and ex-rivals alike publicly bending the knee for Donald Trump after the attempt on his life, his election interference and convictions forgotten. Meanwhile, the Democrats are more divided than ever over Joe Biden's ability to best Trump in November especially after he was benched by COVID again. The measurable successes of his presidency, all but forgotten as well. By the end of the week, a crescendo of bigwig Democrats and grassroots poll numbers publicly demanding he pass the torch. Can the Democrats recaptured the political initiative or has the attempted assassination of their candidate regenerated the Republican Party? As the convention was wrapping up, I spoke to Marc Lotter, Donald Trump's former strategic communications director, and to Karen Finney, a CNN political contributor and the spokesperson for the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign.

Not only does he have COVID on top of everything else, but it's becoming more and more public, more and more senior, the internal Democratic officials coupled with, you know, polls from grassroots Democrats, that Biden won't make it in terms of winning in November. And for you, Marc Lotter, and for Team GOP, this must be music to all of your ears. On the one hand, you've got this implosion at the top of the Democratic ticket. You've got a sense of chaos and drift. And on the other hand, you've got a sense of cementing the GOP as Trump's party, the deliverance of Trump from the assassin's bullet, et cetera. Give me the mood amongst your party at the end of this week. MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, TRUMP 2020: Well, obviously there's a lot of momentum, but I think there -- there's a lot of recognition that we still have four months to go until election day. A lot of things can and will change. The map, the polls all look very good right now for Donald Trump and Senator J. D. Vance, but we've got to, you know, run through the tape as they like to say. And so, whether it's Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Gretchen Whitmer, Gavin Newsom, we're also focused on the policy side of it. None of those candidates are going to change the direction of our country. They're going to stick with the same policies, whether it's on immigration, whether it's on taxation, energy prices. So really, the campaign is the same from our standpoint, we just have to change the name of the person, or maybe changing the name of the person who we're running against.",

So, for example, if you live in a state where you're afraid of losing your right to access IVF or contraception or abortion, that has not changed. And that is a fundamental difference between what Democrats are fighting for and what Republicans are fighting for. So I think the issue is here, whether it's climate change, whether it is, you know, we don't believe in trickledown economics, whether it is, you know, helping college kids pay for their student loans, there's a whole range of issues where we have just very different ideas. And I always like to remind people, you know, those folks who are knocking on doors and having conversations with voters, those have not stopped. And so the issue conversation continues and will continue. And as we sort out sort of the top of -- what's happening at the top of the ticket, you know, we're also really talking about very fundamental differences for the direction of our democracy.",

Suggested women should stay in violent marriages even. I'm going to play this and talk to you about the issue of winning women. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), U.S. REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace, which is this idea that like, well, OK, these marriages were fundamentally -- you know, they were maybe even violent, but certainly they were unhappy. And so, getting rid of them and making it easier for people to shift spouses like they change their underwear, that's going to make people happier in the long-term. And maybe it worked out for the moms and dads, though I'm skeptical, but it really didn't work out for the kids of those marriages. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, there's also no way that a national abortion ban is ever going to get passed by Congress.The President has also been very clear he supports IVF and the exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. But I think, you know, while the Democrats all want to focus only on just this one issue, I think what you're going to see the president, Senator Vance, and Republicans also talk about is a lot of mothers, a lot of families out there struggling to pay for groceries, struggling to pay for gas. They're worried that their young daughters or themselves might be the victims of crime based on all of the 12 million illegal immigrants that have been let into this country under Joe Biden. So there are a lot of issues I think that are at play. Yes, there are single issue voters on the issue of abortion, both on the right and the left. But I think most people are probably it's one of their issues, may not be their only issue. And right now, they're worried about putting food on the table.",

I'll give you another example, equal pay for women. You know, the criticism that we're hearing from some conservative circles about the women Secret Service members who were part of the president -- former president's detail, some are saying, well you know, that's DEI and they shouldn't have women. they're not strong enough, you know. So again, it's also how you talk about women, how you respect women. And I just want to point out something on immigration. We've had 12 million people here illegally for decades, and what we're talking about is, again, two very different approaches to securing the border, which President Biden has, and those crossings have gone way down. But also, how do we have a humane policy in terms of how do we have people return to their countries where that's appropriate? Not as we saw during the Republican Convention this week with signs to just throw people out. You know, this rounding people up and mass deportations. I don't think people really think about what that would really look like in terms of having deportation centers, separating children and families, not to mention the economic impact that that would have on the American economy if all those workers who are working for substandard wages, by the way, would be all of a sudden gone.

I was just in Israel about three weeks ago, and there is a lot of fear. We heard some of this coming out of the NATO conference. World leaders are very anxious about the idea of Donald Trump returning to the presidency. They're anxious about what it means in terms of America's role in the world, the nature of the relationships, the fact that he has praised dictators like Putin and what that means in terms of a realignment of forces. And so, I think they're very real questions about what a Trump presidency would mean for American foreign policy.

It was also the climax of the great space race between the United States as in the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War. Half a century later, and America is in a new space race this time with China. And this week, scientists revealed the first evidence of caves under the lunar surface, which could be crucial for sheltering moon dwellers of the future. Astronaut Michael Collins played a starring role in the Apollo 11 mission. He piloted the command module Columbia, while Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic descent to the surface. Then he orbited alone for nearly a day until they returned. From my archive. Here's our conversation from 2019 on the 50th anniversary of the moon-landing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
