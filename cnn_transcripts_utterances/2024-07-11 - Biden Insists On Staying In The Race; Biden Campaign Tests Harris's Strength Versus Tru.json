Now, we're up to 17 in all. And even before the press conference, sources said more were ready to come out, but they were waiting for the NATO summit to end.

They're also looking at a calendar where, you know, if there's going to be sort of a change of some kind, it has to be done sooner rather than later. But they're looking at these 48 hours importantly. And, you know, the president is going to be in Rehoboth Beach over the weekend. I was with him last weekend in the pool, traveling with him on Air Force One to his various stops around the country, and he was out and about. But this weekend, he's not. He's going to be down this weekend in Rehoboth. And I think it's a time that he typically spends with his family. I'm going to be there as well.

And yes, candidates make mistakes. And by the way, you covered for your situation really well. I've seen it happen before. You mastered it. He doesn't do it as well. And I don't think that our expectations are too high. I do think that both candidates are flawed. And, in fact, my only conclusion here is to make everybody angry, which is he was good enough to survive for another day, but not good enough to put this behind him. I think you're right about this weekend. I think Monday is going to be the key day, both in terms of his interview that night and in terms of having spent two days with his family, truly assessing where things are. There are going to be a few more Democrats in the next 24 hours. They're going to be frustrated with him. And you can't say that referring to the vice president as Donald Trump.

And at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" we reported on that in June. We reported on it in early June, weeks before the debate, in a story that took us months to put together.And since that story was published -- and in that piece, we interviewed people who spent time with the president behind closed doors in unscripted meetings, and the picture that came from that was that his performance was very uneven. He would lose his train of thought. It would -- he would pause for long periods of time. He would say the wrong word. He had struggles with the details of policies. But at other times, he was fine and he was completely on it and was completely with it. And, you know, since we wrote that and since the debate, we've just had more and more stories come -- more and more people come forward saying very, very similar things. And so, I think that led us to look at, like, how is it that so many people were surprised by this debate and how was it that this was such a surprise to so many people? And part of it is this very stage- managed presidency. Now, of course, every presidency is -- every president is in a bubble, but this bubble is just much thicker than other presidents.",

You know, I don't have to tell you, as a Black woman, you know, in American society, it may not be easy to get elected president. She has roots in San Francisco.

You know, her -- one -- one Democratic consultant said to me, her floor may be lower than Biden's, but her ceiling may be higher than Biden's. And I think that there -- there is a sense among many Democrats that if you could turn the page, you would have a nominee who is younger than Trump. Suddenly, he would look like the old guy who is losing a stamp, who has the potential at least to deal with the biggest problem Biden has from 20 to 24. The decline in his support among younger nonwhite voters, that is the biggest change we've seen since his standing in 2020.
