And this evening is dedicated to make America strong again.But in terms of the politics of it all. Joe Biden, President Biden began the month of August 2021, with a 49 percent approval rating, according to Gallup. By the end of August, after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, which went very, very poorly, obviously, 13 servicemembers killed in that attack at Abbey Gate, at the Hamid Karzai International Airport, at the end of August, his approval rating was 43 percent. That was a significant slide in just one month. And a lot of people, Dana, think that that was the beginning of the end, when it came to Joe Biden's ability to be reelected.

And then, of course, the tragic suicide bombing that killed 13 American soldiers. I quite agree with you. It was -- it was a -- certainly, a point right then, where Biden had been quite popular. It seemed like we were getting out from under COVID. Of course, there was a resurgence of that. But it was -- it was a point at which people began to have serious doubts, about Biden's competence, and whether or not he had -- had lived up to the selling points that he had made to the American people, about his foreign policy expertise.",
