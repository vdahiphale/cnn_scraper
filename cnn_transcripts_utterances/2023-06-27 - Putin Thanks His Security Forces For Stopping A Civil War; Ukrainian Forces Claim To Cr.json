      "sentences": "I think Lukashenko today, the President in Belarusia, actually perhaps gave the bestexplanation of essentially the unpicked, the Kremlin narrative and shows how the Kremlin is trying to sort of paint over what was a terrible weekend for them. Lukashenko says that Prigozhin turned around his convoy going to Moscow because Lukashenko himself told Prigozhin that he would be crushed. Yet here we have on the other hand President Putin presenting a picture of actually, it was the military that stopped Prigozhin driving to Moscow because they came out and they stopped him and the reality the world and Russian saw over the weekend was actually that Prigozhin himself decided to turn around his troops and pull them back. So, although the Kremlin and President Putin are trying to sort of paint a new narrative, it doesn't fit the events on the ground and Lukashenko, you know, provides a completely variant narrative. So, when you have President Putin then telling the troops, as well, that you worked so hard and so well and you all pulled together, it seems to belie perhaps another piece of misinformation that the Russian forces weren't so united. And there is a history of that. We know that Putin met with his different defense chiefs yesterday, and we know that the National Guard chief today said that his forces were going to now get tanks and heavier equipment and it's easy to imagine a picture where a National Guard was saying, well, we can't stop Lukashenko on the road -- we can't stop Prigozhin on the road with his tanks and heavy armor because we only have light machine guns. So, I think the Kremlin, as you say, is very much in damage control, but there are varying narratives out there, plus the reality of what Russians saw on the ground. The Kremlin, of course, has the advantage of being the main media machine and the main mouthpiece of most people here in Russia. But some of this is not going to stick.",

Now, the couple of things that you mentioned are some of the big headlines here of what they missed. I mean, beginning in late July, remember Epstein had hung himself on August 10th of 2019, but as early as late July, Epstein was found lying on the floor of his cell with an orange cloth around his neck. He was then determined by the psychiatric ward to have a cellmate and that didn't happen. So, then leading up to the night that Epstein had killed himself, he did not have a cellmate. Another shortcoming is that he was allowed to stockpile bed linens. I think we have a photo of that. Just see how many orange bed linens he had in his cell and that is what he was able to use to fasten nooses, which were recovered in his cell when they found his body in the early mornings of August 10th. They also -- these guards were supposed to do reviews, prisoner checks every 30 minutes, that, because he was in the special housing unit known as the SHU. But the report found that between 10:40 PM and 6:30 AM, they did no checks at all. So that gave Epstein ample time because he had no cellmate. He had the means and the opportunity to commit suicide. Now, one of the things that came out of this was there were a lot of conspiracy theories of whether Epstein could have been murdered. Even his own legal team had put forward a medical expert who said he thought it was potential for homicide. So, what this report does is also gets into saying that they found no criminality. They said that there was no -- of the video that was available, which there were also deficiencies in that. There was no evidence or no images of anyone entering the area of the SHU where he was. They also found that there was no defensive wounds under -- nothing under his fingernails, no bruises, no contusions on his body, nothing to show that he was fighting off any assailant. You know, trying to put to rest some of the big question there was there anything else that could have happened. I mean, but the bottom line here is they're saying that all of these shortcomings not only allowed Epstein to die and not only allowed these questions around his death to happen but also deprived his numerous victims of any justice because he eventually, he could never go to trial to face these charges, Zain.",

World Sports Don Riddell joins us live now with the details. So, this was part of a two-year investigation, and what it really found was that the sport of cricket is certainly by no means a sport for all. We're talking about institutional racism.

The report said that the decline among black cricketers in this region is so well-documented, they found it deeply concerning that there had been no ECB-led initiative or report to understand, halt or reverse that decline. They talked about the sexism that women in cricket experience. They just kind of feel like they're add-ons. They're treated as subordinates. And many of them reported that they have been subjected to predatory behavior, often by men where alcohol had been involved. And the report also talked about the pay disparity, which it described as embarrassing. Women, on the average, earning only 20 percent of what men earn. Earlier on CNN's World Sports Show, we heard from Azeem Rafiq, he was a former Yorkshire cricket player who reported that his county, his club, had subjected him to racism, harassment, and bullying, which set off a whole investigation of its own.

When he was asked by Amanda Davis, the World Sport host earlier today, if he'd come back to cricket, and he said he would, if the right people were in charge, suggesting that he doesn't think the right people are in charge right now, or at least that the people that are in charge are not fit to really lead the game of cricket into a new era. We should just bring you the response from the ECB, the England and Wales Cricket Board. Their Chairman Richard Thompson said this, on behalf of the ECB and wider leadership of the game, I apologize unreservedly to anyone who has ever been excluded from cricket or made to feel like they don't belong. It is going to be really interesting to see what happens next. Zain, especially since this is such a huge summer for English cricket, it's the Ashes, it's England against the old enemy Australia, both the men's and women's teams are playing. Interestingly, the English Women's Spin Bowler Sophie Eccleston who's a brilliant player, this week, some of the former players in the England team have been speculating, is she the best spinner in England right now, male or female? So, that's kind of the level, the standard that some of these women are playing at and as you say, these numbers are quite shocking with regards to the pay disparity and how they're treated.

Donald Trump supporters had pushed the so-called independent state legislation theory, but the Supreme Court rejected it in a six to three vote. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control is warning about a handful of locally acquired cases of malaria in the U.S. Americans typically catch the diseases spread by mosquitoes after traveling overseas. There has not been a case from local U.S. sources in about 20 years. There are more than 240 million cases each year with the bulk of those cases in Africa.

While Wagner's presence in Russia is likely to dwindle, the mercenary group still has a large footprint in Africa. Here's a look at all of the African countries in which Russia is allegedly propping up dictators, undermining democracy as well, according to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. You can see Wagner's largest presence is really in the Central African Republic, Mali, and Sudan. Russia's weapons of choice include mercenaries, disinformation, election interference and arm steals. After this weekend's insurrection, as African leaders propped up by Russia and the Wagner Group are likely concerned that weekend's events may indeed end up loosening their grip on power, John Kirby from the National Security Council says that it's too early to make any kind of judgment about Wagner's future.

While the Ministry of Defense works the traditional arms sales angle, of course, Russia, one of the two or three top arms exporters in the world. And now with that relationship potentially on the Fritz, that makes it a little bit more difficult for countries in the middle and for groups in the middle, groups like the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan, who had sort of played both sides of the fence although a little bit more with Wagner, now potentially have to decide where the relationship is headed.

Often shirtless, captured hunting, or taking a submarine down deep in the Black Sea. Putin was born in October 1952 in what is now St. Petersburg. In 1975, he joined the KGB as an intelligence officer. In 1999, then-President Boris Yeltsin appointed Putin prime minister. In 2000, Putin was elected president of Russia. At the time, even President George Bush was impressed, though it didn't last. GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy.",

So, Medvedev was elected President of Russia and named Putin as prime minister. A move that raised questions about how much power Medvedev really had. In office, Medvedev changed the constitution, extending presidential terms from four years to six years before Putin was re-elected president again in 2012. Putin has ruled Russia for more than two decades, and his power is undeniable. He escalated the war in Chechnya, invaded Ukraine, and his government allegedly interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, though he's denied that. He also allegedly had a hand in disposing of his critics, like former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who died weeks after drinking a cup of poison-laced tea. Litvinenko blamed Putin. The Kremlin denied his involvement. Still, Putin won his last election in 2018 with more than 76 percent of the vote. His critics have slammed the election as unfair, citing tight control over the media and election monitors. Some critics have suggested Putin has used his reign not to better the lives of the Russian people, but to enrich himself through theft and corruption. Bill Browder, who once invested heavily in Russia, is now one of Vladimir Putin's toughest critics. FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN \"GPS\" HOST: Estimate his net worth.

This is according to the Sierra Leone Electoral Commission. The elections, of course, happened on Saturday. It was considered to be a two-horse race between President Bio who was up for re-election, and also former Cabinet Minister Samura Kamara, as well. The opposition leader, Samura Kamara, is currently disputing the elections results. He says that they were not free and fair. But once again, the electoral commission is announcing that President Bio has won reelection in the Sierra Leone vote that took place over the weekend. I want to bring in our Senior Editor for Africa, Stephanie Busari, who's been tracking the election. Certainly been tense. There's been pockets of violence, Stephanie.

And on top of that, as you point out, people are dealing with rampant inflation, the costs of ordinary sort of basic foods quadrupling just recently. So, that is a major priority for President Bio as he is now reelected.
