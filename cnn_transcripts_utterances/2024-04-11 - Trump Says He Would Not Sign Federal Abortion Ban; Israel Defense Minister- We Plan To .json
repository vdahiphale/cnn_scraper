Just days after saying that he believes abortion rights are up to the states. Donald Trump finds himself at the center of Arizona's controversial civil war era ban. On Tuesday, the Arizona Supreme Court revived a law written back in 1864, which bans abortion statewide, with the only exception being for the life of the mother. On Wednesday, Trumps signaled he believes that the law goes too far. He also insisted he won't sign a national abortion ban. If he becomes president again, despite the fact that he did previously support one. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What we're seeing from Republicans is trying to say, no, we don't want federal restrictions, but this was always about states. That's what they're trying to say. And Democrats are pointing out that. Sure, but they are the reason why hi, were seeing these kinds of harsh bands such as an Arizona come into place because this is what happens when you leave this to the states.",

And so anything including potentially a ballot measure that's addressing abortion is going to impact that outcome especially if it motivates Democratic voters to come to the polls to vote for that ballot measure.Then that's potentially more Democratic voters then going to go ahead and vote for Biden, even if they're not enthused about him as the candidate, as the person on the ballot. I mean, that's really the concern from Republicans right now, is not that the ballot measures are going to change people's votes, but that it's going to juice turnout for the wrong voters for them.",

You've been reporting on David Cameron being there in Washington, but this is really about the U.S. and tough calls between Netanyahu and Biden. So I think it was a direct response to that.A lot of cynics, cynics looking at it saying, well, if you cared that much, you would have done it sooner. Other cynics as well saying, even if you do try to get 500 trucks in, its going to be really difficult because of the war you're carrying out there.",

She had left Rafah and she was going northwards, got to a check point and suddenly the IDF were firing in her direction. Now her feeling wasn't that she was being targeted, but they were targeting someone else, but she was in what was meant to be a safe area. And that really does illustrate the sort of environment that these aid workers operating. And it shows how difficult it is to deliver the aid. Now, she's also pointing out that Israel may be saying there's lots oftrucks. So Israel have blamed the U.N. effectively for not distributing the aid that they're sending into Gaza. The U.N. have been telling me that there's a discrepancy here. Israel says trucks have gone into Gaza, once they've gone into the screening process. But you don't really count as aid until it gets into their warehouses. So when Israel says trucks are going in, the U.N. says that's not necessarily true. U.N. blaming -- when Israel blames the U.N. for not distributing it, she did accept its incredibly hard to distribute aid in Gaza, particularly when, you know, previous missions have been bombed and this one got caught in some crossfire. But they are doing their best. And if there wasn't a war in place, they would be able to distribute it more easily. So there's a real war words between the U.N. and Israel, which doesn't help anyone because obviously the U.N. is trying to be an independent non-political body. But there's political background between these two organizations as well.",

Surveys are ongoing as we go through the day to day.Heavy rain has been really big problem with this system. New Orleans got over six inches of rain in just a few hours yesterday. That's more than a months worth of rain. Same thing is happening this morning in Tallahassee we're in just to three hours, they got more than a months worth of rain, a flash flood emergency continues this morning until about 6:00 because were looking at heavy rain coming down so quick that they're watching things rise pretty quickly, and that causes that flooding threat. Flash flood warnings, those stretch into southern Georgia as we get the range are really just come down very heavy with these storms. There is all that lining, the southern end of the storm system, but the shower stretch all the way up into the Great Lakes from Chicago then over into New York as well. Here's that severe risk for today. We've got that slight level two out of five risk along the Big Bend of Florida, getting into southern Georgia than another area of concern for a few tornadoes, damaging winds and large hail up from Ohio, going into Pennsylvania, that enhanced risk level three out of five there. The flood threat continues as we go through the day today, again, running up the East Coast, you could see that slight risk from D.C. over towards Columbus and then tomorrow up in New England, because the storm system is just packing a lot of moisture.
