He's about to be sentenced after being convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress.All of this stemming from his refusal to testify before the January 6 Select Committee and his failure to turn over documents. So let's begin this morning outside the US District Court in Washington, DC. CNN political correspondent Sarah Murray is there. Sarah, how is all this expected to play out today?",

And what we know is that Steve Bannon is trying to get out of any kind of jail time. He was convicted on two counts for refusing to show up for a subpoena, to testify before Congress and refusing to hand over documents.The government has asked that he spend six months behind bars, and they said he should pay a $200,000 fine. Now Bannon's team has said look at the most he should get probation. He listened to his attorney's advice. And if you are going to put him behind bars, it should be house arrest only. They're also saying ban and plans to appeal his conviction. And they're saying that any punishment he receives should essentially be put on hold while that appeal plays out. The government has taken issue with that as well saying no, look, he did nothing to try to accommodate the process. He did nothing to try to accommodate the January 6 committee. Whatever sentence is handed down today, he should have to serve it immediately. So of course, things are just going to get underway in a few minutes here in the courtroom and we're going to wait and see what the judge makes of all of this.",

They're obviously focusing on the efforts of the former president and some of his allies to overturn the Georgia election results in 2020.And Kelly Loeffler, the former senator from Georgia was a very active ally. Some emails some text messages rather, that have been obtained by the Atlanta Journal Constitution, portray her being in contact with people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Congresswoman who was a top ally of the former president, trying to figure out ways to overturn and challenge the Georgia election results. In the case of Pat Cipollone, he was a top lawyer at the White House, White House Counsel, in fact, and he pushed back at the former president and some of his allies, as they were trying to figure out ways to claim that there was enough fraud to keep the former president in office, claiming that he had won Georgia and in other States. And so these are witnesses that are very important to the Georgia, the Fulton County investigation. You see there a list of other people who have gone in, including Boris Epstein, who is still a top ally and a former adviser of the former president, Rudy Giuliani has also appeared. And of course, Senator Lindsey Graham is now according to the appeals court, they're in Atlanta, he has to show up to provide testimony. He, the former - the Senator Graham has claimed that he is exempt from this because of the speech or Debate Clause. The appeals court has said that he should testify to the grand jury, at least with regard to his efforts, his conversations with the former president and allies to try to overturn those election results in Georgia. We don't know whether he's going to appeal and try to keep - stop this testimony from going forward, Bianna. But, but right now, that's what the courts are ordering him to do.",

He appeared before a grand jury investigating the January 6 attack in Washington. He, as we saw up here before the January 6 committee as well as through their hearings, and we also know that he was interviewed by the FBI for his - the President's - the former president's Mar-a-Lago documents scandal.

And so I do believe that the FBI has all of the information and was - received answers to their questions. The questions that when we were watching the January 6 committee, we couldn't hear him answer because he would assert privilege. I don't know whether or not Mr. Cipollone took a similar position or was willing to be as forthcoming with investigators in Georgia but I do believe that if that was litigated through the courts, that would ultimately be the - be the result.",

What the judge is looking at is something called a pre-sentence investigation report, which is a report that is prepared by an arm of the U.S. courts, that contains all sorts of things about Mr. Bannon's history. His, you know, results of his interview, background check, any potential criminal actions, you know, of course, he had been indicted and then pardoned by the former president.And the judge is going to look at all of the history and characteristics of Mr. Bannon, which includes not only his criminal history, but his upbringing. And then, of course, you know, many of his statements and actions that weren't even necessarily criminal, but are, you know, whether it's negative or positive, and then is going to also look at all the circumstances of this event and determine what the appropriate sentence will be. Under this statute, 30 days in prison is the minimum sentence. So Mr. Bannon will be going prison. The question is just how long. The government wants six months, he's saying zero, it's going to be 30 days, I imagine that he's trying to angle for, you know, house arrest or something where, you know, he won't actually spend time in prison, but would be in home confinement.",

RSV is a common cold virus that can be associated with severe disease in young children and older adults. And the CDC says it's already hitting peak levels in some areas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. JUAN SALAZAR, PHYSICIAN IN CHIEF, CONNECTICUT CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER: This has really stepped up over the last two, three weeks. And it's created some difficulties for us because again, our beds are filled to capacity. The kids keep coming in. And so we've had a situation where we have to expand our services in a way that we can provide all the care for the kids that are coming in with RSV. I've been doing this for a long time. I've been at Connecticut Children's for 25 years, and I have never seen this level of surge specifically of RSV coming into our hospital. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And Tara, CNN analysis of new HHS data shows children are filling hospital beds more now than over the past two years in the pandemic. I'm hearing anecdotally from friends too whose children are suffering with this, one had to be hospitalized. Why are we seeing a spike in cases?DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, Bianna, we've done COVID mitigation strategies really well over the last couple of years. And so kids normally get exposed to RSV, and almost all of us have it at some point in our lives before we reach the age of two. But because of what we've done in the past two years, we've changed the equilibrium, right? So kids have not gotten exposed, they've not developed the immunity. And now we're seeing this big influx all at once of children, even potentially children who are older than they would have had this type of reaction previously. And so yes, as you mentioned, we're seeing a spike across the country in RSV, particularly pediatric hospital beds filling up. We know that three quarters of pediatric hospital beds are filled now compared to an average day to in the past two years when it was about two thirds. In general, this is a very common lower respiratory tract infection for kids under the age of one. And on average, we see about 58,000 hospitalizations a year for kids under five, 2 million outpatient visits for kids under five and kids usually do well, whether at home or even when they go to the hospital, they get symptomatic treatment and they usually recover. So we don't want to scare parents. There usually are about 100 to 300 deaths per year. But it is important to understand if you see symptoms in your kid and know exactly when to act and when you can relax a little bit.",

This is where the drones are being launched from and as you say, these are drones that fly to a target, guided and explode on impact. These are the drones that the Russian forces are using to some considerable effect in attacking civilian targets, power plants, apartment buildings, killing civilians. Now the Ukrainians have been able to bring down, shoot down any number of them. So it's not like all the drones are getting through to their target. And they're essentially seen as weapons of terror to terrorize the population. You know, but make no mistake, there's a couple of things on the calendar that everybody's watching. And front and center is the winter weather is coming. So both Ukrainians and the Russians are going to want to solidify their battle positions and get into place if they need to wait out the winter. And for Ukraine, that means they are still pressing very hard, very understandably, in their view, for an acceleration of that air defense capability. The U.S. speeding up the delivery of some of the air defense, it's promised also, both UK and Germany contributing to the air defense equipment being shipped to Ukraine, but Ukraine clearly fails in this situation.
