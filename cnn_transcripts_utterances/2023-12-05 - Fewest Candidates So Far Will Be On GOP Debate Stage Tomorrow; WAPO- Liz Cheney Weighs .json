Here's what she told The Washington Post. \"Several years ago, I would not have contemplated a third party run. We face threats that could be existential to the United States and we need a candidate who is going to be able to deal with and address and confront all of those challenges. That will all be part of my calculation as we go into the early months of 2024.\" Now, it should be noted that there are anti-Trump Republicans who do not want her to enter the race. They actually believe that this will take votes from Joe Biden and would propel Donald Trump to the White House something else she said she would take into consideration. But this has all been part of what she has been doing lately with her new book and also amplifying what a Trump 2025 agenda would look like and what it means for democracy.",

There was a lot of people, there were a lot of people on the fence when he skipped that first debate. It wasn't clear, is this going to go in his favor? Is it going to miss out on something? Is he going to not be able to reach certain voters because he's missing these debates? They no longer feel that way. They feel like they've been able to want to control the narrative. One of the things that Donald Trump is very good at doing. And two, they have seen his poll numbers continue to rise. So there is no indication that he's ever going to participate in any of these events.

He'll have help from some Hollywood heavyweights Steven Spielberg, Shonda Rhimes, Rob Reiner all hoping to bring in cash ahead of the fundraising deadline at the end of the month. Of course, President Biden last quarter raised $71 million along with Democrats that was outpacing the Republicans in the field, but it is lagging behind other incumbent presidents at this point in their presidency. But certainly the campaign says that fundraising is picking up. They said that November was the biggest month for grassroots fundraising since Biden announced his reelection campaign in April.

They have spent $45 million on television advertising so far this year, that's far ahead of what President Trump or President Obama spent in the off-year before their re-election.And what the campaign is doing is really trying to test messaging in these ads ahead of next year trying to see what resonates, trying to see what sticks and you've seen them run ads, including during NFL games about the economy, about health care, even ads criticizing President Trump's record on health care. But certainly, President Biden's challenge will be to try and reverse his approval ratings, try and convince skeptical voters that he deserves re-election and certainly campaign officials do say that that's going to cost a lot of money.

      "sentences": "Well, the good news for the campaign, for the Biden campaign is that we're still a year out and they have time to work on this. Obviously, seeing a softening in your base, in your coalition is concerning.I think, based on my conversations with the Biden campaign, they certainly take it seriously. I think some of the key things they can do are to really speak to the things that President Biden has done that have helped, for example, young people. And you saw them do this, this last week on health care, Obamacare. They really seized on Donald Trump saying he was going to repeal Obamacare. Part of the reason that's such a potent argument, and we certainly saw that in 2019 and 2020 in the Democratic primary. Part of the reason that's such a potent argument is because you're telling people 26 -- who are 26 years old and younger, that they're going to be taken off their parent's insurance. So it's a really tangible argument about something that will make a difference in young people's lives. And so it's smart for the Biden campaign to jump on that not only to say Joe Biden has done things to make your life better, but also to say, look what the alternative is, if Donald Trump becomes president, this is going to be taken away from you. And so every opportunity that they have to draw the contrast, not just solely tell people what Biden's done, but also put it in the framework of these are the stakes if Donald Trump takes office, that's a smart thing to do. And that's what they have to do consistently to try to get these numbers back up.",

And I say that not because he's disregarding the impact or the voices or the perspective of the young voters have, but because foreign policy plays out over time.It requires sometimes difficult conversations, it requires private conversation. Some of the work that he's done, for example, led to the temporary ceasefire that got a lot of those hostages released. But I think that Biden has been very clear that the violence and the level of violence being committed against Palestinians is unacceptable. I think he will probably continue -- he and his administration will continue to ramp that language up. You certainly saw Tony Blinken talk about that over the course of his last trip, even to Israel. So I think he's going to continue to do that. And I think at the end of the day, he's working toward a solution that brings the violence to an end, which is his ultimate goal.",

But what a third party candidate can do is leach support from the leading two candidates. I think given her criticism of Trump, she's certainly not palatable to the Republican base. And I think for a lot of Independents who would have suspicion about her given, you know, some of her more conservative policies that they don't agree with, I think it's really hard to see a world where she does anything but take votes from Joe Biden and ultimately help Donald Trump in that scenario. So I would certainly hope that she will spend the time continuing to call out Donald Trump to call out the potential threat that a second Donald Trump term would pose and continue ringing the alarm rather than entering the race in a way that I think would almost certainly hurt Joe Biden.",

According to both local accounts as well as Israeli military officials, there have been heavy strikes in two key cities there, El- Baba which is in the central part of the strip, as well as in Khan Yunis, where the Israeli military appears to be making one of its primary offensive in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. There is some indication that senior Hamas commanders may be in that city. And tonight, Herzi Halevi, that chief of staff, is saying that the address for the Israeli military that it is targeting is Hamas. And it is Yahya Sinwar, the group's leader as it moves forward into southern Gaza. Now, amid all -- amid this offensive, the Israeli military has also ordered fresh evacuations of huge swaths of southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of people live, directing them to move towards the city of -- even further South City of Rafah, where already hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and are living in overcrowded shelters. Tonight, the U.N. Refugee Agency is warning that that city simply cannot accept the flow of hundreds of thousands of additional people. They don't have enough shelters for them. The water system is unlikely to be able to support those individuals. And so now, civilians in the Gaza Strip are facing increasingly difficult choices not only facing the destruction from the airstrikes that they are seeing in some of those key cities, but also, of course, the very difficult choice of whether or not to heed those evacuation orders, whether it's a heads further south, where the conditions simply may not be ripe up for them. Now, amid all of this, Hamas is continuing to fire rockets towards southern and central Israel. We saw today, as there were rockets intercepted above northern Tel Aviv, indicating Hamas continuing to be able to strike at Central Israel even amid this intense operation by the Israeli military.

He is not going to hold up all these military promotions that he has been doing all year long to get his demands met.Now he will allow almost all of them to go through. There are roughly 450 military promotions that have been held up amid this one man blockade. But Tuberville just told a group of reporters with a colleague, Lauren Fox, that he will hold up all of them, except for the handful of four star generals, a four star nominees. They're about 10 or so, 10 or 11 of those 450 that he wants individual roll call votes on. But the rest of them, under four stars, three stars, and below, all those he can -- will allow to go forward. That means that Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader can go to the floor and simply call for their vote and be -- they can be approved as quickly on a voice vote. Something that typically has done time and time again for many, many years. What has made this situation so unusual is that these nominees, which are promotions all across the military ranks typically are very quickly confirmed. But Tuberville has tried to block them, to use them as leverage to get his demands met. He had concerns that Pentagon, its post-Roe policy would reimburse service members to travel out of state for reproductive services, including abortions. He wanted that scrapped. He called that policy illegal. The Pentagon said, no, it wouldn't. And this stalemate for months has persisted. But Tuberville facing pressure from his right flank, from within the Senate Republican conference over this and calls to potentially change the Senate procedures to allow these nominees to be confirmed without his support. There was this talk among Republicans joining Democrats in that effort, all of which led to pressure on Tuberville to ultimately back down here. So a significant development in this yearlong fight. Tommy Tuberville has said he's backing down after more than 10 months of holding up these key nominees across the Pentagon. Brianna?",

But you're right, Brianna, for so many months, he dismissed that this had its real national security implications. So in the Pentagon, I'm warned about, something senators -- Republican senators like Dan Sullivan warned about, something that Lindsey Graham warned about. Even Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell had raised concerns about Tuberville's tactics. He dismissed all of it, said that he had been speaking to other generals who said there was no problem whatsoever on the battlefield. But the political pressure really has led to this point for Tommy Tuberville. There really was no way out of this standoff.
