Just ahead tens of thousands of police are being deployed in France, after two nights of rioting following the death of a teenage boy shot by police.We're live in Paris on this developing story. Then presumed human remains are found in the wreckage of the Titan submersible, what investigations are finding out. And a major loss for the UK government after a court said its plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda are unlawful. We begin in France though, where at least 150 people have been arrested across the country in the second night of rioting after the fatal police shooting of a teenage boy identified only as Nahel M. It happens during a traffic stop on Tuesday in the Paris suburb of Nanterre. French officials say the officer who shot and killed the 17-year-old acted illegally and that the officer has been put under provisional detention for voluntary homicide. French President Emmanuel Macron chaired a crisis unit meeting earlier he has called the shooting unjustifiable, but he's also condemned the rioting. Heavy security is in place across the Paris region as more protests are expected. Let's go straight to CNN's Melissa Bell who's in Paris for us. What's the atmosphere like Melissa?",

      "sentences": "Well, Max full of trepidation on the part of the authorities deploying those 40,000 police men and women fritter night across the suburbs, the outer suburbs of Paris. And that's really where we saw so much of the damage being done last night; cities like not to lose across the country.But that outer ring of the suburbs of Paris, a lot of that violence was focused and that violence really erupting. As you said the first night in Nanterre as a result of what happened to young Nahel, during that traffic stop. Worsening that night, 31 people arrested, overnight it was 151. And really this time what we saw overnight, Max was schools being destroyed, for being put on fire. Everything that represented the state, police stations were attacked, people went into them and took over extraordinary violence. And I think that is what they fear once again for tonight because this is something that has been a long standing issue here in France. What happened to young Nahel on Tuesday morning is all too tragically Max, something that has happened many times before. Traffic stops or identity searches often in the less favored favorable were less, well-off neighborhoods of Paris, turning violent and sometimes as in this case, deadly. There have been investigations in the past there have been protests in the past. And this issue has kept coming back. The line taken by the government this morning, this was not an issue of the state. It was the fault of one police officer. The anger that is out there on the streets is very much about the fact that this keeps happening and it keeps happening Max to the same people.",

And those pictures you were just showing of him visiting Dagestan yesterday, with crowds cheering and trying to touch him trying to take selfies and things like that. That's in southern Russia, highly unusual, particularly after the pandemic where Vladimir Putin has been very much at arm's length when it comes to ordinary people in the country. He was cheek to jowl last night with people down there, getting selfies with him treating him like a Rockstar.Clearly, I think a reaction to or response to those extraordinary scenes we saw at the weekend of Wagner forces being cheered by locals in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don. Still a lot of swirling rumors speculation, though about the whereabouts of that, that General that you were speaking about there, General Surovikin, Surovikin rather, you said Surovikin, Surovikin. Where he is at the moments and that he hasn't been seen, as you rightly say, since he appeared on television at the weekend, urging Prigozhin's Wagner fighters to stand down from their military uprising. The New York Times reporting, of course, that he had advanced information perhaps, about that the plans of Wagner and of Yevgeny Prigozhin, that we've not been able to verify that. And, of course, the Moscow Times, which is now an online news organization, operates from outside of Russia, is quoting its anonymous sources that General Surovikin is being detained for questioning. Again, we cannot independently verify that and the Kremlin, in response to our questions, has said it will not comment on that. But yes, you know, clearly, lots of things happening behind the scenes. What if anything's happening, it's happening behind the scenes at the moment, and it's not happening in public, Max.",

Looking at the repercussions of the rebellion, they're also discussing the EU's role in the West commitment to bolstering Ukraine security that could include long term deals to provide weapons equipment and other military aid to Ukraine.The U.S. Coast Guard says it has found what are believed to be human remains in the wreckage of that submersible that imploded near the Titanic. Pieces of the sub have now been brought to dry land and are being investigated. The Coast Guard says it's proving whether criminal or civil charges should be filed in connection with the implosion that killed five people as they were exploring the Titanic wreckage. CNN's Paula Newton has been tracking this story for us and incredible really, that they've managed to get anything up from the bottom.",

What's interesting here is that they will say that U.S. medical professionals will now begin what they call a formal analysis of those remains.And again, Max, you can only imagine how painful that is for the families, but also a measure of comfort there because they desperately want to know what their families went through if they knew what was coming. And those are the kinds of pieces of information that they would like as well, hoping to obviously bring their loved ones to rest. I also do want to point out though, that late yesterday, we received a release from the transportation safety board here in Canada initiating yet another investigation. They say that in fact that they have in their possession, the data recorder from the polar prints. You'll remember this was the mothership that was supposed to be tethered communication wise to that tighten and would know step by step, minute by minute when things began to go wrong. And then also, as we were saying, Max, those very large pieces of debris that were brought up by that remote operated vehicle, the transportation safety board here say as well --",

Huge crowds you didn't know quite how many were going to come out. It's difficult to tell without a wider shot, but certainly jam packed or groups of people there marching in his name, relatives of the boy also attending ritual -- . So why are these protests breaking out across France?Well, anger is rising across the country over the death of a teenage boy who was fatally shot by police during a traffic stop just outside Paris On Tuesday. More than 40,000 police officers have been mobilized across the country following two days of riots and violence. A French police officer was put onto provisional detention for voluntary homicide and French authorities say he acted illegally. But the government urges calm and denies institutional responsibility for the shooting. It's not the first time French police have been accused of excessive use of force, particularly in the neighborhoods with racially mixed populations outside France's biggest cities. Six French and international human rights organizations are currently involved in legal cases in France, asking for structural reforms to end what they say are discriminatory police practices. For a closer look and to try to understand what's going on within the culture here, Melissa joins us. This is a frustration boiling up. Or is it specifically targeted at the police? I'm trying to understand what you think this case has tapped into in France.",

And the judge has said sending them to Rwanda would breach the European Convention on Human Rights. The decision overturns a previous high court ruling found around; there was a safe third country to send refugees and asylum seekers.The plan was aimed at stopping human smugglers. That plan by the British government is to appeal the decision -- to the Supreme Court if they accept it. Let's get some perspective from Jomana Karadsheh. I mean, there weren't, the court wasn't disagreeing with the principle of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda. Was it? It was saying Rwanda wasn't a safe place to go for those asylum seekers?",
