So he's absolutely determined to legislate on this.Now, of course, there's historic precedent, you know, all the way back to 1995. So almost 30 years ago, now he's actually have tried to do this and eventually have to back down because of the kind of turmoil we're seeing on the streets today. Now, Emmanuel Macron finds himself also in a rather unique situation, because all the way back to the early 2000s. This is the first president that does not have a parliamentary majority. In other words, not only can he not legislate, but he needs to find ways to legislate differently. And he has not been good at consulting and listening to others. He simply argues that he was reelected and that he has a mandate. And what folks are pointing out to him is that really only 28 percent of those people who actually bothered voting in round one supported Emmanuel Macron. And the rest of them essentially voted against Le Pen in the run off stages. And so you have a president here occupying this kind of centrist position in which you have a far left and a far right but are not interested ultimately, in working with him on these policies.

And secondly, that he hasn't consulted for us and have recourse in this particular case, to Article 49.3 the push legislation through without the support of the representatives of the -- in the lower house was, of course, the catalyst that was needed for the social movements.

But this increase comes with turmoil within the banking sector. It's seen as a clear sign Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is determined to stay the course and a never ending quest to bring down inflation.The Fed increased the key rate by a quarter point on Wednesday. Well, that came as no surprise to most. U.S. financial markets did not respond well. The Dow down more than 500 points and NASDAQ and S&amp;P each lost more than one and a half percent. Let's take a look at markets in the Asia Pacific region right now. And you can see the Nikkei down by almost a quarter of 1 percent. The Hong Kong up by almost 1 percent. Shanghai flat and also the Seoul KOSPI flat so kind of mixed across the board there, not much reaction at all. The Fed Chairman Powell though said the banking system is sound and resilient. He rejected calls for a pause in rate hikes. Notably, a statement by the Fed did not explicitly refer to future rate hikes, instead saying further increases may, may be needed. More now from CNN's Richard Quest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE (on camera): Trust the Fed to walk this narrow tightrope, and perhaps have it both ways. The Fed has admitted that the banking crisis is likely to restrict credit, it will be harder to borrow money. And that will help slow down the economy and ultimately bring down inflation. Therefore, they didn't need to do as much and could only raise rates by a quarter point. The banking crisis was doing that work for them. But the Feds taken a Get Out of Jail Free card by saying that if for some reason, this is all so uncertain, and it doesn't pan out that way. Then they will go back to raising rates. You see inflation in the eyes of the Fed is still public enemy number one. Richard Quest, CNN, Tokyo. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Bundchen says, \"When I was 26 years old and he was 29 years old, we met, we wanted a family, we wanted things together. As time goes by, we realized that we just wanted different things.

Fox News says it can't be liable for airing inherently newsworthy allegations from public figures like Powell and Trump's former attorney Rudy Giuliani.Judge Eric Davis questioned the Fox lawyer asking if top executives have the power to block the network's hosts from booking pro-Trump attorneys that they knew would promote false claims about Dominion. Fox's lawyer said that even if the Murdochs or other executives were aware of the bookings, they can't be held liable because they weren't directly involved in the decision making to put the guests on shows. It's not enough to show that these executives had the ability to step in, Fox lawyer Erin Murphy argued. She also said the Murdochs and other top executives don't control what goes on the air. But Rupert Murdoch in his deposition, acknowledged that he could have stopped Trump's legal team which peddled election lies from appearing on the network's air but didn't. It's now in the judge's hands to decide if this case goes to trial or if the facts are so clear cut that he can automatically rule for either Dominion or Fox News without going to a trial.
