That's been the focus of the last several days making sure at least one lane of traffic could be opened on every single street in Buffalo precisely so that those emergencies can be dealt with. A lot of these emergency calls went unanswered. More than 400 of them during the height of the storm. And so they want to make sure that life- saving measures can take place all over the city.That is something that's already happened. You can look at this street here in downtown Buffalo. It's pretty clear. There are, of course, mounds of snow on each side. And those mounds of snow, those are actually smaller than what we saw on the way in. And that work continues today. In fact, a driving ban is still in effect for Buffalo. Police say more than 450 pieces of snow removal equipment are out on the streets. We've seen several trucks going by in order to try to continue to dig out from this more than four feet of snow and so they're begging folks just to still remain off the roads in terms of individual drivers. The mayor did tweet, though, that several bus lines are going to be coming back into service this morning. Rail lines will begin service again around 11:00. So, some things are beginning to return to normal. But one of the big concerns, and this speaks to what we saw on the way in yesterday, we drove in on a passable road, but the sides of the roads were piled up with snow, and some of the deaths, some of the people who lost their lives in this storm were found in vehicles. So that's something we're going to be concerned about as officials, you know, begin looking and doing welfare checks in homes and checking vehicles. We do expect to get an update from Erie County officials at about 10:00. So not long from now. We hope to get an update on the death toll and on how the efforts are going on right now. Jessica.",

One for diabetics, and one for people who are trying to lose weight. Both are legitimate reasons, but the problem is, is that this drug has become so popular for weight loss that the diabetics - many, not all, but some people with diabetes are having trouble getting it.Let's take a look at what the manufacturer has to say about this. They say there's an intermittent supply disruptions of some dosages of this drug called Ozempic due to the combination of incredible demand coupled with overall global supply constraints. So, this really is spelling trouble for some people with diabetes who really rely on this drug. It's an interesting drug when for weight loss what it does is it works on hormones that regulate appetite. And so it's really been a godsend for many people. It can lead to, say, 10 percent, 15 percent weight loss. But that doesn't help the folks with diabetes who are really in need of this drug, some of whom are having a lot of trouble finding it.
