She was supposed to catch the bus. She never got on that bus, according to police, and she never made it to school. She never made it back home. And police and authorities, multiple agencies are concentrating their search efforts in this area here to my right. You can take a look. This is a lakefront community. This is Lake Livingston. There are multiple areas on this lake that are being searched by authorities. Now, we have a map to give you a sense of what this area looks like. And some of the key places where evidence has been found. Lake Livingston, where you see where I am, this is where the little girl was last seen. But if you look south on that map, you'll be able to see that there's a dam. Well that's where the backpack that little Audrii was wearing, that's where police found a red, bright red backpack with a Hello Kitty. Downstream, where the Trinity River meets I-59, that's where searchers were looking for clues, evidence, anything on Sunday. And just to our north, in this area, is where they have been searching today. So there's been a lot of efforts to try to find her. Now, according to state police, there is a person of interest, a 42- year-old man. But they say that while he's a person of interests, he has not been charged or arrested with any charges related to the disappearance of Audrii Cunningham. He's arrested and in custody on an unrelated for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Now, according to state police, the family of Audrii Cunningham is familiar with this person of interest. That is the only thing that they will actually disclose at this point in time. Now, state police is calling this a criminal investigation, but they won't go into the details of what that means. They also say that they suspect foul play. They won't go into the details of what that means either. But again, the search here continues. I actually just also got off the phone with the FBI, Brianna, who says that they do have investigators and resources here on the ground to help with the search. And just to go back to what Audrii Cunningham's mother just told me, she says that her daughter is beautiful. She just hopes that everybody can look at that picture and look at her daughter, and if anybody saw anything, if they can please call police -- Brianna?",

They're looking for volunteers to participate in a year-long simulated Mars surface mission.The accommodations are going to a 1,700-square-foot 3-D-printed habitat at NASA's Space Center in Houston that they're going to share with three colleagues. And you'll be facing all of the challenges of space travel on the red planet. Let's discuss with retired NASA astronaut, Leroy Chiao. Leroy, thanks so much for joining us. As a veteran of four missions to space, including a 6.5-month mission to the International Space Station, you know well what it takes to thrive in those kinds of circumstances. So what does it take to become a Martian?",

Are there any conflicts that develop?And this kind of thing we've been doing over the years, both at NASA and in other places, too. [13:50:03] For example, some years ago, the Russians, their big Biomedical Research Institute held a Mars 500, a 500-day international study with representatives from different countries. And so I believe this is the longest one that we've done to date, we will do that here at Johnson Space Center in Houston. So it'll be interesting. We learn a lot of these -- a lot from these simulations. We also study a lot from the analogs in the Antarctic. And also in the Arctic Circle. On Devon Island, there's a small place there we do research as well.",

And the Russians learned even earlier than we did since they've been flying long-duration space station flights before we even had Sky Lab up there.But we learned early on, or they learned early on that you can't just throw a group of people together in a closed environment for a long period of time and expect everything to work out. So there needs to be some consideration of the personality mix. And that's one reason that we pay attention to these things during training, when we're selecting crews, putting crews together for the International Space Station. And that's worked very well. Because even, you know, from your experience variances, maybe in college, when you decided you're going to get an apartment with your best friend and after a few months, your work friends anymore, not everyone can live in close quarters with each other. So that's part of what we're looking at. What happens on a Mars mission, especially when you're going six months there are six months back in a small spacecraft, what are some of the psycho-social issues that are going to come up?",

You have to be age 30 to 55, a non-smoker, a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. It doesn't really sound like they're looking for trained astronauts for this mission.",

And that's one of the -- I don't know, \"criticism\" is probably too harsh or word.But one of the comments on these kinds of studies is, are these people that you're selecting for these studies, who can take a year off and basically go be a part of it, are they representative of what your astronaut community of people are going to be like, you know? And so another example that comes to mind, you know, some years ago, where we had the biosphere, right, in the desert and they had a lot of issues with they're -- not only their facility, but with the interaction of the people inside and it didn't always work out well. So, yes, that's a fair comment on how representative will be volunteers be. You'll have volunteers that are going to be paid, I'm sure.

      "sentences": "Well, you know, every little bit accretes some knowledge and so there is some value to doing these kinds of studies.But I have to say that probably the best place to do these kinds of studies is in the actual environment, aboard the ISS. So you've got people flying regularly, six-month missions. Now it's not the year-long mission that were a year-and-a-half, at least long missions we're envisioning since it takes around six months to get to Mars and then, say, six or longer months a surface stay and then a six month return journey, you're talking about a much longer mission. But still, you're actually in the space environment with astronauts, with cosmonauts, with an international crew, who now, we're studying those interactions very carefully. Like I said, were very good about putting crews together. We haven't -- haven't really had any Issues, any significant issues to date. But you know, I don't want to take away from studies like this to say that they're not as valuable. They do add some value. But again, the caveats. You know, are these people really representative of the folks we're going to send to Mars? Frankly, you're probably going to send older people to Mars, and not for any other reason -- well, for many reasons -- but probably the main reason is because of the radiation exposure the crews going to be exposed to on the way there on the surface and then on the way back. You know, you want to send the older people that's not -- certainly you don't want to send women of childbearing age and expose them to those levels of radiation. But even younger folks, you don't necessarily want to expose them to higher levels of radiation, whereas older folks, they're likely to maybe pass on from other causes before the radiation causes a problem.
