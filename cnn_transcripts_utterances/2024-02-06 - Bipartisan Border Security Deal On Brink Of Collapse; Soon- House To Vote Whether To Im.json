      "sentences": "Welcome to The Lead. I'm Jake Tapper.A lot going on this hour. Right now, a floor debate in the U.S. House of Representatives ahead of a significant vote pushed by House Republicans whether or not to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, which could make him the first cabinet official impeached in nearly 150 years since War Secretary William Belknap in 1876. That was for corruption. And the U.S. Senate ultimately acquitted Belknap, which is almost certainly to happen again with Mayorkas, an acquittal with Democrats controlling the Senate chamber. Also this hour, the counteroffer for a hostage deal from the terrorist group Hamas, which is calling for a complete ceasefire. I'm going to get the reaction from the father of nine-year-old Emily Hand. She spent nearly two months in Hamas captivity. And leading this hour, the major ruling earlier today from a three judge appeals court panel agreeing that Donald Trump is not immune from prosecution for alleged crimes he may have committed when he was president. And giving Trump's team until only February 12, Monday, to file emergency action with the U.S. Supreme Court if they want to appeal. Let's get straight to CNN's Kaitlan Collins. And Kaitlan, this was more than just a denial of Donald Trump's legal arguments. It was the judges unanimously rejecting and repudiating Donald Trump's actions around January 6.",

So they use the word allegations and allegedly a lot in here, but these judges get into what is at the heart of that indictment, what Trump is saying that he is immune from prosecution from. And they're saying that, you know, if he did what he's alleged to have done, that he was inserting himself into a process where a president has no role, the counting and certifying of the Electoral College votes. And they say that would undermine constitutionally established procedures laid out for the Congress.And in addition to that, Jake, you know, their scathing argument about what his actions are around January 6. They also reject every single argument that his attorney made in front of them that day. Of course, we listened to it live as his attorney was in front of these three judges. And they basically say that all of these arguments are wrong. They almost kind of, you know -- they say that they misread past rulings, they say the idea that because he was impeached by the House and then acquitted in the Senate and that that would qualify as double jeopardy here, I mean, they seem to just outright dismiss and the claim that also that this would have a chilling effect on future presidents if Trump was not immune from this prosecution, they say actually it's the reverse that is more dangerous. The idea that a president is immune from everything. And one part that they referenced, Jake, that stood out to me is what's known as the take care clause. It's that the president is supposed to make sure that the laws of this nation are faithfully executed. And they say it would be essentially quite the paradox if the one person whose task that is, whose job that is, would then be immune from following those laws.",

What do they do?Did they hold a lot of the timing in their hands? If that doesn't happen, Jake, and if it does go back to just this court, then we could see Judge Chutkan moving ahead with this case, potentially.

And something that if you look at this immigration policies, immigration law that's been broken has been like this. Last time it was reformed was 27 years ago. So it's time we start moving forward. Now, if you look at the bill and you read the bill, the $20 billion helps us with securing the border, continuing to have more border patrol agents, more customs agents. But at the end of the day, it didn't fix the root of the problem, which is what we need to continue to work on. But this is really something if we continue to stay status quo, nothing will change. It's time -- really, it's about time that we did have a bipartisan bill that's going to really help us create something for our asylum seekers and continue to work with them. You look at it, it -- the process is a little tougher. I get it. But also -- but once the process -- they go through the process, they'll be able to work immediately. And that's something that we've been asking for as border leaders. So, you know, we understand, we're here day in and day out, and we understand what needs to be done. And at the end of the day, having a bipartisan bill that addresses a lot of the things that need to. We know the mandate, I get it. It's a mandate.

Let's bring in Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales from Texas.Congressman, let's start with the vote to impeach the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Mayorkas. It's going to take place in a matter of minutes. There are a world of critics, even conservatives, who say House Republicans are turning policy disagreement into impeachment. Again, I've asked this of other House Republicans, what is the high crime and or misdemeanor here? And are you at all concerned about Democrats doing this to the next Republican president's cabinet officials because they don't like how they interpret the law? REP. TONY GONZALES (R-TX): First off, thanks for having me on, Jake. And, yes, of course, Democrats are going to use this exact same technique. It's what happens in Washington. Round and round we go. But what has he done? He's got -- what has secretary Mayorkas done to deserve to be impeached? He's gotten Americans killed. Just ask the Tambunga family that had to bury their grandmother and seven-year-old daughter. And we've had enough. And America wants a change, Jake. Whether it's impeachment, whether it's resign, whether it's policy changes, it's very clear that whatever the Biden administration is currently doing is not working. People are dying due to fentanyl. The amount of folks on the terrorist watch list are coming over. I mean, we have had enough, and so it's time for the House of Republicans to come together and impeach Secretary Mayorkas.",

Everyone's talking about this bill is dead. It's not going anywhere. What happens next? This is what I think happens next. I think President Biden should look into parts of this bill that make sense, which is increasing funding for ICE and ERO and let's turn up the amount of deportation flights for people that do not qualify for asylum. That would help. Let's surge immigration judges to the border, that would help get cases heard in days, not years. And the third part, let's get to the root of the issue. The root of the issue is the cartels. It's time for us to stop fighting one another as Americans and fight the real enemy, which is the cartels.

They love seeing people coming over. Remember, there was a member of Congress that hosted the vice president in El Paso and said, this is -- welcome to the new Ellis Island. So there are people that want to see this happen. On the other end, there are people that love to be able to go look at this chaos that they're providing. Meanwhile, Americans are the ones that are having to pay for this crisis. So, yes, I think there is a lot of politics that are being played. I look at it through the lens of this way. This bill was 370 pages long. It probably should have been 10 pages. So let's get rid of all the fat and let's find a border security bill that is meaningful, that can get through the finish line, that's what I'm committed to doing. I'm not giving up.

But once he's no longer president, then your job as the chair of the party is the party first. Not any one individual, not the president, not the White House.And so her role has changed while she has been RNC chair, the nature of that job. And it means that suddenly that can read as, oh, have you been disloyal to me? And remember, for Donald Trump, there is almost no such thing as too loyal. There is always a sort of a seeking of a scapegoat or, oh, you maybe have betrayed me in this way. And so she is -- but in a long line of people who have been kind of thrown under the Trump bus in this fashion.
