That's what makes these numbers really big.Look at the line earlier here -- the 7:00 a.m. rush here at Reagan National Airport. The good news is right now, people are getting through security relatively quickly, although the TSA tells us today is going to be one of the biggest days of the holiday rush -- 2.6 million people expected at airports nationwide. The FAA and air traffic controllers anticipating handling 48,000 flights. Last Friday and this Monday and Tuesday were really big. They will rival today's numbers. But what's interesting about those numbers is that they are only five percent off from the all-time air travel record we saw this Sunday after this past Thanksgiving. I want you to look now at the cancellations and delays. Over about the last week, airlines have operated about 187,000 flights. They have delayed about 36,000 of them. And that number, according to Transportation Sec. Pete Buttigieg -- he says it's a little high based on what we have seen in the past. But the cancellations have remained relatively low. We're talking only one percent of all flights canceled over the last week. And we're talking 1,300 flights in total. I spoke to FAA administrator Mike Whitaker about this. He says the agency is prepared and airlines are prepared and they are in constant communication. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And also, former commanding officer of the USS Cole, Kirk Lippold. It's good to have both of you with us. And Commander, if I could begin with you, Benny Gantz also said this week that the time is running out to reach any sort of a diplomatic solution between Israel and Hezbollah. There is so -- there are so many eyes, rather, watching what is playing out along that northern border. How concerned are you this morning about an expanding war in the Middle East? COMMANDER KIRK LIPPOLD, U.S. NAVY (RET.), FORMER COMMANDER OFFICER, USS COLE, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  I think you may see an expanding war only because Hezbollah is very much entrenched into Lebanon. They have been there for literally decades. They're in the government. They are throughout society. And they have had the opportunity over that time period to build up military forces. To watch how the Israelis operate in the northern border area. And so, consequently, they are well prepared to begin to attack Israel from the north and target all the way to the southern end of the country. They have weapons that can reach that far and they know exactly what they would want to aim for to try and disrupt Israel's capability. So while Israel may rely on the Lebanese government to try and get them back, Hezbollah is going to drive their own agenda at the behest of Iran to do whatever it takes to prevent Israel from destroying Hamas.",

HAGAR CHEMALI, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, U.S. MISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS, FORMER NSC DIRECTOR FOR SYRIA AND LEBANON, HOST, \"OH MY WORLD\" (via Webex by Cisco):  Right, Phil. As you said, one of their number one priorities is to prevent this from expanding into a broader regional war, which is why they beefed up their military assets in the Mediterranean, in the Red Sea, and in the Gulf. And so, now what you're seeing is the U.S. also strike back those Iran-backed militant groups in Iraq, specifically, and in Syria to push back on them when they have struck U.S. bases. In my own opinion, they could be more forceful in those responses because those militant groups are not going to launch a big war. They are unable to. They don't have the capacity to beat the United States at this war. And so, the U.S. does have room there in an effort to prevent something wider-scale. To pursue more forceful attacks in a message that these militants understand. These militants only understand the language of military engagement. And so, to respond more forcefully -- but not to the point of igniting a massive war with Iran, which I don't think will happen. Then it sends this message of you're not allowed to do these types of attacks or strikes because we're going to come for you, too, on behalf of Israel or in defense of preventing a destabilized Middle East.",

Similar to Hamas, they do not care about the conventions that are out there that prohibit targeting civilians, civilian infrastructure. But nonetheless, Russia is trying to make sure that they put the conditions into place that may drive Ukraine to have to come to the bargaining table if the United States, in a leadership role, doesn't work with our European partners to ensure that Ukraine gets the weapons they need at the time they need it to do what they need to do, to not only defend against Russian attacks but also push Russia back to the pre-war borders, including Crimea.",
