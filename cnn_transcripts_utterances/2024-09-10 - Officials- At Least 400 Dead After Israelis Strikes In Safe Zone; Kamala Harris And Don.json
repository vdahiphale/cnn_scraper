The Democratic presidential nominee arrived in Philadelphia on the eve of the debate after days of preparations for the high stakes showdown. In an interview released on Monday, Harris said she predicts Trump is going to lie and use his old and tired playbook to attack her personally. Meantime, the Trump campaign spokesperson says Trump is \"going to be himself,\" while previewing some likely lines of attack, including that Harris, \"owns everything from this administration.\" Both candidates are hoping to sway still undecided voters when they meet Tuesday night in Philadelphia as the race for the White House remains tight.

Images on social media appear to show what looks like a fire in a residential building in the Moscow region. Local officials say at least one person was killed as a result of the attack, and three more were injured. The Russian Defense Ministry says 144 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight, including 20 over the Moscow region. Local officials say some of the drones landed just 38 kilometers south of the Kremlin. Well, after 2-1/2 straight years of war, Ukrainian forces are losing morale, and many of them are losing their lives. Well, right now, Ukraine is trying to repel Russia's advance on the key military supply hub of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, but they're not having much success. Fred Pleitgen has the latest from the embattled city and a warning, his report contains graphic video. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Ukrainian troops sweeping into a village on the eastern front, but these aren't career soldiers, they are ex-convicts who volunteered from prison, got some basic training and were thrust into battle. Vitaly, 41-years-old, 10 years in jail for theft and violent assault now, assaulting Vladimir Putin's army. VITALY, EX-CONVICT, SHKVAL COMPANY IN 59TH BRIGACE (through translator): We have a goal. We have a task and we must do it. We're never confused, always focused. You need to be very quick there. PLEITGEN (voice over): The ex-convicts are part of Ukraine's 59th Brigade. They are camped near the frontline, rudimentary, but a lot better than jail. Our conversations remain basic about survival or death. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): He who has a strong spirit wins. He who has a weak spirit dies. PLEITGEN (voice over): Many are dying here on both sides. The 59th Brigade gave us this video showing Russians fleeing a burning house as the ex-convicts attack. But Vitaly admits they are suffering casualties. VITALY (through translator): We were moving into a position and my buddy was blown apart as soon as we went into the field. He was dismantled. It's hard to watch, but what can you do? You can't help. PLEITGEN (voice over): Their deal is simple, fight, survive and become free men. VITALY (through translator): I need turn the page of my life. I have five children after all. I need to think about my kids a little bit and about myself. My life was a mess. PLEITGEN (voice over): Company commander Oleksandr says his men performs some of the most dangerous assaults around here. Oleksandr was a jail warden and many of those here, his inmates. He recruited them and says the traits that put them in jail now keep them alive. OLEKSANDR, COMMANDER, SHKVAL COMPANY IN 59TH BRIGACE (through translator): The convict subculture is used to surviving. They survived in very harsh conditions and they will make every effort to survive. PLEITGEN (voice over): This unit is part of Ukraine's force defending the key logistic hub of Pokrovsk.",

But firstly, what do you make of this highly politicized Republican report on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and do we learn anything new? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think you put it right in the right condition, Anna, when you said highly politicized, it is a highly politicized report. Many people knew it was going to come out from, primarily those in the Republican Party, the members of that committee. It's been answered by the Democrats. And unfortunately, because there has been so many other investigations into the actions of both the Afghan war, but also the final days of the evacuation operation and the chaos that pursued that, there's not going to be much additive, in my view, to this. Having skimmed through both the reports, both the Republican report and the Democratic rebuttal to it, I didn't learn anything new. Truthfully, there has been several after actions conducted by both the Department of Defense, the military and the State Department, as well as Central Command, and they are covering all the things. They know what they have to learn from what occurred during this chaotic couple of days. But there's also the issue of the entire war. You know, how many mistakes were made, what do we learn in terms of lessons, how do we try and polish those things so we don't repeat those kind of tragedies in the future.",

You know, when you're a general and you're in charge of a mission in a different country, you want that mission to succeed. So, sometimes common cultural bias overtakes you. But there was also a strategic political failure from early on in the war, after things changed, and there was a competing demand in terms of what exactly the strategy was, what was the desired end state, once the culture became known inside of Afghanistan, knowing that that President Ghani could not pull this nation together no matter how much training his security forces got, it became very problematic.",

They have hearing aid features; that will certainly appeal to a lot of consumers.[02:35:00] CONSTINE:  Absolutely. I think the new apple watch, there's a beautiful new black model and it's really designed for treating sleep apnea, which is massively undiagnosed. A lot of people don't even realize that they have it. And so, if it can help you sleep better, that's going to be a huge win. And Apple's -- the Apple Watch already has a massive lead over all other wearables in the market. And I think the new Airpods will be especially helpful for anyone with older parents who have hearing problems and don't necessarily want to go get a clinical-grade hearing aid that usually ends up unused and left in a drawer. Because people bring their Airpods everywhere, that could be really helpful. But I think Apple has really realized that it's already got the best- in-class products in a lot of places. And so, maybe it's just trying not to screw things up. Maybe it actually finally realized that it's not selling a phone as much as selling a camera that can text. And so, you might need last year's iPhone telephoto lens to tell the difference between the models, but there are so many fan boys and fan girls out there that always want the latest technology that they're going to get the new one no matter what. And one nice thing is that the new iPhones, the bigger models and smaller models actually have the same features, so just if you have smaller hands, you're not left as a second-class citizen with a weaker iPhone or a weaker camera anymore.",
