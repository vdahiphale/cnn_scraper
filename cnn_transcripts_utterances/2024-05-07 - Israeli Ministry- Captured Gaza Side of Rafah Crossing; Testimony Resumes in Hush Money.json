And on a parallel track in Cairo, in Egypt, of course, across that Rafah border and beyond but no less fundamental to the story. Israel says the hostage ceasefire proposal that Hamas agreed to late on Monday is and I quote here, far from Israel's requirements, but that it will send a delegation to Egypt for further talks. Well, there are a lot of moving parts right now with a lot to unpack. Let's stay on this with Jeremy Diamond who is in Jerusalem, Arlette Saenz from the White House. Jeremy, let's start with you. We're seeing video of Israeli tanks literally rolling over signs that say I love Gaza and Gaza and on the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing. CNN has geo located this video showing an Israeli tank at the border, which is one of the main supply routes for humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the Enclave.

Now it comes as the U.S. has repeatedly warned Israel against engaging in a widespread major campaign without a plan in place to ensure the safety and evacuation of the more than 1.4 million people who are currently in Rafah that President Biden reiterated his position in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just yesterday.

And we saw this back and forth just yesterday between Israel and Hamas, as Hamas official said that they had accepted an agreement when it comes to the release of these hostages and a potential ceasefire. Now, U.S. officials said they didn't see this as an agreement. They saw this as a counter proposal. So there's still a bit of a negotiation that has to be underway as the U.S. really hopes that some type of deal would be the best way to secure the release of hostages and a ceasefire as these fighting has continued. Now, President Biden today also will be delivering a major speech on anti- Semitism here at the -- here on Capitol Hill.

And I quote here, calling on the Israeli side to exercise the utmost levels of restraint and to stay away from a policy of brinkmanship that has long term impact and that would threaten the fate of the strenuous efforts made to reach a sustainable truce inside the Gaza Strip. Well, as we mentioned, there's a lot to unpick now. Where are we with that potential hostage ceasefire deal? How long before we may see the release of hostages, for example, that would be during a -- at least temporary ceasefire, period or truce. When might that be? Well, let's break this down now. What we know and what we don't know perhaps? CNN's Paula Hancocks joining me here and I thought it was really important to just mark with the Egyptian side of the back end of that statement, this stairway from a policy of brinkmanship. It has long term impact. It threatens the fate of the strenuous efforts made to reach a sustainable truce inside the Gaza Strip. We hear calls for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza echoed around this region and beyond.

What it does mean is that Hamas is effectively putting pressure back on Israel, they put the ball back in Israel's court that it's up to Israel now to accept or not accept, and it also shows publicly that Hamas is willing to make a deal. This is what I'm hearing that the fact that they have said they accept this proposal publicly shows that they are at the point they are willing to accept this kind of proposal. But Israel is coming under a huge amount of regional pressure as well. I'll read you one comment from the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Jordan, Ayman Safadi saying, quote, tremendous effort has been made to produce an exchange deal that will release hostages and realize a ceasefire. Hamas has put out an offer if Netanyahu genuinely wants to deal, he will negotiate the offer in earnest. Instead, he is jeopardizing the deal by bombing Rafah.

This is a one on one personal time that Macron insisted on having with Xi, and it's really breaking with protocol, but he is there to reinforce the main issues, which is, you know, reduce trade imbalance between China and Europe. We saw that message yesterday in particular with the European Commission chief yesterday, in that trilateral meeting. They want to secure better access for European companies in China, fewer subsidies for Chinese exporters. The other message they're trying to get across is this, you know, ending the war in Ukraine. Macron wants Xi to use his influence over Russian President Vladimir Putin, who we should note is visiting Beijing later this month. And yesterday, we heard from Xi in Paris, he pushed back on that criticism of China's close relationship with Russia, saying, we oppose the crisis being used to cast responsibility on a third country, sully its image and incite a new -- cold war.

Right now, we are outside the courthouse in Manhattan, where CNN has learned from a sourcethat, one of the prosecution's key witnesses, adult film actress Stormy Daniels is expected to testify in Donald Trump's criminal trial today. Now the judges on the bench, prosecutors are in the courtroom along with Trump are expecting things to get going in just a few minutes. Her testimony will allow jurors to hear from the woman at the center of the case against the former president, though we do not know at which point she will testify today. Remember, Trump has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election to buy her silence. Now prosecutors say it was all part of an attempt by Trump to mislead voters. I want to bring in Jeff Swartz. He's a former judge, and now a law professor, as well. And for folks who are watching, you can see the updates on the left side of your screen that's coming from our reporters inside court. So you can follow along with some of these live updates. Jeff thanks for coming back. So I just want to get your reaction right off the bat to tell our reporting that we expect Stormy Daniels to testify that we expect the prosecution to call Stormy Daniels to testify. Why is she so important? What are you expecting to hear from her materially in regards to the case? JEFF SWARTZ, FORMER MIAMI-DADE COUNTY COURT JUDGE: Materially, she's going to say what her understanding of the deal was, her receipt of the money from her lawyer, it's basically going to be corroboration for her lawyer who had a very difficult cross examination. And she's also going to describe what Mr. Trump is denying, and that is whether there in fact, was an encounter between the two. Based upon the interviews I've seen, she seems to have a rather vivid memory of that evening.",

However, if it came out with anything referring to Stormy Daniels, then that's a different story. Now he's commenting on witnesses, he also put into that same post the complaint that somehow it was unfair, because there was no time for his lawyers to prepare, nothing could be further from the truth than that. They've known who the witnesses are, for a very long time. And good lawyers don't wait till they hear the night before who's going to testify to prepare their cross examination. As we've seen with all the other witnesses, the lawyers were very well prepared, because they've had these names for a long time. They've been preparing for a long time. And I think that statement was really kind of a falsehood meant to lead people in the wrong direction. Again, that's just commenting on how he sees things progressing in court. That's not going to violate the gag order. But he better be very careful at this point about what he does, because I personally haven't been a judge will tell you that judges don't make the kind of threats that Merchan has made in his last order and not mean it. Merchan is going to do what he has to do to take control over his courtroom. And the idea that Donald Trump thinks he's still in control is something that Judge Merchan has to make clear to him, you are not in control. I'm in control. I'm the guy in the black dress. I'm the guy that makes decisions.",

However, Michael Cohen could take a whole week himself. And so therefore here we are sitting with a couple of days left in this week. And then we got all of next week, and then maybe a day or two the following week for some follow up kind of finish off witnesses. And then the defense will have to move forward after motions for judgment of acquittal, assuming they are denied they will have to move forward. We really could be finished in to the jury, presumably, by the end of the month, and they may be deliberating at the start of June. That's kind of the way I see it. I'm not surprised.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: It would be tragic if weeks of intense diplomatic activity for peace in Gaza, yield no ceasefire, no release of hostages and the devastating offensive in Rafah. I reiterate my appeal for both parties to show the political courage and spare no effort to secure an agreement now. To stop the bloodsheds, to free the hostages, and to help stabilize the region, this is still at risk of explosion. This is a crucial opportunity that the region and indeed the world cannot afford to miss. Yet things are moving in the wrong direction. I am disturbed and distressed by the renewed military activity in Rafah by the Israeli Defense Forces. The closure of both Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings is especially damaging to an already dire humanitarian situation. They must be reopened immediately. Just to give an example, we risk running out of fuel this evening. I urge the Government of Israel to stop any escalation and engage constructively in the ongoing diplomatic talks. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What he doesn't address is how he believes the two parties can close the remaining gaps that exist here. He is also focusing on the Israeli military operation in Rafah urging Israel to avoid any escalation, as he said, and also expressing concern about what that military operation means for the entry of desperately needed humanitarian aid into Gaza, noting that both the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, as well as the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza that both of those remain close. The Kerem Shalom crossing closed after Hamas appears to have fired rockets and mortars towards the direction of that crossing killing four Israeli soldiers and resulting in the closing of that crossing. The Israeli government has committed to reopening Kerem Shalom, but it's not clear when it will do so. But as of today, both of those critical crossings remain closed. So a message from the Secretary General about the importance of humanitarian aid, about the importance of focusing on the negotiations at the moment to try and reach a deal and of course, on the consequences that not reaching a deal would have for, both the people in Gaza as well as the hostages and the families of those hostages.",

But the nighttime visuals, the video that you just saw a moment ago. Well here is a bird's eye perspective of that very same tornado that struck the northern sections of Oklahoma. This is in Barnesville. And this is really my first time seeing this video and I'm just kind of flabbergasted at the extent of the damage here. Trees have been completely ripped of their foliage. You can see buildings that have been completely flattened roofs torn off of their houses, cars displaced. This is significant damage from a lot of on the ground experience. This is -- this has got to be an EF three or stronger tornado. Of course the National Weather Service comes in and assesses the damage gives the official rating but nonetheless, I mean this is very significant tornado damage. I mean look at that wide path. I mean this has got to be at least 100 meters wide with this particular tornado, quite a perspective to see it from this CNN drone aerials that were shot just moments ago. 17 tornado reports for the day yesterday, this is in the past 24 hours and that same line of storms is weakening as it advances eastward. But there are a few different things at play here that are going to make this another dangerous setup for tornadoes. So here's this line of storms. It raced through Oklahoma yesterday. Here it is about to impact Chicago. There are delays and cancellations at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Others some stronger storms moving across Kentucky and Tennessee right now as well impacting places like Louisville and Indianapolis. But nothing severe as it stands. But it will happen behind this is the sun will come out. There will be breaks in the clouds. And the atmosphere is going to take advantage of this very turbulent environment that we have in place across the eastern and central U.S. This is known as the Ohio River Valley Storm. Prediction Center has highlighted this area as the most at risk of tornadoes today, some of which could be strong, large hail possible and severe wind gusts up to hurricane forced in some locations. We do anticipate another round of severe weather so not this initial line moving through that I showed you on the radar now but later today once we start to see the thunderstorms start to bumble -- bubble up because of the atmospheric conditions in place. There it is. You can see it actually by this evening. Cincinnati all the way to Columbus and Cleveland even Detroit in the mix. I will keep an eye on this and Becky we have this term called severe weather fatigue. We have three days still yet to go of severe weather for the Eastern U.S.",
