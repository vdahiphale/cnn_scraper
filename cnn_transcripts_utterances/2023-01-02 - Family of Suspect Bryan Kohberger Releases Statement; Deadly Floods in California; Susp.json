We will continue to let the legal process unfold and as a family we will love and support our son and brother.

We respect privacy in this matter as our family and the families suffering loss can move forward through the legal process. And his attorney is the chief public defender for Monroe County, Pennsylvania. He tells me that when the arrest happened at 1:30 in the morning on Friday, that it was actually Bryan Kohberger's father that answered the door. The family is saying according to the attorney, about 3:00 in the morning. The middle of the night he answered the door. We know it was the FBI, Pennsylvania State Police. We know Idaho State Police are here in Pennsylvania at this point. The father fully cooperated with law enforcement, I am told. He brought his son Bryan to the door. That is when authorities arrested him. I am also told by the attorney that the family is not being allowed to visit him in this correction facility.

If a president can incite an insurrection and not be held accountable, then really there's no limit to what a president can do or can't do. And so, yes, I do think ultimately when we get to where we've got to go, I think the Justice Department will do the right thing. I think he will be charged and I frankly think he should be.

There is a bridge connecting Kentucky and Ohio which will benefit from some of the funding in the bipartisan infrastructure law that was passed last year. It was one of the few bipartisan accomplishments the president was able \\ to achieve in the past year. Additionally, they were able to pass more funding for Ukraine. Also, investments in the microchip industry here in the United States as well as gun safety legislation. Now the White House has been trying to identifying Republicans they can work with in this upcoming Congress and they're really targeting two groups. One being that group of moderate Republicans and another, incoming freshmen who won in districts President Biden carried back in 2020. But even as they are focusing on ways to find bipartisan cooperation, President Biden is fully cognizant of the Republican resistance ahead. One thing that they will be watching very closely this week is that race for House Speaker as they are waiting to see whether Kevin McCarthy will be the leader of the Republicans and Speaker of the House. Also, the White House has been gearing up for a bevy of investigations expected to be launched from House Republicans. They've said that they will launch investigations into everything from the withdrawal from Afghanistan and work on the southern border as well as Hunter Biden's business dealings, which the White House has said is politically motivated. President Biden very soon will be returning to Washington in that era of divided government. He hopes there will be bipartisan cooperation but he's also prepared for the resistance ahead.

Other people just know him as many people do around the world, as the Pope had some mixed feelings about his record as Pope. But I think most of them are at least interested in experiencing this ritual at the Vatican where you can come and pay your respects to a Pope. It was the same for John Paul II. But of course, we saw an entirely different mood here with John Paul II. There were many, many more people and it was for a different Pope. He was much beloved. Of course, we had people from Poland and everywhere. So, we'll see in the next few days who comes here. For the moment, obviously these are people who are already in Rome. So, once they get inside, they can pay their respects to the body of Pope Benedict. They try to keep them moving as much as possible, of course. And then the funeral mass will be held on Thursday. So, this will be going on for the next two days here. Once the funeral mass is held the Pope, we know, Pope Emeritus, has requested a simple mass. We'll see how that goes with Pope Francis doing it.
