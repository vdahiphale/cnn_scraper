This is in response to an increasing wave of Palestinian terror attacks against Israelis over the past year and a half. The Israeli military saying that they are trying to remove Jenin as a safe haven for militants.But of course, many civilians there are so deeply affected by what is happening. Residents there saying that bulldozers -- Israeli bulldozers are tearing up their streets. This is ostensibly to remove IEDs that militants have been using recently against the Israeli military there. Now, we know of at least eight Palestinians who have been killed. There are reports that at least some of them are militants, but no militant group has claimed any of them as their members. We know of at least 50 injuries. We know of one Israeli soldier who was injured as well. Now, the White House has said that they are monitoring the situation closely. And they did say broadly that they support Israel's security and right to defend its people. But there are condemnations coming down from places like Egypt and Jordan, of course, the Palestinian authority just for about the scale of this sort of operation. And the concern now, John, is that this will turn into something so much broader. We keep talking about the days of the Second Intifada, and just feels day and day in and day out that we're getting closer to that point. The Israeli military saying that they're not engaging in any sort of large-scale military operation in the West Bank, and these are targeted operations. But Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, says it has called on all of its members to operate now against Israel, John.",

He has newspapers and the government of the United States says that the charges are simply baseless.CNN's Kylie Atwood joins us now from the State Department.

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Sara. I mean, this has been confirmed by the spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Moscow that there was this meeting today with Ambassador Lynne Tracy, the U.S. ambassador in Moscow, with Evan Gershkovich. And as you said, the significant thing here is that she has not been able to see him.The U.S. ambassador has not been able to see Evan for multiple series of months since April. And the U.S. Embassy has requested access to Gershkovich over the course of those months, but those requests have been turned down. So, it is of course good news that she was able to get in and see him. We aren't getting a readout in terms of how that meeting went, how he was, how he's doing. We might get more from U.S. officials you know as time goes on because it's our understanding that this meeting just concluded today. But we should note that he was detained earlier in March, as you said, on charges of espionage, that the State Department, of course, is denying, and that his family is denying he was there as a journalist for The Wall Street Journal. And one of the challenges with being charged with espionage in the Russian system is that the Russians, therefore, look for something that they can get out of the United States when it comes to their spying around the world. And so, what we have reported is that U.S. officials are really working hard to try and figure out what it'll take to offer up to the Russians to get Evan out of prison. And of course, we should note that there's another American, Paul Whelan, who's also been wrongfully detained in Russia for more than four years. So, they're working on trying to figure out what they can offer to the Russians for both of those men who are wrongfully detained. There's also a whole host of other Americans who are detained in the country, not necessarily deemed wrongfully detained by the United States -- by the State Department at this time. But of course, this is a space we continue to watch. The good news is that he was visited today but it comes after many months of the Russians denying U.S. diplomats access to this American Citizen, Sara.",

An attempted murder investigation has been opened. His wife and two young children were inside.What we saw here outside the town hall was still some of the damage on it. Earlier today was a march of solidarity in favor of that mayor -- in support of that Mayor. The mayor is saying a certain line now has been crossed. It's been nearly a week now, John, of really remarkable levels of violence, anger gripping not just as outer suburbs of Paris in some of the less well-off neighborhoods here in the French capital, but also elsewhere in France, many of its other urban centers. And it's hard years of frustration about police brutality, but also fears and suspicions of systemic racism within the police. What we've seen over the course of the weekend was another weekend of remarkable violence. 1300 people arrested Friday night. 700 Saturday night. That was down to 157 Sunday night. Now, what authorities are saying is that they hope that the violence may be quietening down. And what may have helped is what young Nael, the boy who was killed last Tuesday at the police stop, had to say on Sunday. Have a listen. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) NADIA, GRANDSON KILLED BY POLICE (through translator): I blame the policeman who killed my grandson. I'm the grandmother. I blamed the policeman who killed my grandson. That's all I want. The police, they are here, fortunately. They are here and the people who are breaking things, I tell them, stop, stop. We want to calm things down. We don't want them to break. We want them to remain calm. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

So for -- so far, 93 flights have been canceled today. That's actually not so bad. That number though, is almost certainly to rise as the storms increase around the country.

The second is really going to be up and down much of the East Coast.Now, both of these areas are going to get several waves of storms today. But keep in mind. Some of these areas were just hit yesterday and now they're going to go through it all over again. Over 250 total reports from yesterday, the vast majority of them being damaging winds. That will continue to be the case today. Some showers are already ongoing this morning into the Northeast, but a lot more of them will ramp up this afternoon and evening particularly here stay stretching from Massachusetts, all the way back through Mississippi and even into Arkansas and Oklahoma. That secondary target point is going to be up across portions of the Midwest but damaging winds, large hail, and even some tornadoes are still possibilities. The first round this morning but notice a lot more of this begins to fill back in in the afternoon and the evening once you get that heating of the day. But even going into tomorrow, the holiday itself, we are looking at additional showers and thunderstorms possible. The target point really going to be this area across the Midwest, including Minneapolis stretching over to Denver. And then yet again, in many of the same areas today we're talking Massachusetts all the way back into Mississippi, the threats themselves will remain the same. You're still talking damaging winds and the potential for some large hail. Another concern too is also just going to be the heat because of how widespread it is. Numerous states across the Southeast looking at those temperatures to feel like they are into the triple digits. Then out across the West, we're looking at excessive heat warnings where the temperature itself will be crossing into the triple digits, maybe even 110s and 120s. That's also going to start spreading off to the North and West, so states like Oregon and Washington also looking at the potential for some heat. That likely to start peaking tomorrow for the holidays. South and into Wednesday. Keep in mind several of these locations also looking at the potential for record temperatures. We're talking at least 30 cities that could end up having records over the next several days.",

And even though the hotels are going to stay open, it is significant because of course, you're seeing them outside instead of working in hotels. They have a number of demands, including of course higher wages and better pensions, but they're also asking for better conditions when their working safer workloads. And essentially, just better health care. One of the things that they're really interested in is a housing fund as well because what they're saying is that it's almost impossible to live here in Los Angeles and work in these hotels. And they say it's almost just really difficult to be in Los Angeles with the salaries that they have at the moment. Here is what of those union members told me just a few minutes ago.
