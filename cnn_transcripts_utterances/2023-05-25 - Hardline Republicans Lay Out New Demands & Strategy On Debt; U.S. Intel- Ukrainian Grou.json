      "sentences": "Well, first of all, if the government can prioritize its debt payments, and that's a big if. You know, back in 2011, there was a plan to do it in place.There are some machinations behind the scenes to try to do it now, to say, OK, let's make sure the bond holders get paid first, let's make sure Social Security recipients, military personnel, et cetera, get paid first. First of all, I don't know that they have the technical capacity to do it based on my own conversations with treasury personnel, that they would like to be able to do it but the system isn't set up for it and they have old, obsolete I.T., frankly. So even if they could do it, there are still going to be some bills unpaid, there are going to be some government workers, some potential people expecting to receive benefits, doctors who are receiving Medicare or Medicaid payments, whoever gets deprioritized, they are going to suffer. There's going to be lots of uncertainty there. My bigger concern beyond that sort of immediate tangible effect of people just not getting the cash flow that they're expecting, is that you could see, again, major disruptions in financial markets. Even if we pay off the bond holders, even if we succeed at doing this thing that may be technically very difficult of saying let's prioritize the payments, market participants may still view this as a default and may view treasuries no longer a safe asset or not as safe as it used to be. And treasuries are sort of the building block of the global financial system. You have these domino effects that could go through not just treasury markets, but stock markets and lots of other financial markets throughout the world.",

At the same time, there were also communications, intercepts coming from Russia with Russian agencies also speculating that the Ukrainians must be behind this attack. And that led to a preliminary assessment that Ukrainian groups may have been behind that attack. But you're absolutely correct to say that the U.S. also says they don't believe that the highest levels of the Ukrainian government were actually involved in this. And certainly, one of the other things that's important to point out is that this is not a definitive assessment. However, for the Kremlin, it is all very definitive. They came out once again today and said they were absolutely certain that the Ukrainians were behind it. And of course, one of the things the Kremlin has been doing after the attack took place is they've used it to justify their ongoing war in Ukraine -- Boris?",

We've done some new reporting and we found, at a key facility at the FAA, that it handles pretty much every flight going in and out of Florida. In a seven-week period last summer they were short 200 shifts, led to 4,600 delays. These can have a cascading effect. And there have already been delays because of staffing issues in Denver on Sunday and Monday. So we'll see how this weekend goes.

The room that had lights in it now has the lights turned off. The animal has the ability to come out of that nest box at night where they put out foraging things that it can forage for and display its natural behavior. And it's only handled for a medical procedure or to switch it from area to another while one habitat gets cleaned. The bottom line is, we made a mistake. We apologized profusely to the people of New Zealand because of that mistake. And we're going to do better. And that's what we're going to do.
