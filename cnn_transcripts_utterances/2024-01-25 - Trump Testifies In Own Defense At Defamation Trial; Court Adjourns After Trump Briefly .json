We're following these major developing stories and many more, all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. An extraordinary moment in federal court today as Donald Trump testified in his own defense at his second civil defamation trial. The former president answering a handful of questions in about the time that it takes us to go to a commercial. And in that brief time, Trump still managed to get cut off by the judge. But the big headline here is that he mostly stuck to the parameters laid out by the judge before he took the stand, mostly. We have CNN's Kara Scannell who is at the courthouse in New York; CNN's Paula Reid; and CNN Legal Analyst, Joey Jackson also with us. Kara, to you first, walk us through Trump's testimony.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna. I mean, he was on the stand for less than five minutes. He actually spent more time discussing what he could and could not be asked about than he was actually on the stand. So he went up and took the witness stand, rose his hand, swore that he would tell the truth.And then his attorney asked him just three questions. She asked him: \"Do you stand by the testimony in your deposition?\" Trump said, \"One hundred percent yes.\" But the jury had seen earlier in the day excerpts of Trump's deposition where he denies E. Jean Carroll's claims. He calls her a whack job. He says she's mentally ill and he says that he doesn't know her. So Trump's saying, yes, 100 percent he stood behind that. Then she also asked did you make this statement in response to the accusations that were made by E. Jean Carroll. And Trump said, \"Yes, I did. That's exactly right.\" He was starting to say that he considered these to be a false accusation and the judge cut him off, telling the jury that they just needed to - all they needed to hear from him was that, yes, he did make his statements in response to her accusations. And then the third question, Trump's attorney had asked, did he instruct anyone to harm E. Jean Carroll. Trump said, \"No, I just wanted to defend myself, my family and frankly the presidency.\" Again, the judge cut him off and said that the jury should only listen to what he said in that, yes, he made these statements to defend himself. So Trump really having to walk a fine line there. The judge very much controlling what he said. And then E. Jean Carroll's attorneys got their chance to ask him questions. They were only able to get one through asking him if he attended and was aware that there was a previous trial in this case. He said that he didn't know there was a trial in the case. His attorneys came back to him and asked him if he had an attorney representing him at that other trial. He said he did. They wanted to ask another question. The judge cut that off. So he - the judge really kept this under control. A big contrast to when Trump was on the stand just a few weeks ago in the civil fraud trial where he was campaigning from the witness stand. That did not happen today.",

Primarily a credit to the federal judge here who kept the command of his courtroom made Alina Habba commit to a plan ahead of time, kept her and her client to stick to that plan while he was on the stand and then wrapped it up and moved it along. But also, Alina Habba and former president, Trump, they could have easily tried to play more at the edges of this, tried to say a little bit more before the judge cut in. So, again, people weren't sure if he was going to take the stand, but everyone seemed to think he was going to make a scene like what we saw just a few weeks ago in state court, but that's not what happened here. She got in her three quarters, exactly as she told the judge she would. And he answered them, though he did call her outside the lines a little bit. That was stricken from the record.

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna. I think it was very significant testimony, although it was brief, it was very important, so the question becomes why. When you ask the question, did you view the allegations as false and you say yes, it's an indication that you were acting in good faith. It's your view, it's your perception as to the statements being false. That's number one, very important, going to the issue of punitive damages, which are designed to punish what this is all about.And then you pivot to other questions. For example, did you at all, right, direct anybody to give the indication or to pile on or anything else, the answer being no. Then you ask the question, right, which was previous to that, which really is about what was this about. You were responding. You weren't affirmatively trying to trash or impugn anyone's reputation. The nature of the comments you made were in response to your defending of yourself. You couple that with saying, hey, what other people may have done on social media, Brianna, they may have done. But that was not at the behest of me, it was not at the direction of me and, therefore, I should not be held accountable. And so that's the essence of the defense. That's why these statements were important that the president got out. And the fact that he stayed within the parameters while surprising is very important. Because I think it shows the jury some semblance of respect for the process, which they certainly can take into consideration in evaluating the amount of damages to award. And real quick, Joey, what did you think about the cross? Look, I mean, at the end of the day, crosses are important because what you want to do is you want to try to impugn a person, right, and really get at the fact that this is about going after someone maliciously. It's about doing something purposely. It's about engaging in misconduct. The fact that you're so limited on cross, though, and that's not really a full cross where you can attack a witness, I think that goes to the detriment really of the plaintiff because you really want to get at the witness. You couldn't because the questions were so limiting, Brianna.",

Sources tell CNN that meantime, the Biden team is cheering on the Haley-Trump feud, hoping that it forces the Trump team to use up some resources before the general election. Biden stumped a short time ago, pushing his record on the economy in the critical swing state of Wisconsin.

Take a look here, pure Independents, 41 percent of them have an unfavorable view of both. My goodness gracious. Now, you mentioned that word dreaded. And there was a great poll question that was asked late last year, feelings about a Biden-Trump rematch, dreading it or looking forward to it. Dreading it wins the day with 50 percent, just 47 percent of folks are looking forward to it. But again, look at independents, Boris, who, of course, are so key in elections. We're - once we get past that primary season, 61 percent of Independents are dreading this potential matchup compared to just 35 percent were looking forward to it.
