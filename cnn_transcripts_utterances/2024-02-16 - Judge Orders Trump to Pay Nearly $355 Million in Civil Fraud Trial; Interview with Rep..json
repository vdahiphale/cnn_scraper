And worth noting, Congressman, of course, it was Oversight testimony -- Oversight Committee testimony of Michael Cohen, former fixer of the former president. You were among those who questioned him back in 2019 where he testified that Trump had inflated his assets.It was really the origin story of what is culminating today with a judge ordering Trump to pay nearly $355 million in this civil fraud trial. What's your reaction to this order? REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): I think it's appropriate. It's a natural and logical extension of what happened back in February 2019. And that day is etched in my memory. Michael Cohen came before our committee and told us point blank that Donald Trump routinely inflated his assets for purposes of loans. In that case, I think he talked about a loan that Donald Trump was trying to get to buy the Buffalo Bills. And he talked about how Donald Trump would also inflate his net worth to get onto the Forbes wealthiest people list and then deflate his assets for purposes of real estate taxes.",

The congressman there thinking that this could affect how Donald Trump is going to conduct himself.If, you know, you have someone where this mask is kind of dropped now on, he was a successful businessman, cultivated that image, and now that's kind of been yanked down.

      "sentences": "Donald Trump can be a disciplined messenger when he chooses to be. So if we look at the Jean Carroll court case, once that decision was made, he's put out two statements about the decision. He did not criticize her in those statements. Very clearly, he wanted to avoid doing that to, you know, not draw any more ire from the judge or any more penalties potentially. So he can do that. He does have that capability. He usually chooses not to.And yes, we know sort of the Mad Libs word soup that comes from Donald Trump on any of these statements. We all could have written this. AI certainly could have written it. But there's a difference. We know Donald Trump has an ability to control news cycles anytime he wants to. So we're not talking about Navalny right now. We're not following Joe Biden's visit to East Palestine. This is all about Donald Trump. The difference being that this is really bad news for him. It's not just something that can be lumped into, I think, to anybody credibly viewing this, you know, two-tiered system of justice. And just one last thing on this. The Republican primary was over the minute most of Donald Trump's opponents raised their hand and said, if Donald Trump is convicted, I'd still support him. That was game over. And Trump knew that. So this is bad news for Donald Trump. It's bad news for messaging to independent voters, certainly. But the primary, regardless of what Nikki Haley says on this, which will probably be strong, it doesn't change what's happened in the primary, because all of his opponents, say basically Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson, said long ago, all of this is fine.",

A major decision by Judge Arthur Engoron in New York in Donald Trump's civil fraud trial.The former president ordered to pay upwards of $350 million in that case and in disgorgement penalties. The judge essentially finding that Donald Trump was liable for fraud and installing effectively a babysitter to oversee the financial dealings of his company. We have CNN's Paula Reid to walk us through the details. You've been looking at a very long filing by Judge Engoron. What stands out to you most, Paula?",

      "sentences": "All right, Boris, you laid out the financial hit that the former president and his organization is taking. But let's look at some of the other penalties here. Starting with the former president.The judge here barring Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years. He's also barred from applying for loans from banks that are registered in New York for three years. But I want to note the judge did not dissolve Trump's business certificates for the Trump Organization. The so-called corporate death penalty is something that the attorney general had sought. But clearly, the judge did not agree. I want to note that that is something that is rarely handed down in the state of New York. And when it has been, usually there is a clear victim. And one line of the Trump defense here was that there was no obvious victim. They argued that these businesses got their money. They continue doing business and that there was again, this is a victimless crime, even though they might argue that it wasn't a crime. Now, let's go on. When it comes to monitoring, you talked about the so-called babysitter. The official independent monitor has been in place since 2022 for the Trump Organization, making sure that they are in compliance with business regulations and laws that will continue, according to this order, for another three years. Now, the judge also saying that the company needs to pay for another person, an independent director of compliance, again, to help make sure that that company is in compliance with rules and laws. And it appears that would extend even beyond the life of the monitor. Now, what makes this case so personal. It does, of course, strike at the heart of who Trump reports to be a successful New York businessman. It's also his family business. And three of his adult children testified in this case. And there are penalties for his two adult sons, too. The judge found Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump liable for a host of civil fraud in New York, including issuing false financial statements, falsifying business records and conspiracy. Now, they're each ordered to pay $4 million from their personal profits for the fraud. And they are also barred as serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation for two years. And it was interesting. The judge really took note of the lack of remorse or contrition from the Trump Organization. Saying, quote, their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological. So it does appear that the approach, the conduct of the former president, at least two of his children, the combative nature of the way they opted to proceed here did not pay off when it came to this ruling. But as we know, the Trump Organization does intend to appeal this.",
