Many Democrats feel like he should never have sought a second term to begin with. They think that he should have sort of bowed out after the midterms in 2022. And the fact that he only stepped aside about 100 days before the election put Kamala Harris in essentially an impossible position, and that she eventually lost because she wasn't given the time to really introduce herself to the American people. That's certainly a view among some Democrats, it's not a universally held view. And actually, when you talk to allies of Biden, they think that he could have potentially performed better, particularly when you look at some of the demographics that Kamala Harris lost. So, certainly, a lot of finger-pointing about how this election was lost. In some ways, those questions are masking the bigger questions of how Democrats lost so many elements of the coalition that they needed to win this election, and that has a lot more to do about the Democratic Party as a whole. But what you heard from President Biden there really kind of papered over all of those questions. He is very much focused on ensuring this smooth transition to power. He did speak to the President-elect Donald Trump yesterday. He's invited him to come visit at the White House, that could happen as early as next week. Of course, the subtext to the conversation about transition and smooth transition of power, peaceful transition of power is that President Biden was not afforded that four years ago.",

Of course, talking about the accomplishments that he was able to achieve during office. And it was interesting, he said, that a lot of those things won't be seen for years, potentially for 10 years. And you could almost hear Democrats kind of gritting their teeth when he said that, because while that may have been great policy, it certainly wasn't great politics if he had hoped to be elected or if he had hoped to help his Vice President be elected.

As I just said, he knew it was the right thing to do, and I would want to say as well, is that if you look at the four years, almost three -- well, three-plus years, there are some historic accomplishments that they were able to do together, whether it's beating big pharma, and now Medicare is able to negotiate. Now, whether it's getting a bipartisan infrastructure law, whether it's the Pact Act, the bipartisan infrastructure, the CHIPS and Science Act -- thank you so much -- these are things that were able to get us out of the pandemic. And you heard me say at the top that the President is proud to leave the strongest economy for the next person that's coming, for the President-elect, and that's what they're going to inherit. But with all of that said, and this gets to your question, despite all of the accomplishments that we were able to get done, there were global headwinds that -- because of the COVID-19 pandemic, obviously COVID-19 led to disruptions with the supply chain, and it had a political toll on many incumbents. If you look at what happened in 2024, globally, and that's what you -- that's part of what you saw, right? You saw that there was a political toll on incumbent parties around the world here. Now, to be very mindful and leave the political analysis to the pundits, they're going to dig in. They're going to look under the hood. They're going to see exactly what happened.

We have to remember what happened in 2022.   Twenty-twenty-two is a perfect example actually, because when we came out of 2022 Midterms, we saw a successful Midterms from -- for any new administration in over 60 years. And it was because of the president's policies. Let's not forget that all of the accomplishments that the President did -- again, I had listed the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act. Those are popular with the American people, yes, those policies were indeed popular. And that's what got us through the 2022 Midterm, there was supposed to be a red wave that didn't happen. And so, coming out of that, we did see some historic markers there.

At the absolute worst case, Isa, if he follows through on mass immigration limits, if he follows through on the mass global tariffs, we are expecting growth to be slower. Economists agree we could see inflation around one percentage point higher next year. That will simply slow the Federal Reserve down, and the market's already sort of moving in that direction.
