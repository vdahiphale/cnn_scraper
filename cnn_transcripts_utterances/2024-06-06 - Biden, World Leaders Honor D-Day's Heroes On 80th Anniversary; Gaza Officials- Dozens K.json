Like he's kind of just realized it's so incredibly hostile in Manhattan that they're, of course, they're going to be efficient on this thing. So at the end of the day, I don't know that president Trump is known for packing heat too often but I would say the safest route in the long run is don't give a creative prosecutor any sort of avenue, right?

And the fact that she's having hearings instead of ruling on the papers should be something that went -- whoever the person is, but particularly a presidential candidate, we should -- we should welcome that. We should say, let's air it all out. Let's have the public and the attorneys, they're airing it out. The only thing that's unusual about all the stuff that I've heard is, in fact, having amicus brief. Participants do argument as opposed to just submitting the briefs. That could -- you could read the tea leaves and think that might show that she's kind of struck by the amicus filing by former Attorney General Ed Meese and some folks with him that really question the whole constitutionality of the special prosecutor statute.",

On cross-examination, she actually testified that she couldn't really remember where she saw the drug paraphernalia. She said it was more of a drug residue, but most importantly for the defense, she testified that she never witnessed Hunter doing drugs or even drinking wine. Now, I was in the court for this testimony, Jake, and I can tell you the jurors were very attentive throughout her entire appearance on the stage. Now, look, they were cognizant of the fact that they were once in-laws, then they were romantic partners, he introduced Hallie Biden to crack cocaine, so its very salacious story.
