I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Now is the time for intense diplomacy, that's what the White House says as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepares to travel to Beijing this weekend, hoping to thaw their very chilly standoff. It follows his other diplomatic trip last week to the Middle East, where reality is beginning to bite. That region sees the United States pulling back from its historical security role, shifting its strategic gaze to China. And so, that's making room for other players, like Saudi Arabia. From signing global soccer superstars to starting up a major new golf tour to hosting Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelenskyy and getting Beijing to broker a new diplomatic deal with Iran. Meanwhile, top Iranian officials having been meeting with Europeans this week. We get insight into all of these moving parts with Middle East expert and former senior advisory at the State Department, Vali Nasr. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But there are at least some positive signs compared to what we have encountered in the past,and that is, for instance, that Iran and Saudi Arabia decided that it's in the interest of the region and their own national interest to bury the hatchet, find a way to work together, similarly between the UAE and Iran, between Saudi Arabia and Turkey, between UAE and Israel. Things are not solved, but at least the region is taking some ownership of how to fix things, and that's a positive track. On the other hand, we're also seeing the United States being more interested in diplomacy than war in this region for pragmatic reasons, like right now, it's trying to talk to Iran as a way of trying to contain its nuclear program, it's trying to work with Saudi Arabia on oil issues. So, what we are seeing is that everybody is trying to not get into conflict in the Middle East, not to fix things through conflict but through positive engagement. Now, this is a steep hill. There's a lot of issues in the region. There is too much poverty, too much unemployment, too much authoritarianism, too many bad guys, too much corruption, we still have broken states in Yemen. And Syria, we still have Bashar al-Assad. We still have problems with Iran. We still have leftovers of what happened in Iran in the past few months. We have tensions between Iran and Israel. We have Iranian nuclear threats. All of these things are there. So, the problems haven't gone away.",

It would give Iran more meaningful and lasting economic relief. It could permanently, not temporarily, contain Iran's nuclear program, and it might reduce Tehran's support for troublesome militias in the region. In doing so, such a deal could bring more stability to a part of the world that sorely needs it. Why do you think, A, that kind of original deal would be attractive to Iran?

The issue of dual nationals or foreign nationals in prisonin Iran is a matter of barter for money or for their own prisoners. So, there's been negotiations with the U.S. through the Cataris (ph) over the release of the three Iranian American prisoners, including Siamak Namazi, who was on your own program, in exchange for $7 billion of Iranian money that are frozen in South Korea plus some other things. So, I think the Iranian government is -- now that it feels a little confident that the protests in the streets are not the way they were, they are making an example of these cases as a way of deterring repetition. I mean, we read about these journalists, but at the same time, as we're talking, the Iranian universities have been told to expel any professor or student who has been seen on a video, and now, they have also facial recognition, et cetera, that has been seen during the protests, without possibility of being hired again. All is with the view of not only purging the universities now but also putting a marker for the next time that something like this happens that students or professors will think twice before they tweet or show up at protests. So, it's a very, very heavy hand with a government that basically doesn't think it's going to lose anything by doing these things because unlike, let's say, Saudis or Turks or others, there's no equities in the West. It already has a pariah status. And its highest priority is survival. And for that survival it needs to intimidate the population and it's using the judicial system to do that right now.",

Also, it's released satellite image that we're showing of a plant location of a purported drone manufacturing plant inside Russia that the U.S. believes Iran is supplying the material to build this drone plant. How much of a threat is it to the U.S., to its regional interests, and obviously, to the war in Ukraine that Iran appears to be forming an axis of, whatever, anti-U.S., anti-NATO, with Russia and China?

And I want, you know, the world to look at this like refugees are not the issue, they are not the problem. We are the result of other issues, and people should take really like deep look about what are these issues, whether it's global warming, whether it's like war and crimes and people hate and sometimes even like clothes (ph) and, you know, like it's a lot of things, but we're not the problem, we're not the issue. You know, we are one of the consequences of so many other issues, and that's why people should look and where they find different solutions.",

Like I like was introduced, I would say, to the world after \"For Sama.\" But within that, I was carrying on my shoulders a very heavy like responsibility, you know, like within everything happened in Syria, within my personal survival, I needed to tell the world what crimes I've been witnessed, what things happened. I wanted to change something. And for me, like, within this film, like I'm very proud. I can't be even like more proud of myself that now, in my career, as a refugee director, I was able to do a film like this in over like 10 countries with people who speaks so many languages with an amazing crew who supported me, and that's -- I think, it's another message, you know, like behind the film that refugee should be on the table, refugees should give and be able to give what they can do.",

It's a way to build community, it's a way to build connections within these groups. And, you know, I think it's proven as ways to help deal with mental illness in certain cases. So, sport can be therapy in and of itself. You know, it's a way to really create connections, you know, anywhere in the world.
