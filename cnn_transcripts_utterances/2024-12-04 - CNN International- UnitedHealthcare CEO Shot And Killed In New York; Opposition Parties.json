And we begin with breaking news in New York City. That's where police say that the CEO of UnitedHealthcare was shot and killed outside a midtown hotel this morning. Investigators say that it appears to be a targeted attack. They tell CNN that the gunman was lying in wait for the victim, who you see here, CEO Brian Thompson, and fired multiple times, as Thompson made his way to a company conference at the New York Hilton. We're going to take you to these live pictures now. As you can see, the police presence in midtown Manhattan. We know that Thompson was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later. We're told that the shooter ran from the scene, then got on a bike, and right now, police still searching for that gunman. We do expect a police press conference in about 30 minutes. We will, of course, take you there once it starts. But, in the meantime, I want to welcome in former Washington, D.C. Police Chief and CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst, Charles Ramsey. Commissioner, you were also the Philadelphia Police Commissioner, among other roles. Great to have you today. Having led some of the nation's largest police forces, what can you tell us about what investigators are doing right now? What's the priority? CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST, &amp; FMR. WASHINGTON, D.C. POLICE CHIEF: The top priority is to find the individual responsible for the shooting, and they're going through video right now. It's downtown Manhattan, so -- or midtown Manhattan. So, you've got a lot of cameras in that area, business cameras, NYPD cameras, cameras on busses. Some cabs even have cameras. They'll be looking to see if they can identify the suspect and their direction of flight. Now, they do know part of the direction of flight, and he wound up in Central Park. I don't know if they were able to maintain tracking him there or not. But, this looks like he -- not only was it targeted, but he also had his escape route plan, fled on foot, got on a bicycle. He knows the area. And so, this is an individual right now that is being sought after. He is at large. He is very dangerous, obviously, and the police are doing everything they can to try to identify and apprehend them. I know people want to know about a motive. Police will be working on a motive, but priority number one is catching him.",

Did he walk into the hotel to see whether or not the target was in the hotel? If so, you certainly have video there. They were able to get a pretty good description of this individual that they're looking for, white male, dressed in all black, including a black hoodie, great backpack, black gym shoes with a white stripe. So, people got a pretty good look at the individual. Now, he was wearing a mask, which is not unusual for this time of the year, and being cold and all, but they have enough to at least have an idea of a suspect that they're looking for in terms of making a stop.And so, they're using right now technology. They're interviewing witnesses. They're doing everything they possibly can and find out whether or not, was this directed at this individual for a personal reason? Was this someone who may have had a beef with the insurance company, knowing he is the CEO, and taking it out on that person? We just don't know the answer to any of that. And so, there is a lot of work that needs to be done. But, in half an hour, police will brief you on what they're able to give out publicly at this point.",

It's not something that you have a lot of control over, but you do try to keep the identity of the individual quiet for as long as you can.But, he is well known. I mean, he is the CEO of a major company. He is the one that was shot. One of the witnesses may have seen him and knew who he was right away, reported that to the media. That information gets out. If the family did not know, that's very unfortunate, but sometimes that does happen. But, it is a challenge to try to get the family members notified prior to the release of the name of a victim. It is more challenging we have a high-profile individual than you would have if it's not such a high-profile person.",

Brynn, give us a sense of what you're seeing there.BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Rahel. I just got to the scene, and of course, it's -- as you can imagine, it is flooded with investigators. I want to keep you up to date on what information we are learning, every minute, really, of this investigation. As we're learning, it is preliminary, but still, details are coming out. Our Mark Morales has learned that the police believe a silencer was used in this attack, and that sort of jives with something that we will learn from a garage -- parking garage worker who, one of our colleagues spoke to, who said they were working inside that garage right across the street from the entrance of this hotel, and someone ran in and said someone was shot, but nobody heard any gunshots. So, of course, I'm sure police are trying to speak to the people, the witnesses that are in this area at this moment, in addition to, like you said, a giant manhunt happening in the middle of New York City and beyond. So, what we've learned from investigators, to update all your viewers, is that Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was coming to this hotel, that's here behind me, the Hilton Hotel, about 06:45 this morning, arriving for a conference that was expected to happen in that ballroom. That conference, we're learning, has been canceled, of course, and we're told through sources that this gunman was possibly waiting outside the entrance for about 10 minutes or so before Thompson arrived, and when he did, authorities believe he fired several shots at Thompson from about 20 feet away, sources telling our John Miller, killing him. What we've also learned, sources telling John Miller, that that gunman then fled down a back alley, onto a bicycle, and sources telling me that they went in the direction of Central Park. So, now that is the route they have so far, what we've learned. You can imagine, they are pulling video cameras from this heavily trafficked area of midtown Manhattan, trying to piece together like a puzzle, exactly, possibly, where this person is or went, rather, but also who this person is. We've learned from sources that they may have been wearing a mask, which, of course, could be hindering some of this investigation. So, a lot of details are coming in. I'm going to get out of the way really quick so you can just kind of see the scene here. And you could see the NYPD crime scene unit truck on the scene. You can see a lot of investigators here. One thing I did notice, Rahel, as I was running over here from our headquarters, is that there -- this is a hotel that takes up really, about a half of a city avenue, which is quite a lot of real estate in the middle of New York City. And there are several entrances to this hotel. So, that's probably something investigators also realize. And it kind of points to more how investigators do believe this was some sort of targeted attack against Thompson. So, a lot of details that they are combing through, and we hope to actually learn a lot more when the NYPD holds a news conference that's scheduled for about 11:30 noon today, and we'll have a lot of questions, and hopefully get some answers to those questions as to what took place here this morning.",

I was just having a conversation with Commissioner Ramsey, and I asked about, does it complicate things when you have so many people in an area when a crime happens? And he says, actually, it can help, because you have more potential witnesses. Talk to us about the conversations that we believe police may be having with those who would have been in the area.",

As I said, there is multiple entrances to the hotel. This isn't exactly one of the main ones. The main one would be on Sixth Avenue when we're on 54th Street. So, it's sort of a side entrance. So, unclear who was on the sidewalk? If it was people heading to work, not minding their own business? But, not really exactly the place where you would pick up a cab, so to speak, here in New York. You would probably do that at the main entrance. So, not clear how many tourists might have been sort of hanging out, or other people.What our colleague did learn from that garage worker, like I said, the garage is right across the street, which is -- there is a theater right across the street as well, is that they didn't hear anything. They just -- someone had run in and said that someone had been shot. Now, whether that person witnessed it or saw it themselves, it's unclear, but these are the conversations, the questions that are being asked right now, I imagine, by investigators, let alone from the fact, Rahel. Remember that he was headed to a conference for UnitedHealthcare. So, you can imagine there was a number of people possibly inside that ballroom who might be able to provide some sort of insight as to why maybe Thompson might have been targeted, or at least, kind of get some more information from those people as well. So, there is a lot of work to do for police, in addition to trying to find this suspect. SOLOMON: Absolutely, and certainly a lot of questions. Brynn, we know that you are working your sources within the department and also awaiting that press conference. So, we'll let you go to continue your work. But, Brynn, thank you.",

How do you see this playing out, I mean, the likelihood that he resigns, or maybe want to have his day in court? TROY STANGARONE, DIR. OF HYUNDAI MOTOR-KOREA FDN., CTR. FOR KOREAN HISTORY AND PUBLIC POLICY: So, Yoon's personality is to want to try and push through this. It doesn't preclude the possibility. Eventually, the pressure builds for him to resign. But, I think we will go through the impeachment process. We've seen right now all of the opposition assigned as co-sponsors. So, that's 191 votes. They only need to find nine more to impeach him. As we've seen, you already had 18 in his party voted against the martial law approach. So, I think there is going to be likely the votes within his own political party to take and remove him from office. They need to get there. They're talking about trying to remove him from the party itself. But, I think it's going to be hard for him to say. The complication is going to be any impeachment has to be approved by the Constitutional Court. And right now, it requires seven justices to hear the case. There are currently only six. And so, I think there is going to be questions about whether it would be legal to remove him based on the number of seats on the Constitution Court right now.",

Our warriors never back down, and neither do I.\"But, having gone through this process already with Matt Gaetz for Attorney General, and wanting to make sure that the President-elect is in position to name a replacement if Hegseth does back out, they are now starting to consider some names, and yes, Ron DeSantis is one of them. He is someone who has a military background. He has been the leader of a large state. He also has been a vocal defender of Trump in the past, on Fox and such. So, he is someone who does check a lot of boxes, but he has this pass with the seat with Trump, and as well with many people who work for Trump. And so, it will be interesting to see how those two things are able to gel. Now, I will point out, Hegseth will be on Fox today, where he will try to continue to make the case for himself. And also, his mother appeared on Fox earlier today, trying to talk back -- or take back a letter that she put out to her son, accusing him of a record of abuse with women. Take a listen to how she described that episode. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PENELOPE HEGSETH, PETE HEGSETH'S MOTHER: I wrote that out of love, and about two hours later, I retracted it with an apology email, but nobody has seen that. He is a changed man, and I just hope people will get to know who Pete is today, especially our dear female senators, that you would listen to him, listen with your heart to the truth of Pete. I wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't believe he is the man for the job. Pete and I are both warriors, and we've -- I've developed a really tough skin over the years. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, the complicating factors with Hegseth might push that back, and that might be -- and that might even be more complicated if he is replaced.One area, though, that was a potential hurdle was a question of whether or not the Trump transition team would have access to background checks from the FBI. Well, that was resolved in the last 24 hours where the Trump transition team signed a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Justice, getting them access to FBI background checks, which, I am told, and we are told at CNN, is one of the concerns about Hegseth from some of the Senate Republicans who want to see those FBI background checks before committing to some of these more controversial nominees.",

Now, so far, we haven't heard directly from President Biden. He only spoke about this very briefly when he told reporters traveling with him yesterday that he would be briefed on the matter. That is something that happened while he was here in Angola. But, U.S. officials have been expressing concern as this was playing out, and still, even after Yoon lifted the martial law following that vote from the parliament to block it. So, we will see how exactly President Biden might respond when he arrives back in the U.S.But, this is something that the U.S. government is incredibly concerned about, given the fact that South Korea is a key ally of the United States. President Biden has gone to great lengths to try to foster that relationship with the country, but also directly with President Yoon, as he has sought to build relationships in the Indo- Pacific to try to serve as a counter to China. But, there are also more than 28,000 American troops who are stationed in South Korea. So, there are these long ties between the two countries. One thing that we heard from Secretary of State Antony Blinken a bit earlier today is they want to see a peaceful resolution to this situation. But, he also said that they want South Korea to be able to be held up as a symbol of a successful democracy. That is something that he said that they have done for the past 30 or 40 years, and he is hoping that that won't change in this matter. But, we will see what further the White House has to say, as officials, both here in Angola and officials back in the U.S., were scrambling all day yesterday to figure out what had happened, and now they're trying to assess what's going to happen next.",

Specifically, he touted the Lobito Corridor. That is an 800-mile unfinished railway project which is aiming to take critical minerals from the interior countries in Africa out to the ports for exporting, exports that could go directly to the United States. Today, the President was in Lobito, Angola, touring the port terminal there, and also, he sat down with the leaders of four of the countries that are part of that corridor. That's Angola, Zambia, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo. All of these moves from the U.S. come as they're trying to make inroads into Africa at a time when China has had growing influence here. They have poured more than hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure projects across the continent through its Belt and Road Initiative. President Biden, at various points of the trip, took some swipes at China, not specifically mentioning them by name, but saying that the U.S. provides a better alternative. Take a listen.

This morning, at 06Mr. Thompson was removed by EMS to Roosevelt Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 07:12 a.m. Mr. Thompson is the CEO of UnitedHealthcare and resides in Minnesota. Detectives from Night Watch, Midtown North Detector Squad, and Manhattan South Homicide responded to the scene and began their investigation. What we know is that the shooter arrived at the location on foot about five minutes prior to the victim's arrival. He stands alongside the building line, as numerous other people and pedestrians pass him by. From video, we see at 06:44 a.m. the victim is walking alone towards the Hilton after exiting his hotel across the street. We believe the victim was headed to the Hilton Hotel to attend the UnitedHealth Group Investors Conference that was scheduled to start at 08:00 a.m. The shooter appears to be a light skinned male. He is wearing a light brown or cream colored jacket, a black face mask, black and white sneakers, and a very distinctive gray backpack. The shooter steps onto the sidewalk from behind the car. He ignores numerous other pedestrians, approaches the victim from behind, and shoots him in the back. The shooter then walks toward the victim and continues to shoot. It appears that the gun now functions, as he clears the jam and begins to fire again. The shooter then flees on foot northbound into an alleyway between 54th Street and 55th Street. Once at West 55th Street, the shooter continues to walk westbound on the avenue in Americas, where he gets onto an electric e-city bike and rides northbound on the avenue of Americas towards Central Park, where at 06:48 a.m. we have the shooter riding this bike into Central Park at Center Drive. At the scene, we recover three live nine millimeter rounds and three discharged nine millimeter shell casings. The motive for this murder currently is unknown, but based on the evidence we have so far, it does appear that the victim was specifically targeted, but at this point we do not know why. This does not appear to be a random act of violence. We are seeking information from the public to help identify the shooter. As the commissioner said, we have upped the reward up to $10,000 for information. You're urged to contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS. All information will be kept anonymous.
