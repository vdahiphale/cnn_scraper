And the United States, President Biden shared an uplifting Christmas message to Americans.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: And too often we see each other as enemies, not as neighbors, not as fellow Americans. So my hope this Christmas season is that we take a few moments of quiet reflection, find that stillness in the heart of Christmas, and look at each other. That's who we really are, fellow Americans, fellow human beings worthy of being treated with dignity and respect. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And so back in the Vatican, where Pope Francis kicked off the CatholicHoly Year, known as a Jubilee, the ceremonial opening of the holy door at St. Peter's Basilica.

The Jubilee is ancient tradition which is focused on forgiveness and pilgrimage, and during the year, 35 million people are expected to travel to Rome. The Pope began the Jubilee with the opening of the holy door in St. Peter's Basilica, which is normally cemented shut but has been opened for this special celebration.The Pope was wheeled up to the door. It opened and pilgrims filed in behind him, touching the bronze panels as is tradition. According to Catholic teaching, those who carry out certain spiritual, charitable acts and go through a holy door will receive an indulgence which is related to the forgiveness of sins. The Pope is hoping this Jubilee can bring hope to a troubled world, and in his Christmas Eve homily, said he wanted the Jubilee to be a time where peace and justice reign. And the Pope has also called for the Jubilee to be a time when richer countries forgive the debts of poorer nations and for prisoners to be offered amnesties or pardons. The day after Christmas, the Pope will travel to Rebibbia Prison on the outskirts of Rome and become the first Pope to open a Holy door in a prison, something that he hopes sends a message to governments across the globe. Now, this Jubilee year is likely to test the stamina of the 88-year- old pontiff. He is determined that the message of the jubilee should resonate across the globe. Christopher Lamb, CNN, London.",

What we have in Syria is as a phase where, you know, many things can happen, which is quite different as compared to what we had under the Assad regime. And what we saw was a. A tree was burned by some. Some individuals that apparently were not Syrian, according to the new authorities. But the new authorities could have just left it, right? They didn't. They sent a representative to the community, condemned it, so that the perpetrators would be punished, which is good.

When it came into land, as you can see, the plane is basically going, losing control, going up and down in all sorts of fashions, suggesting control issues until it comes in to land. And it's an emergency landing that it's making. The pilot's valiantly attempting to keep control until the plane does hit the ground, which we are not showing, of course, because it's at the moment which people perished, the fireball which subsequently engulfed the aircraft.But as video shows, we have video of the aftermath and showing the wreckage. And extraordinarily more than 20, well, 25 people survived, of which 22 are believed to be in hospital. In total, there were 67 souls on board the Azerbaijan plane. We'll have more details and when we get them, we'll bring them to you. To Ukraine now, where Ukraine says Russia has launched aerial attacks across the country. No Christmas respite. Russia's used missiles and drones and hit residential building and civilian infrastructure. At least one person's been killed and at least six people injured. Officials say Russia's also targeted the energy infrastructure on a massive scale, causing blackouts in several regions on Christmas morning. Ukrainians are therefore doing their best to celebrate this holiday as the war continues. It was brave carolers, not only the war, but the cold, who sang in Kyiv outside a giant lit Christmas tree, hoping and welcoming a brighter future. And Christmas Eve services themselves. They were marred by the wails of air raid sirens as Russia launched air attacks, including a deadly missile strike in Khariva. President Zelensky has insisted that Ukrainians are not giving up hope for their country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (voiceover): This is the sound of a miracle. This is the sound of life. This is the sound of Christmas. This is our third Christmas during wartime. Our great Ukrainian family cannot fully celebrate it the way we would like to, the way it should be celebrated. Not all of us are home, unfortunately. Sadly, not everyone has a home. And tragically, not everyone is with us yet, despite all the hardships brought by the enemy, they have failed to take or destroy what matters most. Our hearts, the light within us, our faith in goodness and mercy, and the humanity that lives in each of us. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
