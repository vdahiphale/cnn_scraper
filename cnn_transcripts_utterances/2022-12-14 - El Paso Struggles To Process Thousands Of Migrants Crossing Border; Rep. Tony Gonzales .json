(on camera): The average number of migrants arriving here in El Paso has been about 2,500 a day. And because of that, many people here, city leaders in El Paso are concerned about what this could look like if Title 42 is lifted next week. (voice-over): The public health policy known as Title 42, which was used during the pandemic to remove some 2.5 million migrants from the U.S. is set to expire next week. But for many migrants, the talk of Title 42 isn't on their minds. Well (ph) and Reina (ph) of Alaska has left Nicaragua six weeks ago with their nine-year-old girl. (on camera): He said they came they were unaware of Title 42 and the Title 42 could be lifted. So they really just want to come here to work for a couple of years and go back home to Nicaragua.

But that's just a drop in the bucket. A large part of this is stigma. You know, mental health is creeping in all parts of our society. Border Patrol agents are no different. They're just having to deal with these horrific incidents, not to mention many of the people coming over illegally, I get it, they're seeking a better life for themselves. But you're having to pull babies out of the water and just deal all kinds of different issues that is certainly impacting our border patrol agents.

This suspect, 42-year-old David DePape stands accused of assaulting Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He faces charges of attempted murder as well as assault. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges. And in court today, we learned that one of the officers who interviewed the suspect said that the suspect confessed to all of this. And so, again, a lot of new details about what the suspect was allegedly planning. And of course, Jake, when you look at the list of these targets, there's no question that this appears to be a politically motivated attack. The suspect allegedly also talked to police about Hillary Clinton, of course, the former Secretary of State telling authorities that the evil in Washington, quote, \"originates with Hillary Clinton.\" And of course, this is what we've heard from law enforcement sources throughout the last past few years that they are concerned about that there are people out there who are on the receiving end of so much of this vitriol. So many of these conspiracy theories, they are concerned that they could be ticking time bombs just waiting to act on those beliefs with violence, as we saw in the case when Nancy Pelosi. And finally it's worth pointing out that people might say, well, look at this target list, this is aspirational. The Biden's and the Clintons are protected by the Secret Service. Of course, Governor -- California's Governor Gavin Newsom, he has a security detail from the California Highway Patrol. But look, no further than that Pelosi attack itself. The House Speaker was not there. She was out of town. But it was her husband who of course was so severely injured, he could have been killed.

Congressman, what's your (INAUDIBLE) new group, this law firm that fights to block Biden administration programs that are trying to remedy racial and gender disparities? REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D), SOUTH CAROLINA: Well, thank you very much for having me. Look, I have been saying now, for more than a dozen years that I did check throughout the country and in a lot of legislative halls, attempts to turn back the clock. I just finished today, a mock up in the Veterans Affairs Committee of two African Americans who came home after World War II. One of them was while in uniform was blinded by a local police officer here in South Carolina, took a bit of a stick and pushed his eyes out, deny any kind of assistance from the veterans, the so-called GI Bill. Maddox (ph), up in New York, was admitted to Harvard University, was not allowed to get veterans benefits, because they did not want to set a precedent. That's what has been going on since the 1940s. And we moved to correct that in this country with the Civil Rights Act of 64, the Voting Rights Act of 65, the Fair Housing Law of 68. These things were done to correct traditional discrimination that are taking place against black folks. Now, we knew, in fact, I used to run the South Carolina Commission For Farmworkers. The veterans -- I'm sorry -- the Agriculture Department, but discriminating against black farmers. And all the records show it, depicts the case is replete with it. And Biden administration move to correct that. And now they're saying you've been unfair to white people. That is why today, there are eight less African Americans in the South Carolina legislature than they were in the past legislature. Because these laws are now making it fair game to discriminate. So Miller knows what he's doing. They think they've got enough people on the Supreme Court to back up what they're doing. And so that's what's going on here. I would hope the media will not allow this to go unchecked.",
