President Biden meets with the leaders of South Korea and Japan ahead of his final meeting with China's President Xi Jinping at the APEC Summit in Peru. Controversial contest. 58-year-old former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson fights 27-year- old YouTuber Jake Paul on Netflix. And escape the country. The U.S. has seen a spike in people looking to leave. So, what is driving the surge in interest? We'll speak to a company that helps Americans move abroad. That conversation, coming up. But first, President-Elect Donald Trump continues to build his incoming administration with polarizing figures. He picked North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum to run the Interior Department. Burgum challenged Trump for the Republican nomination, but avoided criticizing him on the trail. Trump also selected his defense lawyer, Todd Blanche, to be the deputy attorney general. Blanche was Trump's lead attorney in the New York hush money case. Well, meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson says he will ask the Ethics Committee not to release a report on former Congressman Matt Gaetz. The Senate Judiciary Committee asked for the report after Trump chose him for attorney general. CNN has learned the Trump transition team is bypassing traditional FBI background checks for at least some of his cabinet picks. And they're using a private company instead.

Lee Zeldin at the EPA. Even Doug Burgum, I think, is a fairly conventional Republican pick at interior, someone who will, you know, prioritize energy development. But then you have the whole other category, the kind of shock and awe candidates who -- nominees whose qualifications and character and fitness for the job are just so far out of historical bounds. The defense secretary nominee, Hegseth, Matt Gates at the -- as the attorney general, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at HHS, Tulsi Gabbard as the chief intelligence officer, someone who is so closely connected in positive comments to the Russian -- to Putin and the Russian government. I mean, these nominations seem to me designed precisely to evoke the reaction that they have to be as outrageous as they seem. And I think Trump -- you know, Trump, if nothing else, is a great student of human weakness. And I think he is very clearly testing in these initial nominations, how far he can push Republican senators into doing things they could not have imagined, you know, on the day before, voting for Matt Gaetz as attorney general, because each surrender, as I've written, paves the way to the next. And if he can push them on this, he can push them on their appointments, he can push them on policy, he can push them on the kind of violations of norms that you mentioned in your intro about dispensing with FBI background checks.",

They areadult conspiracy theory, you know, kind of nonsense with a dangerous edge. The Federal -- CDC, the Center for Disease Control, which would be one of the agencies that he would have authority over, if he did become HHS secretary, reported last year that compliance with school vaccine mandates, which are set by the states but with guidance by the CDC, compliance with them is dropping near the level at which they don't work anymore, at which too many kids are not vaccinated to provide the herd immunity. So, with Donald Trump giving RFK Jr. this kind of platform, or even if he gets denied the HHS secretary, certainly he'll end up in the White House as some kind of healthcare czar, you run the enormous risk that even more parents who are both -- really, at both ends of the spectrum, primarily on the right, we'll say no to vaccines and thus, endanger outbreaks of things like measles for the vast majority of parents who do want to protect their children, you know. So, we come back very quickly. I mean, Donald Trump won this election because voters were dissatisfied with the cost of living and secondarily, with the border. They largely put aside their concerns, which still existed, about all the other things that came with electing him. And what he has done over a very short period of time is make very clear to everyone, from his immigration appointments to these kinds of appoint -- nominees that we're talking about that, you know, you don't get to order off just one side of the menu, you get the whole package. And voters are now we're going to have to see how they react if, in fact, you have someone like RFK Jr. undermining the effectiveness of school vaccines and threatening outbreaks of childhood diseases that we thought we had vanquished.",

And that conversation will continue with China's President Xi Jinping tomorrow. The third and final time these leaders will meet representing the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world, and it comes at a precarious moment geopolitically around the world. You have China forging closer ties with Russia's Vladimir Putin. You have the country's intentions with Taiwan unclear. You have the U.S. having poured tens of billions of dollars to both safeguard its own economy against China's influence, as well as pouring money into economies around the world to do the same. And while there are a few assurances that Biden can give President Xi about what the U.S.-China relationship looks like after January, there are going to be opportunities to talk about the stability and the progress that has been made in recent years, and to focus on those areas where continuity is possible, like military level communication, efforts to curb the trafficking of illicit drugs, and regulate artificial intelligence. Those are areas where there is some agreement between the two countries, though it is very clear that the world will change dramatically as it -- where it comes to the U.S. and its relationships with allies and adversaries alike. And Trump has wasted no time assembling a team of China hawks who are expected to take a very hard line when it comes to Beijing, starting with issuing very steep tariffs that the president has -- president-elect has telegraphed quite clearly on the campaign trail.

It's still growing in size and in strength, and it could still grow a little bit more. But the forecast is for about 205 or so kilometers per hour, making landfall farther to the south. Now, all the other ones have been much farther to the north. This is much closer to Manila and to more populated places like Baguio. So, this is going to make wind damage. This is going to make storm surge. This is going to make heavy, heavy rainfall. Certainly, 250 to 400 millimeters of rainfall would be likely with this as it does run on shore, on up into the mountains. You don't see any white specs here, which mean over 500. But, boy, it's because it's moving so fast. This is just going to continue to move on by. It's going to run right off back into the sea. And so, it's not going to be a long-lasting storm like the one that we're going to talk about right now for Honduras, just in a couple of minutes. Here's Usagi moving on up toward Taipei, making some wind and some rain, but really less than about 60 kilometers per hour. Right now, we're at 83 for Tropical Storm Sara. Sara here for Honduras. This has been an area that has been hit by so much rainfall over the past couple of days now for the capital at 618 millimeters in really just about 24 hours. And the rain is going to continue because this storm isn't moving very fast. There could be another 250 millimeters of rain before it finally stops. This is what the rivers are already looking like in parts there of the country. There goes the rainfall finally across Belize and even into the mountains here of Southwestern Mexico.

And I tell you what, that slap was probably just about as real as when Mike Tyson hit Alan in that first \"Hangover\" movie. You know, they're doing a little acting here to try to drum up interest for this fight. You know, the last time we saw Mike Tyson in a real sanctioned fight, which this is, was about 20 years ago. And back then, Tyson didn't look great. So, you know, you got to temper your expectations here. Go into it with very low expectations. Jake Paul, you know, he just became a pro fighter about three years ago. He's 10 and one in his career, hasn't fought a lot of real boxers, but he does look competent in there in the ring. He's 31 years younger than Mike Tyson. So, as I said, this is going to be a real fight, but they are changing the rules a little bit here. A normal heavyweight fight, 10 to 12 rounds. This one's only going to be eight. They usually have three-minute rounds. It's only going to be two-minute rounds. They're also going to use bigger gloves, 14-ounce gloves, as opposed to 10. A little more padding there. So, Lynda, they've changed the rules around a little bit to make -- hopefully, make this very entertaining and a very fun fight. But again, Mike Tyson, 58 years old.
