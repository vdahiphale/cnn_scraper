He won't be bogged down by having to campaign day in and day out himself against former President Donald Trump. You've already seen him start to focus on some of those legacy pieces this week, traveling down to New Orleans to talk about cancer.But another key focus for Biden will be trying to help Vice President Kamala Harris be elected president in November. The two will be appearing for the first time together on a stage today out in the country, traveling to Maryland to talk about lowering prescription drug prices. The expectation is Biden will hit the road in the coming days, weeks, and months in order to support Harris and also do everything he can from here in the White House to ensure she's elected in November.",

Thank you both for being here this morning.Let's talk about this new poll that's come out by Pew Research, finding that Harris' campaign is energizing the Democratic Party in a brand new way. Sixty-two percent of Democratic voters strongly support Harris at the top of the ticket compared to last month, which is really no number. Just 43 percent of Democrats strongly supported Biden in that very same poll. So, Pete, Trump -- there's the poll there -- has another news conference today hoping to grab the spotlight from Harris as you see these numbers. If his presser is anything like the last one where he spewed a bunch of lies and he went after her personally, is the old adage still the same that all publicity is good publicity for him? PETE SEAT, FORMER WHITE HOUSE SPOKESPERSON FOR GEORGE W. BUSH (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, that's what I tell my clients, so let's stick with that, Sara. All press is good press. But I think what he has going for him is most Americans are living their lives and not watching his press conferences -- every minute of his press conferences -- and hanging on every word that he says. But I join the chorus that says he needs to scrap the personal attacks and insults and focus on the issues that the American people care about. We see this in poll after poll. They want to boost the economy. They want to secure the border. They want to cool inflation. It's not that hard. The roadmap is there.

It is Biden-Harris, Biden-Harris, Biden-Harris. It's like saying Beetlejuice three times. It just conjures up bad things when you say that. So whatever economic policies Harris-Walz puts out, that is an implicit admission of the failures of the Biden-Harris administration, plain and simple. So she will try a new font. She'll try a new color scheme to pretend like it's something fancy and new, but it's not. It's the same failed policies that the American people feel are not working for them.",

Ask voters how they feel about expanding the Affordable Care Act. Ask voters what they -- how they feel about being able to send their kids to college and not having that burden because a lot of their kids have -- are having their student loans forgiven. Ask voters how they feel about an administration who has focused on these policies that are massively popular. The infrastructure bill, the PACT Act. You ask voters about those things in polls and in focus groups, they poll off the charts. And that was what was frustrating, frankly, from Biden's perspective because they were not connecting the two. Well, guess what? Kamala Harris and Tim Walz can absolutely connect the two and take credit for it, and that contrast is going to win them the election in November.

Like I said, he's a 39-year-old man. He has a California driver's license despite appearing to have been in the D.C. area since 2018. We've also found that he does have a criminal history. And his criminal history spans several states, including a 2019 charge in Maryland for disorderly conduct, and second-degree assault, and resisting arrest, as well as another 2019 charge in Florida for trespassing and giving a fake name to police. So obviously, as law enforcement continues to search for Kessler and physically bring their suspect into custody, they're also trying to figure out why Kessler or why anyone would have wanted to break into Donald Trump's Virginia campaign headquarters. It's important to note that there is no evidence at this point to suggest that this break-in was politically motivated. But at the same time, law enforcement has not found any sort of evidence that Kessler left behind at the campaign headquarters. They're also not sure in this early stage of the investigation if Kessler took anything from the campaign headquarters. There are still a lot of questions in determining both motive and finding Kessler himself.",

This immense death toll coming as ceasefire talks are finally happening once again in Doha this morning.Let's get right to CNN's Jomana Karadsheh in Qatar for us this morning. What are you learning about how these talks will go forward? JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know, this is happening with the backdrop of a very tense time in the region. And, of course, this grim and horrific milestone Sara as we've heard from Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza saying that today the death toll -- the 10 months of war has surpassed 40,000 people killed. And they expect that death toll is even higher. They believe that there are thousands -- possibly up to 10,000 people who are unaccounted for who remain under the rubble. And when we're talking about the 40,000, they say that the majority of them are women and children. Nearly 17,000 children they say have been killed in 10 months of war that the U.N. has described as war on children because of the shear number of children who have lost their life. Children who have been maimed. Children whose lives have been shattered by this war. We're talking about nearly 20,000 children who have lost one or both of their parents in this war, Sara. Just a few months ago we were here in Doha, and we met with evacuees from Gaza -- children who have lost parents. Children who have lost limbs. Mothers who have lost their babies. And it gets really harder and harder by the day to try and describe what the people of Gaza -- the civilians are continuing to go through. You know, I speak to people there and they say that they have gotten to a point now here they just wish they would die so they do not have to live through this. So they don't have to live to mourn their loved ones. And you speak to people right now and they feel that they have been abandoned by the world and they have lost hope. As you have these talks right now with so much riding on these talks -- the lives of civilians in Gaza, the fate of the Israeli hostages.

      "sentences": "Good morning, Kate. Thanks for having me.Alex Murdaugh thinks that he's the organ grinder and the justice system is the monkey. The reality is that this is a normal appeal that anybody who is convicted and doesn't plead guilty and is convicted by a jury of murder always gets an appeal. The difference is that it didn't go through the intermediate Court of Appeals first and the State Supreme Court grabbed the case. This case is going to be appealed based on evidentiary rulings that Judge Newman made based on the trial was in Walterboro and they felt there should have been a change of venue. But most importantly, as you said, that there was alleged juror interference. I represented six jurors who testified that not only did they not hear former Clerk of Court Becky Hill say anything that was any more than just ministerial -- like, what do you want for lunch? How do you want to get to and from the courthouse? But nothing that was said or done influenced their verdicts. The issue before the Supreme Court is going to be the former chief justice who denied the motion for a retrial applied the South Carolina standard for juror interference. The defense argued they should have applied the federal standard pronounced by the United States Supreme Court. The difference is the South Carolina standard says that you must show, in addition to the inappropriate statements by Becky Hill, that it influenced the jurors' outcome. The federal standard says all you have to do is show that there was inappropriate statements made by the Clerk of Court, and you get a new trial. It's a very serious issue. For our system to work it has to work for the worst of us, not just the best of us. So I believe that even though Alex Murdaugh was guilty, even though there was significant evidence, these are important issues for any defendant to get a fair and impartial trial. So we're going to have to see if our Supreme Court agrees with Justice Toal and applies the Supreme Court standard. Regardless, if he loses, Alex is going to take this up to the United States Supreme Court. He has 30 years. BOLDUAN:  Right.",
