He's also on the Oklahoma sex offender registry.Now, authorities did obtain a search warrant to go to his home. They arrived there at around 3:00 p.m. yesterday. They conducted the search. That's when they discovered seven bodies not in the residence but sort of just on the property according to the sheriff. No details on how long the bodies had been there. This -- officials did say there is no suspect at large at the moment, no threat to the community. There was also a separate missing persons alert posted by the sheriff's office on Facebook regarding 14-year-old Ivy Webster, which revealed that she actually went to a friend's house with a friend on Saturday to the Macalester area. She was supposed to return home by 5:00 p.m. on Sunday, but her family was not able to reach her. Our affiliate did speak to the father of Brittany Brewer as well as Ivy's Brother. Take a listen.

And he was scheduled to appear in court at 9:00 a.m. on Monday. He obviously failed to show up. The records say that a bench warrant for failure to appear was issued. And that court date stemmed from charges filed in 2017 when McFadden was accused of using a cell phone to exchange news -- nude photos and videos with an underage girl while he was serving time for a 2003 rape conviction. This is according to CNN affiliate KOKI. They interviewed Ivy's parents. They told our affiliate that they were shocked to learn if McFadden's passed and that he was out and about, John.",

That is according to the Union, which represents 15,000 pilots.CNN's Aviation Correspondent and pilot Pete Muntean joins us now. Pete, update us on exactly where things stand right now. PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT (on camera): You know, things are pretty tense, Sara. And they have been for years. American Airlines pilots are fighting for a new contract with the airline. But now things are really coming to a head and now the Allied Pilots Association, it's the union that represents 15,000 American Airlines pilots have voted to authorize a strike if necessary. That is really key. More on that in a second. The Allied Pilots Association, 99 percent of its Union voted and 96 percent voted in favor of a strike. Now, pilots had been picketing, it's a major hubs across the country. But the big thing to remember here is that there was a long path to an actual strike. Numerous steps would have to take place, not to mention mediation potentially with the U.S. government, and Congress or the president could step in. And American Airlines underscores there is no impact to operations because of this strike authorization vote. This is the statement from American Airlines. It says. We understand a strike authorization vote is one of the important ways that pilots expressed their desire to get a deal done and we respect the message of the voting results. So, talks with the pilot union and the airline continue right now. I spoke to Dennis Taje, who is a captain for American Airlines and the spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association. And he says right now, they're fighting for better pay, better work conditions, and better conditions for pilots to be most ready to work. And set this against the backdrop of summer travel when we're likely to see a lot of headaches and a huge amount of passengers returning to flying. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He wants the government, he wants private sector, families, individuals to think about how to make us all more connected. So, for example, he said that we should invest in groups that bring people together. Put money into making that happen. Train healthcare providers to recognize loneliness because they don't always do that. And established digital safety standards. Tell social media companies you need to have standards so that people will feel more together than apart. Now, some of this gets to the very fabric of what our society has become. This will be hard to reverse. But this is his blueprint for starting down that road, John.",

If you feel lonely, you pick up the phone, call a friend, and then it goes away or you get in the car and go see a family member. That's OK.
