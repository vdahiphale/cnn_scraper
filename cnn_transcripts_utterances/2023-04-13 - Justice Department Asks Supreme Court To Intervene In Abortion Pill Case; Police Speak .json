Often women don't even know they're pregnant at that point. Opponents say the bill, which has the support of Republican Governor Ron DeSantis would effectively end legal abortion in the state.",

CNN senior political analyst Gloria Borger joins us now for more on this. So gloria, what's notable is the silence from most Republicans on what in theory would be seen as a victory for them. Restricting abortion access is something that they have been fighting for decades now, and here it is before them. And yet nothing.",

And that is Donald Trump, who is in the headlines right now and the issue of abortion. They know that seven out of 10 Americans believe that the abortion pill should be readily available. Most women in this country who do you opt for abortion used the abortion pill. They also know that abortion pills are used for miscarriage.And right now, they don't want to get in the middle of this fight. They want to let this go to the Supreme Court and let the Supreme Court handle it. They won the Dobbs decision, and now the party is kind of stuck. They're not quite sure what to do because they need these voters in any kind of a general election. And this is an issue that is really motivating for suburban women in particular and independent voters in general.",

And at a certain point some Republicans, in fact, some Democrats were saying, be careful what you wish for, because when you get it, it's going to backfire. And what we see happening around the country right now is that the country has changed on the issue of abortion dramatically. And that the Republican Party is split on the issue.I mean, you do have as I was mentioning candidates like Mike Pence, for example, Tim Scott, for example, who are going to say, you know, we've got to -- we've got to be anti abortion -- although Tim Scott is a little more moderate on the issue, then Mike Pence. But now you have this five week ban in Florida. As you pointed out earlier, most women don't know they're pregnant at five weeks. And so, you have a country that is overwhelmingly in supportive of women being allowed to make the decision. As I said 7 in 10, Americans support the use of an abortion pill.",

We just saw these two state representatives reinstated, all this issue of surrounding gun reform legislation. Gloria, we did see the governor earlier this week signed an executive order that would strengthen background checks. It's a step in the right direction -- Gun -- gun reform activists would say.Do you think this is a sign of something that we could see potentially other Republican states do as well or do you think this is sort of an isolated issue?

So perhaps, unfortunately, it's more likely when it hits home in your own state, is that the governor is more likely to do something, although that hasn't happened in Texas after Uvalde, for example.I think that for some reason, and I've been trying to figure it out. Gun reform is not as motivating factor for voters as other issues like abortion has proven itself to be and I don't know that after all of these mass shootings, whether finally some kind of compromise on gun reform, whether it's an assault weapons ban or -- will finally get approved. It's hard to understand why this hasn't been more motivating. And maybe after what we've seen in the deaths of children, it will become that way. And maybe we saw that in Tennessee a little bit, but it comes down to the state legislatures here. And if the state legislatures are as polarized as they are right now, I'm not quite sure what happens on a national level. No one I know what it would say, oh sure, we're going to get an assault weapons ban. That's not about to happen.",

I'm going to be brief on the details. But here's the summary in the update.On April 4th, 2023, at approximately 2:30 a.m. San Francisco police officers from southern station responded to the 300 block of main street for report of a stabbing. Officers arrived on scene and located -- and located the victim, later identified as 43-year-old Robert Lee, suffering from an apparent stab wound. Officers rendered eight and summoned medics to the scene. Mr. Lee was transported to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital with life threatening injuries. Despite efforts by first responders and medical personnel, Mr. Lee died from his injuries. The San Francisco Police Department homicide detail responded and took over the investigation. Homicide investigators developed information that identified the suspect as 38-year-old Nima Momeni, of Emeryville, California. We can confirm that Mr. Lee and Mr. Momeni knew each other. However, we will not be able to provide further details at this time regarding the evidence that confirms that information. This morning members of the San Francisco Police Department's investigations bureau and tactical unit served several search warrants and arrest and arrest warrant in San Francisco and Emeryville, California. Mr. Momeni was taken into custody without incident in Emeryville, California. He was transported to the San Francisco County Jail and booked on one charge of murder. California penal code section 187a. I'd like to remind everybody that this is still an open and ongoing investigation, and we will not be able to provide further details at this point. Before I turn this over to our district attorney, I want to assure everyone that our investigators have been working tirelessly to make this arrest and bring this case to justice for the Lee family and his loved ones. Just as we would for every homicide that occurs in this city. I would like to thank homicide investigators led by Detective Brett Dettmer (ph) and Detective Thomas McWilliams (ph), also Lieutenant Calvin Sanders and our entire homicide team who have worked not only in this case, but all of our open cases. You know, I said from the start that I have every confidence in the men and women and the members that work homicide. They have an 85 percent clearance rate year today and that is expected to go to 92 percent because we just solved a 1994 case yesterday as well. We never give up finding justices -- justice for the victims in this city. And I want to make sure that everybody knows how hard the men and women and members of this department work to keep this city safe. With that said just a reminder. We won't be able to provide any details in this case today. But this is an ongoing investigation and we still have work to do. And our job is to provide the best evidence possible to this district attorney and her team. So, we can bring this case in any other homicide, a crime in the city, to justice. So, with that I'd like to turn it over to our district attorney Brooke Jenkins. We'll take questions after.",

This is involving the death of Bob Lee. We are told by the SFPD chief that that suspect was taken into custody is 38-year-old Nima Momeni.Now the chief said that the two know each other but said they would not be giving any details of the evidence in terms of how they know that. But again, Nima Momeni taken into custody in the death of Bob Lee charged with one count of murder. We'll continue to follow those updates. All right, well, a lawsuit has just been filed by the estate of a man who died after spending 20 days in solitary confinement. This was at the Jackson County Jail in Indiana. 29-year-old Joshua McLemore was arrested for pulling a nurse's hair while being treated at a nearby medical facility.

Attorneys say he lost then 45 in less than three weeks, and an autopsy revealed his immediate cause of death was multiple organ failure due to refusal to eat or drink with altered mental status due to untreated schizophrenia. Now CNN has reached out to the Jackson County Sheriff's Office for comment, along with Advanced Correctional Healthcare, Incorporated.CNN political commentator Van Jones is joining us now. He is also, as many of you likely know, an advocate for criminal justice reform. The details here really surprised me. So many of us these details that are alleged in this lawsuit, Van.

You know, the United Nations defines solitary confinement for more than 14 days as torture. And yet there are people in the United States who are in solitary confinement for literally years on end.Having a schizophrenic episode should not be a death sentence in this country, having mental health issues should not be a death sentence in this country. This is particularly appalling given the fact that there was like literally no medical attention given to him, even though he wasn't eating, wasn't drinking. It's particularly appalling. But I think people would be shocked to know how many people find themselves in situations like this and worse for even longer.

We know that he has been in Georgia filming a movie for Netflix called \"Back in Action.\" Now Netflix declined to comment. This movie also stars Glenn Close, Cameron Diaz, and we know that this incident did not occur on the set. We also know that Jamie Foxx was not transported to the hospital via an ambulance.
