I'm Jake Tapper.And we start today with our politics lead in the White House, in an all-out reelection blitz trying to capture on any momentum from President Biden's fiery and rather political State of the Union Address last night in which the president referenced Donald Trump, at least a dozen times. In less than an hour, we expect to hear from the president outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He's visiting the commonwealth, a crucial battleground state, today, along with the first lady who hails from there. Meanwhile, the vice president is about to land in another key battleground, Arizona. She heads to another battleground, Nevada, tomorrow. Just take a look at the travel plans for the president, the vice president, and the Biden cabinet over the next few weeks from California, to Rhode Island, Missouri, to Wisconsin and Ohio. This is what the White House sees as the official launch of the Biden Trump rematch. Now to bolster that effort, the Biden campaign said today that they're launching 100 new offices this month, hiring 350 new team members and launching a $30 million media campaign. Those ads are expected to reflect some of the key themes we heard from Biden's speech last night, and the criticism he leveled at the man he identified only as my predecessor, along with the Republican Party.

He came across angry. He came across full of vengeance. He came across loud and grumpy. And look, this was a partisan speech. He came right out of the gate talking about his predecessor over and over and over again and taking it to Donald Trump, instead of talking about the State of the Union, which is what this was four. And if I wanted to go to Biden rally, I would've gotten my small snacks and Snicker bars and hit the road to a Biden rally. But this was supposed to be about the state of the Union. And on the issues, too, we can certainly talk about that. But I think the fact that he talked about the economy, which is a big issue for people, saying U.S. is the envy of the world. We're coming back. Things are great. That's not how people feel and while he can sit there and say we're on a great economic comeback, that's not how people feel.

So, Mark, thanks for being here. What is your reaction to these protests? Is there any legitimacy at all to the concerns that some of the aid ends up in the hands of Hamas which is obviously a terrorist group that attacked them? MARK GREEN, FORMER ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Well, I think what the report reminds us all every day is a bad day right now in Gaza. There are still hostages being held by Hamas, Israeli hostages, American hostages, and people are hungry. It also underscores how difficult this is. Delivering humanitarian assistance during calm times is hard enough but in a war zone and where there's so much rumor and distrust, it's extraordinarily difficult to do. I think we all understand the emotions and the humanitarian need that draws or drives us to do airdrops and to do sea bridge that they're talking about. But it's no substitute for getting in over land. And so, it's worrisome. Its going to be a long time before this goes away. And every day, as I said, is a real bad day right now.",

And so even as we talk about the era, were talking about not even a drop in the bucket of the need that's there. And the hunger is rising, the medical needs are rising, the desperation is rising. So they simply have to get to an answer and get there soon. I know that it's something that the administration missions looking at and pushing on. As I said, it's really worrisome right now, and nobody should be led into the false hope that somehow airdrops or a sea bridge which is going to take several weeks to put together is an answer.

Overley of Los Angeles, was on the USS Oklahoma. That battleship capsized and sank and only 12 minutes after multiple Japanese tornado hits.Four hundred twenty-nine U.S. crew members were killed. There remains eventually were recovered, but most were deemed unidentifiable.

Overley will be buried later this month. May he finally rest in peace and may his memory be a blessing.
