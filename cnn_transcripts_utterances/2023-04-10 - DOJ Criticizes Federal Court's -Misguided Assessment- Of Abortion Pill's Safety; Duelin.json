      "sentences": "All right, this just into CNN. The Justice Department just issued a filing criticizing a Texas judge's decision to suspend the FDA approval of the most commonly used abortion pill.The DOJ is arguing for an emergency stay against the ruling that would take effect this Friday. Mifepristone has been widely available for women across the nation for more than 20 years. But also this weekend, a conflicting court ruling out of Washington State, the federal judge, they're deciding to protect access to the same drug across 17 blue states and Washington, D.C., which sued to protect medication abortion. CNN's Joan Biskupic joining me right now with more on this. Joan, this is a very confusing time for women. So what's next for the Texas ruling because that's the more threatening one?",

      "sentences": "No. The more important one is definitely Texas. But I think you had a map of exactly the states that had sued and going to us district court in Washington State.Washington State and 16 other Democratic-run states, plus the District of Columbia had actually sued the FDA. The FDA, that's on the other side of the case in Texas, saying that they did not want any kind of stages yet in there -- they didn't want the FDA to modify or change regulations on the ability of women to get this drug. And they wanted to have access preserved. And what a judge did in that case, Judge Thomas Rice out of the district court in Spokane, did, indeed, say that the FDA could not prevent -- could not change the rules or restrictions having to do with access in those particular states. So essentially, right now, you have that order from Judge Rice stain that women in those 18 total jurisdictions should have access to the drug. Meanwhile, you have Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's one that still stands, even though we're about to have probably more action on that, just because of what's coming just now from the Department of Justice, where he's saying that, by Friday, all of it might access to the Mifepristone would be actually rolled back. Now I do want to say that we expect some action by the `Fifth Circuit. And if we don't see the `Fifth Circuit actually granting this administrative stay as it's called, I'm sure the government will go to the U.S. Supreme Court. So just a lot happening. But for now, everyone should know that the medication abortion drugs are available to women who need them.",

All right, so Michigan was one of the states which appealed to that judge to keep the medication legal. And Michigan's Attorney General Dana Nessel is joining me right now. So good to see you. I mean, there's a lot of confusion for women, understandably, right now. Women, particularly of childbearing age. So I just want to be completely transparent to any of them who might be watching. So if you live in these 18 restrictions that Joan was talking about, the 17 states and the District of Columbia, is your access to Mifepristone in jeopardy because of the Texas decision?",

      "sentences": "Well, I have some additional information to add from this morning regarding the Washington lawsuit.And that's that the FDA, who, of course, is a defendant in that case, has reached back out to the court to Judge Rice to ask for clarification about what will happen and what is the judge's order going to be in the event the Department of Justice is not successful in seeking a continued stay of Judge Kacsmaryk's order. So I know this is very complicated, but I think it's actually very good news, at least for the 17 states, plus the District of Columbia, because would it -- would it says to me is that the FDA is interested in obeying Judge Rice's order. And if what Judge Rice is saying is, irrespective of what happens in Texas, or in the `Fifth Circuit, that they are still going to allow FDA approval of Mifepristone to at least the parties to the Washington lawsuit. Including states like mine, Michigan, so that Mifepristone would remain legal, available and FDA approved, at least as it pertains to those states.",

Maybe I don't like the fact that it prevents HIV. Or maybe I don't like the fact that it's a form of birth control because I'm anti-birth control. And to substitute a judge's opinion for that of the medical community, I think is scary as it gets.

In fact, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, we're told, was just briefed on this leak on April 6th. And now the Pentagon is really trying to get its arms around the scope and the significance of this leak, trying to figure out just how big it is. And of course, the national security implications, whether compromises sources and methods. Now a senior DOD official did just brief reporters and told us that they are currently undergoing an investigation internally, kind of an interagency effort led by the Defense Department to try to figure out just how bad this leak is. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS MEAGHER, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS (voice-over): The Department of Defense is working around the clock to look at the scope and scale of the distribution, the assessed impact, and our mitigation measures. We're still investigating how this happened, as well as the scope of the issue. There have been steps to take a closer look at how this type of information is distributed, and to whom. We are also still trying to assess what might be out there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Fredricka, I'll get to that in a moment from now.But I just want to start with a sequence of events that took place on the 28th of February this year when you had a young boy going up to the Dalai Lama at a public event, and he asked him for a hug. The Dalai Lama then invited him onto stage and said, give me a hug as well as the kiss on the cheek, and the boy obliged. Moments later, you had the Dalai Lama look into the eyes of the boy and ask him -- and asked him rather to kiss him on the mouth. He drew him closer, holding his chin, and kissed him on the mouth. And then seconds later came, the words \"suck my tongue.\" Now that's really taken social media by surprise. And it's because the furor and outrage Frederica on social media that forced the Dalai Lama's office earlier today to issue a statement. What's interesting, though, Fredricka, is the fact that this statement comes six weeks after the incident, which took place, like I said in February. [14:55:02] So it's clear it's the pressure, it's the outrage that caused the Dalai Lama's office to come out with a clarification, which reads -- and I'm going to read excerpts from here: \"His holiness wishes to apologize to the boy and his family as well as his many friends across the world for the hurt his words may have caused. His holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way, even in public and before cameras. He regrets the incident.\" Two phrases here that caught my eye, Frederick. The first is where the statement reads, \"for the hurt his words may have caused.\" The second, \"often teases people he meets in events and in front of cameras.\" Clearly, there's more to that in this video, Fredericka. And there's more than an apology that the Dalai Lama, according to critics, should be offering at this point -- Fredricka?",
