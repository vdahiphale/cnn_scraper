      "sentences": "Look, Bianca, as you mentioned, you know, there haven't been any missiles flying back and forth between North and South Korea today, but the tensions continue to escalate. And perhaps in order to ease those tensions there is hope that perhaps that U.N. Security Council meeting will help change the tensions, the continued escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula.But for now, the incident you just described lasted about four hours and took place at the same time as the now extended joint drill between the United States and South Korea. It's called \"Vigilant Storm.\" It was extended one day extra. It was only supposed to last five days, it'll last six now following yesterday's failed intercontinental ballistic missile test by North Korea. This is North Korea's newest missile the day that it was tested, the Hwasong-17 ICBM which Kim Jong-un showed off in a highly produced propaganda video earlier this year. And it's believed to have failed midflight after its second phase separation. That's according to a South Korean government source. But even if this ICBM did fail, progress was clearly made since the last time it was tested back in May -- in May according to the South Korean government. It's believed that the same type of ICBM only flew to an altitude of 540 kilometers. Yesterday it reached an altitude of about 2,000 kilometers and likely failed in the third and final stage of flight. Those stages include the boost, midcourse and terminal phase when the missile reenters the atmosphere and strikes its target. But the key here is that no one single test is special on its own. And North Korea gains knowledge from each and every weapons test that it conducts. And just like anything you do, the more you practice, the better you do. So, when talking to experts they say that North Korea's aggressive pace of testing is what's most concerning. Now as for what could be next, experts say ICBM and nuclear tests are a set and with the U.S. midterm election and G-20 coming up, a nuclear test could be carried out soon especially with North Korea's tendency to conduct tests ahead of important events to move itself up the agenda -- Bianca.",

Those really are now seen as being too rigid. Obviously, something needs to be done about the opioid problem in the United States. But those guidelines were seen as sort of putting all patients in one basket when in some ways some patients really do benefit from opioids. For example, some cancer patients.So, before we get into the guidelines, let's take a look at who is experiencing pain in the United States. About 1 in 5 adults have chronic pain and about 1 in 14 adults have experienced pain nearly every day over the past three months that limited their life or work activities. The CDC essentially is saying for some of these patients opioids might be appropriate for some perhaps not. So, let's take a look specifically at what they're saying. The CDC is recommending nonopioid therapies for subacute or for chronic pain. In other words, if the pain is not acute, non-opioid therapies would be preferred. Also, if you are going to prescribe opioids, they tell doctors don't discontinue them abruptly. And also, if you're going to prescribe opioids, consider offering naloxone at the same time. Naloxone an antidote for opioid overdoses and the CDC is saying, if you are going to be giving someone opioids, you should consider giving them naloxone at the same time -- Max, Bianca.

Children are dying from COVID and other illnesses due to lockdown restrictions. CNN's Selina Wang has more from Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A 14-year- old girl lies in bed, convulsing at a COVID quarantine facility in China. Someone comes over saying, the kid has a fever of 104 degrees Fahrenheit, and no one is coming. She died soon after. A man who says he is the girl's father posted this video online, filming his daughter's body, he is demanding justice. I beg the Communist Party to investigate, he says. CNN hasn't been able to independently verify the videos, they have been censored in China. Along with these videos of a father desperately trying to revive his three-year-old son, he can't get his child to the hospital office than enough, because of COVID restrictions in Lanzhou City. The boy later died. Enraged residents turned to the streets, swarms of armed police hold them back. In Lanzhou City, some are forced to quarantine outside in the cold, in parking lots. This viral video, which CNN could not verify, shows others forced to stay in male bathrooms, sleeping under urinals. In year three of the pandemic, every positive case and close contact is still sent to government quarantine facilities like these, and this one, the video says it's a quarantine site for kids in Gansu Province. A little boy jumping on bricks to avoid the  pool of dirty liquid. This is where they use the bathroom. Distraught parents crowd outside to protests. Protesters rushed to the streets in Lhasa, Tibet, demanding the end of a lockdown that lasted for more than 80 days. And in Zhengzhou City, workers are fleeing Apple's biggest iPhone plant after a COVID outbreak. Masses of workers carrying their luggage, walk long distances across highways through villages, even farm fields, those left behind at the factory claim living conditions are subpar. Videos appear to show workers literally fighting for boxes of supplies. China's leader Xi Jinping claims zero-COVID puts lives above all else. But for many, it's precisely the policy itself that's ruining the lives. This woman sobs on the ground crying, that after she was caught with her mask pulled down, the government suspended her business for 30 days, losing a month's income. Metal spikes, which the man filming, says were installed on a compound gate to prevent residents from leaving or red plastic barriers. This one separating a father from his daughter. The little girl worried, asked her dad how he's going to get home. But her father, like millions across China, likely has no idea when he can go home or when all of this will end.

And the Nets hoped he would have taken that time to apologize for all the pain that he caused but it took way too long. He was given multiple opportunities to do that.

This is what he said at that time.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KYRIE IRVING, BROOKLYN NETS PLAYER: So, I take my full responsibility, again, I'll repeat it, for posting something on my Instagram or Twitter that may have had some unfortunate falsehoods in it.
