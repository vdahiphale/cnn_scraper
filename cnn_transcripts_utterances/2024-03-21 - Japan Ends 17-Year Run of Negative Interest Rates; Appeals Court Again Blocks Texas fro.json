And the island nation just did something that ithasn`t done in 17 years, raised interest rates. According to the Bank of Japan, the short-term rates will now increase from minus 0.1% to around zero to 0.1%. This move will shift away from the country`s negative interest rate policy, which was initiated years ago to help stimulate a struggling economy. With more on this move and the future of Japan`s economy, let`s turn now to our Hanako Montgomery, who`s in Tokyo. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "A bit of background as to why Japan has finally ended negative interest rates. There are reallytwo key components. The first, we`re finally seeing inflation. The second, wages are finally going up. So right now, the rate of inflation in Japan is hovering at about 2% for its core consumer prices. That includes everything besides food and fuel. Now, 2% is that magic number you want to see that indicates the economy is healthy and growing in the right direction. This is historic for Japan, which has seen years and years of deflation. So at the same time, we are also seeing wages increase significantly. On Friday, Rengo, Japan`s largest labor union comprised of the country`s biggest companies, agreed to raise wages by 5.28%, the largest pay hike in 33 years. Now, this is historic for Japanese workers in the country, because they haven`t seen their wages increase that much in comparison to the United States, the U.K., Germany, other OECD countries, for example. It`s seen a lot of stagnant growth. Now, these two key components are what indicated to the Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda that it was finally time to end negative interest rates, which will now set the economic agenda for the months to come in Japan. Now, in terms of a stronger yen, though we did see the price of the yen fall today. Experts did tell me that we might see a stronger yen in the months to come riding on the back of higher interest rates. Now, if we do see that, it would mean input prices do go down. Now, this is hugely significant for the country because Japan is a resource-poor nation. It imports more than 90% of its fuel, of its gas, and about 60% of its food. So input prices do go down, that means the cost of living in Japan will also go down. Now, for foreign tourists, however, it might mean that their next vacation to the country is just a bit more expensive. But again, this is a gradual change that we might be seeing many, many months in the future. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Many states, especially in the eastern part ofthe country, experienced this dip in temperatures, making it feel like we were still full-throttle wintertime. So if you or anyone you know were ready to leap into spring by maybe freshening up the garden, there might be some worry over how to protect those precious flowers and veggies. Well, we`ve got you covered. Our meteorologist Elisa Raffa has some tips from some of the pros, some seasoned farmers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So that means that growing season in some places is as much as two to four weeks longer. So you might have to protect those plants in the cold, just like these farmers. We`re at a strawberry farm where you can see the farmers here have covered these strawberries with row covers to keep those strawberries protected from frost forming on their leaves. And the blankets also help trap some of that heat. Now, while you might not have acres and acres of strawberry farms at home, you can still use some of the same practices to protect your own plants. You can use things like bedsheets, blankets, burlap, and cheesecloth all to protect your own flowers and vegetables in your garden. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
