And they had all sorts of people to make those arguments to average Americans, people like Adam Kinzinger who was a Republican, reaching out to those Trump-Biden voters, those Nikki Haley Republicans to get those sort of centrist Republicans and moderates to back her ticket. And then she looked like a boss. She looked like a president. To the extent that she is trying to break the highest and hardest glass ceiling, and being a woman could be problematic, she went in there and said, I am tougher than Donald Trump.
