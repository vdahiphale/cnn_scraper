      "sentences": "Hello and welcome. I'm Paula Newton in Atlanta. And we do begin with breaking news this hour.At least 47 people have died in a plane crash in South Korea. Officials say a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 crashed while landing at the Muan International Airport in the southwestern part of the country. 175 passengers and 6 crew members were on board that flight. Fire officials say, the death toll is expected to rise -- at rise. At least two people, though, have survived. And rescue workers are racing to reach people in the tail section of this airplane, which is the only piece so far that we know that is intact. CNN correspondent Mike Valerio is following this breaking news. And he does join us now live from Seoul. Listen, Mike, just the early details here, pretty horrific. What are you learning, especially given the catastrophic nature of this crash? MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT Well, I think that we are centering on this astounding storyline, part of this horrific crash, that all resources from the top of the presidential office here in Seoul have been dedicated to seeing if there are more people, Paula, who can be saved from this wreckage, potentially a third, fourth, who knows? But there seems to be optimism from first responders who are on the crash site because two people have been rescued that that tail section is, I don't want to say intact, but at least you can still see the tale. And there have been these two miraculous stories of people who have survived. The hope is that out of this astounding tragedy that perhaps more people can be rescued. So the pictures are simply cataclysmic and just so arresting to look at. But this is essentially how we got here as far as we've been able to confirm at CNN. This starts with a Jeju airliner leaving Bangkok, Thailand, just after 2 a.m. local time. And to bring you all to speed with, you know, what is Jeju Air? What kind of airline is it? This is the largest budget airliner in South Korea, founded in 2005, wildly popular in this part of the world. And if you want to go to a vacation destination, be it, you know, idyllic Jeju island, after which this airliner is named here in South Korea, if you want to go to Thailand, any of these other vacation destinations, this is an airline that's very popular with people in this part of the world to go to those vacation destinations on a budget. So we have, in total, 181 people who are leaving Bangkok in the wee hours in the morning. It's 12:11 I believe the pushback time from the gate was at Bangkok. And then as far as we were able to see from open source intelligence and flight data, Paula, no problems, everything going according to plan in the just over five-hour flight time from Bangkok to Muan, which is about a three and a half hour drive south of Seoul, where we're coming to you from right now. So what investigators at this very early stage, just after three hours of this catastrophe happening, may be honing in on is what was going on, if anything, what potential problems were happening with the landing here. We're still working on clearing, verifying beyond a shadow of a doubt early images, Paula, that seem to show the landing gear, the wheels that should come down from the plane, not down, and this airplane, this Boeing 737 800, landing on its belly and scraping the tarmac and then running into a wall, colliding with that wall and then engulfed in a fireball at the end of this terrible course that the airliner took. So again, that is the very early sort of nexus point of where investigators may be looking. And of course, as we mentioned, this is a Boeing aircraft. So that could bring in investigators from Boeing from its Chicago headquarters, Washington state, authorities from the United States, to help people here in South Korea figure out just what went wrong and what happened because God forbid, this happens on another plane. They want to make sure that they have looked at what happened here to prevent anything like this from happening in the near and distant future, Paula.",

I don't want to go into too many details because we don't want, of course, reporting to be wrong after the fact. But that is [inaudible] that is being looked at. It does seem as though there was some sort of radio communication given out towards the end -- very end of the flight that something was going on. I don't want to be, you know, vague with that without saying, you know, our true intention, which is that we're just trying to sort through all the information, verify beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is correct. But that is certainly something that we are looking at here. What if any kind of radio transmission went out? And there does appear to be something that went out before this plane crashed. NEWTONwe know of so far, they will obviously be gathering a lot of information. I do want to point out that we are now reporting that airport in Muan is now closed, as everyone can imagine, as rescue efforts and the investigation there continues. Mike, given the fact that you just described this really as holidaymakers, I mean, suffice to say there would have been a lot of young people, a lot of families. If you can just let us know, you know, the kind of trips that this airline usually would undertake, especially to a vacation destination like Thailand.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. I think you hit the nail on the head, Paula. This is a vacation. It's not only vacation, but that's what, you know, if I'm talking to buddies here in Seoul and they say, oh, I'm flying Jeju Air, it is to any of these idyllic vacation destinations in our corner of the world. And I think -- so we're going to be waiting to see how many families were on board at 2 a.m. coming back just before the New Year's holiday here in the middle of the coming week.But I think, you know, if we do want to talk about broader context and the frayed emotions that this is happening in the middle of -- when we're talking about our emotions as a country here in South Korea, you know, we're talking about the acting president, Paula, who has directed all available resources. This is the third person with presidential powers who South Korea has had in the past month. We are still dealing with the chill and the specter of martial law being declared on December 3rd in the early -- the late evening into early morning hours that is certainly unprecedented in South Korea's new age as a blossoming democracy. So the point I'm trying to make here is that a lot of people, you know, are on edge and have the thoughts of, we have been through so much here as a country that just seeing this video is so arresting and to happen at the very end of the year as we're hoping for a much better 2025. You know, I'm getting texts left and right of people who are concerned about, oh, this person is on vacation or that person is on vacation. You know, are they safe? It's a country and a populace that has been through so much. So this only adds to it. And the details to your earlier point could be even worse as the fire department is expecting this death toll to rise. We're trying to work on a number of people who are unaccounted for. But again, we have nearly 50 people who have died and a plane that had 181 people on it. So we're trying to figure out now what happened to the rest of the people who make up that 181, you know, population that is on the plane. That could be heartbreaking for us to confirm in the hours to come, what happened to the rest of the people who have not been accounted for, Paula.",

I do want to get to the equipment. This is a 737-800, as you have reminded us so many times before, a workhorse internationally and incredibly safe.When we're talking about this aircraft itself, you know, what strikes you about it in terms of how it would perform if it -- if, let's say, there was a bird strike in one engine or something else that happened with the landing gear?",

I'm not saying it -- that we've worked on. I'm not saying it happened in this one. But there have sometimes been problems where if a bird strike does damage one engine or damage some equipment, the pilots have to be very careful to make sure that they are shutting down the engine that was damaged. Sometimes, it's difficult and this has happened that they've shut down the wrong engine. Not saying that happened here. I'm just going back to other crashes. And if they were coming around to have the tower confirm whether the gear was up or down, indeed, it was up, that was not deployed. And then in other cases, sometimes, you know, the pilots have gotten a little bit behind the plane. And they have had to just go ahead and land without the gear down. And the other thing that we have to mention is a lot of people seen lots of movies, we've seen lots of video coverage and news coverage where they foam the runways. Well, you know, if you're just coming around for a look see and have the tower to confirm that the gear is up or down, it wouldn't be foamed. And not all airports have foam equipment.

      "sentences": "Well, as questions continue to mount over the possible connection between Russian air defense systems and Wednesday's deadly plane crash, Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued an apology for the fact that the flight crashed after entering Russian airspace around the Chechen city of Grozny, acknowledging, according to Kremlin, that Russia's air defense systems were in fact active when the plane attempted to land in Grozny, however, no admission of responsibility from Moscow. Investigations are still ongoing.But nearby Ukrainian drone attacks in the moments preceding the crash have led some officials to believe that the plane may have been downed mistakenly by Russian anti-aircraft defenses, with officials in Azerbaijan saying that the plane came under external physical and technical interferences while in Russian airspace. Meanwhile, several aviation experts and U.S. officials have said that perforations seen in the fuselage are consistent with shrapnel damage from an explosion, though the cause of the holes in the wreckage has not yet been confirmed. Investigators are continuing to assess the evidence, including two black box recorders which were recovered from the wreckage, as well as, of course, eyewitness accounts. Remarkably, 29 people out of 67 on board the flight survived the crash, some of whom filmed their final moments on the flight. One survivor describing a loud bang being heard and felt before the plane began to descend. But it could still be a matter of days or even weeks before any final conclusions are made by investigators. For now, at least five airlines have suspended flights to areas in Russia, many citing safety concerns. Neda Bashir, CNN, London.",

Rescue operations are underway, though at this hour, two people have survived so far. And that's according to fire department officials. Investigators are on the scene.

So this is Jeju Airlines, Jeju Air, named after Jeju Island, which is the Hawaii, so to speak, of South Korea, a beautiful island in the southern part of South Korea. So Jeju Air, a vacation, low budget airliner that people take for destinations to the tropical, beautiful destinations between South Korea, and East Asia, and Southeast Asia, certainly the these idyllic locations in Thailand among them. And we're at a point where people are coming back in multitudes after having fantastic Christmas vacations, getting back into the slow rhythm of normal life in Seoul and throughout the Korean peninsula, throughout South Korea. And now, we are hit with this tragedy and a death toll that has continued to rise.Our first broadcast a couple hours ago, we were reporting 20 some odd people dead, that death toll rising into the 40s and now into the 60s. And the fear is that, this national tragedy will get so much worse with, again, 119 people who authorities still have not been able to confirm against the flight roster where they are and, you know, what has happened to them. So we are all holding our breaths, communicating with authorities three and a half hours south of here about just what they are doing to see if there are any more miracles that can happen, Paula. NEWTON: Okay. Mike, standby and stay close for us as we continue to get more information, as you point out, those rescue teams are at the airport right now. Appreciate it. And we now want to bring in Geoffrey Thomas. He's editor of Airline News. He joins us now from Perth, Australia. Really good to have you with us, Geoffrey.

But one thing that's very perplexing is the reports that are coming in that the aircraft landed without the undercarriage deployed.Now, whether or not, it's a little bit unclear whether or not the undercarriage collapsed on landing or whether the undercarriage was not deployed at all. This is a really serious issue that I think obviously investigators will be very much focused on.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, it's very fundamental system that works on these aircraft and all aircraft, you know, literally tens of thousands of times a day. The undercarriage lever goes down, you get three greens. If you don't get three greens, you get a red or three reds or whatever, depending on which part of the gear is deployed. If that's the case, if you got reds, then you talk to the control tower and they will visually tell you whether or not the gear is down or not. They had perfect weather, so a flyby of the control tower would have been easily possible.And then if the gear had not deployed, then the next stage in an emergency like that would be that all the fire engines would be laying foam all over the runway and there will be all sorts of fire and emergency protocols put in place and equipment ready for this particular type of landing. So the only explanation at this stage is that, for some reason, either the pilots forgot to deploy the undercarriage and again, there's warning systems for that as well. There's a ground proximity warning system that tells the pilots that the ground is too close and that the undercarriage is not deployed. So there are multiple warning systems in place to prevent such an accident. So obviously, way too early to tell. The black boxes will now become critical. That's if the pilots have not -- if the pilot did not survive this accident. Any control tower conversations as well. This one is perplexing. You've got a beautiful fine day. You've got an excellent airplane. You've got a good airport, dry conditions. It is perplexing.",
