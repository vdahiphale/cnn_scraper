Now, I am told by the source that they're only looking at people, who may be under investigation, by DOJ, but that have not been prosecuted, have not faced charges.

Before the midterms, it was clear that Joe Biden was going to be under a lot of quiet pressure, from within the Democratic Party, not to run. And people really got -- and if the election results, in midterm had been bad? He probably wouldn't have done it. But the midterms really helped him. They transformed the race, best midterm elections for any president in 20 years. And they make it much more likely he's going to run, and much more -- and very importantly, that the Democratic establishment will rally around him. In that, I think that the arguments over age will probably subside a good deal, in the weeks to come, Anderson. We'll have to see there are other things that can come along.

And if he runs, I'll probably back him. Maybe I want someone else from another generation.\" But so far, that person has not emerged. The one complication to all of this is, I think, Democrats feel most strongly about this, if Biden is running against a Donald Trump. If that person on the Republican side is someone else, someone who is younger, who does represent a changing of the guard, on the Republican side? I think you might start to see a little bit more consternation. If we're talking about a Ron DeSantis, or someone else, a Nikki Haley, I think it changes the dynamic, both for Biden and also for his party.

General Hertling, can you tell us what goes into getting wounded soldiers away, from the frontlines, and getting them medical attention, and time, to save their lives? Because obviously, that Golden Hour is critical. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), FORMER ARMY COMMANDING GENERAL, EUROPE AND SEVENTH ARMY, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, the Golden Hour is critical, Anderson. And what I'd tell you is it is a process. The first thing that normally happens is what's called \"Buddy Aid.\" If it's in a good unit, you also have something called \"Combat lifesavers,\" which are soldiers who have been trained, in advanced medical techniques. Then it goes to a medic, which kind of does a triage, to see what kind of conditions, you are in, saving your life, getting the blood flow going, making sure you're getting an airway that's clear. And then, if the medic can't handle it, they medevac you, either by helicopter or ground ambulance, back to an aid station. If it's even more catastrophic, and you have to have surgery, then they, those medevas usually take you back further, to the rear, to a place called a \"Combat support hospital.\" I explain all that because this is a technique the U.S. Army uses. We have trained the Ukrainian army, to do that. Their Buddy Aids, and their combat lifesavers, and their medics, all have the kind of advanced kit that you need, to treat wounds, to include tourniquets and bandages. But they also have ambulances. I mean, our friend, Scott Kelly, the astronaut, has donated a bunch of ambulances, to Ukraine, to make sure that Golden Hour is complete. I saw the same kind of approach, used by the Russian, or attempted to be used, by the Russian army. They do not have the Buddy Aid. Their medics are poorly trained. And it's very difficult to go the long distances back, to their combat support hospital, where they treat traumatized soldiers.",

And those helicopter pilots are trained. They have medics on board. They treat the soldiers, when they get on board the helicopter, on the way back, to the hospitals.Ukraine does not have as many helicopters as we do, certainly.

They are some type of either artillery shell bombs, delivered by an aircraft, or a missile, that holds anywhere from 40 to sometimes close to over 1,000 of small bomblets.They're about the size of a Coke can. It's the equivalent of a hand grenade. What happens is those bomblets disperse overhead, over a unit, the bomblets drop out of a shell, and are dispersed over a very wide area. And they drop, truthfully, Anderson like hand grenades. In our Army, we call them DPICM. It stands for Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions. What happens is if it hits a vehicle, it has a shape charge, the kind of anti-armor charge that will go through metal. If it hits the ground, it has like a fragmentation charge, much like a hand grenade. So, it can affect both equipment and personnel over a very wide area. They are effective. But what I would say, they were banned by more than 100 countries, under the Convention on Cluster Munitions. I think it was back in 2008. I'm not sure the year. I may be wrong. But they are very dangerous in many cases, because if they don't explode, they're left on the battlefield. Children, civilians can come along, and pick them up, don't know what they are. They literally look like a coke can, and they can explode. So, it causes dangers to civilian population. There is very much of a pro and con on these kinds of munitions.",
