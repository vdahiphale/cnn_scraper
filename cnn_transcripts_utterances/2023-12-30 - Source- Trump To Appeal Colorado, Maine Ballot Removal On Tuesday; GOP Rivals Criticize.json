So it's just you and me this morning.All right, so as soon as this morning, the Oregon Supreme Court could decide whether to keep former President Trump's name off the 2024 primary and general election ballots. A group filed the 14th Amendment lawsuit earlier this month arguing Trump is ineligible to run for office because of his role in the January 6th insurrection. On Thursday, Maine joined Colorado in banning Trump from its primary ballot. But both rulings are on hold right now caught up in court battles. And sources say Trump is expected to appeal them Tuesday. CNN's Paula Reid reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Supreme Court facing increasing pressure to weigh in on whether states can remove former President Trump from the 2024 ballot after Maine became the second state to kick him off based on the 14th Amendment's ban on insurrectionists holding public office. SHENNA BELLOWS (D), MAINE SECRETARY OF STATE: No Secretary of State has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access based on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. But no presidential candidate has ever engaged in insurrection and been disqualified under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. REID (voice-over): In Maine ballot eligibility questions, first, go to the Secretary of State, not the courts. Trump has called for Democrat Shenna Bellows to recuse herself in this case because of previous comments about January 6th, where she tweeted, the Jan. 6th insurrection was an unlawful attempt to overthrow the results of a free and fair election. She did not remove herself from the matter. And now the issue heads to the courts, as Trump and the state's Republican Party vowed to appeal.",

Even California on Thursday opted to include him. In a statement the Trump campaign accused Colorado and Maine of election interference, attempted theft of an election and the disenfranchisement of the American voter. Even some of Trump's rivals have criticized States taking him out of the running instead of leaving it to voters. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It makes him a martyr. You know, he's very good at playing poor me, poor me. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Can you have a Republican secretary of state disqualify Biden from the ballot because he's led in 8 million people illegally. REID (voice-over): The Colorado GOP has already appealed that state's ruling to the United States Supreme Court, asking the justices to take up three key questions. Does Section 3 of the 14th Amendment apply to a president? And is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to be enforced by states and also asking whether the GOP has a First Amendment right to choose its candidates. Trump is also expected to appeal. DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They're trying to take the election away from the voters. (END VIDEOTAPE) REID (on camera): Even in states like Michigan and Minnesota where they opted to keep Trump on the primary ballot, those judges left the door open to relitigate this issue in the general election. So the Supreme Court does not weigh in here. This is an issue that could hang over the 2024 election through November. Victor?",

You have a situation in Maine where every state, Victor, as we know, has a governor and a legislature. The legislature, of course, has the authority to make the laws and the governor enforces and decides to sign or veto those laws. It happens to be that in Maine, the Secretary of State is delegated that authority by the state legislature. What authority? The authority to determine ballot access.In doing so, there was a hearing held. In doing so, she had a 34 pages decision. I'm speaking of Ms. Bellows, the Secretary of State, a Democrat, in which she determined that the President engaged in an insurrection and indeed there was an insurrection and that she has the authority as given to her by the legislature to make the decision and so she did. In Colorado, the distinction would be that the process provides for the courts to make the decision. But even in Maine though, Victor, we know that Ms. Bellows, the Secretary of State said put her decision on hold until the courts do get involved. So ultimately, it's going to the courts. And the last distinction very briefly, is that of course, because the Colorado courts have already weighed in that is now right to go to the United States Supreme Court. In Maine, however, determinations have to be made through those courts before it could get to the United States Supreme Court. But that's where it needs to go and needs to go quickly.",

And even that visit earlier this month from President Zelenskyy to Washington did not necessarily convince some of these Republicans of the necessity for more American assistance.And what President Biden is trying to do is to use this aerial assault, this largest of barrage of rockets since the war began to make the point that American assistance has actually saved lives in Ukraine, including just yesterday through the things like the Patriot missile batteries, other defense systems that have allowed the Ukrainians to protect themselves. And in the statement, the President says, unless Congress takes urgent action in the new year, we will not be able to continue sending the weapons and vital air defense systems Ukraine needs. We cannot let our allies and partners down. History will judge harshly those who fail to answer freedom's call. And remember, Victor, this is all cut up in these discussions over immigration, Republicans, Democrats trying to come up with some new rules for the southern border that would be partnered with the $60 billion that President Biden is requesting in additional assistance to Ukraine. Now, just earlier this week, the White House said it had essentially expended all of the existing authorizations. It announced $250 million in new assistance that was essentially the bottom of the barrel. They say that any new assistance will require congressional approval. Whether this new assault on Ukraine, this reminder of the continuation of this war is enough to convince the skeptical Republicans I think remains to be seen.",

So the scope of this latest attack from Russia, 158 drones and missiles, according to Ukrainian officials, striking schools, homes, churches, President Zelenskyy says Russia through nearly every type of weapon in its arsenal into this wave of strikes. From a military strategic perspective, is it clear to you why this is happening now? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, good morning, Victor. Well, the best way to describe this is, this was a coordinated attack ended. What it shows is Russia's ability to put together a an effort that encompasses all elements of it's almost all elements of its power. The one key element missing, of course, was nuclear, chemical, biological. And that, of course, we don't want you to see on the battlefield ever in Ukraine. But what the Russians were able to do was mount this coordinated attack, which is a complex military operation. And they clearly went after targets that they had in essence telegraphed that they will go after. They did this last year. And they're doing it this year for the winter. They wonder if it really destroy the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine and basically render the country uninhabitable. So that is the Russian military strategy. And they are doing what they can to make it work. In essence, what they're doing, Victor, is they're throwing the kitchen sink at this problem. It is one way in which to do this, but overwhelming forces what they're trying to show here. And it remains to be seen if they actually have more weapons inside their capacity to do this.

So what the Russians could do is figure out the data from the radar returns on the Polish side and see how well the Polish radar systems and other systems track the incoming missile.And given that they can then figure out what kinds of things they might use if they were ever to attack Poland.

The Broncos owe him $39 million next season whether he's on the team or not. So the issue was an injury clause that would give Wilson another $37 million if he cannot pass a physical in March. The Broncos wanted to change that, Wilson said no way. And that's why he is now benched and the team appears to be moving on from him after this season, despite all the money that he's owed.
