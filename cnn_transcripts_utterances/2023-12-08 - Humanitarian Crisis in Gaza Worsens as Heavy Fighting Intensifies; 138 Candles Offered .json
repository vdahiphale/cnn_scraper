And it also specified that in a two-hour series, it says, of precise strikes, it killed numerous terrorists, it says. But we also know that hospitals in Khan Younis were taking in dozens of casualties as well. And you mentioned, Kim, the death toll according to the Hamas-run health ministry now more than 17,000. The IDF says that it's killed around 5,000 militants. But even If those figures both from the Hamas- run health ministry and the IDF are accurate, that still leaves a very large number of civilians to have been killed since the fighting began after that October the 7th attack by Hamas.

They had various different tiers, different parts of the country and different restrictions.And that's evidenced by the fact that, of course, Boris Johnson famously didn't respect his own lockdown rules and broke them in Downing Street and other people in Downing Street broke them multiple times while other people in the U.K. were strictly adhering to these rules, not being allowed to go and see their loved ones dying in hospitals, not being able to go to funerals of people they loved.

Bartov said he found no evidence of fraud in Trump's business deals.CNN's Brynn Gingras has that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Trump expected to take the stand on Monday as the final witness for the defense in the civil fraud trial that is really nearing an end after about two months. But in the courtroom for the defense, the second to final witness is an accounting expert that really was the strongest witness for the defense that we have seen yet. Really this witness basically said that the statement, the financial statements of condition that are at the heart of this case, which of course, if you remember, the New York Attorney General has said had over inflated assets done by the Trumps and they did it intentionally. This witness countered that for the defense, basically saying that they weren't out of the ordinary that no accounting principles were violated and that he and his judgment hasn't even seen a case of fraud here and even questioned the attorney general as to why they even brought this case forward. So really the strongest witness that the defense has put forward, the former president sitting at the defense table listening to this testimony. But again, the big day, the big final day will be Trump when he finally does take the stand in this trial that has started really in October, and we won't hear a final decision. Of course, the judge making that final decision until January. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

India has a population of 1.4 billion people, the largest population in the world by a country and it has needs to manage of these 1.4 billion people. Employment, electricity, there are still millions of people who cannot rely on steady electricity here in India and therefore the reliance on coal and therefore more production of coal fired plants in India and India is clear they need to depend on coal for a while at least. There is a self-imposed deadline of 2070 for net zero emissions for India but for now coal is the biggest source of energy here in India and it will be for a while. But also along with that India has made clear that they are into renewable energy. There's huge investment happening there and there needs to be a balance between both experts say, but that's going to take a while from now. Let's just take you through our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUD (voice-over): The world's two most populous nations are deepening their reliance on fossil fuels. Governments in India and in China, home to almost 3 billion people combined, want to satisfy a growing need for energy by burning more coal. Both are pledging greater coal-fired power capacity and putting their net-zero ambitions in doubt. There will be no compromise on power needed for growth, India's Minister for Power, R.P. Singh said last month, even if it means addition of coal-based capacity. In November, the United Nations production gap report revealed that if all the coal projects currently planned around the world materialize, we will burn 460 percent more coal in 2030 than water be consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.",
