It's not the first time he has mentioned jail. But, this threat appears to be the most serious. Now, that's after Judge Juan Merchan found the former President in contempt of court for the 10th time before testimony began today. And the dramatic moment follows Friday's emotional testimony from former Trump confidant Hope Hicks. She delivered a gripping account of how the Trump campaign mobilized following the release of the Access Hollywood tape in 2016.Today, we're following maybe slightly less gripping testimony from the former longtime controller at the Trump Organization, but nonetheless, important. And because we don't have cameras in court, you'll notice on the left side of your screen, we've got real time updates coming from our reporters inside. CNN Correspondent Jessica Schneider joins us now. So, Jessica, can you just explain who we're hearing testimony from today, and why they're so important in the case that the prosecution is trying to build?",

      "sentences": "This witness, Omar, is helping prosecutors get to the heart of these false business records charges. What we're hearing from now is Jeffrey McConney. He worked as the Corporate Controller at the Trump Organization. Prosecutors are saying that he is the one who really maneuvered and helped arrange this reimbursement to Michael Cohen for that Stormy Daniels hush money payments. McConney is actually in his probably hour plus of testimony. He has gotten very detailed about the repayment. So, we're seeing how McConney's notes about how Cohen would be paid,he'd be paid monthly out of notably Donald Trump's personal account, and how the total repayment would be $360,000 plus a $60,000 bonus, even though as you'll remember, the hush money payment was only $130,000, McConney saying that that additional money accounted for the taxes that would be taken out. And really, this is just the second time, aside from what we heard from David Pecker's testimony, that the jury is hearing really the nitty-gritty details of this money exchange, of course, that is at the heart of this criminal trial. So, earlier in McConney's testimony, we heard him talk about, and again, this might be key about how carefully Donald Trump was tuned into his finances, even at one point Donald Trump noticed that one week his cash ledger was down from the previous week. So, just recently, in the past few minutes, actually, we've heard from McConney really talking about how the payment to Michael Cohen was labeled as legal expenses, and that it was also being made as part of a retainer. But, notably, when prosecutors asked, did you ever see any written retainer? McConney said, no. So, again, all going to the actual charges in this case of falsifying business records. So, Omar, this witness, he is getting into the particulars of this cash exchange, something that we haven't heard from other witnesses. David Pecker outlined the broad contours of this scheme. But now, prosecutors have the controller for the Trump Organization testifying as to the exact way that this repayment was made, and kind of showing how it wasn't exactly following usual protocol. So, this could be a -- it's a bit of a dry testimony, not an exciting witness, per se, but could be crucial to the prosecution. Omar.",

How hands on he was to operate this whole thing going to what the prosecution needs to show, to show his criminal intent? And again, both before he was President, after he was President, how did it change? His behavior being the same. For the defense, they painted her as a reluctant witness, one who was,in their opinion, sort of characterizing her testimony, bending to the prosecution, not really wanting to be there and explaining in their cross-examination that some of what the prosecution has said she was testifying about wasn't exactly correct, that her memory was sort of being molded by the prosecution. So, both sides making points. And for the defense, that means that they're asking the jury to sort of doubt what she is saying about how much Trump knew about what was going on inside, and that she is not necessarily telling them what the prosecution wants to hear.

We are just told that she will do it at some point.Now, for Johnson's part, he sees this as a complete waste of time and a bad look for Republicans, as he is trying to govern and keep his very narrow majority and divided majority together. Greene maintains that she has a lot of support for this effort, but only two Republicans have signed on to her resolution.

It follows that roundtable we saw earlier when there was also the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. This is a trip that starts with arguably the toughest crowd that Xi Jinping is going to meet amongst Europeans in the shape of the European Commission leader and Emmanuel Macron that will end, Rahel, over in Serbia and Hungary with much friendlier voices in terms of their stand towards Beijing.And the reason these ties have been so complicated, if you cast your mind back to that visit you mentioned five years ago, Rahel, it was a much different Western Europe that was greeting President Xi Jinping. You'll remember that Italy had gone so far as to join China's Belt and Braces Initiative, only withdrawing formally this March. Since, of course, a lot has happened, not just COVID, but of course the war in Ukraine. And there is a great deal of unease here in Europe about the continued selling by Beijing of many of those dual-part components that are helping Russia's economy and argue Europeans its war economy, and that's going to be part of the subject of the conversations here in Paris. Also, of course, at the heart of their disquiet, the Europeans that is, there is the looming trade war with Beijing that you mentioned, not only the probes by the EU into what they consider suspect, maybe unfair practices, a great deal of unsettled voices within Europe's automobile industry as a result of the flooding of the European market by specifically Chinese electrical vehicles, but also suspicions of unfair practices is a subject of probes. There has also been a counter step by Beijing looking into the fairness of France's cognac exports towards the country. And that looming trade war, of course, is the background to these talks, much more fraught than, Rahel, than they were five years ago when Europe was arguing against Washington that it was a much more constructive relationship that was needed with Beijing. It is to take down to settle some of those ruffled feathers that Xi Jinping is here, and from the point of view of the Europeans, to see what room for maneuver there is in seeking to maintain their cooperation with Beijing, even as they seek some reassurances on some of those fears that I mentioned, Rahel.",

But, it will take some pretty substantial concessions on the part of Beijing for Europe to change. It's much different approach and one that has hardened substantially these last few months. What Europe is talking about now, Rahel, is de-risking, not decoupling. They make that distinction. But, they really want to wean themselves off their dependency from Beijing. It's difficult to see what Xi Jinping might offer that would lead Europe to change that tack. Remember that this is a continent and the European Union under a greatdeal of pressure itself economically. It's difficult to see what might be done, at least the veneer of continued dialogue. And as we heard from Xi Jinping this morning, his hope that more can be done to increase cooperation and perhaps at best, Rahel, averse that fear of an all-out trade war that is looming so greatly right now.",

      "sentences": "Well, for months now, Rahel, the Israeli military has threatened a ground offensive into Rafah. That offensive has been delayed as these ceasefire negotiations have been ongoing in recent weeks with hopes that perhaps an agreement could be brokered between Israel and Hamas to see dozens of hostages release, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and of course, a ceasefire that would avert this major ground offensive into Rafah. But, those negotiations are now stalled.And as a result, what we are seeing is the Israeli military carrying out what appeared to be the first stages to lay the groundwork for that ground offensive and that is ordering tens of thousands of people in eastern Rafah to begin evacuating north. Thousands of leaflets were dropped early this morning. People received phone calls and text messages as well. But, now the question is, will the area where they're being directed to go, will it be adequate for tens of thousands of people to live in? The Israeli military has said that it has brought in additional tents, food, water, medicine, including field hospitals set up in the Al-Muwasi, an expanded humanitarian zone that also now includes western Khan Younis and parts of central Gaza. But, humanitarian aid officials have raised severe concerns that the area is not adequate enough for so many people to be able to live in, and also concerns that while this initial evacuation order is limited to eastern Rafah with 100,000 people living there, that fear and panic could quickly spread to the rest of that city in Gaza where 1.4 million Palestinians are currently estimated to be living, and that if tens of thousands more people beyond those in eastern Rafah begin to move to that humanitarian Zone, it could quickly be overwhelmed, and we could be facing a very dire humanitarian situation. So, a lot of moving parts here to keep an eye on. Those ceasefire negotiations, while they have stalled, they are still ongoing, with the CIA Director in the region trying to desperately broker an agreement that could perhaps avert the sight of Israeli tanks and troops moving into Rafah.",

So, certainly, as Jeremy said, negotiations for some kind of agreement to enable the release of some Israeli hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a potential ceasefire or a potential pause in the fighting have yet again stalled here. The proposal on the table is one that was proposed by Egypt that the U.S. has termed quote, \"very generous.\" It would engineer essentially the release of about 33 hostages in exchange for a pause in fighting.The big sticking point here, though, Rahel, is that Hamas, at this point, is refusing to accept the terms of those deals -- with that deal without some commitment from Israel to essentially end the conflict or essentially end the fighting. And this is something that Israel has been unwilling to do. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, of course, under a lot of pressure from the right wing of his governing coalition to prioritize the dismantling of Hamas over even the release of prisoners. That said, Rahel, even though we are in this sort of this impasse moment, U.S. officials clearly don't yet believe that the deal is dead. CIA Director Bill Burns, as you mentioned, remains in Doha today after being in Cairo yesterday. He will remain in the region to continue trying to kind of engineer some kind of a deal, bring this deal to fruition. But, of course, the stakes couldn't be higher here for Rafah. U.S. officials believing that Israel's warnings about going into Rafah, about this operation in Rafah are certainly in part intended as a pressure tactic on Hamas to try to get them to agree to this deal. There is also some logistical challenges here. There is certainly a sense that the leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, would have to agree to this proposal, and communication inside Gaza and with him has occasionally been very difficult. So, as Jeremy said, lots of moving parts here and very high stakes.",

But, to the same extent, she gave them the flavor of what was going on inside the Trump Organization, as all of these different things were coming to light, things that were dangerous to his campaign, and how he was concentrating on his campaign, not on his family, and that it was all consuming during those last couple of weeks of the campaign.That's important, because the key to this is that the purpose, that is the more substantial purpose of what they were doing was to hide contributions they were making, in essence, to the campaign, and that they were hiding these payments to influence the campaign.

Take a look at this video of Nyando River. The death toll from flooding across the country has risen to 228 people, and authorities are warning that more heavy rainfall is expected in the north and the west regions. The Office of Kenya's President says that at least 72 people are still missing, and more than 1,600 people have evacuated from Nairobi after authorities listed high risk areas. For more now, let's bring in CNN Correspondent Larry Madowo, who joins us live from Nairobi. And Larry, I think the picture behind you really speaks for itself.

Larry, thanks so much.Meantime, here in the U.S., millions of people across the country also trying to deal and cope with deadly severe weather. Right now, parts of the Midwest are under the highest level of a tornado threat. This is happening as heavy rain drenched parts of Texas over the weekend, displacing thousands of people and forcing hundreds of rescues and killing at least one person. On Sunday, this four-year-old little boy, Lucas Warren, was swept away by floodwaters. Joining us now from Harris County, Texas, is CNN's Rosa Flores. Rosa, just an awful story there, and tornado threat now adding to the danger there for people. What are things like on the ground?",

She says that the family which included mom, dad and son, were driving home during a storm. There were floodwaters. This family was driving through a flooded area. Now, the mom says that there was no barricade blocking people, drivers from traversing in that area. And so, they kept on going. Well, lo and behold, the water was too strong. The battery of the vehicle died. Then water started going into the vehicle.And this mom telling NBC DFW that they went outside of the vehicle to try to get to higher ground, and then she describes the final moments when she last saw her son and she said this quote, \"a current came up real high, and just let go, and I didn't hear anything from him. I think he just went under.\" Now, this mother, who was devastated, says that first responders arrived moments later, but it of course was too late. The body of her son was recovered hours later, and she describes her son as just a bright and sweet little boy who was going to be turning five-years-old and just a few weeks. Now, Rahel, we reached out to the Johnson County Office of Emergency Management, that's the county that's just out of Dallas where this occurred, to ask about that road that was not barricaded and why? We received a statement from them, saying quote \"Until the 911 call that prompted our water rescue on County Road 528, there had been no calls reporting high water in the area. In that particular area of the county, there is around 250 miles of roadway that have to be checked, and can take some time to make evaluations. It's one of the reasons we stress that it's important for an individual's own safety not to drive into flooded roadways, even if they look passable.\" And Rahel, as I mentioned, this tragedy happened in Dallas. I'm in Harris County, which is close to Houston. That just gives you a sense of the magnitude of this storm. And I can tell you that the message from officials is always the same. If you see rising waters, if there is a street that has been swallowed by water, even if you think it looks passable, don't drive through the water because it can be extremely dangerous, and as we know in this case, deadly.
