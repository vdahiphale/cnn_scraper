How a room full of Canadian lawmakers ended up giving a standing o for a Ukrainian veteran who, it turns out, fought for the wrong side during World War II. After it was pointed out the guy fought with the Nazis, there's major new international repercussions today, including an apology from Justin Trudeau. Plus, look at this video. A night of looting in Center City, Philadelphia. Shocking images of lawlessness prompting even more serious questions about basic safety in our cities in the United States. And leading this hour, yes, the election music. You know I love it. A critical night in the Republican presidential race. Only seven will be allowed on the stage in this second debate instead of eight in the first round. Governor Asa Hutchinson, the one not making the cut tonight. Sorry, Governor. The dominant candidate in this primary race also will not be on stage, Donald Trump, though that is voluntarily. Instead, Mr. Trump going to Michigan with a message for union workers, though oddly, he's chosen to do so at a non-union plant. We'll get to that later. But let's start with a debate. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is in Simi Valley, California, where Republican candidates will take the stage in just a few hours. Jeff, who made the stage? And how critical of a night is this for candidates looking to break through, which is, to be honest, all of them.",

He also will be surrounded, this time by former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, as well as Ohio entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and the rest of the field goes out on the stage from there. But yes, this is a scramble for second place, a race to be seen as the Trump alternative.There's no doubt a lot has happened since that last debate in Milwaukee at the end of August. Certainly, there's a looming government shutdown, there is a massive strike that is, you know, potentially creating economic headwinds and waves in Michigan. Abortion policy is also much more front and center than it was even a month ago because of Donald Trump's own comments. So those are some of the new issues. But many of these candidates, many of these campaigns simply want to have this night without Donald Trump to make their case, to make their introduction directly to the voters, largely of Iowa, largely of New Hampshire who are consuming a steady diet of Trump news. So they are trying to sort of get beyond that to make their own cases here. Of course, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, we're told, is going to go directly after the former president. That, of course, has been the centerpiece of his campaign. But, Jake, what we're looking for here tonight are some of those new cross currents. The race has changed a bit since that last debate. Nikki Haley has been on the rise, at least somewhat. The Florida governor certainly has high stakes here in terms of trying to hold his position as the leading alternative, if you will. And, of course, former Vice President Mike Pence clearly also, he's on the end of the stage this time, still also trying to make his point as well and stay in this contest. As you said, Asa Hutchison is not on the stage tonight, Jake. Seven are, but the next debate will not be until November, so this could be one of the biggest opportunities for all of these candidates to break through.",

If they were still focusing solely on the primaries, we'd likely see him in South Carolina or Iowa or New Hampshire. But instead, he is giving a primetime address to working class voters in the swing state of Michigan.Now, a reminder, these voters and this state helped deliver him the White House in 2016, and it helped deliver President Biden the White House in 2020. And Trump wants to take some of those voters back. Now, obviously, we're in a very different scenario than were in 2016 because Trump has a political record. And one that union leaders have almost excoriated calling pro-business, anti-worker, anti-union. But the Trump advisors tell me they believe they can drive a wedge between these union leaders and the rank file members. And they certainly want to show that tonight. I just want to show you over my shoulder here, Donald Trump always won for optics. They are going to fill a pen that is flanking Donald Trump while he speaks tonight with union members who are in support of Trump. And of course, they are all going to be holding up signs that say Union Members in support of Trump. So clearly trying to give that visual there. We know that he's going to be focused a lot on the economy tonight. The big question, of course, is whether or not he can actually get these union members to vote for him in 2024.",

And he's gotten bigger and bigger on it in recent weeks, essentially saying that it will kill American jobs, that all the jobs are going to go overseas. Well, we heard from the president of Drake Enterprises, where this event is located at tonight, who said on Fox News that if electric cars were to take over, he would be out of business and everyone here would be out of a job.

Nikki Haley had a good debate, and she did.I don't think it was necessarily because of the debate performance.

Police reporting that there were more than 70 incidents related to looting last night. And as you said, it was all after really peaceful protests concerning that court decision about an officer who killed Eddie Irizarry back in August.But police wanted to make something very clear last night and today that they will continue to arrest those who are responsible for the looting and also that the looters were not protesters. They were, as police called them, criminal opportunists. So, Jake, here's how this all started. Basically, it started around 8:00 p.m., like you said, about 30 or 40 minutes after that protest by city hall had concluded. Then looters descended on a Foot Locker right here behind me in Center City. Police arrived, but then those people swarmed away. Then they went to a Lululemon, an Apple Store, and then other parts of Philadelphia as well. Jake, police say that some of the people may have spread the word about looting last night over social media and even suggested there may have been a caravan of a select group of people who were going to specific spots in Philadelphia. Police saying incredibly disrespectful and disgusting acts against citizens here in the city. But again, many arrests and, Jake, we're seeing more Philadelphia police resources tonight out in the city behind us. Jake?",
