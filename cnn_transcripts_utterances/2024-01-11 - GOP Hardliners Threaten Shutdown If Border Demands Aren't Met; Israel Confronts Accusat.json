You know, it's these folks that are more worried about their portfolios than they are, the people of this great country that have gotten us into this mess.You know, we want to blame the left and Congress, and I want to blame that noise that's coming over. Somebody's like drilling back there. But the reality, Boris, is that we've got our national chambers of commerce to blame for this thing. They've pushed for this. They want the cheap slave labor in our country. They don't care how they get it, and you know, again, they're the ones that, when you see the president rolling in, you always say, who's that out there on the tarmac? Well, I guarantee you, Boris, it's not going to be me, and it's not going to be you. It's going to be the big boys and girls that write those huge checks that don't give a rip about this country or they all -- when the country's doing great, they'll wave the flag but the reality is, the deep state is real. It's both parties. They don't see black or white, they see the color green, and they will wreck this country to get it. And they do not care, because they'll still have it. They'll be in great shape. Their money will be overseas somewhere, and I'll show her account somewhere, and they'll survive and the rest of us will not. And they really don't care. So, to me, the fight is much bigger than the Republicans or the Democrats. Because in the history of this world, I doubt that we'll be a footnote. But I'll tell you, this great country, if we let it fall, we will be at fault for it, before just mainly for our own greed. SANCHEZ: Congressman, I will put a pin on your reference to cheap slave labor. I'm not sure if that was a reference to immigration, but I want to move on to something else and we could pick that up some other time. The drama unfolding at the Oversight Committee yesterday, you were on hand for Hunter Biden showing up during a hearing, leaving after a few minutes, seemingly trying to show that he's unafraid of answering lawmakers' questions. Chairman James Comer, back in October, offered to let Hunter testify publicly with a transcript to be -- or rather, he offered to let him testify publicly months ago. Now, he wants him to testify privately. Why not just let him answer your questions in front of the world?",

And the reason they do that is so that if somebody's innocent, say, if your name is mentioned in there, that it doesn't need to be. It's not part of the -- it's not -- it doesn't have anything to do with it. But you were casually mentioned in it or maybe some confidential bank records. Those are the type of things they filter through and they don't do in the public, and that possibly is the reason why.But really, I don't give a rip, Boris, get him in there. He's in contempt. He knows he is. Yesterday was just a show for both sides. You and I both know it. If we didn't have these things and the X or Twitter or Facebook or any of the others, that wouldn't have been a big deal. But it was, because it's instant gratification from both sides of the aisle, and you and I know it. It's a game they play, and it's unfortunate.",

And joining us now, we have Law Professor at Rutgers University, also the author of Law and Morality at War, Adil Haque. Professor, thank you so much for being with us. What did you think about South Africa's argument today? ADIL HAQUE, LAW PROFESSOR, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY: So I think South Africa made a very powerful argument that if the International Court of Justice follows its prior case law, established in cases like Gambia versus Myanmar, then it should find for South Africa, it should find that South Africa's claims are plausible, that there is a direct link between South Africa's claims and the measures that it's seeking, and that those measures are urgently needed to prevent irreparable harm to Palestinian civilians. I also think South Africa made a powerful moral argument that the court should follow the law established by its prior cases without fear or favor, even though this is obviously a very controversial case with high stakes and the court is likely to face criticism and even condemnation should it rule in South Africa's favor.",

Whether you think it is genocide or not, this is a humanitarian crisis of horrific proportions that South Africa is trying to stop.So to suggest that it is somehow acting as the legal arm of Hamas is really just not appropriate. South Africa actually addressed this criticism in its argument today. And it explained that because the International Court of Justice only has jurisdiction over states, it cannot adjudicate Hamas' responsibility under international law. But there is another body that can, and that is the International Criminal Court. And South Africa has referred the situation in Palestine to the International Criminal Court, giving the prosecutor the power to investigate Hamas as well as the Israeli defense forces. Technically, the court had that jurisdiction already, but South Africa has supported the International Criminal Court in investigating individual criminal responsibility by Hamas as well as by members of the Israel Defense Forces. So I think this particular charge of hypocrisy is misdirected and not founded, in fact.",

Bomani Jones himself, what do you think of this? What you heard just then from Bill Belichick? BOMANI JONES, SPORTS ANALYST AND PODCAST HOST, \"THE RIGHT TIME WITH BOMANI JONES\": Well, I mean, I don't think it was terribly surprising that Bill Belichick, I mean, ultimately got fired. I think they dressed this up pretty nicely, but that didn't sound like a man, (inaudible), right? Like, I'm pretty sure this man got fired. And given his performance this year over the last couple of years, if a player had analogous performance to Bill Belichick, Bill Belichick would have fired him with a heartbeat. In a heartbeat, it wouldn't matter. If he was the man, all the Patriots held me with that hat on, he'd have fired that dude. So, I mean, I think it's just fine. Like, I had nothing emotional about seeing Belichick go because he had been successful for that long and it was incredible. And when he stopped being successful, he moved on with Saban. I had been kind of expecting this one for a year or so, and I don't think most people did, but I think that coaches of his generation and his level of accomplishment are looking around at the current landscape of college football and are saying to themselves, why am I doing like? Like this is a lot more stressful than it used to be. I got all my money. I got all my accomplishments. There's got to be a better way to live.",

Like, I don't think with Tom Landry got put out to pasture in 1989 that his thought was, OK, well, I could never coach again. He didn't -- I don't know how hard he tried, but I'm also not sure how interested somebody was going to be at hiring a coach of that age at that time. So let's see what happens with him.

The class of 2001 recruiting class that he brought in, that changed everything at that place.
