He didn't want to be pictured with veterans who were wounded.But then you have families of these 13, largely, who feel seen by former President Trump. And they do not feel seen by the Biden administration. That's very clear when you talk to a lot of them. We had Paula Knauss Selph self on yesterday. She's the mother of Army Staff Sergeant Ryan Christian Knauss, who died at Abbey Gate. And then on the other hand, you have this sacred space, right, where so many servicemembers are buried beyond these 13 and there are rules so that their memory is not a political tool. How do you make sense of these competing interests?",

So fine, civilians are allowed to endorse anybody they want. But not to use that portion of Arlington National Cemetery for partisan political purposes.

Most importantly, the rocket that was supposed to be used in the company's ambitious Polaris Dawn mission, which is now in limbo.Kristin Fisher joins us now live. Kristin, why is this getting grounded? KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: So, last night, SpaceX had three big launches planned for its workhorse, the Falcon Nine rocket, one crewed mission for the Polaris Dawn crew, and then to uncrewed to get Starlink satellites up to space. The crewed Polaris Dawn mission scrubbed due to weather. Then they moved on to this uncrewed Starlink launch. And they successfully got all those satellites up to space. But the booster that propels those satellites up to space, SpaceX does something that nobody else does with this booster and it lands the booster on something called a drone ship after it gets its payloads into orbit. And so last night, it suffered a very rare explosion on a drone ship. And this is a booster that is flown to space and back over 20 times. So it happened out in the middle of the ocean. Nobody hurt. Nothing was severely damaged other than this drone ship and the booster. But the FAA says they are now investigating this as a mishap investigation.",

And then, SpaceX can resume it's launches.But it could have an impact. It could also significantly impact the launch of the Polaris Dawn crew, which is, right now, waiting to launch in quarantine. But, you know, Boris, I think this really points out why NASA has been so vocal about wanting two American-made spacecrafts functioning and working to get its astronauts to and from the International Space Station. As you can see, just one little thing can ground the spacecraft. And so you always want a backup. That's why they want Starliner to work. But, of course, we know what happened there. It's not flying these astronauts home anytime soon.",

Violation of these rights only deepen the crisis and hinder efforts towards a peaceful and Democratic trends position.\" Let's get the latest from CNN's Stefano Pozzebon, who's in the region for us.

      "sentences": "That's right, Boris, Brianna. Desperate measures. Namibia having to kill wildlife to feed people who are starving. And yet, the country is seeing it as a necessary evil.In fact, the Ministry of Environment, they're calling it sustainability intervention. Why? Because these animals will die anyway, because of this drought, the worst in 100 years. And the practical parts of this, first, they will come from areas that the government says have sustainable game numbers. And they will be killed by professional hunters and distributed to people in need all across the country. So that is the background for that. What kind of animal that we're talking about? It's a fascinating number of different species. We're talking about here 83 elephants, 60 buffaloes, 30 hippos, 300 zebras, 100 blue wildebeest, 15 impalas, and 100 elands. So these are some of the animals that are earmarked for that. Already about 150 animals have been killed, providing more than 125,000 pounds of game meat to those that are in need across the country. And yet, most of the southern part of Africa facing the worst drought in a century. Because of the linear weather phenomenon, rain has dried out there. And this has been exacerbated by the climate crisis. And the other part of this is because the water is dried up, the grazing lands are in limited supply. There's been some deadly human wildlife conflict. So especially the elephants have been going into people's homes and the people fight back. And so this is part of the reason why 83 elephants are a part of this. That's a big number. Elephants are protected in many parts of the world. But southern Africa has a population of about 200,000 elephants. So this will not make a big dent in that. But still, truly desperate measures to see a country having to kill wildlife to just feed the people who are at risk of starvation, almost half the population -- Boris, Brianna?",

And they're poached for, sometimes for bushmeat, but largely for their ivory.A lot of these other animals now find themselves in peril because of drought. People are now going to protect these spaces, not just in Namibia, but in Kenya and Tanzania. They're now going to national parks and preserves to graze their cattle for these nomadic communities that move from one place to the other to follow the range. But I don't know how -- how resilient these populations are already to survive in Namibia because it's a desert. They're on the edge of survival as it is. Namibia has far smaller populations of wildlife compared to other countries. So they find themselves in this desperate place. But it's quite shocking to see that they feel that they're at this recourse where they have to kill their own symbols of their natural heritage.",
