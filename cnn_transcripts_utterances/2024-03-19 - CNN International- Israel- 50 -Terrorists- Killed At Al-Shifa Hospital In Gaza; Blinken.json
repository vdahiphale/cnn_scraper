There are continuing calls for more land crossings to be opened. And in the absence of that, we are seeing more airdrops, and we're seeing the maritime corridor being used. But, repeatedly, humanitarian aid groups say that there is no substitute for being able to get aid in across these land crossings.Now, the UN-backed report, you mentioned then, did say that they believe that there could be famine in northern Gaza between now and mid-May. That is if the humanitarian situation doesn't change and if they are not able to get more trucks through the land crossings. Now, we have heard from World Food Programme. They said just a couple of days ago. They were able to get some 20 trucks, excuse me, 10 trucks into northern Gaza through a new route. So, these aid groups are still trying to find different routes to get to where they need to, to drop this aid off and distribute it to the desperate residents of Gaza. Less than a week ago, the Israeli military said that they had opened up a gate along the security fence between Israel and Gaza, and through that route the World Food Programme was able to access northern Gaza. That was a pilot program. We haven't heard that that's being used any more in the future. But, this is what the pressure is at this point, to open up more land crossings. We've heard it from the Biden administration. We've heard it from the international institutions, the WFP saying that there is a very small window now to be able to try and avert famine in the Gaza Strip. Rahel.",

We heard criticism from the Anti-Defamation League as well as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Biden White House and the Biden campaign.I'm going to read you just part of the statement from the Biden White House. Spokesperson Andrew Bates said \"There is no justification for spreading toxic, false stereotypes that threaten fellow citizens. None.\" And that's just one of, again, the responses that we have heard condemning Donald Trump's language. But look, from the Trump campaign side, they are leaning in. They are defending this. We heard from Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. She said quote, President Trump is right. The Democratic Party (sic) has turned into a full-blown, anti-Israel, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist cabal. So, as you can see, Rahel, very different responses to this language. But look, this is the type of rhetoric from Trump that isn't entirely new. It is far from the first time that the former President has targeted Jewish Democrats. Donald Trump is someone who claims, and I know personally, or he personally believed from my reporting, that he did far more for Israel than any other President in modern history. But, there isn't an interesting distinction as well about Donald Trump, and we got a glimpse of that during that podcast interview. He often conflates support for Israel with being supportive of the Jewish population despite trading in antisemitic stereotypes. And shortly after losing the 2020 election, Donald Trump lamented how his support for Israel didn't seem to translate to the ballot box with support from Jewish Americans. He felt at the time and still personally feels that Democrats wrongly got a lot of votes from Jewish people. So, much of this is political as well, Rahel.",

The ad that you just played is particularly targeting Latino voters, as the President heads out West to Nevada and Arizona as part of this nationwide tour of the battleground states in the post State of the Union.But, you're right. On the fundraising thing, this is one of the clear, bright spots for the Biden campaign. They've had a rocky few months with polls showing Biden trailing Trump across the key battleground states that both men need to win to secure the presidency. And this comes as Trump is also facing significant financial challenges related to his legal troubles. And so, it's really quite the contrast there on the fundraising front as well, the Biden campaign touting record fundraising in February, saying that they have the most cash on hand of any presidential candidate in history. And we're increasingly seeing them deploy those resources to try to frame this contest. This was the strategy that they wanted to sort of keep their powder dry, wait till it became a two-man race, Biden versus Trump, and then start to really deploy these resources in a way where they could frame it around this idea of a binary choice. It's either Trump or Biden. Obviously, there is third-party candidates that are complicating those efforts.

We've seen her be involved in a lot of the marketing around WeightWatchers. Well, late last year, she said that she was taking one of these new weight loss medications. She didn't say exactly which one.And then, last month, she said she was stepping down from WeightWatchers board and donating her proceeds from her shares in that company. She said last night that she had done that because she wanted to do this special without any perceived conflicts of interest around using these medicines. So, this was really focused a lot on these new drugs. Some critics, I saw both from the medical community and just sort of on social media, called it an infomercial for these medicines.

These are medicines both for type two diabetes when it comes to Ozempic and Mounjaro, and for chronic weight management in Wegovy and Zepbound.And the coverage for type two diabetes is a lot broader here in the United States, about 76 percent from employer insurance compared with only about a quarter who cover weight loss drugs, Rahel.

It was all part of a deal to end antitrust lawsuits brought by home sellers. And this could be a game changer for buyers and sellers, especially as sales have slumped amid high mortgage rates. And it also got us wondering, how does the six percent commission stack up internationally? Well, to put that in perspective, The New York Times reported a 4.5 percent commission is more average in Germany, 2.5 percent in Australia, and 1.3 percent in the UK.For more on this, let me bring in Eugene James. He is a longtime housing expert, and co-owner and broker at Atlanta Real Estate Consultants. Eugene, good to have you. This is really -- a really big story. And so, we're so glad to have some perspective today. First, when people hear the difference between the commission here in the U.S. versus everywhere else in the world, how do you sort of explain the six percent fee structure? Is it always more work for six percent? EUGENE JAMES, CO-OWNER AND BROKER AT THE ATLANTA REAL ESTATE CONSULTANTS, &amp; LONGTIME HOUSING EXPERT: Well, thanks for having me on board. But, it is kind of hard to compare U.S. commission versus throughout the rest of the world. I think it's really important to understand that here in the U.S. there are typically two real estate agents involved with each transaction. You have the listing agent or the selling agent, and the buyer agent. So, the commission does get split. I understand sometimes in other parts of the world, it doesn't happen like that. But, nevertheless, as far as I can remember, and I've been in business 25, 30 years, even if you go beyond that, it's been around six percent, five percent or six percent in the U.S. since who knows how long. So, it's time for change. I think change is good.",

Now, they're going to be ready to negotiate with you. And if they're not ready to negotiate with you, interview some other agents.

And so, if the commission was less than normal, they tend to steer people away from even seeing that house, which is why discounted brokerage companies that were listing houses for sale, it was taking longer to sell those houses.Now, one of the changes that might be happening as a result of this huge lawsuit is commissions may go away. You may not be able to see them in the multi-listing service. Now, if that happens, that would be a huge change and you won't have to worry about agents steering people away from seeing your home if you're offering a two percent or three percent commission rate versus a six percent.
