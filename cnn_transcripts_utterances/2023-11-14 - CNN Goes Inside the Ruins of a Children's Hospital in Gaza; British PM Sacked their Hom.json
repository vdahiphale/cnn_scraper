During a meeting at the White House Monday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said the United States must do more to stop quote, \"atrocities in Gaza.\" Mr. Biden did not respond to those comments.Meantime, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is acknowledging discord within the State Department over the Biden administration's policies on the wall. In an email to staff, Mr. Blinken wrote, some people in the department may disagree with approaches we are taking or have views on what we can do better. We have organized forums in Washington to hear from you and urged managers and teams to have candid discussions. We're listening. What you share is informing our policy and our messages. I do want to bring in CNN's Clare Sebastian who joins us live from London. Good morning to you Clare. So of course as we're reporting international pressure intensifying on Israel to declare a ceasefire and the U.S. President is feeling that mounting pressure too. So what is the latest on all of this? CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Rosemary, we had an acknowledgement on this from within the highest levels of the Israeli government, the foreign minister on Monday saying that essentially he sees that international pressure is mounting and they have around two to three weeks before it really intensifies. Now we have already seen it intensify. We're seeing repeated calls from aid agencies for a ceasefire amnesty this week calling on E.U. leaders to demand one. We're seeing the Arab and Muslim world of course unite around that call for a ceasefire. French President Emmanuel Macron at the end of last week coming out and saying there is no other solution than a pause, he said, going to a ceasefire. Now, as to whether this is weakening the resolve of Israel's regards its operation in Gaza, it doesn't seem like there's any evidence of that at the moment the foreign minister said even when those two to three weeks elapsed and they see this international press pressure increasing that does not mean that Israel will change course and a similar sentiment, Rosemary, we heard from the Prime Minister Netanyahu on Monday. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): This is neither an operation or a realm but a war to the end. It is important to me that you know this. This is not lip service, but from the heart and mind. If we do not finish them, it will come back. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They are, it seems, still some distance away from calling for a ceasefire, though. And President Biden, you saw him on Monday choosing his words extremely carefully around what's happening in the hospital, saying that it's his expectation that there will be less intrusive action, he said.And we later heard from the White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, speaking to CNN's Jake Tapper, who re- clarified exactly what the president had meant by that. Take a listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESPERSON: When you bury those targets inside civilian infrastructure, particularly a hospital where there's innocent patients and little kids who have severe issues that need looking after, it makes it much harder for any military force to go after those targets because the hospital itself ought to be, as the president said, ought to be protected. So he's really talking about this incredibly difficult conundrum that Israeli military forces are facing right now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We've seen staffers in USAID also come out and demand the president do more to push for a ceasefire. There's also been protests in the U.S. There was a protest here in London which culminated at the U.S. embassy. I think it's clear that certainly there is a view that while the U.S. may not be explicitly to blame for what's happened, they may have the power to push Israel to do more to protect civilians.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIPE LAZZARINI, COMMISSIONER-GENERAL, UNRWA: I really hope that we are now reaching the threshold where we say enough is enough. And I do believe that today we have more and more leaders who are genuinely calling for an humanitarian ceasefire. I don't have the confidence that there will be a ceasefire anytime soon, but I'm seeing a shift in the narrative with a certain number of leaders who recently were still reluctant to call for an humanitarian ceasefire and now seeing the death toll in the Gaza Strip say there is no other avenue than to lead to this. So I'm still hoping that all those with influence will succeed to, you know, to impact the decision for a ceasefire. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They are now taking the journey by foot because there is no fuel to transport them from the north to the south. Unfortunately, the situation is very, very hard.
