The 50-mile race, at one from Manchester to Liverpool in England and race organizers now say she didn't actually run the whole thing. The marathoner even admits that she had taken a ride in a friend's car for a portion of the competition.CNN's Carolyn Manno joins us now with more on this. Carolyn, a runner is apologizing very much -- very -- apologizing, like it's very forcefully. But what else happened here? There's more of this. CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, she says, Kate, that it wasn't malice that it was a miscommunication. This is Scottish Ultra marathoner, Joasia Zakrzewski. And she admits that she made what she calls a massive error and actually accepting a third- place trophy for finishing this Ultra event in Liverpool. It's 50 miles long. It took place in England a couple of weeks ago. She's 47 years old, and she told the BBC that she felt tired. She felt sick around the halfway mark of the race when she decided to jump in a friend's car up to that next checkpoint. And she said that when she got to that next checkpoint, she told the race marshals that she had done that. But they urged her on. They said if you don't finish, you really regret it. So in her mind, according to her, she said she continued to do so but in a non-competitive way. Now, that doesn't necessarily sync with accepting a third-place trophy for not being competitive. The fourth-place runner in that race, a woman named Mel Sykes has since been awarded that trophy on the women's side. She describes this as good news for her but ultimately bad for the sport because, of course, it leaves a stain on the legitimacy of all of this.",

And a lot of it does fall on race organizers to make sure that there are no errors like this or no foul play. And I think that's why we're learning about this two weeks later is because the data that was picked up on whatever tracking devices of these athletes were ultimately didn't sync up with the route. And so, once the race marshal and organizers found that out, we're still putting all the pieces together. So I don't want to give you an incorrect timeline or speculate.",
