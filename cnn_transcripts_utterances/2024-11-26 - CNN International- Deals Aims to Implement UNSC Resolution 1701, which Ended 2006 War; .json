Today's vote coming after weeks of painstaking negotiations. A short time ago, a series of Israeli air strikes hitting Beirut as the IDF delivers punishing blows on what it says are Hezbollah targets ahead of any truce.

Just to pick up on the last point that you mentioned, Becky, we've heard from theSpeaker of the French Parliament just these last couple of days about the fact that, yes, indeed, since that arrest warrant was issued by the Hague. France being a signatory to it, it would simply be applying the law by carrying out an arrest. But of course, this just the culmination, as you suggest, of a deteriorating relationship, frankly, over the course of the last few months. It was just after the opening of the second front with Lebanon that France took a much more active and vocal role in calling for arms embargoes against Israel. That particularly began by irking Israel. But it didn't stop there. There was the arrest in October on the sidelines of a visit by France's incoming foreign minister to Israel, of a couple of the policemen that were accompanying him, a minor flare up then as well. But as Emmanuel Macron has been critical of Israel, increasingly calling for European wide arms embargoes on Israel. We've seen Benjamin Netanyahu reacting very strongly almost each time he spoke. So, there is a lot of tension between the sides. And of course, this is important, not only because France has been playing an important role in the negotiations leading up to this ceasefire, but about what position it has in any monitoring process of the implementation of the ceasefire, if and when it gets accepted. There is sufficient tension between Tel Aviv and Paris that we understand that there are a number of Israeli concerns about how closely involved France will remain in that implementation and monitoring process. And yet, for Lebanon, for the Arab World, more widely, an important presence in these negotiations to counter what has been seen increasingly over the more than last year now as a very one-sided American approach to the conflict in support of Israel, almost to the exclusion of everything else. The interests of the Lebanese international law at times, these are the kind of things that have been at the heart of what French officials have been raising over the course of last few months, and why the wider world will be very keen that France should remain involved Becky.",

Later in the afternoon, they were joined by counterparts from the Arab World, the key stakeholders in that region, to further discuss the situation in Lebanon, in Gaza, in the broader Middle East, and how to deal with the escalations there. Today, the ministerial focused on Ukraine in the morning, they were joined by the Ukrainian Foreign Minister. And of course, it's important that they are discussing these Becky not only because we have seen them just broil into even more of a conflict, particularly between Ukraine and Russia in recent days, but also because there's no clear resolution to the majority of these conflicts. Of course, it seems that perhaps we are on the verge of a deal for Lebanon. However, we've been here before. We have seen U.S. officials be optimistic in the past, only for that optimism to be dashed in Gaza.

This is the important step that the Justice Department is taking to ask for the dismissal of the ongoing January 6 criminal case against Donald Trump. And Donald Trump alone for obstructing Congress conspiracy related to the 2020 election. That case, they said we have to dismiss it, not because our belief in the case changed, but because the circumstances changed, because he is the president-elect, and this case has to be dismissed before Donald Trump is inaugurated. It is just too much of a burden around the presidency to have someone who is holding that office facing even the specter of a case like this, if they were to have just paused it. So, they are asking for the full dismissal. The judge agreed with that. Then there's a separate case, the classified documents case against Donald Trump, which was already dismissed, but that the Justice Department was trying to revive in an appeals court. They said, because of the immunity, the same type of immunity around the presidency. We're going to have to pull that appeal against Donald Trump, but there is still an appeal that's ongoing where the Justice Department is fighting for the ability to use special prosecutors in the southern states, including Florida, where that case was brought. And so that appeal does continue on, Donald Trump and his justice department, they're going to have to make some decisions about what to do when they do come into office. They may disagree with the Justice Department on this idea that this is only a temporary protection around the presidency. That's how it's set up now, but this is really the finality of these two cases against Donald Trump that were charged last year and have become such a monumental moment for history. This is an important point in history too, where the Justice Department has decided how to end these.",

He will write a report. That report will be handed over to the attorney general, and Attorney General Merrick Garland has promised that he will release that report. Now, what it says might not be much different than we already know about these cases. We know a lot about them. They were indicted, charged in court, so we saw those charging documents. We saw additional proceedings around them. So, in the January 6 case, we got a monumental court record of all of the evidence the Justice Department believes that they could have taken to trial that just came out a couple months ago. So that's very likely to be replicated in the report. And one more thing to note, Becky, whenever you mention how the Justice Department feels about these cases, they did spell out that they still fully stand behind the gravity of the crimes charge, the strength of the government's proof and the merits of the prosecution here. And then Judge Tanya Chutkan, in her opinion, dismissing this January 6 case against Trump, notes that this immunity around the presidency, it is temporary, expiring when the person leaves office.

      "sentences": "Well, Becky. Look clearly, tariff man is back, and if anything, the president-elect is a bigger believer in tariffs than hewas when he first gave himself that nickname years ago. He sees tariffs as kind of a magical negotiating tool that can be used against friends and foes alike to try to bring them to the negotiating table and secure better deals. He sees them as a way to solve almost any problem. And look, we don't know exactly how this is going to play out, right? I mean, will the president- elect really impose a 25 percent tariff on Mexico and Canada, or is this more of a negotiating tactic to try to negotiate a better deal for American workers and consumers? We don't know, but what we do know is that tariffs have at least the potential to create chaos for businesses, to invite retaliation from other countries to tariff U.S. goods, and also, of course, to increase costs for consumers, because at the end of the day, tariffs are levies on U.S. imports. And in the past, research has shown that Americans bore the costs of Trump's tariffs on China. And look, you mentioned Canada. I mean, Canada is a major partner for the U.S. in trade. The U.S. imported hundreds and billions of dollars of goods from Canada last year alone on everything from minerals to oil. And it's hard to see how a 25 percent tariff on Canadian oil is going to make it cheaper for Americans to get gasoline, or a 25 percent tariff on cement from Canada or wood from Canada, how is that going to make it any cheaper to build homes? It's not. Mexico as well, and it's leading source of autos and auto parts. Also of agricultural products, 89 percent of U.S. imports of avocados come from Mexico. And there is the potential, of course, Becky, for tariffs like that to make it even more expensive for consumers at the grocery store.",

They were laying into the Biden Administration, accusing the Biden Administration of escalating the conflict, especially after, of course, the White House has allowed the Ukrainians to use those attack them, surface to surface missiles to strike deep into Russia. And it was quite interesting, because the spokesman for the Kremlin even said that talk about peace, as he put it, only comes from people who are set to have high rolls in the new Trump Administration. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): As Ukrainian forces grow ever more desperate trying to hold off advancing Russian troops. The Kremlin is growing ever more hopeful the incoming Trump Administration will try to end the war on terms favorable for Moscow. The words peace or peace plan come from Trump supporters and those nominated for future positions in the upcoming administration, the Kremlin spokesman said today. The Russians irate after the Biden Administration allowed Ukraine to use longer distance U.S. and U.K. supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin in return firing a new powerful intermediate range ballistic missile into central Ukraine that's never been used in war.

MIKE WALTZ, TRUMP'S PICK FOR U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: President Trump has been very clear about the need to end this conflict, and so what we're need to be discussing is who's at that table. PLEITGEN (voice-over): And from Trump insiders and cabinet picks, proposals seemingly in line with Moscow's demands, Elon Musk posting his ideas on his X account in early October 2022, calling for U.N. monitored referendums in areas of Ukraine occupied by Russia, for Crimea to be recognized as Russian and for Ukraine to remain neutral. Ukraine's President, who has said he does believe the war will end faster under Trump, also said last week in a radio interview that Ukraine cannot be forced into talks. Musk then trolling Zelenskyy once again. Despite Elon Musk giving crucial battlefield support to Ukraine by providing Starlink satellite internet to its troops, Russians we spoke to in Moscow, unequivocal. They like him. He's an extraordinary personality, this man says, and since he fulfilled himself and his business, society will work with him well. I think Elon Musk is a good example of the future of our planet, she says. He's doing a lot to bring our planet forward, and it's a good development.

And there would be people here that would point back to, you know, the agreements that were made at the end of the Lebanese civil war, more than two decades ago now. And say back then, Hezbollah was obligated, like all the militias inside of Lebanon to put their weapons down, but they didn't. And they maintained themselves as an armed militia, became more powerful, and then parlayed that power with political support as a political party, but combine the two to become overly powerful, is how some people would see it from here, and that's why they want to continue. And I think that point about sovereignty, it really lands on such a sensitive issue, because we've heard from government ministers here. The foreign minister saying that Israel doesn't want to see Hezbollah regrow militarily and reassume the sort of dominant role that it's had inside of Lebanon, that this is a Lebanese sovereign issue. Israel appears to want to have an outsized influence in what happens inside of Lebanon, that it's clear, it's impossible to have an agreement that meets, both aspirations. And I think to your point, there's a 65 -- 60-day ceasefire deal for now, and then more terms are fleshed out then in the intervening period. I think it's very worthwhile noting that 60 days from now, Donald Trump will be the U.S. president, and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, will be counting on a different attitude coming from the White House towards him and towards what Israel wants in terms of its dominance in the north of Israel along the border with Lebanon.
