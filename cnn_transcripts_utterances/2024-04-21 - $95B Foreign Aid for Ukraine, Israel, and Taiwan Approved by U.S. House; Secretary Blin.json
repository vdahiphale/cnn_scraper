Palestinian leaders are calling for a strike today in the West Bank after Israeli defense forces carried out a deadly raid. Plus, the U.S. agrees to withdraw its troops from Niger more than a month after the country revoked a military cooperation deal. How this could affect the fight against terror there and beyond.",

The package includes $61 billion for Ukraine, $26 billion for Israel and $8 billion for Taiwan and Indo- Pacific allies.It now goes to the Senate on Tuesday. The Upper House is widely expected to pass the funding, which would then head to President Biden who says he is ready to sign it. Biden applauded the move saying, \"Members of both parties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage.\" All right. For more on all that, I'm joined by CNN's Clare Sebastian in London. And Clare, those billions of dollars in aid can't come soon enough for soldiers on Ukraine's front lines.",

Well, the Pentagon hasn't been specific, but certainly a spokesperson in a briefing last Thursday, before this vote happened, said that they are poised to move quickly. He said -- and that has previously been showing they can move within days.Of course, we still have the Senate vote and the president's signature, but this should happen relatively quickly. And of course, there may be a more immediate impact. We could see the impact on the battlefield even before the aid lands if Ukraine can anticipate a delivery of more artillery ammunition. For example, they may have to ration less stringently in the meantime which could have an impact in a war where President Zelenskyy has said in recent days that Russia is firing 10 artillery shells for every one that Ukraine is firing. So, they are significantly on the backfoot in the ground war right now. But this is not a silver bullet, obviously. We know that, yes, artillery ammunition is a major factor. But for example, Russia has been having a significant and deadly impact with aerial guided bombs recently, which had dropped from planes. Ukraine desperately needs F- 16s to try to combat those. And this bill will not speed up the delivery of that. We know that training, for example, is a bottleneck there. But it will boost morale on the front lines, and that is significant. Take a listen to what President Zelenskyy had to say in response to the passing of this vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  We appreciate every manifestation of support for our state and independence, our people, and our lives which Russia wants to bury in ruins.

Thanks to the bipartisan support, the thanks given to Speaker Johnson, the thanks given to Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.The Prime Minister saying -- Benjamin Netanyahu saying that this shows bipartisan support for Israel which is, kind of, interesting because there's been this assessment in Israel that the Prime Minister has been alienating Democrats in the United States because of the way that he's fighting the war in Gaza. Because so many Palestinians are being killed, more than 34,000 now. So, the Prime Minister kind of framing it in a way that that is actually important to him to -- he shows he still has, the country still has a bipartisan support. The defense minister, Yoav Gallant, pointing out that there are -- Israel has seven enemies at the moment and important to show. Again, he said that this shows the strong support and strength between the United States and Israel. We heard similar things from the foreign minister as well, Israel Katz, saying that this shows a strong ties, a strategic partnership between the two countries. But the speaker of the Knesset, perhaps framing it in what could be the, sort of, most important language here or the way that he explains it. He says, this shows Israel's enemies of the strong support between the United States and Israel. And why is that so important? Well, there's a -- there's an understanding in Israel at the moment that one of the reasons Iran decided to hit Israel in a way that it never done before, more than 350 missiles and drones directly from Iran into Israel was because the perception here in Israel, at least, is that Iran thought the tensions between the White House and the Prime Minister here meant that that U.S. support for Israel wasn't as strong as it was before, and therefore they could attack Israel in a way that they hadn't done before. So, the speaker of the Knesset making it clear for Iran, for others that that strong support is there. So, this isn't just about having the armaments to continue to fight all the wars that Israel is fighting. It is about sending that clear message to their enemies. Nic Robertson, CNN, Jerusalem.

So, since the call in 2023, the relationship has changed dramatically between the U.S. and Niger.Initially, the military junta kept a level of relationship with the United States even after they told France to leave, they still maintained a kind of a cordial relationship with the U.S. But everything changed in October because for the first few months, the U.S. did not label this a coup because it has constitutional implication on how the U.S. could support Niger. But when the U.S. labeled it a coup in October 2023, the dynamics changed. The U.S. reduced funding, and also importantly, the U.S. also reduced intelligence sharing, which for me, is actually even more important than the withdrawal funds. Because when the U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with them, it raised the question of what is the point of having the U.S. if they would have this drone base, I would not share intelligence. So, there are cocktails of issue which led to the deterioration of relationship between the U.S. and Niger.",

And then the U.S. then share -- shares the information with the allies in West Africa and the Sahel.So, it's a very strategic drone base as well, because the location of the drone base in Agadez is almost right at the center of the entire Sahel. So, drones flown from this area could easily cover many countries and almost the entire Sahel. So, losing this drone base would weaken counterterrorism operations in the region because it would be more difficult to gather intelligence. The Sahel is a massive, massive area.
