      "sentences": "On our radar this hour, a same-sex couple in Kentucky was just awarded $100,000 years after they were denied a marriage license. Dave Ermold and David Moore sued Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis in 2015. You'll likely remember this.She refused to issue their license in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision that legalized same-sex marriage. David said -- Davis said issuing the license and others for same-sex couples violated her Christian convictions. And now, we see who has had the last word there. In Southern California, a school district agreed to pay $27 million to the family of a student who was killed by bullies in 2019. The family's lawsuit states that two students punched 13-year-old Diego Stolz in the head. He then fell and hit his head on a concrete pillar. He never woke up and died nine days later. The wrongful death lawsuit alleges that administrators were warned that Stolz was being bullied but did nothing to stop it. After the settlement was announced, the school district highlighted the anti-bullying efforts that they have since then put in place. TV painter Bob Ross is a cultural icon, and now the art market is starting to reflect that. The going price for his very first on-air painting, A Walk in the Woods, was almost $10 million. It was painted live on air back in January of 1983. A great year, by the way. A show volunteer bought it that year and kept it until the Minneapolis-based art gallery got it -- got it. Months later, the gallery owner says it's now listing it for sale -- for sale of $9.85 million. But it is in no rush to sell. Happy little trees, John. Happy little trees.",

And like I said, I have been in a couple of these planes before and these people are very brave. There's certainly a lot of risk when you fly in these missions.

Darius, thank you so much for being with us. We want to note that your wife is a UAW member also. Neither of you works at a plant that's striking just now. But you do support this strike. Why is it so important? DARIUS GOODMAN, UAW MEMBER; WORKS AT FORD IN DEARBORN, MICHIGAN: First of all, thank you guys for having me. Second of all, I think that this strike is important not only to build the middle class but to further help the United Auto Workers in what we -- what we stand for.

What's happening in Ukraine is not some on the other side of the world. This is in our strategic interest because American prosperity depends on European prosperity, which depends on security and stability. So, there's a practical aspect of this that's in our interest. Of course, the Chinese are also watching to see, are we serious when we say we are for sovereignty, for -- respect for international law, respect for freedom of navigation, respect for international agreements.

Ukrainians need our help. They need both military and non-lethal aid, and they needed it yesterday. Why to speak up now? That's the one I -- it's easy to answer.
