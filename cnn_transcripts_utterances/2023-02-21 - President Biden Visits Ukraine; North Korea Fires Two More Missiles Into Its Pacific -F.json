      "sentences": "Now, there is a long history of American presidents visiting war zones. This trip was unprecedented in modern history however because theAmerican president traveled to an active war zone without a large U.S. military presence. President Biden said his trip was to reaffirm the, quote, unwavering support that the United States holds for Ukraine. But, earlier this month, the United States said Russia has committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine. That was an escalation of what they`d said previously. Russia called the accusation an excuse for Washington to further the conflict. During his trip, President Biden also announced new military assistance for Ukraine and incoming sanctions against Moscow. We`ll keep you informed on any more updates from the president`s trip as well as new information on the ongoing war overseas. And over the weekend, the secretive nation of North Korea launched a series of missile tests off the coast of the Korean peninsula. The country says the missiles have enough range to hit the United States. But the U.S. has said this weekend`s events, they don`t pose any immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory. The tests do however highlight the destabilizing impact of North Korea`s illegal missile program. North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un`s sister warned of more threats to come unless the United States halts military drills with South Korea. More now from Paula Hancocks, CNN international correspondent based in Seoul, South Korea. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

On Sunday and Monday, we have seen tit-for-tat retaliation from both sides -- North Korea, and also the U.S. and South Korea on the other side. So what we saw on Saturday, Pyongyang admitted a day later, was an intercontinental ballistic missile. Now these they claim can hit mainland United States and they are the ones that do concern Washington. We heard from Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un`s sister, that this actually shows that they have missile re-entry technology. Now, it`s very difficult to know if that is in fact the case, but that is what Pyongyang is claiming at this point. So what we saw on Sunday then just one day later was a concerted show of force by the U.S. and South Korean air force, air forces. They flew sorties over the Korean peninsula, including at least one B-1 bomber, escorted by South Korean fighter jets and then in response to that, we saw this Monday morning from Pyongyang two launches. Now they say that it was a super large multiple rocket launcher exercise in retaliation for what they saw the day before. So this is really a latest cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation, but certainly, the Saturday launch was the significant one. But we`re not expecting the tensions or this tit for tat retaliation to diminish anytime soon, because Pyongyang says it is doing so because the U.S. and South Korea are carrying out joint military drills, and if they continue to do that, then they will continue to respond. Now we know that this week at the Pentagon, there will be a nuclear tabletop drill between the U.S. and South Korea, and then next month, there will be a larger joint military drill between the two countries.

For example, in the summer of 2015, a fire in southwest Alaska blazed across 26 square miles. Winter came and snow covered the fire site. But the following spring, the fire returned along the old burn scar, evidence Scholten says of a zombie fire. By burning through the soil and the roots, zombie fires can be more damaging to the forest than regular fires, making it harder for them to recover. But that`s not all, these boreal soils store huge amounts of carbon, so burning them releases it as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Zombie fires are rare but Scholten found that they are increasing due to climate change.",
