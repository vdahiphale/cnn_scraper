And like you said a minute ago, we're going to see wind chills up to negative 40. And that is going to be a little scary. So holiday travel in this area likely will be put on hold. Our public works department and our snow team, they're out working diligently to clear all of our streets. But these conditions, you know, they make it nearly impossible to keep the roads clean, because it will drift right back over as these winds pick up. The temperatures, cold and high winds could cause also a hypothermia and frostbite very quickly. So we're advising everybody to stay out of this weather, stay indoors, stay safe and we're advising residents to remain home and not travel unless it is absolutely necessary. These conditions are unreal. And, of course, we're seeing, with climate change, more extreme conditions, from the high heats and high winds and duration in the summer to this kind of situation in the winter.",

Today was supposed to be the busiest pre-Christmas Day in terms of the number of flights scheduled nationwide. But the numbers of cancellations keeps going up. And the pace is really quick. According to FlightAware, 1,570 flights canceled nationwide. O'Hare is number one. Denver is number two. Chicago Midway is number three. In fact, one in every four flights here at O'Hare has been canceled. Which is a huge problem and will have a nationwide ripple effect because this is a huge hub for American Airlines and the biggest hub for United Airlines. Just got a tour of the ops center where crews scrambling to get passengers on connecting flights at different airports to save some trip. And earlier in the week they were emailing passengers to get them to change their itineraries. Listen to those who got out here early before the snow hits. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Some of those Republicans have cast doubt on the future of U.S. aid to Ukraine, including the Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, saying that there will be no more blank checks to Ukraine going forward. Now Zelenskyy made this case not only to those lawmakers but directly to the American people, talking about trying to capture American hearts in his remarks. And while he expressed a lot of gratitude for the support that the U.S. has given so far, including the $1.8 billion of additional aid that President Biden announced yesterday, we also heard him make clear it is just not enough.

I was part of the official escort committee, met with him in a back room in the Capitol. He's very -- a very strong man, very inspiring. You know what I appreciated about his speech, a couple of things. One were the parallels that he made to World War II. That would be my father's war. When I go to Poland, they talk about 1939. And had we stopped Hitler at that point in time, we would have saved so much blood and treasure from occurring (sic). And what we're see right now is a struggle for the global balance of power in the world and that is Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. And chairman Xi in China, looking at Taiwan and also Putin in Ukraine, you cannot bifurcate these world powers. And they're all against freedom and democracy in the West.

And the thing is, every time we give them what they need, they come through. My only criticism would be -- and to your point about the blank check -- we are going to have oversight and accountability. The American taxpayer deserves that. But through that, I want to make sure that, when we're giving them this money, it is going to the weapons that they need because right now they're not getting the weapons that they need. I think it was difficult because Zelenskyy is in a position of saying thank you for the Patriot battery system that could maybe protect Kyiv but not the whole country. But what he's saying behind the scenes here, I need more. I need everything. I need to win this war and you're not giving it to me. I've had a lot of discussions with the administration -- and these are bipartisan by the way -- what does Ukraine need to get this thing done in the short-term, not a long-protracted war? And you know what it is? You slow walked the HIMARS, the Javelin Stingers. Now it is the longer-range artillery that could hit the Iranian drones in Crimea. That is what is causing the damage and destruction against the infrastructure and the civilian population. That is what they need right now, and this administration is not willing to put that in.
