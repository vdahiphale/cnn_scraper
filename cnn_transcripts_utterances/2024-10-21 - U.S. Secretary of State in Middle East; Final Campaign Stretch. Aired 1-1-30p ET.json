Vice President Kamala Harris is hitting not one, but all three blue wall states. And she's teaming up with an unlikely ally, former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, who, in an unprecedented effort, is hoping to help Harris win over undecided independents and moderate Republicans in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. That trio of battleground states tipped the 2016 race for Donald Trump. But it swung back in Democrats' favor in 2020.",

The vice president just held a roundtable with Republican Liz Cheney, where she warned about a second Trump presidency. Here's a moment from that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  In many, many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the consequences of him being president of the United States are brutally serious. There are things that he says that will be the subject of skits and laughter and jokes, but words have meaning coming from someone who aspires to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States.

It lasted about 40 minutes in total.And there were two different elements that stood out to me when it comes to what message they were trying to get across here in the suburbs of Philadelphia. The first was along the lines of the bite that you just played for the viewers, basically, Vice President Harris saying, as she has before that former President Donald Trump is an unserious man for the job. Then, former congresswoman Liz Cheney, she also noted that Trump idolizes tyrants. That was her argument and she was arguing also that foreign adversaries feel that they can play Trump on the international stage. But then what also stood out to me, Boris and Brianna, was this second aspect of the event, and it was where Liz Cheney spoke about women's reproductive rights. And it almost sounded like she was trying to give perhaps a pro-life, suburban, maybe more conservative or moderate woman's -- who might be a voter in this part of Pennsylvania, Liz Cheney seemed like she was trying to give them the language to support Vice President Kamala Harris, even if they may be uncomfortable with the issue of abortion. Take a listen to what the former congresswoman had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FMR. REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY):  This is not an issue that we're seeing break down across party lines, but I think we're seeing people come together to say what has happened to women when women are facing situations where they can't get the care they need, where in places like Texas, for example, the attorney general is talking about -- is suing to get access to women's medical records, that's not sustainable for us as a country.
