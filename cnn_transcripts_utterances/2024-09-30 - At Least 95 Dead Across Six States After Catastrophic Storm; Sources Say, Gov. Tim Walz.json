In North Carolina, at least 36 people are dead and officials have received more than a thousand reports of people who are missing.

What is also significant about this strike is it's the first time since hostilities ramped up, that there has been a strike outside the southern suburbs of Beirut, where Hezbollah has a large presence. So, what we also heard in within the last two hours was from Naim Qassem, who's one of the senior deputies of Hassan Nasrallah, who gave what appears to have been a recorded speech in which he didn't seem to be indicating any willingness of Hezbollah to ceasefire, to agree to a ceasefire. He said that as far as the organization goes, despite repeated body blows and, of course, the killing of the leader of the group, he said, we did not collapse. We are going on despite the pain and sacrifices. He said, Hezbollah will continue confronting Israel in support of the Palestinian people, Gaza, and the people of Lebanon. So, no indication from Hezbollah at this point that it's going to change course despite the blows it has sustained in the last two weeks. Kate?",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [07:20:00] SIDNER:  This morning, the Harris campaign is targeting Trump's plans on health care. A senior campaign official telling CNN the 43-page analysis called Concept on Health Care is an attempt to force the Trump camp to address their proposals. There's also new polling this morning that shows two thirds of Americans believe health care is not getting enough attention in this election. Joining me now is CNN's Meg Tirrell.

This is a new poll from Gallup and West Health, and what it finds, this was done in September of about 3,000 people, is about 67 percent of U.S. adults say they don't think that health care is getting enough attention in this 2024 presidential election cycle.And that is true that a majority of people believe that across political parties, although it is most pronounced among Democrats, the poll finds 78 percent of Democrats believe that, 67 percent of independents, but still 53 percent of Republicans said that they don't think health care is getting enough attention in this election cycle. They also drilled down on key issues and which candidate different party members said that they trusted the most on key issues like access to care, insurance coverage, increasing quality of care, lowering the price of prescription drugs. This broke down among party lines as one might think Democrats were more likely to think Harris would do better on those, Republicans were more likely to think Trump would do better on those. They were slightly more likely to trust Harris. Independents, though, one-third of them said that they didn't trust either candidate on these issues. So it kind of shows there's a lot of room there to be talking more about this and to win some folks over. And when I said they were more likely to trust Harris, independents maybe slightly were leaning toward Harris on those, but still that third said that they didn't trust either candidate, Sara.",
