What we've seen over the past few weeks is he has brought a lot of chaos and disruption to hearings in several of his cases and internal conversations within Trump world, where they (ph) are revealing that maybe that didn't have the benefits that they anticipated, which is part of why you're seeing a much more traditional disciplined approach to tomorrow's oral argument that includes, at this point, he's not expected to attend.Sources tell us, look, there's really no upside and even Trump understands how high the stakes are. They are also confident in the merits of their case and they believe this can be a win for them. They don't want anything that will distract from that. Also, look at the caliber of lawyers that he has. Jonathan Mitchell, former Texas Solicitor General. Dana, this will be his sixth time arguing before the justices, and also the kind of preparation. Yesterday and today, the entire Trump legal team, they've been doing mock arguments, moot courts. I mean, this is something I did in law school. This is what most people would do to prepare for Supreme Court arguments. But as we know, the Trump team, not always conventional, but taking a more disciplined, much more prepared approach to tomorrow's argument. As you said, quite a contrast to what we've seen over the past two weeks.",

Let's look at the heart of what they're going to be hearing in the first place, Elie. This is specifically a question that has come up through the State of Colorado. And as I said at the beginning, the Colorado Supreme Court said that they don't think he's eligible to be on Colorado's ballot because of his actions related to January 6th. This is not the way most states have looked at their ballots. I think that's important to point out.",

There have been something in the order of two to three dozen of these challenges brought around the country. And part of the problem with the 14th Amendment is, we collectively don't really know exactly how it works. And as a result of that, you can see it playing out, if you go across the map.Some states have had Secretary of States who've rejected this; others states have had trial court judges who've rejected this; others states have had federal judges who've rejected this. We're literally all over the map. But it's important to keep the perspective here. Only -- of all those challenges, only one and a half -- Maine being the half because they're sort of still in process -- have said yes, Donald Trump is off the ballot on the under 14th Amendment. So, while Colorado is getting all the attention because this is the one that has gone to the Supreme Court, they are really an outlier here and I think that will be on the justices' minds tomorrow.",

      "sentences": "So, this is a great question, probably the question I've been asked most commonly, just hanging around the building here. It depends how they rule. If the Supreme Court rules for Colorado, inherently, they're saying states you do have the authority to remove someone from the ballot. You have to, of course, abide by your own procedures.If that's the ruling, then they are going to deal with other state challenges, perhaps Maine. Illinois said we're going to wait and see. So if the court rules that way, they are going to be inviting sort of state by state by state review. If they rule for Trump in a certain way, if they rule that the president does not count under the 14th Amendment, if they rule this is not up to the states, it's up to the Congress, then it's a silver bullet, all of these challenges are over and we are done.",

Technically, the primary was meaningless. The delegates will be awarded based on the results of the GOP caucuses, those are tomorrow night. Donald Trump is competing in that contest but not the primary.So Haley was the only one on the primary ballot that she lost to last night, and she lost to \"None of These Candidates\" by a two-to-one margin. The Haley campaign is dismissing the results, saying it didn't devote any resources to the state and \"We're full steam ahead in South Carolina and beyond.\" John King joins us now.

She didn't spend any money out there to campaign, she didn't put any ads on the air. There is no delegates involved, so it's meaningless. But what the Haley campaign was hoping for, because Trump has the state party wired. Trump is going to get all the delegates of the caucuses on Thursday night.What the Haley campaign was hoping for is that other voters would come out and voter in this primary, and they could claim some symbolic victory. Instead, they lost to \"None of the Above.\" It is just embarrassing. Well, it doesn't mean anything in terms of the math of the race, but she right now is desperate for momentum. She didn't get even a bounce, a little tiny bounce out of Nevada. So, it all comes down literally -- she says she's in through Super Tuesday, but Trump has won Iowa. Trump won New Hampshire. Trump is about to win Nevada. South Carolina is fourth. I don't think she can be on four (ph).",
