And now there's a fight happening about whether some of these ballots should be counted. At issue here are undated or misdated ballots. So, this is a ballot that was actually cured this election cycle. Just yesterday the voter went in and fixed the date. Others may not be cured in time. And so now Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman has joined a lawsuit asking a federal court to supersede a previous decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and allow those misdated or undated votes to count, arguing the date on a mailed ballot envelope has no bearing on a voter's qualifications and serves no purpose other than to erect barriers to qualified voters exercising their fundamental constitutional right to vote. So, how many votes are we talking about? Well, we know of at least 3,400 in Philadelphia County. We know of at least 1,000 in Allegheny County. Now that's the Pittsburgh area. A couple hundred others that were undated or misdated in Monroe County. All three of these counties voted for Biden in 2020. And, Anderson, as you know, thousands of votes could make a difference in a very tight race.",

The numbers this year do fit that pattern if you take a look here at the pie chart. Sixty-nine percent of pre-election ballots in Pennsylvania were cast by Democrats. Now, remember, Republicans historically favor voting in-person on Election Day. So, those votes are going to be among the first results we're going to get tonight. And that's why the early map might fill in red and we may then see a blue shift as those mail ballots are counted. This year, by the way, 63 counties, so the majority of this state, including the biggest county, Philadelphia, is going to do a marathon count going around the clock until every single mail ballot is counted. So, no rest.

And we've been talking to voters here You know, I can't really quite tell you that there's enthusiasm. It almost feels like the issues are too heavy for that. We spoke to some of the Democratic vote, or voters who are voting for the Democrats. They feel that democracy is at stake. They are tired of the divisions that they're seeing in the country, and they want to cast their ballots to shift that. As far as some of the Republicans that we've spoken to, for them it's been bread and butter issues, the economy. They are tired of the social division issues that have been coming up. They want to see change on inflation and the economy and they don't feel that the Democrats could deliver that for them. We've also sort of seen a bit of a climate of fear here. At least one voter that I talked to pointed to election observers. He wasn't quite sure who they were. He felt intimidated. Again, that's just one person's experience. But it speaks to the broader climate of fear with voting irregularities also coming up as a topic in this election. We have seen a barrage of negative ads on both sides.

So, Christina Bobb, one of his former lawyers, yesterday said on a right-wing network, there should be absolutely a result no later than the middle of the night, meaning tonight, or early Wednesday morning. I think those areas that don't have a result, it's going to look very suspicious. In other words, already planting the seed of doubt. DR. ABDUL EL-SAYED, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: That's absolutely right. So, I'm from Michigan and we know that in Wayne County, in Detroit, they count votes a little bit later. You have a higher density of people, of course. And so fewer election officials counting more votes, it's going to take more time. But this is sort of a way of trying to set the table around the fact that really only the rural voters or the suburban voters are the ones that you should be paying attention to. And so it really is worrying because, well, this is a structural reality of what it takes to count votes. S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: This is why -- I mean all - all the races are important and I know we're all watching, you know, Senate Pennsylvania, Senate Georgia, but the three races that I think are most important are Kristina Karamo in Michigan, Mark Finchem in Arizona and Jim Marchant in Nevada.
