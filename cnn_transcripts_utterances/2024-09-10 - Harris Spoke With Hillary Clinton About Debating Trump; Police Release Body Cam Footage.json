And while we don't know the details of their conversation, the source telling us this says that Clinton has expressed that baiting the former president is one of the best tactics the vice president could do tonight. Clinton has pointed to this exchange as one of the single lowest debate moments for Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Notable, I should mention, that this week, again, Clinton was asked in a \"New York Times\" interview about whether she had spoken with Harris about the debate.And I think you saw it, Robby, it was a total dodge. She acted as if she'd been asked another question. But of course, she's been speaking with Harris. It would be malpractice if she wasn't talking to her about the debate. How essential is it that Harris has gotten Clinton's insight on this?",

I'm sure she's consulted with President Biden as well.And look, it's hard -- it's hard to know when a campaign -- what it's really like to be up there on stage all the pressures on you. She has an A-plus team preparing her for this debate. People who've done this for Obama, for Clinton, provided it. But there's nothing quite like being on that stage. And Hillary's the only woman who's debated him in a general election context. We know that Donald Trump does treat women differently. So I think it's a really important perspective to get. I will also say I think the world has changed a lot in the last eight years. Donald Trump was president and then he was defeated. So this is a very different context than Hillary faced. But her input is still incredibly important.",

But looking back with the benefit of experience of 2016, what is the best way for Harris to maximize her performance on the debate stage compared to Trump's? MOOKago. These viral moments, these little clips are so important now. And so she needs to make sure that, not just that she's ready to have these moments, but ready to have the right moments. She has to drive a contrast with him on looking out for the middle class. She has to surface that she has new economic ideas versus his old, tired, you know, in many cases, unrealistic ideas. And on women's health care, there's a really important contrast for her to draw. So she needs to do all of that. I would say the thing that is still a problem, since 2016, right up until today, is that Donald Trump's bad behavior antics, racism, sexism is incredibly distracting. It's very easy to watch the debate and pay attention to those things rather than a really serious case that she or Biden or Hillary we're trying to make. And I think that is the hardest thing to do. Because even when you're -- when you're baiting him, which I'm sure she's going to try to bring him in to have some of those important contrasts moments. But if he -- if he behaves really badly, sometimes that can spoil it. So it's important that she's going to have to be nimble and really try to break through his bad behavior to a send clear message. Because, unlike Biden and unlike Hillary, she is still relatively unknown to - you know, based on the polling, to say at least a third of the electorate. So we need to pay attention to them and make sure that they're learning something new.",

And what that means is that -- for those people who don't know what CALEA means, it's commission on accreditation of law enforcement agencies. It's like this national organization that takes a look, a keen look at policies of a police department and makes very strong recommendations for them. Them, being certified by CALEA, I know for certain that they have a very good program in de-escalation. And that's what we did not see here by the officers that we're there. If anything, we saw, escalation. And if you listen to the language that was being said when they we're trying to get him to sit down on a curb and he says he just had surgery on his knee. The other officer, the one officer responds saying something to the effect that, what a coincidence, did you just have surgery on your ears? You know, talking about, you know, him not listening to them right away. This is appalling. This is one of the main problems we have in policing today is that police officers are not following their training. They're not using de-escalation techniques that they're trained in.

The law does say that we can pull someone, have someone step out of their vehicle, extract someone from their vehicle, if we fear for our safety. That's case law. That supports that. However, they knew who he was. They had this driver's license. They knew who he was and where he was going to. There was absolutely no reasonable suspicion whatsoever to believe that their safety was at risk. So for them to even have him step out of the car, in my hey opinion, and I've been a trainer -- one of my -- you know, when I was with the Maryland State Police in Baltimore City, that's what I did. I headed up both training divisions for both those agencies. And what they did was completely against training. And in my opinion, it did not follow case law for the reasoning they used to get him out of the car. Their safety was not a risk. So that comment by the union, they're just trying to cover their officers. That's what they're paid to do. But, in my opinion, it's wrong.",
