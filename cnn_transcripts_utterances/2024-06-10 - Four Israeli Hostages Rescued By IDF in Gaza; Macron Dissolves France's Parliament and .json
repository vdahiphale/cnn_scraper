That is why we are leaving the emergency government today with a heavy heart, but with full confidence. I call on Netanyahu, set an agreed election date. Don't allow our people to get torn apart.

This would happen that it did not respond to, the IDF's failures, that Israeli Defense Force in responding that day, and the assumption is that Prime Minister Netanyahu could not survive that. And of course, one of the beneficiaries could well be Benny Gantz himself, who ran against the Prime Minister a few years ago laws, but today, he's doing well enough in the polls, it is not inconceivable that he could emerge victorious, also, not certain. But what we're seeing now is the United States with Benny Gantz's help tried to get the Israelis to commit to what President Biden called an Israeli proposal for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange, and get Hamas most importantly to agree to it may be difficult, more difficult -- it was difficult before the rescue, it may be more difficult now. And overnight, Kasie, the U.S. has finally decided to go to the United Nations Security Council with a ceasefire and hostage exchange proposal, basically the one the president laid out ten days ago and try to get their approval of it to up the pressure on both Hamas and Israel.",

He needed Gantz's credibility to some degree that deal with the U.S. and the rest of the world. But if Netanyahu agrees to the Israeli plan, which came out of the war cabinet, not out of the political atmosphere and the coalition he's put together, those right wingers have threatened to leave the government. That would bring about a government collapse.",

In Germany, a lot of people would view that party now the second most powerful party in the country as, you know, traditionally a very far-right party.So, it has huge influence because Germany and France and Italy are the three countries that have most influence over the European Union. I was interviewing a U.S. expert based here in the U.K. earlier on, and she was talking about how, you know, this will empower Trump effectively. A lot of -- you know, the right was rising in Europe before Trump, but Trump managed to popularize the messaging, and they've adopted a lot of that. So, he certainly added energy to the rise of the right here in Europe. And it also means that the more senior these right-wing politicians become, the more, you know, contacts and power he has within Europe. So, it's very empowering to him and his foreign policy. He creates alliances specifically for him within countries which were traditionally U.S. allies. So, it has a -- it will have a big impact on Trump if he gets into power, and it will cause a problem for Biden if he gets into power, because they're going to be much less supportive of him and his policies going forward.",
