Morocco becoming the first African nation to reach the semifinals. Stunning Portugal one nil to advance in the tournament. And now they'll wait to see who will they'll face next -- England or France.They're kicking off just -- they kicked off rather just moments ago. But amid the fanfare, there is also melancholy. The sudden abrupt death of sports journalist Grant Wahl casting a shadow on the tournament. He collapsed while covering the Argentina Netherlands match on Friday. The circumstances of his death still unclear at this hour. Wahl was one of the most prominent voices for soccer in America championing this sport calling out corruption and sticking up for equality. FIFA, the international governing body of soccer paying tribute with a makeshift memorial during the latest match, saying, he should have been here. For more on all of this, let's bring in CNN's Don Riddell and Patrick Snell. So Don, do you first -- you know, what more are we learning about the circumstances of his death?",

      "sentences": "Well, the details are scant, but we know that during this extraordinary game, which I was also covering last night between Argentina and the Netherlands that he collapsed during the match. It was an extraordinary occasion. He was broadcasting on the game. His last tweet referenced the Dutch equalizing goal that went in in the 90th minute.And the subsequent drama that played out on the stadium, obviously, consumed the 80,000 plus supporters who were there. But as that was happening, we now know that Grant Wahl had collapsed and a frantic effort to try and save his life was underway. Witnesses told CNN that that lasted between 20 to 25 minutes. We do understand that he was taken to hospital. But those efforts to save his life were unsuccessful. And, you know, the football community is a small one. It's very tight knit. Of course, we all work for different broadcasters or different publications. But everybody sees everybody at the games, a lot of people are very, very close friends within the community. And Grant Wahl was incredibly popular, not just in the United States, but in Europe and beyond. And, you know, the sense for the last hours throughout today has just been one of absolute disbelief, the fact that it was so sudden, so bizarre, has made it really, really difficult to comprehend. We do know that Grant had been complaining of health issues during this tournament. The irony is when I last saw him two weeks ago, we were talking about my health issues because I've completely lost my voice. And I was grateful to Grant for joining me on the show. But he did go to see a doctor a few days before he passed away. He was complaining of a tight chest. And we do know that he was working incredibly hard as a freelancer out here at the World Cup in Qatar. And these may well all be significant factors in his demise.",

I mean, that is so powerful. It's really poignant. Major League Soccer as well, a statement from them a little earlier. Some real strong, powerful words here. \"We are shocked, saddened and heartbroken over the tragic passing of Grant Wahl. He was kind and caring person.

They will play the winners of the game between France and England. Of course, this is the first World Cup tournament in the Middle East. Morocco are the first Arab team, not just the first African team, but the first Arab team to get to the semi-finals. And the way they're playing, they're brilliant.

But in the short term, yes, the main concern is going to be the West Coast states.Right now, we've got some rain in Seattle, same thing in Portland, some very heavy rain showers sliding into areas of San Francisco, as well as Sacramento and a lot of snow. Not just in California. Really when you talk about the intermountain west, the Cascades, the Rockies, all of these areas likely to pick up at least 8 to 12 inches of snow. But when you talk about the Sierras, that's where you're really going to see some of the highest numbers. Here you're looking at 3 to 5 feet of snow in just the next 48 to 72 hours. Along the coast, rain is going to be the big concern and you're talking 3 to 5 inches in some places. Keep in mind that's in a very short period of time. So flooding is going to be a concern, landslides, mudslides, especially along some of those burn scar areas where we did have some fires a few months ago. In the next 24 hours, the system as a whole is going to begin to shift farther south. So now you're going to start to see more of that rain beginning to push into Southern California as well as areas of Arizona. So for today, the main concern for flooding is northern and central California. Once we get to Sunday, the main concern is Southern California including Los Angeles as well as San Diego. Then the system begins to make its way across the country bringing a lot of snow to the intermountain west and even the high plains. In fact, wind gusts are expected to get particularly high here 70 even 80 miles per hour. Very poor visibility so we could end up with true blizzard conditions across the High Plains Monday and Tuesday. At the same time on the southern edge of this storm, one of the big concerns is actually going to be severe weather before the system continues to make its way over to the East Coast by the time we get to the end of the week. We talked about snow still quite considerable amounts in the northern area. Here you can see widespread at least 6 to 12 inches. Some areas though could top out at higher than 1 foot. Rainfall likely about 2 to 4 inches. But keep in mind for a lot of the southeast, that ground is saturated from a lot of rain the last few days. When we talk about severe storms, Monday the main threat will be from Oklahoma City down to the Dallas Fort Worth area. Tuesday, it becomes much more widespread and a little bit stronger, Fred.

But we're also going to use commercial systems where NASA is buying a service.For example, the landing system for the Moon is going to be a service provided by a commercial provider, which we didn't have the luxury of back in the 1960s either. So what we're doing now is we're trying to take the best of everything America has to offer both what the government has been doing for over a decade and what commercial has been doing, in fact, just recently. We're trying to put them all together in an open architecture system. That's the key. You know, the way we do rendezvous and proximity operations, or I should say docking, the way we do environmental control and life support systems, data, avionics, communications, all of that in this new architecture is open. So, we can have commercial companies join with us in this expedition. And we can also have international partners.

We were asked by the state of Florida, my institution, which is based at the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Maritime Museum to go out and take a look at this debris. And there had been some speculation that it could be a shipwreck, or it might be a pier, or someone even thought it might be the bleachers from when they used to do races on the beach at Daytona.But we can definitively say that it is a ship wreck. We have seen key features, ship construction features like sealing, planking and frames and stringers, with particular types of scarfs and the fasteners that are used to hold these timbers together. So, it is definitely a sailing -- the remains of a sailing ship. And it almost certainly dates to the 1800s.",

Just statistically alone, it's most likely that they will date to the 1800s. And that's just because we have so much more shipping in the 19th century or the 1800s than we did in previous centuries.So we kind of start off almost with that assumption. And then we are looking as best we can, in this case, what had been exposed was buried again. So we had to dig down to expose these timbers one more time. And looking closely at the timbers, we haven't seen anything that would suggest an earlier date or a more recent date. So everything looks very consistent with the type, say, the types of bolts or the types of iron spikes or wooden pegs that are there holding the timbers together. Everything is consistent with what we have seen on other shipwrecks that date to the 1800s.",

So this would have been kind of the equivalent of an 18-wheeler, semi-truck that we see on the interstates today.It's probably not likely that it dates to the slave trade or probably would date until after the slave trade was outlawed. But it's -- it seems, again, we're -- you know, odds are certainly that it was carrying a cargo, perhaps a cargo of lumber, or it could have, you know, if it was coming from the Caribbean sailing north along our coast, it could have had a cargo of fruit. If it was coming from the Gulf of Mexico sailing along the Florida coast, it could have had cargo of lumber.
