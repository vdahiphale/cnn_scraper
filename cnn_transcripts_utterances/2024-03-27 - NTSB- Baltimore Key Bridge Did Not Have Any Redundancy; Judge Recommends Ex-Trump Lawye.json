And 764 tons of hazardous material that was on board when it crashed into that bridge. Also tonight, there's a new litmus test apparently, to get a job at the new Trump-run Republican National Committee. Wrong answers only, apparently, to this question. Was the 2020 election stolen? It wasn't. But also, just in, speaking of the 2020 election, the chief architect of that plot to keep Trump in power is, tonight, facing a major reckoning. And screens and teens. Are smartphones and social media dooming a generation? A guest, tonight, who has studied the science says yes, and to take them all away, until high school. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. But we start with the breaking news, tonight, as we have just heard from the NTSB, with new information, on its investigation, of the collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, details on the data recorder that was obtained from that 200 million pound cargo ship. Officials say there are six hours of recordings, and numerous alarms can be heard, as they laid out a timeline of what happened, including this. At 1:26 AM, the ship's pilot asked nearly, for those tugboats that were nearby, that had been helping the ship, to come back for help. Then, ordered for the anchor to be dropped, because the ship had lost all power by that point. All of this happening just moments before that big crash. We're going to piece together this timeline and what it could mean, as this investigation is very much still underway. This comes, today, as we also learned that in that pitch-black water, and those dangerously frigid temperatures and high tides, with mangled metal all around them, divers, late today, discovered the two bodies, of six -- of the six missing people, two of the six of those construction workers, who were just doing their jobs, on the Key Bridge when this disaster struck. One was identified by a driver's license, in his pocket, the other by a single fingerprint. We'll talk more about the victims here in a moment. But on that breaking news, CNN's Pete Muntean joins us, was at that NTSB news conference that just wrapped moments ago. Pete, tell us just the highlights, as this investigation is going on. We're getting so many briefings a day. What did they just tell us, moments ago?",

From a dive team perspective, our team stood down, this afternoon, after being involved in over a dozen dives, just over the past two days. We're at a point, right now, where we believe that we've searched all areas, underwater, that are safe for divers to search. Now we're moving towards an operation, where some salvage is going to need to happen, a lot of underwater debris is going to need to be removed, and the bottom, if you will, of the collapse zone, stabilized, before divers can reenter the water, for any other purposes. So, a lot of instability on the -- on the crash scene, and something that we're going to have to really be attentive to, over the next few days.",

And things are moving very quickly. My sense is it's going to take a few days. I think the Corps of Engineers, as well as the Coast Guard, and some other structural engineers need to conduct a good thorough assessment, of the incident scene, both above and below water.

So, the night of the incident, we had Overwatch and Maryland State Police, who had infrared capability. And then, we've had drones up over top of the site itself. That's the only way we're able to see in. Oftentimes, when chemicals release, there are chemical reactions, that they give off heat. They'll give off a very strong odor. They'll give off a vapor cloud. And it's been that Overwatch piece that's been able to really assure us, right now, we have no reactions on board.

They don't get as much information as airplane black boxes. But what we did get was a good kind of timeline, which we hope to get read to us, in the near future, of the exact orders that came out on the bridge. It sounds like, again, the ship's pilots, there were two pilots on board, Chesapeake Bay pilots, who sounded the alarm, almost immediately. Once that power went out, they knew they were in trouble. They set in motion, their emergency distress signal out. They sent a Mayday out. It started movement on the bridge. It started tugs and coast guard vessels heading their way. And the crew seemed to have performed admirably, in trying to get a handle on the situation. What we didn't learn, obviously, is what caused the power outage.

Get their information before they get exposed to the press, and everything else going on in news, you want to get that feeling. The ship's crew was on the ship, because they got to maintain the ship. I mean, we still have issues with the ship. If weather comes up, we got to worry about the ship shifting. But they really need to start gathering that information, as quickly as they can.

What this is referring to is the type of structure that existed in this main portion of the bridge, known as a truss. Over these three spans there in the middle, truss is made up -- is made up of diagonal members that look sort of like a triangular web. And these types of structures are often fracture critical, meaning that if a key component, that is either pushing or pulling against another component, adjacent or next to it, is compromised? It can lead to further compromising or domino effect of the members that are along it. And so, around the late 70s, or 80s, our coding authorities began to really emphasize the need for a structural redundancy. However, today, as was said, it's quite different. But during this time, it was known that truss bridges are very strong. They're among the strongest that you can kind of use, in terms of the ability to support vertical weight. However, as we learn things, and situations like this happen, the need for structural redundancy became more and more a part of our coding lexicon.",

And so, it was designed right around that time.However, I would say that truss bridges, and in this case, is a continual truss -- continuous truss that actually shares loads across supports as well. So, beyond the fact that the truss itself could potentially be fracture critical, you also have situations where loads are redistributed, or attempted to be shared across supports. And so, we're talking about different levels, whether it's talking about macro (ph), of the actual truss members, or even the continuous nature of that portion of the bridge in general, it's always important, of course, to have redundancy. And this is something that has become towards the latter part of the 20th Century, something very, very common now, in the bridges that we design.",

This is the culmination of a months-long trial that has been going on. But really, bigger picture, it's a major reckoning, for another lawyer, who tried to keep Trump in power, after he lost in 2020. The California Supreme Court will have the final say here. But this ruling will force Eastman's law license into inactive status, which effectively bars him from practicing the law. I'm joined, tonight, by the Chief Trial Counsel for the State Bar of California, George Cardona, who led the Eastman case. And it's great to have you here. I mean, this is a blistering decision when you read it. Why do you believe a case like this, against John Eastman, is so important?",

But it really has dire implications, as the U.S., right now, is facing a devastating mental health crisis, among its children.This week, Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, signed a bill into law, banning children, 14 and under, from having their own social media accounts. And that's really just the latest, in a string of states that are trying to pass laws that restrict young Americans, from being on social media. But with youth suicide rates rising, a big question is whether or not it's enough, and what parents should be doing, to bring normalcy, back into their children's lives, in the smartphone era that we now live in. Joining me now is Jonathan Haidt, who is a social psychologist, from New York University, and also the Author of the new book, \"The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness\". And it's so great to have you on, because this book is really engaging. And essentially, what you're saying is that we went from this era of, you called it, play-based childhood, to now it's smartphone-based, and the consequences that are so obvious from that.",

I take a long time, in the book, to go through what is childhood? Why do we have it? Why is human childhood so long? And once you see all the things we have to do, in childhood, developing our social skills, taking risks. And you see that we were doing that, all the way up until the 1990s. Kids were doing that from 5 Million B.C. until the 1990s. We started reducing that, and we're over protective. But their mental health doesn't plummet until we give -- they trade in their flip phones for smartphones. And that all happens between 2010 and 2015. That's the great rewiring, because a flip phone doesn't take up every minute of your life. But once you get a smartphone, it does. And childhood, as we know it, for millions of years, is kind of over.",

      "sentences": "That's right. Everyone focuses on the content. The latest data shows that American kids are spending about five hours a day, on average, just on social media, just social media. You add in all the other stuff, and you're up to eight to 10 hours a day, on their phones and other screen devices. That pushes out just about everything else.Now, there's a lot of efforts to say, well, let's clean it up. Let's, you know, if they're going to spend 10 hours a day, let's at least make it not so much suicide content, and let's make it nicer stuff. It's still 10 hours a day. It means they're still sleeping less. They're exercising less. They're seeing their friends much, much less. They're not studying as much. They're distracted all the time. So, my point is, we can't possibly make social media safe, for middle- school kids. It's just absurd. Middle school is where the greatest damage is done, especially to girls. We have to just get it all out. I'm not saying ban it -- ban phones legally. I'm saying we need a norm. All parents are thinking like, when's the right age, and they give a phone early because everyone else did. But if we can just say, let's get it all out of middle school. No smartphones till high school. Just give your kid a flip phone or an Apple Watch. That would go a long way.",

But there's a pervasive sense of well, what are you going to do? The genie's out of the bottle? It's too -- we can't roll it back. We have to roll it back. Our children don't have childhood. They're coming out in terrible shape. Academic performance is down. I mean, we can't just say, well, what are you going to do? The secret, the trick to getting out of this is to recognize that we all hate it. The kids even don't like. The kids even say they wish these programs were never invented. But they're trapped. And so, it's a collective action problem. And if we can coordinate, we can solve it collectively. So, it just -- so if you're -- if you're a parent, and you're listening to this, get on a text thread, or talk to the parents of a couple of friends of your kids. If you all delay smartphones, or if you all put certain restrictions on? Then it's OK. Your kids will go for it. They just don't want to be the only one.
