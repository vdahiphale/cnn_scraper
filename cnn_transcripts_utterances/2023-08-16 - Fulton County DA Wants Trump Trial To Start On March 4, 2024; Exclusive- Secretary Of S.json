Right as the 2024 primary season kicks into high gear, so, too, could a criminal trial for Donald Trump in Fulton County, Georgia, as CNN also learned about his possible plan to turn himself in in the coming days. Plus, the siren system that did not sound, drawing questions and outrage in Hawaii after we learned that the Maui emergency siren system was tested, but was not used before the wildfire torched the historic town of Lahaina. Now, the painstaking process to identify the remains of the 106 so far confirmed killed. And an unexpected twist for a small town newspaper after an outrageous police raid raised alarms about the freedom of the press and the United States. Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. And we start today with our law and justice lead, and what is gearing up to be a battle over who gets Donald Trump to appear in court and when. This afternoon, Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis, in Atlanta, Georgia, asked a judge to set March 4th as the start date for the trial of Trump and his 18 codefendants for their alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. But that sets up potential clashes with multiple other Trump trials, which are also said to begin in early 2024. I want to bring in CNN's Sara Murray who just returned from Fulton County, CNN's Evan Perez, and former federal prosecutor, Elie Honig. Sara, walk us through this proposed schedule from Georgia.",

And so, certainly, they are going to also, likewise, push back against this one. But the reality that they do have is, you know, Trump's going on Truth Social and saying that none of these trials should happen before the 2024 election. I think it's pretty obvious why he thinks that, Jake. But the question and the reality that is facing his legal team is that the judges have so much leeway here. And what I am told is that what they are most concerned that could happen while this campaign is ongoing in 2024 is that he's running for president and it is a federal indictment from Jack Smith when it comes to the election subversion case. They were actually worried the judge they're based on what she's been saying in court, her comments made last Friday when they were there talking about the scope of evidence and what Trump could see and what his attorneys can see and who else can see it, that she is pushing really aggressively and that she's making comments about whether or not he could taint a jury pool, whether that could move up.

I mean, they argue publicly and in court that he has a First Amendment right, that he's running for office, and what he says should not be limited but they also recognize the reality that these are prosecutors and judges that are either overseeing the case or handling the investigation in and of itself, and that this is not helpful to them. This is problematic. But Trump is someone who can't necessarily, you know, be told what to do. I mean, his post yesterday about holding the major -- or two days ago, about holding the major press conference at Mar-a-Lago -- or Bedminster on Monday talking about how he is finally going to prove election fraud is something he did entirely on his own. It wasn't something that was coordinated campaign strategy. So, I mean, he has access to these truth social accounts. He is the one who posts these posts.

So, at the moment, we've got more than 100 families that have already been placed.
