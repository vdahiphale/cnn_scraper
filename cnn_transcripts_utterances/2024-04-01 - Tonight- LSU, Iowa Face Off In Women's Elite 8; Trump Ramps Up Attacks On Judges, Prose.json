      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics. Evil, sick, deranged, crooked and corrupt. Donald Trump chose those words to describe the prosecutors and judges, leading the criminal cases against him as he waits for his first trial to begin in just two weeks.Plus, good news for Ukraine, potentially bad news for Mike Johnson. The House speaker says he will allow a vote on desperately needed military aid. Could it cost him the gavel? One he's had for not even six months. And President Biden may have a problem with a voting bloc critical to his reelection, black voters. We have new reporting on campaign plans to keep them in his corner in November. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start today with Donald Trump's dangerous rhetoric. The former president is not just using words to attack people, he calls enemies. He is also using images of video depicting Joe Biden tied up in the back of a Trump supporters' pickup truck. He posted a picture of the daughter of a judge overseeing his hush money trial in New York, which begins just 14 days from now. CNN's Alayna Treene joins me now. So, look, Alayna, this playbook is not new. This is what we expect from Donald Trump. Now that he is the presumptive Republican nominee, though and in -- on charted waters are going into trial. It's important that we continue to call it out.",

      "sentences": "I absolutely agree with you, Dana. And I think the timing here is very significant. These attacks that he is making on the judges' daughter, the judge in his upcoming trial in New York, his prosecutors, lawyers, the former -- the president himself. They're all coming as not only Donald Trump is kicking off his general election campaign in earnest, but also as he is preparing to head to trial later this month. It's really a critical moment for him in his general election campaign, but also in his legal battles.And I do just want to read for you some of what he wrote yesterday on Easter Sunday, going after what he's deemed as his political enemies. He said, quote, happy Easter to all, including crooked and corrupt prosecutors and judges that are doing everything possible to interfere with the presidential election of 2024. And put me in prison, including those many people that I completely and totally despise because they want to destroy America, a now failing nation. And he went on to criticize and attack Special Counsel Jack Smith as well as the Georgia district attorney -- excuse me, the Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. But look, you said this is a playbook we have seen Donald Trump use before. And you're exactly right. And when we say playbook, I mean that quite literally. We know that Donald Trump has written several books, laying out this strategy. There was one about how to get rich, where he says, you know, when you have an enemy, you need to go after them viciously and violently. And he's continued to do that. And it's not only in this campaign, but also he did this in the lead up to 2016, using fear and fear mongering to really try to find his way into the White House the first time around. And it's exactly what he is doing this time. But again, I think the notion of these attacks, and especially where he's going after prosecutors and the judges' family, it's important because it's coming as he is headed to trial. And this is how he's trying to successfully in his mind get a lot of his voters, and more people riled up about this and, you know, contribute to his claims that this is election interference.

      "sentences": "So, the combination of violent rhetoric and sharing of violent images or violent suggestions of images paired with misinformation about the election -- about whether things were rigged that weren't actually rigged or whether results that are accurate and follow the rule of law should be distrusted.When you pair those two things, it makes the connections in people's minds between using violent language or even thinking violently about correcting something that actually doesn't need to be corrected because you know -- because it wasn't wrecked. So, I think those things are problematic. It's interesting because one question is, how much does this either engage the base to think about unlawful conduct? But the other is, how much does it cause the rest of American society to sort of say, you know, what, I'm not interested in this. I really don't like politics and keep people home and make them less interested in voting, or engaging around the issues, or kind of taking a little bit more control of their democracy. And I was really struck by our colleague, Paul Kane of The Washington Post's reporting over the weekend on this new findings from this congressional -- you're going to try to get it right, because the congressional management foundation and it found two things. It found that only like one out of five senior officials on Capitol Hill say that Congress is functioning the way Democratic legislature should. And the other is that like, somewhere close to half of people working on the Hill at a senior level are thinking about leaving because of the heated rhetoric coming from the other party. And I think that shows -- it's not just how it impacts the public, but literally the people who are working in government have now sort of become impacted by the violent rhetoric.",

A big part of why the former president posted about the judge's daughter was intimidation. I mean, it's pretty obvious. Then the question and you all kind of touched on this dynamic in different ways is other Republicans. And whether or not they want to condemn what Donald Trump is saying and doing or not.There was a time during the Trump presidency where Republicans would run for reporters because they didn't want to talk about his latest tweet. Then the former president kind of receded from the white-hot spotlight for a little while and they came out and talked about issues, and we're really happy about it. And I'm not saying we don't talk to these members about issues. We do, but he's now the presumptive nominee of their party. And I talked to Mike Lawler, who is one of the front liners. Somebody who helped make the House Republican majority by winning a seat in New York. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): I think everyone needs to tone down the rhetoric, the language. And you know, obviously, social media has become a vehicle by which to bludgeon people. I just think at the end of the day, the former president, current president, and on down, all of us have a responsibility to check our language. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, it is true that President Biden's campaign is being much more aggressive, which is a different story, different discussion. But they're not putting violent images up. They're not putting, you know, pictures of people up saying like, effectively go after this person. It is different. BARRON-LOPEZAnd Trump telling people to go march on the Capitol and not speaking for hours -- for, you know, the 187 minutes to tell them to stop. So, there is a big difference. I mean, just to add on to what Aaron was saying, it wasn't just with this speaker race where, you know, Republicans have been intimidated and have received death threats. We heard from Mitt Romney, who told the Atlantic that when there were the impeachment votes going down, especially after January 6, that there were Republicans who told him that they would have potentially voted to convict or to impeach President Donald Trump, but that they didn't because they were worried about the attacks on themselves and on their family.",

And there have been a couple of really interesting stories, including from our friend, Mike Bender at the New York Times about what Donald Trump's campaign and him personally what they're doing to try to infuse Christianity into his political movement.Here's one quote. Trump has split the atom between character and policy. This is according to a man named Michael Fea, who is a history professor at Messiah University. He did it because he's really the first one to listen to their grievances and take them seriously. Does he really care about evangelicals? I don't know.

But think he can win things and that he can succeed at carry their agenda over the finish line.I think that ultimately is more important than $60 marketing Bibles or even the words of the message.

You know, if we can use the seized assets of Russian oligarchs to allow the Ukrainians to fight them, that's just pure poetry.

And no one else has come out behind her and said they support it as well. But Johnson cannot take anything for chance in this razor thin majority. So, he said he's going to talk to Marjorie Taylor Greene earlier this week. And he's also been consulting with a another firebrand and that's Republican Matt Gaetz, who was the architect of the last effort to remove a speaker. But in this case, he's actually emerged as a pretty strong Johnson ally. And he said he has been giving the speaker some important advice. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

That's not to say it can't happen again because it relies on a very small number of Republicans who could combine with Democrats.But this Ukraine thing is a -- is a huge question for Mike Johnson. He has talked repeatedly about how this is an important thing to get done in some form. How you're going to get that done in a way that Republicans want is very difficult. How you're going to get that done in a way that can get through the rules committee, which is a very significant part of this process is very important, because you need 290 votes, if you can't do that. So, I think there's a real question here of, is Mike Johnson going to kind of go through the motions on this -- try to give Republicans what they want on this package.

And so that's why they're treating that as a last resort that President Biden is because they want to see something ultimately pass through Congress.
