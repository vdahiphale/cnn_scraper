Now it's coming out in public that this is how Trump feels about it, and they are following his orders, because he is likely going to be the nominee. They are very reluctant to do anything that is seen as undermining him or crossing him.A lot of cases they're driven more by fear than wanting to please him. And, you know, to be honest, Dana, this is a really familiar dynamic for Republicans who served while Trump was in office. He had the power to completely blow up or derail legislation with the, you know, simple click of a tweet or a phone call, and we saw that continually every single day. And now, as it looks increasingly likely that his nomination is inevitable, this is the reality that Republicans are dealing with.",

He also was fined $9,500. And Mehta boiled it down to the fact that Navarro was more than happy to talk publicly about what he was doing after the 2020 election. He wrote a book about it, he did media appearances, but he would not talk to the House. And this prosecution was about contempt of Congress that he didn't show up for testimony or even make any meaningful attempt to negotiate testimony, and they never turned over any documents when the House Select Committee had subpoenaed him. Here's some quotes from Judge Mehta speaking directly to Peter Navarro at the end of this sentencing right before he gave him that amount of time. \"They had a job to do Congress and you made it harder. It's really that simple. It wasn't a kangaroo court. The public could see that. You are not a victim. You are not the object of a political prosecution. These are the circumstances of your own making.\" Now, Peter Navarro did speak in court to the judge. He said he was torn on what to do because he had talked to Donald Trump, thought maybe there would be executive privilege. He's going to be appealing now, just like Steve Bannon, another person who was prosecuted for the very same thing related to the January 6th investigations.",

And here in Superior, the president will have a chance to talk about something and potentially needle Trump on something that he wasn't able to accomplish in his four years in office, and that is passing an infrastructure bill.Biden will be here just a few miles away from Blatnik Bridge saying that he will be promising to deliver these $1 billion in federal funding to repair that bridge that's aging. It currently connects Wisconsin and Minnesota. It's one of those examples that the president is trying to show to voters of his policies actually in action. Of course, as you mentioned, the Biden team is watching some of these bright spots in the economy and hoping that they will start to move in their favor. They're looking at dropping gas prices. The fact that stock markets is going up and also that consumer sentiments are improving. In the end, they are hoping that some of those more upbeat moods about the economy will eventually also translate into better feelings about the president's handling of economic issues. But so far, he has been unable to break through with voters who have a negative perception of his handling of the economy. A recent poll found that less than a third of voters approved of the way that the president has been handling economic issues. Now, the Biden team is also eager to try to draw some further contrast with Trump as they are eyeing that general election matchup. And that will be key in a state like Wisconsin. It's part of that so-called blue wall that helped Biden get into the White House back in 2020. He will need states like this Michigan and Pennsylvania in order to secure a second term. And part of that will be trying to make this economic argument especially to working class voters, which both Biden and Trump are vying for.",

You know, when you look at the blue wall that David was just showing us, and you think about President Biden as a candidate versus other Democrats, that was his strength.

Do they feel like they need drastic change or not? So we'll see if any of those sentiments seep in to make that change.
