The judge denied bail to Mangione, who faces a second-degree murder charge in New York, as well as other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested on Monday.Since his arrest, Mangione has been garnering sympathy and support on social media, partly due to public discontent with the health insurance industry. But that online attention is angering authorities, as CNN's Jason Carroll reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Moscow had always played a key role in shoring up the government in Damascus and has military bases in the country. But the Kremlin acknowledges the challenges it may now face in holding on to them under the new government.CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): As Syrians embark on a new era after ousting long-time dictator Bashar al-Assad, Russia fears the era of its massive military footprint in Syria could be coming to an end. The former commander of Russian forces in Syria and now member of parliament is already warning Russia's leadership not to make concessions. Any gesture of goodwill in the Middle East is perceived as weakness. Weakness is unacceptable, he says. What should be done in this situation, he's asked. Talk from a position of strength, he answers. But how much power does Russia still hold in Syria? Kremlin-controlled TV strategizes over what might come next, with maps showing Russia's bases in Syria. A guest acknowledges Moscow was caught off guard again. Thinking about how it all happened in Syria reminds me about how it all happened in Ukraine in 2014, he says. I want to highlight one universal lesson for world powers. Don't take wishful thinking for reality. When a power is crumbling in days and can't protect itself, this is a verdict. For years, it was the Russian military that kept the Assad regime afloat. Russia's air force pounding rebel groups, its navy firing cruise missiles at ISIS militants in eastern Syria. In return, Assad gave Moscow a 49-year lease on both its main air base near Latakia and a military port in Tartus, allowing Vladimir Putin to project power throughout the Middle East.",
