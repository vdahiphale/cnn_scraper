A historic state visit happening this hour, President Biden welcoming India's prime minister to the White House. You see Mark Milley right there. You see other members of the cabinet and the president's -- and the White House. Well, you also see vice president there. I saw the secretary of state, Tony Blinken, there as well.Very interesting because they are rolling out the red carpet as India's prime minister is about to arrive at the White House at the very same time, there is controversy around it. Some members of the president's own party are boycotting this visit.",

Right now, at least one remote operated vehicle, known as an ROV, has reached the ocean floor, says the Coast Guard, and has begun its search. That search is growing more desperate, as, of course, experts believe that the men on board will likely run out of oxygen today.",

      "sentences": "So, the window of opportunity to find them is closing and the urgency, the amount of gear and the amount of activity is picking up to a very high degree. There are two ROVs in the water now, one U.S. ROV at the seafloor, looking physically to try to find this submersible.The concern is, or the problem is, is that one would expect an emergency beacon on the submersible to be indicating its location. They are not hearing that, and that is of great concern. They have heard these sounds, perhaps banging, perhaps something else, but it sounds manmade that they're trying to zero in on. That little sliver of hope is where they have focused most of their resource right now. There is a second submersible that is about three or four hours into a dive. It takes about 8 hours to get down to that depth. It is going there now. Behind me is the Atlantic Kingfisher, another ship that will take -- we believe will take a deep water salvage gear that's sitting at the airport on a C-17 right now, a very big U.S. military cargo plane. They're going to get it down here and then that will go out to the search area as well. But keep in mind it takes a good 20 hours or so to get out there. With regard to the oxygen, yes, there's concerns about carbon dioxide. They do have scrubbers on board that if they can operate them, they can keep enough oxygen going if they have the oxygen. P.H. Nargeolet, who's a very experienced oceanographer, is also on board. Everybody who knows him and knows how he operates says his first instinct would be to conserve oxygen, would have had everybody either sleeping or very, very calm, as calm as possible. It is dark. If they are alive, it is dark. It is cold. They are facing enormous odds. But there is still hope among search and rescuers that this is a search and rescue and they will not stop until they definitively figure out what has happened to the Titan. Back to you.",

And, presumably, what they will do is once they get down to this area, it's not clear how close this is to the Titanic wreck site. There's always the possibility that the Titan got tied up in Titanic wreckage as well, which may complicate things. But they would establish a pattern, a grid to search. Then the second sub would come down. It would then take over for the first sub, and they would basically do that.It's the same thing they've been doing from the air with the C-130s and the Poseidon aircraft. One goes out, searches, comes back, the other one goes out, searches, and they have just searched massive areas. There is the possibility that this sub is still bobbing on the surface somewhere. So, all of this trying to get to it, because they are running out of time. Back to you.",

I have a question for you. I know that there is some sort of beacon, but why isn't there something like a black box on this kind of vehicle that might help find the submersible?",

      "sentences": "Well, normally what we carry aboard manned submersibles are acoustic beacons, which can be activated by the crew inside, or an emergency situation will self-activate under certain circumstances. For example, when the main batteries, the main electrical power on the sub goes below a certain level, indicating a discharge, it will activate the beacon.And other submersibles have a beacon that can be released from the sub and it floats to the surface and it will have a radio electronic link to satellite through the mothership strobe light on it so you can see it flashing at sea. But my understanding is that the Triton had none of that -- the Titan, I'm sorry, the Titan had none of that. And so it's problematic how they're going to find it. Now, your previously reporter indicated that there is an ROV on the bottom searching. ROVs are a lousy search platform. Once you have a chart and know where something is or you're very close to it, then the ROV is the thing you want, because you can leave it down there almost indefinitely because it's powered up from the surface. They have sonars on board. They can detect the target if you're close enough. So, you do what you've got. But right now, it isn't optimal. And, of course, if the life support is scheduled to run out sometime this morning, then that's an additional problem. BOLDUAN:  Tim Taylor, a deepwater search expert, he told me earlier in the show that he thought the ROVs should have been on site four days ago. Of course, he says they should have been on standby support kind of vessel and should have been in a perfect world, it would have been, four days ago, when the sub first went missing. What do you think about that? What difference could that have made in this regard?",

Having an ROV of that capability, 12,000 feet, on site, standing by with the ship available would be extremely costly. And I think what comes through is OceanGate was trying to do everything in the most economical way possible. So, they just would not pay for that kind of standby.",
