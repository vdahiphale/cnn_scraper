      "sentences": "The man accused of trying to assassinate former President Trump was in federal court today as new details about his alleged plot emerged, such as a reward to anyone who could, quote, \"complete the job.\"And it's, quote, \"raining bombs in Lebanon.\" A barrage of Israeli strikes killing nearly 300 people, forcing many to flee, as Israel's prime minister says his country's war is not with Lebanon, but with Hezbollah. Plus, a show of strength in the Sun Belt for Donald Trump. New polls show a possible path to victory for the former president, as fundraising numbers show his opponent with a huge haul over the weekend, and there are just 43 days until Election Day. We're following these major developing stories and many more, all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Minutes ago, we learned that the man suspected in the second assassination attempt of former President Trump is going to remain in jail. A federal detention hearing for Ryan Routh just wrapped up after three hours, which is a quite long detention hearing. The judge there saying that he found the evidence to keep the 58-year-old defendant behind bars as, quote, \"strong.\" The evidence includes a newly revealed letter. Prosecutors say that Routh wrote at least several months before September 15th, the day that he was arrested, after a witness allegedly spotted him running from the Trump Golf club. Now, that letter, allegedly penned by Routh, starts with this, quote, \"This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, but I am so sorry I failed you. I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. It is now up to you - it is up to you now to finish the job and I will offer $150,000 to whomever can complete the job.\" CNN's Randi Kaye who attended the hearing. Randi, get us up to speed on what happened here. RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Brianna, there was so much information coming out in this hearing, so I'm just going to boil down the most important and intriguing parts of the evidence that federal prosecutors presented. First of all, they described what they believe was Routh's position at the Trump Golf course as a sniper's nest. They said there was one reason and one reason only why he was here in Palm Beach County, Florida, and that was to assassinate the former president. They also said in court that the agent, the Secret Service agent who observed - allegedly observed Routh at the golf course, said that he was in a position that provided a clear line of fire to the sixth hole putting green. Now, remember, Donald Trump was on the fifth hole putting green at the time. That would have put him about 12 to 15 minutes from the sixth hole putting green, where that clear line of fire was. Also new information about the scene itself, there was a scope on the rifle that was found at the scene. That scope apparently was attached, according to prosecutors, by some electrical tape. They say that a preliminary finding shows that a fingerprint found on that electrical tape does belong to Ryan Routh. They also said there were two bags that were found at the scene, and they had metal or steel plates inside them. They said they tested those plates, and federal prosecutors say that those could have stopped small arms fire, so that showed that Ryan Routh was prepared. And just a couple of more bits of evidence, Brianna, that stood out, six cell phones were found in Ryan Routh's car. According to federal prosecutors, one had a Google search on how to get from Palm Beach County to Mexico. Also, the cell phone data shows, according to prosecutors, that Ryan Routh was here in Florida as of August 14th. He came here from Greensboro, North Carolina. That puts him in this area for about a month before this incident occurred, and there were pings on his - from his cell phone to the cell phone towers in the area, precise pings, putting him around Mar-a-Lago and around that golf course multiple times over that time. And finally, there was a handwritten list of dates and venues where the former president was expected to appear leading up to Election Day. They believe that handwritten list belonged to Ryan Routh.

Those facts include clear evidence that he can - he was conspiring to kill the president. There's also a second piece of this, and that is increasing evidence, mounting evidence about his mental state.Anybody who wants to argue that this individual was in a mental state that didn't allow him to make clear decisions, I think, is going to have a tough argument. But the issue is going to be, given the charges that have been filed, how long can they keep him without allowing him bond. I think the big question is whether he gets out or not, and the prosecutors obviously are going to say, heck no, no way, not now, not ever. And I'm going to guess the judge will agree with them.",

Is there somebody else who is participating, who in the hours after the event when this individual was picked up would say, I've got to accelerate my planning because the feds are going to be on to this.You're getting into the second phase now, which is really complicated because it'll go back months and years. It includes things like cell phone, email, travel, friends, family and that is - was anybody cognizant of what the plan was, might they pick up a piece of that plan in a month or a year. For - the evidence today, for example, about a second set of fingerprints on the letter tells me that the feds have ways to go to say whose fingerprints are they and why were they on there? Was it accidental or did somebody participate? I tell you, Brianna, the challenge here is to prove a no. That is, can you guarantee me that over the course of the last year or two that nobody knew and nobody was involved. Proving nos is really hard, Brianna. KEILAR: I wonder what you thought about some of the details that we learned today that he had this, you know, alleged would-be shooter, had a direct line on the sixth green, which would be the next hole that Trump was going to be on. Obviously, someone, when they're on the green, they're standing around, they're putting, they're relatively stationary. And Trump wasn't that far behind, but we learned that a member of the Secret Service, as they were going ahead, a hole ahead of Trump, and they were scouting out the situation, they saw this gun barrel pointed directly at them, at this Secret Service agent, and that as the gun barrel moved, they actually took a shot, then retreated behind a tree, and then as they came back out of cover, that's when they saw that the gunman had left. I wonder what this raises for you about the possibility of the danger there and just how close this came.",

Think about some scenarios.Remember when President Obama spoke to that massive crowd in Chicago after he was elected years ago? What's the chance you could have secured that? Every time a president sit - throws out a first pitch at a baseball game, every time the president goes to a basketball game, when President Trump drives through Central Manhattan, I'm afraid that the pendulum is going to swing to the point where the American people are going to say, there is no way that anybody could ever have access to the president and no way that anybody could ever hurt the president. That is not realistic. I think the shooter got close, but I'm afraid the conclusion that people will draw is that can never happen again, and that is not a realistic proposition, Brianna.",

Don't leave the shelter for 10 minutes until after the sirens are cleared.So they can put that in place at any moment now, anywhere across the country. At the moment, it only exists north of Haifa in the north of Israel where there have been strikes today. So that's an important measure that the IDF has. And the warning coming from the defense minister today for the citizens of Israel is when the home front command tells you something, it is imperative that you follow those instructions. The death toll in Lebanon today from the ministry of health, 356 people dead, 24 of them children, 42 women, 1,246 people wounded in those strikes, 210 Hezbollah missiles coming into Israel today, according to the IDF. The IDF say they hit 1,300 terror targets inside of Lebanon. The Prime Minister today, Benjamin Netanyahu, told the people of Lebanon, we're not targeting you. You're not the enemy. Hezbollah is the enemy. The army chief - the defense minister here, Yoav Gallant, said that what's been targeted today by the IDF is Hezbollah's infrastructure that they've been building for 20 years. The army chief of staff said this is preparing for the next phase.

There's lots of things going on, but you're going to see, like, when you used to see a hurricane coming towards Puerto Rico and it would goggle one way or the other, that's what you're seeing. It's going to continue to move in a direction. But when it moves a little bit to the right or moves a little bit to the left, that's what you're seeing now.
