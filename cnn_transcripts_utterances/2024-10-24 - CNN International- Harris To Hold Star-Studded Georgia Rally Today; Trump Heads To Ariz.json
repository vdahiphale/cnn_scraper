He is going to hold a rally in Arizona, and then he heads to Las Vegas, where he will headline an event alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, Tulsi Gabbard and others. On Wednesday, Trump pushed back against his former Chief of Staff, John Kelly, who in published reports described him as a fascist. Kelly also said that Trump praised the loyalty of Hitler's Nazi generals. The former President responding and posting this online, calling Kelly a total degenerate who made up the story out of pure Trump derangement syndrome hatred. Trump also described the four-star general as, quote, \"tough and dumb\".Let's bring in our team coverage for you. We have CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, who is covering the Harris campaign, and our Alayna Treene, who is tracking the Trump campaign. Priscilla, let me start with you.

Now, there were moments where she showed a more authentic version of herself, talking about faith and grieving her mother, but notably, she also agreed that former President Donald Trump is a fascist. That has come up multiple times over the last several days with the comments from John Kelly that were in The New York Times and The Atlantic, and she invoked those comments repeatedly over the course of the town hall, as she drives home this message, or at least tries to with voters that a second potential Trump term would be dangerous and come with many risks.And so, that was one of the clear messages coming out from the Vice President at that town hall, and also one that they're going to build upon and fold into her closing argument next week, on Tuesday, as you mentioned, a speech that will happen at the Ellipse, which is a notable and historical location and will be one of the highest profile denunciations of the former President and January 6th.",

So, certainly, a lot of star power. We are also learning that tomorrow, when the Vice President is in Texas, talking about reproductive rights, she will be joined by Beyonce.Now, all of this is because the campaign is again trying to amplify their message, not only about warnings of a second potential Trump term, but also on some of their key issues, including reproductive rights, and all over the course of all of that, trying to capitalize on early voting. Here in Georgia, early voting has already begun. So, this is going to be yet another attempt by the Vice President and her team to mobilize and energize voters. She'll do the same later in Michigan on Saturday, where she is going to be joined by Michelle Obama, which will also mark their first time on the campaign trail together. So, sort of this build-up toward Election Day, with the Vice President and her team bringing out the star power, and hoping that all of this can help them in both amplifying their message, but also driving voters to the polls.",

So, he has his first stop in Arizona, and then later, he'll actually have another rally hosted by Turning Point Action, the same group that held that rally last night in Duluth, Georgia, but that will be taking place in Las Vegas. And when I talked to Donald Trump's senior advisors, they say a key goal of this trip, of this West Coast swing, is to continue targeting Latino voters. We saw him do that earlier this week with a number of events that he had held in North Carolina.But, part of that strategy, Rahel, is really trying to focus on making inroads with demographics and voters that they believe could make a difference in these -- in this election, particularly on the margins, as we all have been discussing at length. This election is expected to be incredibly close, and that is something that Trump's advisors acknowledge. They also recognize that they need to do whatever they can to siphon as many people away from Harris' campaign toward Donald Trump's campaign, and also try and turn out first-time voters and low- propensity voters. So, that's going to be a lot of what Donald Trump will be discussing today. I think another thing that you can expect him to talk about is early voting, both early voting as well as mail-in voting. Now, these are things we know that Donald Trump has been quite skeptical of in the past. He is actually still skeptical of it, when I talk to people close to him, but something that he recognizes, and his team keeps telling him that he needs to be encouraging voters to do. In order for them to win, they really believe that voters need to not be afraid of all of the tools of making sure that their vote counts. And so, he is going to be talking a lot about that as well. I would also note, yesterday, he said himself that he would be voting early. He said that in an interview with Fox News. So, I think he'll be using some of that rhetoric throughout the campaign trail today.",

I want you to take a listen to what he said, but I also want to just give our listeners a heads up that some of this audio is not very easy to understand. I was told Trump had a bad connection, but take a listen and hear what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOICE OF DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think it's her worst performance. She hasn't had a good one, but this was her worst performance. These people are crude, rude and vicious. And by the way, there is only a vessel, and so is Joe Biden. He is not the leader of the party, never was. She is no different. She is a vessel.

This is actually something when I was in Duluth last night at that big rally here in Georgia, that was something that Tucker Carlson and some of the other speakers who had been -- who had taken the stage before Donald Trump were noting as well that they argued Donald Trump is the clear leader of the Republican Party. It's clear that he stands for something. And then tried to argue that Kamala Harris is just a product of what they argued was the Democratic machine. I think that's what Donald Trump was getting at. And it's interesting, because I was asking some of his advisors about that, and they argued, we think that's a solid message that if it wasn't Harris, it would be someone just like her, and that actually doesn't really matter. It's just representative of the party overall. So, take that what you will. But, I think a new line of attack. We may start hearing more from the former President.",

But, I mean, the fact that he couldn't even say himself that she closed the deal last night. It's obvious that she did not. I mean, look, this strategy going into the final days of saying Donald Trump is bad, vote for me, is clearly not one that's working. If you look at The Wall Street Journal poll that's out this morning, Donald Trump is leading in -- on many different fronts, whether it's the economy, whether it's on immigration, and if you look at the overall job approval rating, he is higher in his approval rating than she was as Vice President. She has a 54 percent disapproval for her vice presidency. So, if her -- she wants to spend her time here in Washington and go give speeches on the mall, saying Donald Trump is bad, that's fine. It doesn't seem to be one that the voters are wanting to hear right now. They're wanting to hear about cost of living. They're wanting to hear about getting the border under control. Voters are very clear-eyed about who Donald Trump is, and they don't need to hear more of he is bad from her. So, I think it's a -- it's not a great strategy in these waning days of the campaign.",

So, when Lance says that he is talking about securing the border and those things, he had an opportunity to do that as President.

Recall, it was Kamala Harris who spent the first 60 days of her campaign avoiding the media at all costs, and only when she started slipping in the polls did she decide to start going out and doing some of these interviews. So, I mean, we have a little revisionist history going on here.So, he steps out all the time and does interviews. And I just think where they are right now, they have a very clear message, which is, Kamala broke it. Trump is going to fix it. And I think her message right now is that Donald Trump is bad, and that's just not going to sell with the voters.

Kylie, what did Blinken achieve on this trip, if anything? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's very clear that he set out on this trip to try and create some momentum to bring about what the U.S. has said is an opportunity at this moment in time, following the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, to try and drive forth an end to the conflict in Gaza, and of course, the release of all the hostages that are there. It's unclear exactly if he has been able to actually create that momentum in an effective way. One of the things that he just said in a press conference in Doha was that there will be conversations in the coming days with negotiators in the region, but that is potentially a point of hope for the United States who is trying to get back to conversations to drive forth an end to this conflict. However, the efficacy, how effective those conversations will actually be, is a bit of a question mark, because he was unable to say if Hamas would be at the table. Presumably, those who speak for -- speak with Hamas regularly in the region, the Egyptians and the Qataris, would potentially be there. But, unless you have all of the negotiators at the table, it's hard to see how a meeting like that would actually create momentum towards the end that the United States wants to see. And the other point is that he said in his conversations with his Israeli counterparts, including with Prime Minister Netanyahu and also with Qatari officials, that they spoke about new potential frameworks to try and secure the release of those hostages still in Gaza, even after Yahya Sinwar's death. But, what's unclear at this point is what specific framework they are going to decide on and drive forth to really get all the negotiators on the same page and get them to a yes on. So, you have all of these questions that continue to pop up, not the least of which is that you hear from Qatari officials who have been in touch with Hamas, they really don't know who is going to be the lead negotiator, the lead decision maker, I should say, for Hamas in Gaza. So, even though the Secretary of State is trying to drive this momentum, it's unclear if that has been authentically created on this trip. We'll have to watch and see what happens over the course of the next few days here.",

And here are from the international headlines we're watching for you today.The controversial issue of reparations for Britain's past transatlantic slave trade is expected to come up at the Commonwealth summit in Samoa. Britain's King Charles and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer are attending the gathering of 56 member states. Diplomats are reportedly preparing to debate the issue. Britain enslaved more than three million Africans, transporting them to colonies around the world, according to a government-funded organization. One estimate last year put the price of reparations at $24 trillion. The Turkish military carried out airstrikes on 32 targets in Iraq and Syria. The strikes are in response to Wednesday's deadly attack on the state-run aerospace company in Turkey's capital. According to Turkey's Interior Minister, the man and woman who carried out the attack were members of the Kurdish PKK group. They were later killed by Turkish security forces. And as of now, no group has claimed responsibility for the attack that left five people dead. And Russian President Vladimir Putin is talking peace today, just not in Ukraine. You can see him here. Speaking to reporters at the BRICS summit happening right now, he told his fellow leaders that the wars raging in Gaza and Lebanon must stop. Putin also called for the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The war in Ukraine, which Putin launched, also came up. Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a political settlement through mediation involving his country and Brazil. More than 20 world leaders attended the summit in Russia, and it's aimed as a counterpoint to Western influence. Marc Stewart has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: We are seeing evidence that there are North Korean troops that have gone to Africa.

And it remains unclear at this point what they're going to do. Are they going to be shipped off to western Russia and then go down into Ukraine to actually become co-belligerents in this conflict? That is not yet clear. But, it seems inevitable to many officials that we have spoken to that, given that the North Korean troops are in Russia, they are likely to be helping the Russians in some capacity with the war in Ukraine.And so, the big concern now, of course, is that the North Koreans do funnel additional troops into Ukraine to help Russia, because the Ukrainians right now are suffering a serious manpower shortage on the frontlines. They have struggled in their recruitment and forced regeneration, according to Secretary Austin in remarks he gave us earlier this week when we were traveling with him. And so, if Moscow is able to increase the number of forces that it is using inside Ukraine, using North Korean troops, when it is already able to conscript around 30,000 personnel per month to fight in the war in Ukraine, then that gives the Russians a serious advantage over the Ukrainians. That is deeply concerning. And so, that is the big worry now that this is going to be even more of a North Korean involvement in Ukraine than what we have seen just with, of course, North Korea's many shipments of ammunition and weapons that they've provided to the Russians, Rahel.",

The most recent was -- for any sports team was in 2019. That was celebrating the U.S. women's soccer team who won the World Cup.Now, Commissioner Cathy Engelbert of the WNBA, she said that the finals marked the culmination of the most transformational year in the WNBA's history. The clinching game was the most viewed finals game in 25 years, 2.2 million viewers. And Rahel, that was going up against a playoff baseball game in NFL Sunday Night Football. This was the most viewed WNBA regular season ever, averaging over a million viewers. Attendance was up 48 percent league-wide. Merchandise sales, 601 percent increase at the WNBA store, and the league, of course, Rahel, ended a new media rights deal that will be worth more than $2 billion over the next 11 years.
