Because of the presence of so many undeclared voters. Actually, undeclared voters think probably independents make up the largest share of voters there.What Harry and I -- Harry Enten CNN Senior Data Reporter, want to talk about right now is how candidates who've run in this lane before, like Nikki Haley, have done.

Well, it was John Kasich, who came in second place, but a distant second place behind Donald Trump, got 16 percent of the vote.Where did John Kasich run particularly well? Well, he ran quite well in what I would call the Connecticut River Valley. Right in here, right in around Hanover. That's, of course, Dartmouth College, where I, in fact, went to school. And what we see here is John Kasich easily won in Hanover with 42 percent of the vote. But the key nugget to see here, very few votes in Hanover. Look, he won there with just 688 votes. It's not good enough just to carry Hanover and therefore carry the state of New Hampshire.",

Again, very well educated, Hanover, New Hampshire. But look, he only got 531 votes there. It's simply put, not good enough to win the state. BERMANAll right. Harry, we don't have similar data for 2000, but when people think about a candidate who appeals to independents, It's John McCain. People think about John McCain.
