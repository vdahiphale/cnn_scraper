It's 11 a.m. in Gaza where desperately needed humanitarian aid is finally being delivered via the floating pier built by the U.S. Central Command says trucks have started moving ashore carrying the international aid. No U.S. troops set foot on the ground in Gaza. Heavy seas have prevented the U.S. from deploying the floating pier for days holding up the aid deliveries and it comes as Israel expands its ground operations in Rafah and throughout the enclave. New satellite images show Israeli forces have been conducting bulldozing operations north of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Israeli troops have advanced nearly five kilometers since the start of the operation on May the 6th. Entire blocks and many tent camps have been razed and the streets appear empty. The U.N. estimates nearly 600,000 people have fled the city. Prior to Israel's ground invasion more than a million displaced Palestinians were seeking refuge there. Israel says the operation remains, quote, limited in space and in targets. But the Israeli defense minister says more troops will be deployed in Rafah soon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): This operation will continue as additional forces will enter the area. Several tunnels in the area have been destroyed by our troops and additional tunnels will be destroyed soon. This activity will intensify. Hamas is not an organization that can reorganize. It does not have reserve troops. It has no supply stocks and no ability to treat the terrorists that we target. The result is that we are wearing Hamas down. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
