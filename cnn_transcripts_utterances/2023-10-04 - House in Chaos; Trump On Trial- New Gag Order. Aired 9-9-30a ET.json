No Republican would expect Democrats to help join them to vote for speaker just as Democrats wouldn't expect Republicans to do so.But focusing in on Matt Gaetz, you say it's about -- you said it's hypocritical and heresy. He is not alone, though. There are eight Republicans who voted to oust -- who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy, and the word from some of them are, they are -- did not trust Kevin McCarthy. He did not keep his word. I'm hearing -- what do you say to that? D'ESPOSITO: I would have to disagree. I think from January or even right before that, Kevin laid out a clear and concise commitment to America. And we've delivered on that. We've put bills onto the floor that nobody thought that we could pass, and we delivered on them. And working in government, working for our country is about compromise. And some of those individuals had no interest in compromise. It's what they wanted or nothing. And quite frankly, I think most people, as we saw yesterday, 96% of our conference trusted Kevin McCarthy and supported him to be our speaker. But unfortunately, we had a small group who wanted to play real political games and wanted to use our rules to commit terrorist attacks. And that's what we're dealing with.",

I mean, this is -- what we're seeing today is what we should be focused on is last Saturday we had a win for the American people when everyone said it was impossible, when everyone said that the shutdown was looming in just hours, were able to get onto that floor pass, in a bipartisan fashion, which was in the best interest of Americans.",

They conferenced with the Democrats to defeat McCarthy's more conservative CR, and then they conferenced with the Democrats to defeat McCarthy on the floor. Right now, I'm not sure the Republicans are the majority party. You've got more of a coalition government, and this group is spending all their time siding with Democrats. To me, the next question is, are the rules going to change? Will one person be able to trigger a leadership crisis?

And it was a picture of the judge's clerk with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer saying in the post that she is Schumer's girlfriend without any evidence to back that up. Well, that was just a bridge too far, because as you just noted, John, Trump hasn't been shy about making comments about anyone in this trial, the judge or anyone. But this went too far for that judge. He issued this rebuke saying, personal attacks of any member of my court staff are unacceptable, inappropriate, and I will not tolerate them. And he said, if that is violated, any posts, any emails, then there are going to be strict sanctions. Well, after the day of court ended, everyone was told to leave the courtroom, but both sides of the defense, the state's attorneys, had to come back into the room. And there was some discussion with the judge. It's unclear what was said behind those closed doors, so it's very unclear what those strict sanctions could be, how they would be enforced. I imagine it was discussed behind those closed doors. But like you said, today is day three. He is back. We weren't expecting him to come back today, to be quite honest with you, but he has been very engaged with his defense during testimony.
