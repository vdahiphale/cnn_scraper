That is why they have renewed these calls with leaflets, with phone calls for people to evacuate to the south. That is where they say that most of the Hamas operations are, which are in the north.They say that they've also killed some five named key Hamas operatives in the last day or so is that they are keen to emphasize that their key goal of course is eradicating Hamas is bearing fruit. Obviously we're also hearing about the release of an Israeli soldier -- the rescue rather of an Israeli soldier which shows Israel says that it continued to do this ground offensive all the while continuing to try to get these hostages out. That the two are not mutually exclusive. But of course, as you say, they are striking not just in the north. We're hearing of a house that was that was hit in an area just south of the line where Israel told civilians to evacuate beyond. Thirteen people killed, among them children. A journalist at the hospital where those bodies were brought said he saw a total of 44 bodies. So significant chaos still on the ground, significant civilian suffering. While Israel of course, presenting this as very targeted, very surgical, slow, meticulous rooting out these Hamas operatives and pieces of infrastructure and trying to target them.",

It's not a blackout, but it's very, very minimal at this point, and barely enough for us to be in touch with our teams on the ground with our partners, with the bakeries, with the shops that we are operating.

So you know the World Food Program is reiterating the Secretary- General's appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire and the protection of civilians and infrastructure. But without a ceasefire, we will not be able to operate the way we should to be able to get to everyone.Also, fuel is in short supply. And that's bringing Gaza into a standstill. So just to give you an example, bakeries we used to distribute bread to around 200,000 people every morning just in the last few days. And because now of the shortage of fuel, we only have one bakery out of 23 still operating. And we've just delivered yesterday bread for 20,000 people. So that's really a fraction of the needs of 20 -- of two million people in the Gaza Strip. And also the supplies that are coming through the border crossing point. They are trickling in slowly, but if we are to really have a serious and a real difference on the grounds we need much more assistance and aid to be getting in. We only had 12 trucks come in in the last, you know, 10 days. And for us to be able to deliver food to the two million -- to the one million people that we want to assist, we need 40 trucks to be passing every day. So it's a very difficult operating environment for humanitarian agencies including the World Food Program. And also if we are serious about, you know, saving lives, meeting the needs of these people, we have to have access. We have to have the humanitarian ceasefire and we have to be able to get supplies in quickly.",

This kind of this movement and again because of the damage infrastructure, the fuel shortages, the you know, the intensification of the bombardments and also the, I mean, there's simply the fuel and also we're running out of supplies. I mean the that's the reality is that the supplies that we have inside Gaza are becoming extremely limited. So it's not that we, you know, we have we -- we're now it's becoming it's looking more like a hand to mouth operation. So we're just getting supplies. Trying to get them as soon as possible and the operating environment is not allowing for reaching the 1 million people that we need to get to. Since the beginning of the conflict, we reached 630,000 people. But OK, that's cumulative over the last few days and not on daily basis.",

Which is that, you know, they arrive in Rafah, they travel around, you know, 100 kilometers back and forth to Nitzana to get checked, to get scanned. And then they go back to Rafah, and then they move in. So a number of things. It's the process. It's the lack of fuel. All of this is making it very difficult.

We teach the children, too, so that if we are killed, they can feed themselves. The tanks are filled with impure water. We try to keep our spirits up. There is camaraderie in the chaos.
