You see, this is the community that saw Evan grow up. He went to Princeton High School where he played soccer, won the state championship when he was a senior. So this is a community of people that have watched him grow up, followed his career, and when they found out that he had been taken into custody and put into a Russian prison, they jumped right into action. They tried to figure out what they could do as a community to support him. They partnered with the \"Wall Street Journal\" and held a series of events to keep Evan`s name and his story in people`s minds. They worried that as time went on that somehow people would forget about Evan`s story. So they`ve been holding these types of events. In fact, the event that was held here was originally scheduled to be another one of these awareness type of events. But when they learned the good news on August 1st that Evan was coming home, they quickly pivoted and changed this into a welcoming party. They have gathered here, the same place where they gathered as young students. This is where they gather to celebrate their victories. They say they want to welcome him home and celebrate that he`s finally free. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

South Africa has an executive, legislative and judicial capital in Pretoria, Cape Town and Bloemfontein, respectively. South Africa`s biodiversity is unmatched. It`s known for being home to the largest land mammals, the African elephant and rhinos, and it`s also home to marine life like great white sharks, penguins and fur seals. Wildlife teams in Cape Town have come up with a clever way to protect the endangered seals from challenges they face from their contact with humans and plastic waste, all while showing them off to visitors. (END VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over):  It`s an early and quiet morning at one of South Africa`s most visited tourist destinations, Cape Town`s iconic V&amp;A Waterfront, which attracts around 24 million people annually. Situated in the oldest working harbor in the Southern Hemisphere, it`s also a welcoming host to an entirely different breed of mammal.",

The added benefit to theseal platform is that we`ve made the gaps between the wood and slats very wide and for a very specific reason. We have around 100 seals a year that come into the waterfront with plastic entanglements just like these around their necks. But if they come and rest on our platform here with the wide slats, we get to climb into wetsuits, swim below them and disentangle them. And we use a very special tool for that. This is our cutter and it is a hooked blade on the inside, very thin to fit through the wooden slats. And the idea is that we`ll swim in a wetsuit underneath the platform. We poke this through the slats, hook it onto the entanglement and give it a really good tug. And that`ll snap it off the seal`s neck. From the seals` point of view, he`s resting in the sun. He`ll feel a tug on his neck. He`ll stand up, he`ll bark at the seal next to him and lie down again. He doesn`t even know there was a human involved in removing this plastic off his neck.",
