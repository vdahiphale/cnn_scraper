The city is only 20 kilometers from Gaza, where the IDF says Hamas is holding 230 hostages. Now, in Gaza, we are waiting to see the latest images of damage from overnight, and of course, receive the reports on possible casualties. Overnight, the reports of near-total communications blackout, internet, telephone, mobile phones and the like, it's believed to be that has now eased up.

So, we haven't heard from all of the communications companies inside of Gaza, but we have heard from two who say that they are working to repair the infrastructure that was damaged and slowly but surely, they are restoring internet connectivity, home or land landline, cell service, et cetera, and that seems to be the case.But before, on Friday, you had international aid groups, the U.N., the WHO, among them saying that they had lost contact with their staff on the ground. You also have now this debate going on with the Starlink, a satellite internet company run by Elon Musk, who says that he will provide connectivity through Starlink to internationally recognized aid groups. But that set off a serious controversy. The response coming from the Israeli communications minister, who said that Israel will fight that. And I'll just read you what he tweeted. He said, Hamas will use it for terrorist activities. There's no doubt about it. We know it. Musk knows it. Hamas is ISIS. Perhaps Musk would be willing to condition it with the release of our abducted babies, sons, daughters, elderly people, all of them. By then my office will cut any ties with Starlink. Elon Musk, by the way, responded saying, look, he's not naive. He says that they would ensure that any use of Starlink would be done only by actual humanitarian aid groups. He also says that there have been no attempts to connect thus far. And even went one step further by saying that, look, the U.S., the Israelis, if they want, they can carry out their own security checks before any -- anyone inside of Gaza is allowed to connect to Starlink right now. But at the moment it seems, Richard, that the internet, the cell service is gradually coming back. So, perhaps this may not be needed",

We're also trying to sort out exactly to what extent Israeli troops are actually on the ground. We know that there are tanks going in. The Israelis also say that troops on the ground are helping to direct airstrikes inside of Gaza. We also heard yesterday from a journalist in central Gaza, who says that the artillery strikes, in his words, did not Stop. He also said that there was gunfire in the east along the perimeter wall there.Obviously, this is only exacerbating the humanitarian situation. We have new video from the AFP yesterday showing people ransacking a U.N. warehouse carrying out bags of food. There is obviously a lot of desperation right there or happening right there. And none of this seems to be fazing at all, the Israeli leadership who are, sort of, framing all of this in binary terms. You had the defense minister yesterday saying, it is us or them. You had the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that Gaza is a fortress of evil and dismissing anyone who accuses the IDF of war crimes of as being hypocritical liars. Both also warned that this would not be a short war, that they are in it for the long haul. Israel has also been trying to reiterate its calls for people to move south with more urgency, though it's not clear whether that message is really getting through. It's also important to make very clear, Richard, that look, just because you moved south of this arbitrary line that the Israelis have drawn on a map does not mean that you are safe. There continues to be strikes in Central Gaza and in Southern Gaza as well. And as the Palestinian Red Crescent would point out, they say that nowhere is safe for Gazans right now.",

This near-total blackout on communications has meant that aid groups have no idea where their personnel are, or indeed, even if they're still alive. The same holds true for everyone else. A CNN producer in Gaza has told us he's been unable to reach his relatives and the only way he could tell us that was by using a phone with a foreign SIM card which enables limited communications. As we've been reporting, as I just told you a second or two ago, cellular and internet do appear to have been partially restored. Samer Abdeljaber is the Palestinian representative and director at the World Food Programme. He joins me now from Jerusalem. Good morning, sir. At a press conference yesterday, Israel's spokesman Rear Admiral David Hagari said, on Monday the humanitarian efforts to Gaza led by Egypt and the U.S. will be expanding. Do you know anything about this? Are you expecting to be able to take more in through the Rafah Crossing? SAMER ABDELJABER, PALESTINE REPRESENTATIVE AND DIRECTOR, WFP:  That's true, and we hope today we will be able to allow more trucks into Gaza. 40 trucks are expected to be crossing. However, we have to also note that that's not enough compared to the soaring needs that are in need at the moment in Gaza. We need more than that. Just for WP to be able to reach 1 million people, we need 40 trucks a day. If we're going to be supporting 2 million people, we need 100 trucks of food.
