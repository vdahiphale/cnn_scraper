Now, the White House has been leaning into those previous -- or at least the GOP calls to make spending cuts in their negotiations over the debt ceiling. But they haven't given concrete proposals. And in the absence of that, we're expecting President Biden to talk about the impacts of some of the cuts that have come up before. Again, two of those essential programs, like the Affordable Care Act, where President Biden is expected to talk about the millions of Americans who could lose health care, should that go away, as well as Medicaid. Now, of course, we should note, the Republicans haven't been actively pushing for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act for some time. But with the president's budget expected to drop very soon, and in the absence of any proposals from the GOP, that's where we'll see President Biden leaning in today in his remarks. As he tries to further the theme of the State of the Union, that he's going to finish the job. But also, as he emphasizes the importance of affordable health care -- Abby?",

Tens of millions of people could see their precipitation drug coverage cut back. Forty million people with health insurance in this country today potentially could see that go away. Over seven million seniors and people with disabilities could see their home care, nursing care cut back. There's so much at stake. And unfortunately, what's old is often new. We have seen MAGA Republicans put the Affordable Care Act on the table, on the chopping block, time and time again.

Those lines of communication are still open.The president has made an entire career based on being able to get things done in a bipartisan manner. It's important to remind people that the debt ceiling has been raised repeatedly, many more times under Republican presidents than not. And the president is very interested in having meaningful discussions with leaders of the Republican Party. But there are some things that he just will not compromise on. He will not compromise on Social Security. He will not compromise on cutting Medicare coverage. He will not compromise on cutting Medicaid coverage. He will not compromise on these things that will impact millions of people across this country. But he's willing to have these discussions. But the congressional leaders, Republican congressional leaders have to come with a plan. It's not enough when you are in leadership to say, I am against everything that you are for.

Millions of people automatically qualified. Millions of people applied for this debt relief. And the president will encourage people to rely -- to speak out, stay in touch with your congressional leaders. Because we have to remember this relief will impact people mostly who are already working, who make less than $75,000 a year. This relief will impact Independents, Republicans, Democrats across the board. So it would be great if Congress would join in making sure that this relief stays in play.

What he's really concerned about is dissidents inside Russia. And there's an entire center inside the FSB that is responsible for not only monitoring but also taking care of, eliminating, like the Russians say, liquidating dissidents. And he's very, very concerned about that because of how poorly the war is going. He's got to monitor it very, very carefully.",
