And they spoke to a couple of migrants one from Mexico, one from Venezuela.And the migrants are telling us that look, they are coming to Denver for a specific reason. They are seeing that there are nice hotels, that the space is nice, and their friends are telling them, hey, instead of going somewhere else, go to Denver. Do you worry that the policies that had been put forth and the thought that it's a sanctuary city has attracted people on top of this new thing that's happening where people are sharing a video of even the hotel rooms that they're going into? Does that worry you that it's going to become a place where a lot more migrants want to go?",

And we are seeing that most people are coming with having a contact with the Border Patrol. So, those things are working in a sense. We know they have a sophisticated line of communication between each other in terms of migrants. It's what we do particularly as families and communities that are trying to seek safety and security in the new (INAUDIBLE).

This is the second phase of this huge influx of migrants coming. So, many have already gone and settled in their new locations, and the next phase is where these relatives and family and neighbors who are -- who are coming to connect with them. So yes, we are moving folks on. We wrecked -- we suggest or think about 60 percent of them are moving on to other locations and are not staying in Denver. But let me also share with you that five of us mayors, including Mayor Adams in New York, DC, Chicago, and Denver have joined together in a letter to the White House that arrives today requesting a meeting with the president so we can set and be very specific with him what we need to help our cities deal with this influx of migrants, and particularly as he continues to try to communicate with Congress about what they need to do to step up to the responsibility of federal government on this issue.",

In the meantime, we also need to make sure that we have interim strategies, work authorization strategies for these migrants that are coming. Help the local governments with capacity particularly around shelter, and financial resources. Denver has expended close to $17 million since December. We received $900,000 from the federal government in their latest allocation. That's absolutely unacceptable. We are bearing the burden of a federal responsibility around immigration. And they need to lean in more and certainly a more robust way to make sure that the cities are made whole because this is coming directly out of our general funds. So, financial resources, shelter resources, all the necessary resources to care for the migrants in terms of resources around hygiene, around clothing, things necessary, as well as strategies to move them along and help them to resettle in the U.S.",

Her name is Jenna Barbee.She teaches fifth grade in Hernando County, which is a part of the Tampa Bay area. And she says that this all happened during the standardized testing time in early May. She played for her fifth-grade class the Disney movie Strange Worlds because the plot of it was tied to their current lesson plan, which was the environment and ecosystems. You mentioned that it does feature a character who is biracial and gay, but the teacher, Barbee, says that the movie was not sexually inappropriate in any way. And in fact, she thought she was following the policy because she had signed permission slip signed by parents of every student in that class to allow for the viewing of PG movies. And that movie was not listed as an objection. Now, we did reach out to Hernando County Public Schools and they did confirm that the Florida Department of Education is investigating Barbee after a parent complained to them that this movie was inappropriate. That parent also a school board member. Now, they sent letters to the homes -- to the parents and this is what they said in the letter. Yesterday, that Disney movie Strange World was shown in your child's classroom. While not the main plot of the movie, parts of the story involves a male character having an expressing feelings for another male character. In the future, this movie will not be shown. The school administration and the district's Professional Standards Department is currently reviewing the matter to see if further corrective action is required. So, last week, Barbee actually showed up to a school board meeting and confronted them during the public comment section. School Board Member Shannon Rodriguez was there and she acknowledged that she was the one who called the Department of Education. Her daughter was in Barbee's class. And she says that that movie was inappropriate. And that Barbee, she claims, did not follow policy because she did not get pre-emptive approval to show that specific movie. This is what Rodriguez had to say during that board meeting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
