The Russian attacks comes less than 24 hours after the United States and Germany announce plans to send dozens of sophisticated tanks to the battlefield.

      "sentences": "Well, Max, I don't think it is, to be honest, I think the idea that the Russians would revenge themselves or avenge themselves against the deployment of tanks is somewhat misguided. The reality is that these are targets of opportunity that the Russians have been trying to use now for months going after the energy facilities here, the civilian energy facilities.I'm standing close to where a man in his 50s was killed by the descending debris of a missile that was shot down, clearly targeting a significant energy facility here. And this has been the pattern across the whole country. And pretty frequently, almost you'll recall Max, almost on a weekly basis, you get these attacks. Now, the deployment of the promised tanks from a NATO which number close to around 100 falls far short of what the Ukrainians have asked for, which is 3 to 400. But they are modern tanks, replacing tanks that the Ukrainians have lost in there fighting against the Russians. And the Russian sorry, the Ukrainian Defense Minister yesterday told Christiane Amanpour that he thought that these tanks would be put to use as an iron fist, in his words, to try and smash through a Russian defensive line somewhere long, the very long, frontline that stretches right across this country from north to south in the east, predominantly. But the there is no sign yet that those tanks are going to be deployed we understand that the challenge of two tanks in United Kingdom might be among the first to arrive, then the Leopard tanks. And then it could be months before the Ukrainian see the 30 American Abrams tanks, but they are very excited indeed about getting these tanks because it not only did they help in the battle, but it also symbolically allows the Ukrainians in NATO to get on board much more closely in terms of continued supply of these near strategic weapons. So tanks aren't strategic weapons, but longer range artillery is longer range rockets. And above all, fighter bomber jets are very strategic. And they're the top of the list really, of what the Ukrainians are continuing to ask for, Max.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. They make no bones about it; their priority is to secure the air. In other words, to prevent the sorts of missile attacks so you can see that some of the debris still being cleared up behind me to prevent these waves of not only Iranian made primitive drones, the Shahed drones.But these cruise missiles, they have been given the air defenses that helped to bring down. They shot all 20 that were fired here, Kyiv town, Max. But of course they need replenishment of these anti- missile, missile systems and they need more of them. So that's the top of their list. Then they're saying they need more artillery, they need more tanks, of course, they want more drones, they want that modern weaponry that will give them the qualitative edge over the quantitative edge that the Russians have at the moment. The Russians, as you know, Max is sending these waves a human waves of infantry, particularly from the Wagner group employing prisoners, arguably almost pressganged prisoners into rushing at uranium, a Ukrainian positions getting blown down in dozens. Some of them are getting through and that making very incremental, very small amounts of progress at enormous cost. And what the Ukrainians wants to be able to do is punch through those areas and rid the country entirely of Russians. And it seems to be that now that you've seen this unity among NATO partners over the tank issue. There's a growing sense that it is right, ultimately, for all the Ukrainians to actually defeat the Russians here rather than hold them back. I think that may be a significant shift in the kind of behind closed doors attitude of a lot of NATO countries, because there has been a concern that Russia shouldn't in the words of Emmanuel Macron, the French President be humiliated. That was a sort of statement he was making at the beginning of this war. Now, I think there's a growing sense in the NATO partners that Russia should be beaten effectively out of Ukrainian territory and then dealt with on different terms, once that has occurred, Max.",

One official saying they would consider these deployments, these tank shipments to be legitimate targets. Now that's nothing new Russia throughout this conflict has said any weapons shipments to Ukraine will be targeted or will attempt to be targeted by Russia's forces. And now yet another statement saying that the West has crossed the red line that it is now deeply involved that its direct involvement cannot be denied again, statements coming from the Kremlin but I think what's important to note here, Max is that the reaction from the United States the West, the alliance is very different this time. They have absolutely made a conscious decision after this period to step up, ramp up the type of weapons that Ukraine is seeing the tanks. That would have been unimaginable when the conflict started, that Western allies would provide tanks to Ukraine. But clearly Moscow now seems like much less of a threat to these capitals. They see President Putin in the West as a severely weakened by this conflict. He's losing tens of thousands of soldiers on the ground. As you heard from my colleague, Sam Kiley, there he's running out of those resources. On the other hand, Ukraine, it seems like it has an endless supply of support from its Western allies.",

It marks the deadliest day in the West Bank in more than a year.Extremely cold weather sweeping across much of East Asia this during the busy Lunar New Year travel season in many places temperatures have fallen to record lows.

In fact, I just got an update from our producer in Tokyo. She is telling me that flights for the most part have resumed.However, flights in the Northern part of Japan may deal with the weather still. Others also concerned as a heavy snowstorm is expected to hit sometime tomorrow in Japan, particularly along the Sea of Japan Coast. That could impact flights as well as the Shinkansen, which of course is the bullet train that so many people in Japan depend on to get from point A to point B. Also problems to report in Korea, specifically a Jeju Island which is a big tourist hotspot, especially during the holidays. Flights to and from there have finally started to resume, but there were definitely some issues there from all of this weather. Again, heavy snow strong winds impacting many parts of Asia. Finally, I want to take you to China where we are reporting that the City of Mohe which is often referred to as China's North Pole, it recorded its coldest day ever and to put that in context. This comes after China saw its worst heatwave in 50 years so certainly some extreme conditions there. As far as here in Hong Kong things are mild, a bit cloudy, but everything here seems to be an OK, Max.",

He is posting on truth social, which is his own social media platform. He has an exclusive deal with them as well. Let's speak to CNN's Donie O'Sullivan in New York for this, because this is what people are saying, right? That he's not going to return to mainstream media because he's got this deal with his own platform, which might not even survive if he wasn't on it.DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, exactly Max, look, he has from our understanding a deal with truth social, which is that the social media platform that he is now affiliated with, where he has to post there first, and then he could post on other platforms, six hours later, which, as you know, from using social media, that's not really a sustainable approach if you want to have engagement on the likes of Facebook and Twitter. But I think broadly, the expectation here is that at some point, he might be able to wiggle out at that, particularly as we go into the 2024 election cycle. He's going to probably want to be engaged in the news through his use of Twitter and also importantly, using those really valuable targeted ads on Facebook.",

Because Facebook was absolutely central to how he won in the past that way, he managed to target particular groups and get them on side and sell them the sorts of stories that they wanted to hear. So it almost feels inevitable that he would go back onto Facebook.O'SULLIVAN: Yes, in the 2020 campaign cycle, the Trump campaign spent hundreds of millions of dollars on Facebook ads. And look, I think even Democrats would say that the Trump campaign is the best at using at this targeting technology but in 2016, and 2020. I look, I mean, I think that the broader conversation here is, of course, it comes down to the conversation about the power of Silicon Valley and big technology platforms. Look, well, many people, many Democrats here - and Republicans too in the moment after January 6, when there is panic here in the U.S. in 2021. They agreed with that decision that he should have been de- platform and silenced on Facebook and also on Twitter. But as time has gone on, people are saying, well, you know, is it really right that a platform should have that power? So look, interestingly, even the ACLU, the civil liberties group here in the U.S., who has taken many case and issue against Trump, and say that this was the right call because they believe that people should be able to hear from Trump and hold them accountable the good, the bad and the ugly.",
