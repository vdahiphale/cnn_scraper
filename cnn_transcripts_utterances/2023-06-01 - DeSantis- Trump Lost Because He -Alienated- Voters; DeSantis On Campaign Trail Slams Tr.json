And what we're seeing emerge is when he's on the stump, he's talking indirectly about former President Trump, he's never naming him, it's when he gets off the stump and talks to media that we get those more direct hits, that he's taking it at him. And that seems to be kind of the needle he's trying to thread right now. Because remember, a lot of these voters he's talking to may have potentially voted or most likely voted for former President Trump in the past, so he has to kind of walk a fine line here.And what we're also seeing is how he is pitching himself to voters. And that's really starting to come into focus. And what we're seeing the lane, they're really carving out for him and that he's carving out for himself is that of a sitting executive. He's not a former anything, he is a sitting governor in Florida, and when he talks to voters he's really going through and outlining what he and his team have referred to as the Florida blueprint. And he goes through and talks about all of his accomplishments, what he's done in Florida, how he believes that could apply to the entire country. And he really focuses on results. And again, one of those kinds of indirect swipes that we heard today, and it's a line that he repeats over and over is how he believes that running for president and being president isn't about entertainment, that it isn't about building a brand, and you can see who he's directing that ad, but it's about getting results. And really that is what he and his team are focused on pitching to voters is that he can get results. Now whether or not voters will respond to that, of course, that's the big test out here on the road. And he takes it to South Carolina tomorrow. Again, it'll be his first trip to that state as a presidential candidate. And Jake, telling us a lot, he ends the week right where he started back in Iowa. He'll be there with Senator Joni Ernst, and we do expect him to continue to hit the campaign trail pretty aggressively. He's done four stops, this will be his last stop of the night here in Manchester, Jake.",

A Sherpa found that climber 27,932 feet above sea level in an area called the death zone of Everest, where the air is too thin for humans to breathe and temperatures can dip to negative 86 degrees Fahrenheit. That's Sherpa abandon his ascent up the world's tallest mountain and carry the climber on his back to safety. CNN's Isa Soares has the details of this harrowing and extremely rare rescue.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At the ominously named death zone of Mount Everest, during one of the deadliest climbing seasons on record. Nepali guide Geljie Sherpa carried out a rare and almost impossible rescue mission. It was midnight when he saw a Malaysian climber clinging to a rope shivering in freezing temperatures just over 1,100 feet away from the 29,000 feet high summit. The air too thin for humans to breathe, and for helicopters to land. GELJIE SHERPA, EVEREST GUIDE (through translator): It was important for us to rescue him even from the summit. Money can be earned anytime. Left like that, he could have doubled. We have saved his life by quitting the summit. SOARES (voice-over): Geljie convinced his client to abandon this summit climb attempt, so they could say the Malaysian climber's life. Geljie wrapped the stress climber's sleeping mat and hold him down with another guides help. SHERPA (through translator): We had brought him down from Camp 4 carrying him on our backs because dragging was impossible. It took me five to six hours to get from 8,500 meters to 7,900 It was very difficult. SOARES (voice-over): From there, a helicopter lifted the climber down to basecamp. The favorable spring weather is gradually turning even more unpredictable due to climate change. Eleven people died on Everest in 2019, a climbing season that saw unprecedented traffic and long delays in the same death zone near the summit. This season, Nepal issued a record 478 climbing permits. So far, 12 people including an American have died. The highest number for eight years and another five are missing. The unidentified climber was put on a flight back to Malaysia last week. Thanks to Geljie. His name was kept off the list of the mountains victims. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And just to add some context to this, the death zone is the last and the most difficult as well as the highest part of the Everest is where the limits of human survivability are severely tested where oxygen levels are so low that they can actually affect the climber's judgment while speaking about the rescue. This hero Sherpa said that saving one life is more important than praying at the monastery. Jake?",

Our Politics Lead brings us back to Philadelphia where history will be made this fall in the city's mayoral election, either the first woman or the first Asian American will take the city's top job. Last week we interviewed Democratic nominee Cherelle Parker. Today, we're going to talk to the Republican nominee David Oh. David, thanks so much for joining us.And the obvious question, Philadelphia hasn't had a Republican mayor. I don't think since the 1950s. You're running in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans, seven to one. You've made your number one campaign issue crime, understandably, crime is out of control in Philly, your opponent, Cherelle Parker, told us on The Lead last week that public safety was also her number one priority. So how are you going to break through on this issue given that your Democratic opponent is also talking about it? DAVID OH (R), PHILADELPHIA MAYORAL CANDIDATE: Yes, I think it comes down to credibility. I mean, a year ago, she had a very different position. She signed the letter to defund the police. She voted against the police funding in two budgets. And she has changed that position, which is fine, except it just raises the question of whether it is credible or not. I mean, I think it is right to want to support law enforcement. I think it's important to answer the public's call for public safety. However, she also sponsored a referendum against stop and frisk, and recently said that she is for a constitutional type of stop and frisk, which I oppose, because there is no such thing. There is constitutional stop and frisk. It arises. But you cannot instruct the police to go out and manufacture those circumstances. Therefore, it is important that when we use police that the police do not break the law, they abide by the law and they protect the constitutional rights and civil rights of people.",
