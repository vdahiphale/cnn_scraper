Admittedly though, it does seem to be a rather short supply these days.We're going to hear from Kyiv, a message of defiance; from the Vatican, prayers for peace; and from Gaza, reports of an apparent attack that is overshadowing all the news this morning because at least 70 people were killed at the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza according to the Hamas-run ministry of health in Gaza. Several people have said to be wounded, and there are still many under the rubble. It follows an announcement from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israeli forces are intensifying their operations within the enclave. Netanyahu says ramping up an offensive against Hamas will, in his words, take time. But Israelis have determined to fight until the end. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Citizens of Israel, we are deepening the war in the Gaza Strip, we will continue to fight until the total victory over Hamas. The war has a price, a very heavy price in the lives of our heroic warriors, and we are doing everything to safeguard the lives of our warriors, but one thing we will not do, we will not stop until we achieve victory.

But this has really shaken many across the Gaza Strip. As you mention some 70 people are confirmed to have been killed in this latest strike according to health officials inside Gaza. That is the death toll that we know now but it is expected to rise health officials say, there are still people buried beneath the rubble. We've seen that dramatic video coming out of al-Maghazi refugee camp. Showing people and loved ones giving through the rubble in the cold winter at night, searching for their family members buried beneath the rubble.The Palestinian Red Crescent Society says the air strike, and struck a residential square, and residential buildings in the camp area that they had to transport. Dozens of wounded to the nearby Al-Aqsa Mosque, this hospital where again we have seen video emerging showing corpses lining the street outside of the hospital. This is a devastating attack, but it comes as you, mentioned as the Israeli ministry begins to double down on its military effort, both its air and land campaign. As we know, the Israeli military says it is targeting Hamas infrastructure, they have said that they are reviewing this particularly incident, but that death toll in Gaza continues to rise, there are real fears that as the ground operation continues, southwards the death toll will soar even further.",

These underground headquarters was used for directing combat and movement of terrorists, according to the IDF, the tunnel was connected to a shaft, and then to the residence of a top Hamas commander.CNN has not been able to independently verify the details of the tunnels networks location. And the Israeli prime minister's wife is calling on Pope Francis to help secure the release of the remaining hostages still held in Gaza. In a letter to the pope, Sarah Netanyahu requested him to use his influence in her, words to demand the unconditional release of all of the hostages without delay.
