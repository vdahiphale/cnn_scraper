I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is 6:00 in the evening. Major changes are underway in Ukraine. The country's foreign minister, the latest top official to tender his resignation ahead of a government reshuffle there. This as one of the deadliest attacks of Russia's war killed over 50 people in Ukraine on Tuesday. A diplomatic source in this region tells me there will be no deal in the Gaza hostage ceasefire talks as long as the dispute around what is known as the Philadelphi corridor remains unresolved. This as pressure builds on Israel's prime minister to end the war now. And the clock is ticking. The U.S. presidential election just two months away. The hope for candidates are out in key states campaigning. And in one city, mysterious blue dots are popping up on people's lawns. Why? We'll get you there just ahead. (MUSIC PLAYING)",

Because one of the things that Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said and at various times over the past couple of weeks is that everything hinges on the United States and some of the other key allies. He mentioned Germany, you mentioned the United Kingdom and you mentioned France as well. Because they have so much diplomatic weight behind them but also because that's where the bulk of the weapons that Ukraine receives from the West come from. And that certainly is also part of that four-point plan as well. Number one of what he said is that obviously the Kursk incursion of the Ukrainians, that's a key part of that. They want to force the Russians to exchange some of the territory that the Ukrainians have taken in return for some of the territory that the Russians have taken from the Ukrainians. That is definitely part of what they're looking at. But one of the other things that the president of Ukraine has also made very clear is that the Ukrainians are going to need, as he put it, substantially more weapons than they have received so far. And also substantially more weapons that can strike at further distances than the ones that they currently have. One of the things that the Ukrainians have been bemoaning over the past couple of weeks is the fact that they are not allowed to strike large parts of Russian territory or deep into Russian territory with some of the longer distance weapons, the few longer distance weapons that they do have. They believe that those restrictions need to be lifted in order for them to really turn the tide on some of the battlefields. Right now, the situation that we're seeing, Becky, is that the Russians are still pushing very much so on the eastern front. But it seems as though the Ukrainians right now in a little bit of a better position to try and stabilize that front but certainly they're saying, as part of that four-point plan, they're going to need a lot more weapons. One of the other things they're also looking for is obviously diplomatic initiatives. And then also economic initiatives as well. Obviously to keep the Ukrainian economy afloat and to help it be strong in order for the state to survive in the long term -- Becky.",

Hamas has repeatedly said during the recent negotiation period that they were on board with the version before Israel added, at the last minute, these other conditions that, they say, weren't part of that plan that the president had articulated. The U.N. Security Council had essentially voted on. This really adds some real detail to it. And the prime minister is clearly making a priority out of the Philadelphi corridor. And one of the things that Benny Gantz, who was in the war cabinet until very recently, leading opposition politician, you heard him speaking there. He said the prime minister was actually offered an alternate technical military solution to having troops along that border. The prime minister said, the border, we need to have troops there but to stop Hamas getting weapons in tunnels underneath the border, that Benny Gantz, who was part of the war cabinet and a former defense minister here, said, that's just not the case. There are other solutions and the prime minister knows about it. So what does all of this add up to? Well, the protesters are saying just these same sorts of things. And what they're saying is, by coming out on the streets in big numbers, as they did at the weekend and continuing to come out, that helps create a better political environment for these for these opposition politicians to come out and speak. And this is exactly what's happening. Yair Lapid, Benny Gantz, there'll probably be others, we're hearing from them now in this -- at this moment, when there's this huge upswell. What does it mean for the prime minister? Well, as long as he's, as long as his cabinet stands by him and people like the defense minister, who've already spoken against him and voted against him and against the Philadelphi corridor idea, inside of -- inside of the cabinet, unless they can round up and pull away some members of the Knesset from the prime minister's government. Then the government under prime minister Netanyahu will just continue. That's where we're at (ph). What we may be seeing is the beginning of a groundswell toward that.

He said, \"This forever war will go on as long as this government is in power.\" Look, he's no fan of Benjamin Netanyahu, he wasn't before this war and he won't be going forward. But Washington has been very critical of Benjamin Netanyahu's behavior, suggesting he's not doing enough to bring about a deal.

The number of job openings, as you said, the lowest level since early 2021. It's consistent with a cooling jobs market, not a collapsing jobs market. That headline number is the most important one. The other two ratios that we look at, just to give you a sense, the hiring rate, how willing are workers or employers to hire workers at this stage, that is at a decade low. It's a softening labor market. The quit rate, the confidence of workers themselves to say, hey, I'm not working for you anymore, I'm going to go somewhere else and find a job, that actually ticked a little bit higher. It plateaued a couple of years ago. And we've stayed at these levels. Look, the bottom line is this is an important snapshot of where the labor market is, Becky, and the most important data we get is Friday. This was July data. We know it was weaker based on payrolls.

And we've seen that with prices or tax credits for families or indeed what we're expecting to hear today, which is support for startups. And this is something quite interesting. Tax deductions for startups, which currently are $5,000 that they can use in the first year that they spend, she's going to come out and give us a really splashy number and say, look we're going to give you tax deductions up to $50,000 and you can use them over a number of years. Even wait until the point where you're actually making profits. The hope is that they get 25 million applications for new businesses and startups over the course of her future administration. The record high, by the way, at 19 million now. I can give you some challenges to this. Ultimately, what a small business needs in the beginning is cash or credit, not necessarily a tax deduction. The early expenses that you have are payroll, for example, product equipment. How are you going to afford those? And the hope is that someday down the line, you're actually making profits that then you can shield with these tax deductions. I will say that anything that cuts red tape, allows better access, encourages startups to form is a great idea. Questionable, as always, on the execution on this one.

That means that people who were on the hook potentially to testify at a trial in the future against Donald Trump, they're no longer possible witnesses because that part of the case is on the cutting room floor.

So the government of Israel is not directly managing the occupied West Bank but rather the Israeli army. In recent months, a constitutional revolution was taken, was carried out and most administrative powers over the West Bank have been transferred from the military commander to a governor, civilian governor, that is answering to minister Smotrich. And so an elected Israeli, with a representative of the settlement far- right movement, is basically now has all the powers, all the administrative powers, all the public powers in the West Bank. He controls law enforcement, demolition of illegal construction. And we can see already the results. No enforcement on illegal, unpermitted settler construction and a full-blown  enforcement on Palestinians.
