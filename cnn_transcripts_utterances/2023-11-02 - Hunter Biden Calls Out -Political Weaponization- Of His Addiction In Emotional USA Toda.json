Hunter Biden in this split screen set against everything else that's going on in the world is fighting this battle for his reputation that part of the reason that he's not settled his case thus far is that he has his own set of interests. He doesn't want to be prosecuted if Donald Trump returns to power.He wants to be rehabilitated in the public's eyes. And he is being smeared. But there are other choices he could make along the way that would help his case disappear and his instinct is to really fight hard and fight back.",

At the same time, yes, there is recognition that this is sort of the newer strategy for Hunter Biden, and that is to go on the offensive.

This is from Quinnipiac, the Q poll as it's known. Joe Biden, 39 percent, Donald Trump, 36 percent, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 22 percent. Now let's just go a little deeper into independent voters. Joe Biden, 30 percent, Donald Trump, 31 percent, Kennedy, 36 percent. A third, a third, a third. Now let's do the caveat. And the caveat is that this early in the race, voters tend to say, I'm going to go with the independent because they're just annoyed at their choices from both parties.
