Russia's president is set to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un to visit, an apparent growing alliance alarming Western leaders. Also, wildfires out West. An entire town is evacuated due to a pair of fires that are now converging. And in Los Angeles County, thousands of acres already burned by wind-fueled fires. We're live near one of the blazes. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. Right now, President Biden is preparing to make a major announcement that would shield hundreds, hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants from deportation. The president will soon unveil sweeping executive action that allows some undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens to apply for permanent residency without having to leave the country. It would be the federal government's largest immigration relief program since DACA. That's the Obama era policy that protects undocumented immigrants who came to America as children from deportation and lets them work and stay in the United States. CNN's Arlette Saenz is joining us from the White House right now. Arlette, what more can you tell us about President Biden's new policy that's being announced?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, this is a sweeping relief plan for some undocumented immigrants that could have election-year impacts, as President Biden is trying to tackle one of the country's most politically vexing issues, border security and immigration.Now, this plan would tap into an existing authority known as parole in place. And what it would essentially do is it would allow undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens and their children to remain in the country as they seek permanent residence, removing the fear of deportation. The current system requires that you leave the country in order to start this process. Now, the people who would qualify for this would be undocumented immigrants who were married, who were living in the U.S. for 10 years as of yesterday, June 17, and married to a U.S. citizen. This would allow them to work legally in the U.S. And it's estimated that it could impact about 500,000 spouses and 50,000 children of U.S. citizens. Now, this is a move that the Biden campaign is trying to argue stands in stark contrast to the policy of former President Donald Trump. They said in a statement -- quote -- \"Families belong together. It's that simple. It's why President Biden's actions today are so important. And it's also a powerful, stark reminder of Donald Trump's legacy when it pertains to his family separation policy.\" Now, Biden's move today comes just a few weeks after he had implemented or rolled out a plan that really amounts to a major crackdown on crossings at the U.S. southern border. That was a move that drew some frustration from progressives and immigration advocates. So, part of what Biden's trying to do here is ease some of those concerns. This is also something that could potentially appeal to Latino voters in key states like Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia, all important battleground states heading into November's election.",

And so I kind of chuckle a little bit when I hear these Republicans complain, because they are voting oftentimes against the very bipartisan legislative fixes to our border and our immigration system that they rhetorically are for. So, right now, we have to do what's right and what's smart. And I think that's what the president is doing through these executive actions.",

I think that's a good step in the right direction. At the end of the day, Wolf, as you know, we need a legislative fix. And that's something that I'm glad that people like James Lankford, a Republican in the Senate, put forward. However, that measure got blocked repeatedly by Republicans and Donald Trump.

The stakes are high, the symbolism powerful. Observers say Putin and Kim's dangerous alliance is bigger than politics, a defiant message from two leaders determined to take down the U.S. (on camera):  And that is why the White House is saying it is deeply troubled by this deepening relationship between Russia and North Korea, the Kremlin saying that Kim and Putin are expected to sign a new strategic partnership agreement, replacing previous documents signed in 1961, 2000, 2001. And the power dynamic between the two leaders has changed so much over the last 24 years since Putin visited Pyongyang. Kim is no longer an accessory or an afterthought, like his father or his grandfather were to the Russian leaders. He is vital to Putin's strategic mission in Ukraine, and he knows it.

      "sentences": "Well, I think it's pretty big, from the perspective of both the Russians that see this as an opportunity to show that Vladimir Putin isn't isolated on the international stage and he has options, despite the fact that he's been -- his country has been sanctioned more than any other country, in fact, by the United States and by the West in general, and equally for the North Koreans.This is -- this is them showing as well that they have options beyond that negotiation that Will was talking about with the United States and its partners. I think that the real issue, though, is the fact that it's been 24 years since Vladimir Putin paid a visit to North Korea, and there's been a very good reason for that, which is that, up until now, North Korea hasn't really been a foreign policy priority for Russia. But it just shows you how crucial North Korea has become to Russia's conflict in Ukraine, as a supplier of weapons, even though the Kremlin denies taking delivery of North Korean weapons, but how crucial it's become as a partner in that fight in Ukraine. I mean, Russia expends something in the region of 10,000 artillery shells every day. And its own factories simply can't keep up at this stage with that kind of consumption. So it needs to look for artillery supplies and other weapons elsewhere. And North Korea is one of the few countries that not only has that ammunition, but is prepared to sell it to Moscow. And that's why it's suddenly surged in importance for Moscow -- Wolf.",

Meanwhile, there's other important news we're following right now here in Washington. A new whistle-blower has emerged in the U.S. Senate investigation of Boeing just hours before the CEO is due to testify up on Capitol Hill. Dave Calhoun is expected to apologize for a series of very alarming safety failures in Boeing aircraft, including the terrifying blowout of an emergency door on an Alaska Airlines flight only minutes after takeoff. In April, Boeing-employees-turned-whistle-blowers testified that the company often put profits ahead of safety. And, this morning, we learned a new whistle-blower claims Boeing may have installed questionable parts on planes and then hid that from regulators. This morning on CNN, the chair of today's committee says Boeing could potentially face very serious criminal charges. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT):  There's mounting evidence that Boeing should be prosecuted. And I'm going to withhold judgment until we finish this hearing and the investigation. The Justice Department is now doing its own inquiry. But I do think there's near-overwhelming evidence that prosecution is important to sending a message, a deterrent message, and also insisting on accountability. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Joining me now, William Cohen. He's the former defense secretary of the United States. He served under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Secretary, thanks so much for joining us. Last week, as you know, NATO approved a new plan that gives the NATO alliance more control over military aid going into Ukraine, a move officials say is due in part to the former -- to the possibility that former President Trump could potentially win the U.S. presidential election and curtail a lot of that aid. What do you make of all of this? WILLIAM COHEN, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  Well, I think the European allies are justifiably worried. You talked earlier about President Putin being in North Korea. I think it's time for the American people, the American Congress to wake up and smell the gunpowder. Putin is now doing business, certainly a strategic relationship with China. He now has a transactional relationship with North Korea. But step back and look. He's in Syria. He's also in the Middle East in terms of doing business with Iran, with Hezbollah, with the Houthis. They're in the African continent and Latin America. We have to put our emphasis on having allies. NATO is the most successful military political alliance in the history of the world. And you have a former president who wants to undo it. We have to shore up these alliances, both in Europe and also in Asia. And you now have a former president who wants to undermine that.

We don't want to see tens of thousands of innocent Palestinian civilians starving to death. This will be a mark on the conscience and the reputation of the Israelis that they will not be able to erase if they allow tens of thousands of people to starve to death. That is simply not what the Israelis represent to us and to the rest of the world.
