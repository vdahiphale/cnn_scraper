So that's what the Kremlin is saying.The U.S. assessment though is with low confidence. They don't -- they aren't sure that it was the Ukrainian special forces. They're still weighing other options, including Russian or Ukrainian nationals operating outside of state bureaucracies within Russia. That's something they're looking at. But this is still an incident that leaves a lot of questions unanswered and it's still problematic for both sides. It's embarrassing for Russia, on the one hand, still that these drones managed to hit the Kremlin. And for Ukraine, with all of these sort of suspicious incursions into Russian territory, it does raise questions, especially as it takes delivery of Western weapons that come with assurances from Ukraine that they won't be used to attack Russian territory -- Christine.",

Of the more than 300,000 fleeing to neighboring countries, 80,000 have gone to Chad.CNN's Larry Madowo has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The kids cry constantly. The adults look weary of war. The pained faces here are a reminder of the horrors that drove them out of Sudan. At this refugee camp across the border in Chad, sadness stalks almost everyone. As fighting intensified in Sudan's western Darfur region they had to run or risk getting killed. Koubra Abdullah left so suddenly that her son got lost in the chaos. KOUBRA ABDULLAH, SUDANESE REFUGEE IN CHAD (through translator):  My brother is still back there. I heard he was injured. I was forced to come to Chad to seek safety. MADOWO (on camera):  Would you go back to Sudan? ABDULLAH (through translator):  No, no. The only reason I will go back is to bring my child and my brother here. There has been too much insecurity for too long. MADOWO (voice-over):  Because of decades of conflict in Sudan, many of these refugees had already been internally displaced several times. Mastiura Ishakh is 22 but hasn't known a permanent home for most of her life. MASTIURA ISHAKH, SUDANESE REFUGEE IN CHAD (through translator):  I'm worried about all the people we left behind, especially my mother who could not cross the border. I keep asking myself how I can get her to Chad. MADOWO (on camera):  I noticed they're mostly women and children here. Where are the men from Sudan? ISHAKH (through translator):  The men told us to take the children and cross the border so they can stay behind to defend themselves and our property, if necessary. MADOWO (voice-over):  The U.N.'s refugee agency says close to 90 percent of new arrivals in Chad from Sudan are women and children. Many still traumatized but they will need a lot of support to heal. MADOWO (on camera):  We had expected to meet refugees as they arrived in the border town of Koufroun, right across from Sudan, but just before we arrived it was hit by a rocket. That is why refugees are being moved away from border towns to places like this in Gaga (PH). MADOWO (voice-over):  CNN traveled with the USAID administrator Samantha Power to eastern Chad. The U.S. is giving more than $100 million to support the over one million people displaced by the war across Sudan and in neighboring countries.",

PATRICE AHOUANSOU, DEPUTY REPRESENTATIVE, UNHCR-CHAD:  We need to collectively work with all the actors in support to the government of Chad to ensure that resources are mobilized to address the urgent needs of the -- of the refugees. MADOWO (voice-over):  These are the innocent victims of a deadly power struggle in Sudan. The poor and most vulnerable who have nowhere to go. Just another chapter in the life hardship.

Now they're four wins away from hoisting the Stanley Cup. And the engine behind it all has been Matthew Tkachuk, the breakout star of these playoffs. He did it again last night. The game was tied at three in the final seconds and Tkachuk rips the game-winning goal with just five seconds to go. This was his second goal of the game, ninth of the postseason, third game-winner in the series.
