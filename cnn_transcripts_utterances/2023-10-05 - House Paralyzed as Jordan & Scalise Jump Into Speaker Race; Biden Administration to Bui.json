So the president is really trying to make the point that this is still a priority. It is important. It is something that will be talked about with his national security team today, and that he will eventually be making a speech on. It is not expected this week, but it just underscores that this is still very important to the White House. We should also know that the president convened a call with allies this week to reassure them that the U.S. Still supports Ukraine in all of this.

Now, as it relates to, certainly, the gag order, it's not a technical violation, because the gag order related, of course, to the clerk. But it's just not to decorum. The interesting thing to me, Poppy and Phil, is whether this judge uses that in the case itself. What do I mean? The case is about the facts and the circumstances in that courtroom. But if you have a particular person in a case who's a defendant who's not really, you know, obeying judicial rules and orders -- technically, he did. Again, it's not the clerk. But what does this say about how you comport yourself on the business perspective and how, if you're not respecting judicial rules, you respect the rules relating to financial statements and other things.
