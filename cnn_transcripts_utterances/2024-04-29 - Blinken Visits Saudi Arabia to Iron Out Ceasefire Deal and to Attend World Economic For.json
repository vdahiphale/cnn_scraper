And then, of course, there's the Democratic convention coming in Chicago.

As everybody has learned, whether they're happy about it or sad about it, we have an election in a small number of swing states and they're the ones that determine the results.It is surprising, certainly to Democrats and I think certainly to the Biden White House, that it would be tied given the fact that one of the candidates is in a courtroom day after day and that he's facing a total of 88 felonies in four separate jurisdictions.

So there's a limit to what President Biden can do. But what he can do is make clear and do it much more publicly than he has been his opposition to some of the policies of the Israeli government, certainly in Gaza, and what he's doing on the humanitarian side to increase the relief that's going to those in Gaza who don't have enough to eat. That would help. It's not nearly enough. And people always expect too much of a president. They do not have magic wands. They can't end wars overnight. They can't tame inflation overnight.

It's really hard to put out of your mind. And people seem to believe that somehow taming inflation means going back to the earlier prices. That will never happen.

Because it's not just going to happen organically. I think at one time, some of us thought it might, but it isn't happening. So it's going to take an enormous amount of effort. Every day matters. And what's happening to Donald Trump matters, too. This is a choice. You're not simply electing somebody in a vacuum. It's not thumbs up or thumbs down on Biden. You're comparing Biden to Donald Trump, his behavior and also his record. Incredibly, people now think the Donald Trump presidency was successful when, in fact, it has been judged the worst American presidency in all of our history. The experts in the field think it was the worst. I happen to agree with them. So public perception of reality and the real reality, they're two very different things right now.

And in the Kharkiv region, very significant, because Ukraine has been able to really keep that front line up in the north pretty stable since that lightning counter-offensive in the autumn of 2022, where they took back large portions. Now, we see that Russia is pushing in the direction of Kupyansk. You see it there. It's managed to make some ground up in a village just 25 kilometers east of Kupyansk. So, things are moving there as well. So, Ukraine is under increasing pressure. Russia has the advantage in manpower. It also has a significant aerial advantage.

DTEK, which is the country's biggest private energy company, saying that four of its thermal power plants were severely damaged. This is a company which just a couple of weeks ago said that it had lost 80 percent of its power generating capacity. So, we see these aerial attacks step up.

But they had a tricky assignment on Sunday away at their bitter north London rivals Tottenham, and although Spurs played well, Arsenal got the goals.That's Pikaia Saka making it two-nil midway through the first half, and Arsenal were cruising when Kai Havertz made it three-nil in the 38th minute. This was a frustrating day for Spurs. They had more possession, they had chances, but nothing dropped until the 64th minute when Cristian Romero punished Arsenal's goalie for a dreadful mistake. And then, three minutes from time, Spurs really rattled their opponents with a penalty from Son Heung-min. Tottenham, though, unable to find another, so Arsenal held on for three crucial points. The Gunners must win every game and hope that Manchester City somehow slip up, otherwise it is City's title to lose. It's in their hands right now. They picked up another three points on Sunday with a two- nil win at Nottingham Forest. City's defender, Josco Guario, is having a wonderful month. That was his third goal in just five games, while Erling Haaland returned from injury, coming off the bench to make the points safe. That's his 21st Premier League goal of the season. Two- nil, the final score. So here's the table. Arsenal still top. The Gunners are a point ahead of Man City, but City have a game in hand. Arsenal have just three matches left to play. City have four. ERLING HAALAND, MANCHESTER CITY STRIKER: I think the most important thing is to not think, especially in these moments, about taking day by day.

CNN's Lynda Kinkade has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Waddling and gliding through the Antarctic, some of these penguins have seen better days. The world's largest penguin species, emperor penguins, are severely threatened by climate change. Scientists from the British Antarctic survey say tens of thousands of emperor penguin chicks may have died as the species battled to survive record low sea ice in 2023.",

      "sentences": "We know that they breed on sea ice. We know that sea ice is one of the first things affected as temperatures warm, ocean temperatures and air temperatures. And we're starting to see these losses in Antarctica now. Our models are quite dire.KINKADE (voice-over): Dire because these penguins also lay their eggs and raise their chicks on sea ice. But with the ice melting away, the chicks may fall into the sea before they get their waterproof feathers, leaving them to freeze to death or drown. Despite the recent losses, 2023 wasn't as bad as 2022 for the emperor penguins. Scientists say it's because some colonies adapted to the worsening conditions by moving south to find better ice or to more stable ice shelves or icebergs.",

If we can, we still have time to save the emperor penguin. But if we don't, then emperor penguins are going to be one of the first major animals that will be lost purely by the warming planet.KINKADE (voice-over): Fretwell and his fellow scientists predict that 99 percent of the emperor penguin population could be gone by the end of the century. A tragic loss for a majestic bird. Lynda Kinkade, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
