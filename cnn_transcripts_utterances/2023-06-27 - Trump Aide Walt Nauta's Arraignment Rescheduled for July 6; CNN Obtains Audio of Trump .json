It had been scheduled to take part today at 9Nauta is facing several charges, including conspiracy to obstruct justice and several counts of mishandling classified documents. The case, of course, is connected to former President Donald Trump's handling of classified material. Nauta is charged alongside Trump, and the Justice Department says it has surveillance video of Nauta moving boxes with those classified documents around Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. All of this comes as CNN has obtained exclusive new audio of the former president discussing some of those very documents. We'll have much more on that in just a moment. But we begin with CNN's Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz, who is outside that Miami court. Katelyn, you were there for when both of -- Donald Trump was arraigned. We were expecting this morning for Walt Nauta to be arraigned, but that did not happen. Does that come as a surprise?",

It's a twist that makes it a full month following the indictment of Donald Trump and Walt Nauta, where Walt Nauta will not yet be entering his initial pleading of not guilty. That's because he couldn't get a flight to get him into Miami in time.His attorney told the judge this morning that Walt Nauta wasn't there because he spent eight hours on the airport tarmac and then wasn't able to get a flight in this morning to make it in time for this arraignment so that he could enter that plea. And so what the judge did is he said, well, we're going to have another hearing on July 6, so next Thursday, that's when his arraignment is set. Nauta actually is not going to have to be here in person for that but there is still this delay for this because he also still doesn't have a lawyer in the state of Florida to help his lawyer, Stanley Woodward, the lawyer that's been representing him throughout this investigation, take on this case. He has to have a lawyer in Florida, and they didn't have one today either, just like they didn't have two weeks ago when Nauta first appeared next to Donald Trump for Donald Trump's own arraignment. So, a lot of hitches are coming up already putting this a full month out from the date of the indictment for Walt Nauta finally to start the beginning of this case formally by entering that plea.",

And, Kate, I also want to emphasize he knew he was being recorded.

Because we see in the polling there is an opening here. There is a real opening for a non-Trump candidate. It's not one we've seen any candidate exploit yet, but that opening does exist. I would just note, though, John, as you talk about how they talk about this, our most recent poll asked Republican and Republican leaners whether or not they wanted other candidates and the primary to talk about take a stand against what Trump did in this classified documents case, or do they want them to stay quiet on the matter, or do they just want to hear them rail against the Justice Department.

      "sentences": "Yes. The big takeaway here is that the Supreme Court is rejecting this broad independent state legislature theory. This is a theory that was pushed by backers of President Trump in the 2020 election to overturn the 2020 election results. So, the Supreme Court here rejecting that broad interpretation of this theory.So, to take you back, this was a dispute involving election maps in North Carolina. The North Carolina State Supreme Court several years ago stepped in rejecting the maps, and then challengers to that brought this all the way to the Supreme Court saying, look, per the Constitution, it's only the state legislature that really has say over all things elections, including the drawing of election and voting maps. The state court should have really no say. There's a clause in the Constitution that says that state legislatures should prescribe the time, manner and place of elections. And Trump backers in particular interpreted that to mean that partisan state lawmakers had final say over elections. But the Supreme Court today rejecting that broad theory. This is a 6-3 decision written by the chief justice, John Roberts. The Supreme Court really wanted to weigh in on this before any future elections coming up in just about a year-and-a-half, because of the real chaos that adopting a theory like this or even letting this theory linger and not having any final say by the Supreme Court could potentially cause. There was some question as to whether the Supreme Court would actually issue a decision here, because after the Supreme Court heard this case, the North Carolina Supreme Court actually changed its makeup. It became majority Republican. They actually reheard this case. So, the question was, was the U.S. Supreme Court going to weigh in on this? And the fact is that, yes, they have weighted on this today, rejecting that independent state legislature theory in its broad sense, again, a theory that was backed by people who supported President Trump, former President Trump, and supported overthrowing the 2020 election. So, it remains in place, guys, that it's not just state legislatures who have a say in federal elections. State courts can also weigh in when some of these state legislatures are passing rules when it comes to elections, when they're doing voting maps. So, state legislatures that are partisan can still be checked by state courts. That is the takeaway from today's ruling from the Supreme Court, guys.",

We want to have these separate branches of government, the judiciary included, and not going into one another's lanes.Remember, if we go back to the framers of the Constitution, there was an extraordinary amount of distrust for state legislative bodies because they wanted to ensure that they actually had a system of checks and balances going forward. But this if they had accepted the independence legislature theory, it would have meant that there was no real judicial recourse or remedy available to voters, available to the electorate in the immediate sense. Think about what happens on Election Day. I've monitored a number of elections in my work as a voting rights attorney for the Department of Justice. There is no quick response that can be done for those who feel as though they have been disenfranchised. You must be able to go to the courts, for example, on the day of the election and try to get some type of redress of your grievances. In other instances, you used to have a preclearance requirement or some way for the DOJ to act as more than a backstop, but actually proactive. But when it comes to federal elections, if they had viewed this as the courts having no role in providing either a reprieve, recourse or a remedy, it would have left voters in that chaotic state that Jessica mentioned and legislatures having come with wide rules now about what to do in place of it. So, when the Supreme Court took this case, they had recently talked about it or hinted around it as early as 2019, now finally deciding this issue at the core principle, think about where we are in terms of our elections. The courts are very keenly aware that every step they take with respect to voting will have a very quick impact on how elections are structured going forward. We are 400-plus days away from a presidential election at this point in time, the primary season and beyond. They do not want to interfere with the otherwise normal governance of these different rules. But this would have really subverted all of that. It would have said there is no ability for a court to serve as a check and balance against things that otherwise you could go to the courts to address in a holistic way. In many respects, this is in line now with what the court has done now several times in the last few weeks, which is to focus on the ability of the districting maps, to serve as a bedrock for our democracy, to serve as an opportunity for people to have representation, to not have a state legislature or otherwise try to draw lines of a map in such a way that it undermines someone's ability to have that equal access to vote for a candidate of their choosing, not necessarily the winner, but opportunity to vote for a candidate of their choosing. With the independent state legislature theory, it would have essentially said, no matter how much these maps are drawn in a way that runs counter to the Constitution or maybe even the framers of our Constitution, which we know, spoiler alert, did not contemplate a fully equitable system, this would have run counter. This is a way of preserving a status quo that's helpful to navigating our elections.",

And if the outcome had been the opposite of this, it would have been cataclysmic. It would have changed everything about the way we vote. Because, look, the Constitution says it's up to state legislatures to determine time, place and manner of voting. It doesn't actually say courts.And so the argument, and this started as a sort of fringey law school academic theory a couple of decades ago, well, state legislatures means they can do whatever they want, courts can't do anything about it. If that had been the ruling here, it would have absolutely thrown us into chaos. And I think it's important to note this is now the second time in two weeks that we've seen at least two conservative justices, Chief Justice Roberts, and in both cases, Kavanaugh, and in this case joined by Amy Coney Barrett, come down in favor of preserving voting rights. So, maybe the court is not quite as partisan as we sometimes say, not on all issues.",
