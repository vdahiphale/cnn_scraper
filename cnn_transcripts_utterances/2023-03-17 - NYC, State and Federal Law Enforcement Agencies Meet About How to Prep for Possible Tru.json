I'm Laura Coates, and this is CNN Tonight.And, listen, we could just be days away from learning whether Donald Trump, a former president of the United States, will face criminal charges over the payment of hush money to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Now, let's be clear, this is far from a done deal. Until you actually see the indictment, the charges, a lot can happen between now and even the potential for that happening. But sources are telling CNN that New York City, state, and federal law enforcement agencies have been meeting all week long to prepare for the possibility of an indictment. And it will be a stunning surrender of a former president of this country. With all that would entail, we're talking about fingerprinting, mug shots, an arraignment, a perp walk of a former president of the United States. One of his own attorneys, Joe Tacopina, telling the New York Daily News that if Trump is indicted, he won't refuse to surrender, quote, there won't be a standoff at Mar-a-Lago, unquote. We've got a lot more on this in just a moment. Plus, the story of a wrongly convicted man sentenced to -- this number is shocking -- 400 years behind bars. Now, after 34 years in prison, he's been exonerated and finally able to walk free. That's him hugging his mother. Sidney Holmes says he never lost hope and he's here with us tonight. And one Ohio school district is switching to a four-day week. Kids may think it's great news but is it great news for their parents? I'll talk to the superintendent who came up with that very plan. I said a lot to talk about tonight. And here with me now, CNN law enforcement expert John Miller, also John Hart, who is a communications director for Senator Tom Coburn, Democratic Strategist Maria Cardona, National Security Attorney Bradley Moss, and Tia Mitchell of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. I'm glad you're all here. We've got really a full house. Let me begin with the reporting from you, John Miller, over there, because look, this is pretty significant, the idea of the coordination, the choreography, of trying to figure out what to do with an otherwise routine set of events, right, the idea of arraignment or someone turning themselves in. But you add to this, it's former POTUS. Tell me what's going on.",

But nobody has ever done that with a former president of the United States before. And they're talking about will there be a throng of media? Sure there will be. Will there be demonstrators? That's possible. Will there be counterdemonstrators? That's why they've been sitting around figuring out. We need contingency on contingency on contingency.",

The superintendent there is working to fix a problem that the districts are seeing across this nation. It's called teacher burnout. And under the new policy, students will go to school Tuesday through Friday, giving their teachers a day to prepare for the week ahead.Joining me now is the superintendent of the school district in North College Hill, Ohio, Eugene Blalock. I'm glad you're here and thank you, Eugene, for joining us today. I've got to tell you, my kids would be thrilled but me as mommy thinking about my traditional five-day a week work week, I wonder about the motivation. The idea of burnout obviously a significant driving force. What is your goal? EUGENE BLALOCK JR., SUPERINTENDENT, NORTH COLLEGE HILL CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT: Okay. Well, first of all, thank you for having me, Ms. Coates. For us, it has to do with student achievement. What we start seeing is our teachers are struggling, first and foremost, because of high absenteeism and we can't find subs. So, it's tough. We're a small district. We're about 1,400 students. And it's tough to find subs for our teachers. And what we're finding is our teachers -- well, what we were finding was our teachers were losing their plan bail because they had internal. Unlike a lot of people say, well, you can just keep going, no. We have a situation where we have students and we have to have adults to cover those classes. So, teachers give up their plan bail and they don't get a plan bail and it's almost like somebody equated it to being on like a hamster wheel. You never get a chance to get off that hamster wheel, and it's a constant go, go, go. And our teachers, we realize, were truly struggling with teacher burnout. I mean, you could see it in their eyes. And we believe that a five-day schedule, a five-day teacher schedule, will allow our teachers the opportunity to properly and adequately plan for our students.",

When we started this conversation, we looked at barriers. The two barriers that jump out at us was, number one, food, and number two, child care. So, let me say, the pandemic taught us at least one thing, that we can do things differently. And one of those things was, as far as supporting our families with meals. So, students will have the opportunity to come up to the building to pick up meals or we'll be sending those meals home. We're working that out with our food service provider.Now, as far as family support, that was another biggie. For us, we are going to provide limited support for K-8 students and our most vulnerable students. So, when I said that everyone will be working, so, although our certified teachers, they will be planning. Our payer professionals, our educational aides, some of the most important individuals that we have in our building who work closely with the students and the teachers every day, they will be here to help supervise and support those families and those students when they come in. Another thing, this is not like remote learning, per se. What we're going to do -- we're not asking parents to provide any direct instruction. That day when students are at home -- so, on that Monday when students are at home, that will be what we call a spiral review. That will be opportunity for students to practice, and it also will be an opportunity for students to demonstrate to their teachers exactly what they know. Another thing that's beautiful -- that I love about my community, North College Hill, is that, you know, we're a small, close-knit community, family-oriented. And we've already had child care providers reach out to us and say, hey, what can we do to help? What can we do to support families and the students? And they're sending information out -- last week when it was approved and I sent out my information, they were right behind me sending things out to parents saying, hey, we're here for you.

That's nearly as many as the last three fiscal years combined.Although the numbers are, of course much, much smaller than the ones you see on the southern border, federal authorities have moved an additional 25 agents to the area. And the region's top border patrol agent is warning that traveling there on foot in winter poses significant risks to the lives of already vulnerable people making the journey.

And I think what this shows is that in addition to making it to the southern border, they are now making -- doing everything they can to try to get in from the northern border. That, to me, screams desperation, because that is what makes somebody leave the comfort of their own home because they are being either threatened, their family is being threatened, or they can't make a living, right?And as an immigrant, I understand this personally, right? And so, to me, what we need to focus on is this has to be taken out of the political arena and Democrats and Republicans have got to fix this. There's got to be a bipartisan fix. You cannot have a knee-jerk reaction, which is what's happening. Republicans always say, border enforcement first, border enforcement first. That does not make any sense. You have to have tough border enforcement. At the same time, you have to consider legal flows of migrants because until we figure out how to accommodate that -- and we need workers now, we have a huge labor shortage, this is never going to be fixed. ELAHE IZADI, MEDIA REPORTER, WASHINGTON POST: Yeah, the other backdrop to this is also the stricter border measures that are taking place at the southern border implemented by the Biden administration ahead of May when some of these pandemic era immigration restrictions are going to be lifted. And if you look at the past couple of months, the southern border, the migrant crossings have greatly dropped. Which I know the administration is pointing to as evidence that their approach is working. But as we're saying, the northern border is a much smaller number, but there is an increase, which, again, speaks to this idea that people are desperate, and they are trying to find any means necessary. And at the same time, we have an administration that is moving more to the center after it campaigned on having a more humanitarian approach to immigration. And there are a lot of critics on the left, who are now saying this policy on the southern border, this mimic and mirrors the Trump administration's approach to immigration.",

So, I do think you've -- in order to get to the -- to solve the labor problem we have, which is real, you do have to have a much more systematic border security system where you either bring the people in who want to get here legally, but don't allow a chaotic situation on either the southern or northern border.
