Now, Ukraine enters a second year of battling its way to freedom in that war. And this time -- this time lapse I should say, just shows how successful Ukraine's military has been this past year, the Russian troops marked in red mostly contained to Ukraine's east and southeast since last summer. Today, that fighting in the east is intensifying and Ukraine's military is calling for more Western aid including fighter jets. President Biden for now appears to be turning down the request from Ukraine's President for F-16s. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Russians are crushing them, just assaulting them long range with cruise missiles, with other types of artilleries, long range, even from Russian territory, even from the Black Sea, and I think they are on their heels trying to hold.

WATSON (on camera): We're getting a closer look at a Chinese fighter jet. The aircrew here identifies it as a J-11, a two-seater that they say is armed with air-to-air missiles, and it has been shadowing this US Navy playing now for about 15 minutes.

The Indians also are doing business with the Russians. All of the countries and our friends in the Middle East are doing business with the Russian. Everybody has a say, because if this really does spin out of control, if we continue this war for one more year, two more years, three more years, that has the potential to spread this conflict well beyond Ukraine, and they all have a stake in this.

So not only do you have the two from calls are where he was when he was making those calls, if you actually look at the direct phone, you can see the files that are stored in those phones. So there's two things here, there's the phone records, which we really tried hard to get into January 6 or I wanted to have them in the January 6 Committee. There's also the cell phone itself. And there's just so much data out there. And if you think just with our call records alone, we have - almost had 30 million lines of data. So this is a huge sprawling type of thing and it's a real technical challenge for individuals to get all this data. And it's not a surprise to me either. Jim, you know this. I saw the Meadows' text messages and Scott was pretty active on those text messages and kept asking Meadows to go to Signal an encrypted app. So again, this doesn't surprise me in any way that there - this data could be on the phone, but also, that's a little bit different from the call detail records themselves.",

My God, I was in military intelligence for 20 years, so that's the danger.And here's the thing, the reason he's given it to Tucker first is they have a head start to set the narrative. I mean, let's just be honest. I mean, it's as simple as that. It's a political decision, it's not really a decision for the American people. And when you take an oath like I did as a congressman and a military member, I just think it's appalling that you identify one individual to send that type of video tape or footage to when you have other news organizations that should have that same opportunity if you're going to do something that's stupid anyway, right, to send that kind of video footage. It's just appalling. For somebody who sat on the committee, it's very bothersome and I think - and it's just - it's completely unserious and irresponsible. And I think you're going to see - what do you think Tucker's people are going to do with it? I mean, they can send any conspiracy theory they want. They can create any story or fantasy they want out of that. And they can get ahead of the other news organizations and try to set a narrative and I think that's for the 2024 election.",

She and her family have - put up billboards across the Atlanta area in the hopes that a donor can be found. And we're spreading these billboards all over the world right now by showing them right here on CNN. Isabella, tell us about how you're doing and how did this come up?

And then to find out that she could be on a waiting list for eight years. It was unbearable to think that she would have to go through this for eight years waiting for a donor.
