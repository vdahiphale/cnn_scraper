The managing director of the World Economic Forum tells us millions of positions couldn't be made obsolete. Live from London, it is Monday, May the first. I am Isa Soares, in for Richard Quest and I too, mean business. Good evening, everyone. Welcome to the show. Jamie Dimon says the current banking crisis is over as he assumes control over what remains of First Republic Bank. JPMorgan announced Monday morning, it will buy most of the trouble lender. The bank had been unsteady since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, if you remember back in March. Dimon said he believes the banking system is now on a stable footing. He warned in a call earlier the economy could face further issues down the road. This is what he said. Have a listen. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Isa, the fact that JPMorgan is coming to the rescue here is obviously great news. I mean, the nightmare scenario wasthat the FDIC was going to have to run this bank and bail out uninsured depositors at a cost to taxpayers and a cost to confidence. You know, the best case would be that a white knight would step in to kind of stop the bleeding, and that is what has happened here. In his statement this morning, JPMorgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, he said: \"Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did.\" So let me take you through some of the numbers here. JPMorgan is paying the FDIC $10.6 billion to buy most of First Republic. It is assuming $173 billion of this bank's loans. And this is really important. JPMorgan is acquiring all $92 billion of First Republic's deposits, including those uninsured deposits, those above the $250,000.00 limit that the FDIC normally insures. So that means if you have money at First Republic, your money is safe. It's just changed hands to a new bank, JPMorgan. I think going forward, though, the question is whether or not we're going to see any more bank failures. Are we done? Or could there be more trouble along the way? And also, what does this mean for the real economy? Because we know that all of this credit stress is going to make bankers less willing to lend -- you know, mortgages and car loans and small business loans, and all of that has a real economic impact, it slows the economy down, and that's on top of the Federal Reserve's war on inflation, which is also slowing the economy down. So hopefully, Isa, we are through the worst of it, because the longer the banking crisis lasts, the greater the damage it's going to do to the economy.",

JPMorgan shares are up about two percent the last time I looked, while -- yes, just over two percent. It will gain exposure to First Republic's wealthy clientele. First Republic stock lost almost all of its value in fact, last week, after seeing customers have pulled out $100 billion in deposits. It is now the third bank to collapse in just two months. Many investors now wondering whether it will be the last. Well, that is indeed the question. Mohamed El-Erian is the president of the Queen's College of Cambridge University. He joins me now. Mohamed, you're just the person we need to wrap my head around this. First of all, you know, when the news broke today, when I saw it early this morning, many of us in my group were asking: Why are we here again? You know, 11 banks pumped -- what -- $30 billion into the bank last month. Your initial reaction to this? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, PRESIDENT, QUEEN'S COLLEGE OF CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY: So first, thank you for having me. We are here because of three things that have happened that catch vulnerable banks off site; one, a massive interest rate increase that has caused a mismatch in its balance sheet; two, lapses in Federal Reserve supervision and regulation; and third, deposits have become much more flighty, much more volatile. So when you bring these three things together, you can trigger a crisis at one of these regional banks that don't have the size or the diversity of the big bank.",

I mean, Jamie Dimon, as you heard there from Matt Egan in that call, basically thinks we're nearing the end, right? The banking system is sound. Is it, in your view? EL-ERIAN: So the banking system as a whole is sound, but not every bank is sound. Viewers should be reassured because every single failure has seen somebody guarantee all deposits. So we have established a practice now that's going to be very difficult to change of guaranteeing all deposits. That is good news for the depositors and I think that people should feel reassured with that. But we've made all sorts of changes to the system that weren't envisaged. We're making this as -- we are making it up as we go along. The big banks have become bigger. We have changed the deposit insurance system. We have also created more moral hazard in the system. So there is an issue of what happens next, and as your reporter rightly said, the one people that will suffer are those that went to those regional banks for loans, that they are going to find loans much harder to get and that is small and medium-sized enterprises.",

Look, they got a bank for one-twentieth of what that bank was worth at the beginning of the year, one-twentieth and they've gotten some good people.

EL-ERIAN: I would be very surprised if we do not see a hike. If we -- I expect that the Fed will hike by a quarter of a percentage point. Why? Because the latest inflation numbers are worrisome. Not only is inflation proving sticky, but inflation expectation, how people think inflation will evolve over the next year and longer term have gone up. So the Fed has got to hike, and also the Fed believes that it has different tools to deal with different issues. So it can deal with inflation using interest rate tools, and it can you deal with financial stability using other tools.

President Biden talking about the US-Philippinerelationship and saying that the US commitment to the Philippines' defense is ironclad. And in fact, the Philippines is the United States' oldest treaty defense ally in the Asia Pacific. So this is quite a complicated relationship, but it is a historic one. And of course, it is all about China. And you have seen President Biden try and ramp up US military cooperation with the Philippines over the last year or so. The Philippines has recently just granted the US military access to four additional bases in the country, and they have also just completed military exercises. And of course, the real advantage that the US sees in the Philippines is proximity. The Philippines, their northernmost island is only a hundred miles from Taiwan. So, as the US prepares for this eventual possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan, it wants its troops in position to help defend the island, and that is really where the President sees the advantage in this relationship. Of course, it's about more than just China. There's also this potential for the trade delegation, and I believe President Biden also announced that in the Oval Office just a few minutes ago that he would be sending this trade and economic delegation to the Philippines to try and boost that aspect of the relationship. But really President Biden is trying to sort of repair a relationship that had frayed over the last several years both under President Trump, but also under the former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who had looked for closer ties with China. President Marcos is signaling that he wants to develop a closer relationship with Washington. Now that name will be familiar to viewers. He is the son of the longtime dictator, Ferdinand Marcos, Sr., that relationship had been -- or that dictatorship had been backed by the United States. And in fact, in an interesting historical footnote, President Biden had opposed the Reagan administration all that many years ago when he was a senator, so that there is this interesting sort of bookending. Now President Biden very welcoming of Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. as he comes to the White House and really tries to bolster this relationship with Asia. This is sort of a longstanding weeks' long, months' long effort. You saw last week the South Korean president at the White House. President Biden will be headed to Japan and Australia in a couple of weeks sort of this you know, longstanding attempt to refocus American foreign policy to the Asia Pacific -- Isa.",

There was something about the timetable that he had announced, the very frontal way in which he insisted that it would be done that really got on the wrong side of the union to begin with, and they accused him of not organizing or allowing for any of the normal kind of debate.

It's surrounds all the theme parks. And basically, this is a government that was essentially handed to Disney, you know, about 60 years ago. And they were -- they were given this swamp land and they said basically do what you want here. And for most of its existence, the state and Disney have both benefited from this partnership. Disney has built one of the largest tourist destinations in the world. And that has brought a lot of tax dollars to Florida. But in this fight, DeSantis has gone after that special government and earlier this year moved to take over the board, put his own appointees in charge of it. That board then came in power to find out that Disney at the 11th hour had moved a lot of its power -- a lot of the board's power to the company. And they didn't like that.

Making a joke, saying that he's been treated the same way by President Biden since McCarthy, he says has also not yet been invited to the White House to meet with President Biden. But he did soften that just a little bit saying that he does expect the President to invite Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House in the near future. This was -- I should know, a bipartisan delegation, more than a dozen Democratic and Republican members of Congress coming to Israel to commemorate its 75th anniversary. And the tone was definitely one of a continuation of the Israeli-United States alliance. And it was bipartisan also from the Israeli side, although there's deep divisions in Israel right now on politics and on the direction of the country. Both the coalition and opposition members were in attendance and gave the speaker McCarthy a very welcome standing ovation. Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem.",

And you might not like wait what they found out.Their new report estimates A.I. will eliminate 14 million more jobs and it will generate -- they will create over the next five years. Globally, as you can see there on your screen, it says 83 million jobs will go while 69 million are created. Thanks to A.I. It comes as tech leaders including the man-dubbed, the grandfather of A.I. raise major concerns of the future of artificial intelligence. Saadia Zahidi is the managing director of the World Economic Forum. He joins me now from Geneva city. Saadia, great to have you on the show. So, creation has 69 million new jobs, but a net decrease of 14 million in the next five years. I mean, what industries from what -- from this report, what interest you see facing the biggest changes here having the most impact because of A.I.?",

And it's very clearthat the jury's out when it comes to artificial intelligence, about 50 percent of companies think that there will be growth and jobs and about a quarter of companies think there will be net decline in jobs. The growth of course, as expected, artificial intelligence specialists, machine learning specialists, people that are working with big data, those are going to be growing roles. When it comes to declining roles, it's really people that are at the lower skilled end of the workforce. So, people who are working in administrative and secretarial roles, bank tellers, people who are postal service workers, those are the ones who are most likely to be disrupted by artificial intelligence. But then there is also growth. There's expected to be more than four million new jobs in agriculture. More than three million new jobs in education. A number of jobs, at least a million that are going to be created because of the green transition. So, when we look at that complex mix of both technology and sustainability and supply chain changes, there's actually going to be nearly as much growth as disruption of jobs.",

In fact, there's been an increase in the roles that are required across all those sectors. Even increase in advanced manufacturing and in factory workforces. So, we're at a similar inflection point today. It can look very daunting to look at the types of skills that will be disrupted. And yet at the same time, it's clear that there is ample opportunity for people to be able to do more value-added work with artificial intelligence.",
