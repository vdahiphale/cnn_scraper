      "sentences": "We are fewer than 30 days out from the Iowa Republican caucuses. The rhetoric is ramping up and in some cases, getting uglier. During recent campaign stops in New Hampshire and Nevada, former President Donald Trump stoked fears about undocumented immigrants coming across the U.S.-Mexico border. Par for the course, since the day he rode down the escalator and declared himself a candidate for president back in 2015.But the themes and choices of his words this weekend are significant. The former president again repeating language that echoes white supremacists. Trump saying that illegal immigration is poisoning the blood of our country. And on Sunday, that migrants are invading from foreign prisons and mental institutions. Suffice to say, he offered no proof for any of that. Among others, former New Jersey governor and Trump GOP rival Chris Christie called Trump disgusting and his words dog whistling. The Biden campaign meantime responded to those poisoning comments saying that Donald Trump parroted Adolf Hitler. Now, is that a fair comparison? Let's dig deeper. About 15 years before he systematically murdered millions of people, Hitler put that phrase in Mein Kampf. Quote, Great civilizations died out as a result of contamination, of the blood, calling it a poison to the national bloodstream and infecting public life. Hitler was warning about German blood being, as he described it, poisoned by Jews. At his prior event in New Hampshire last month Trump also used the word vermin to describe his political rivals. Comments that were condemned by President Biden as well as language you heard in Nazi Germany. Now, is that an accurate claim? Hitler's Nazi party came to power partly by pounding the idea that the German government was being overrun by Marxists. Something that Trump has suggested now is happening in the United States for years. When he wrote about rooting out Marxists and Jews, Hitler wrote, quote, there was time enough at home at least to exterminate this vermin. The Trump campaign did respond to criticism over his speech this weekend, saying that Trump's speech was great. They previously shot down that vermin comparison this way. Those who try to make that ridiculous assertion are clearly snowflakes grasping for anything because they are suffering from Trump derangement syndrome. And they added this. Their sad, miserable existence will be crushed when President Trump returns to the White House. An interesting choice of words there, Brianna.",

      "sentences": "It's perhaps a combo of all three. So, you know, New Hampshire is the place where she's gaining ground. Iowa, she's not gaining any ground at all. But let's take a look at New Hampshire. Top choices for the GOP nominee. This was a CBS News YouGov poll that came out yesterday. You look at September. Trump was at 50 percent. Where is he now? He's at 44 percent. Look at the rise at Haley. She was at 11 percent in September. She's now up to 29 percent. I will note that is the best percentage for a non-Trump candidate anywhere. Iowa, New Hampshire, national, anywhere since June.You mentioned Christie. He actually rose a little bit. He's at 10 percent now. And I want you to keep an eye on Christie. Why is that? Because I want you to take a look back at our last UNH CNN poll. The second choice of Christie voters in the state of New Hampshire. They overwhelmingly say that their second choice is Nikki Haley at 53 percent. Just 11 percent say Trump. So, if Christie, for whatever reason, decided to get out of the race, that could be beneficial to Haley. And Haley, who's closed the gap to 15 points. Maybe she could close that gap a little bit more. Why is New Hampshire such a good state for Nikki Haley? Well, Iowa isn't and she's not doing anywhere near as well nationally. Well, one big reason why is take a look here. Moderate share of the GOP primary electorate. That is the group that Donald Trump does worse with and the group that Nikki Haley does best with. In New Hampshire, they make up 36 percent of the electorate nationally, just 27 percent. And in Iowa, way down at 17 percent. But I think Boris and Brianna, the question is, can Nikki Haley just win New Hampshire, even though she's in back in nationally? And at this point, looks like she's likely to lose Iowa. Well, let's look back at history. National GOP front runners who won in Iowa and lost New Hampshire. There were only two. It was Bob Dole in 96 and George W. Bush in 2000. And I will note both of these folks went on to win the nomination. So even if Trump loses in the state of New Hampshire, he's still got a pretty good portfolio going forward. Nikki Haley is going to have to blaze a new track for herself, if even if she does win New Hampshire in order to win the nomination, guys. KEILAR: Because when you look, Harry, at where she stands in Iowa, I mean, how does that normally work if you don't do well in Iowa, but you do well in New Hampshire? Is there a precedent for that?",

If Nikki Haley outperforms her polls in Iowa, that may actually be good enough. Think back to 1984 in the Democratic side. Gary Hart came in a distant second place in the state of Iowa, but he outperformed his polls. And Walter Mondale, even though he won the state of Iowa, they then went in New Hampshire and Gary Hart had all this momentum and he came back from an even larger deficit than Nikki Haley has at this point.So, there is a pathway forward to win in New Hampshire, even if you lose in Iowa by a lot. Gary Hart didn't win the Democratic nomination in 1984, but he came awfully close. That, I think, is the closest historical parallel that Haley wants to look forward to. If, in fact, she does want to win the nomination, she's just going to have to do a little bit better than Gary Hart did after New Hampshire.",

Now, if Nikki Haley were to come out of Iowa in the top two or three with a good showing, that does two things. It gives her momentum into New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. And it also is an opportunity to winnow the field.And that's what Iowa is about, winnowing the field. These other candidates that are polling in single digits or in the teens will realize, you know, maybe it's time for me to step aside and put my support behind someone who can actually pose a real threat to Donald Trump. And as we look at those numbers that we just saw, if the field were to consolidate, which the GOP does need to do behind a non-Trump candidate to win not only the primary, but in the general election, right after Iowa and as we get into New Hampshire is the time to start consolidating behind a strong candidate.",

I think Nikki Haley, I've said it before, and Democrats have given me hell about it, but I think Nikki Haley is one of the most talented politicians in the country. Just pure skill set, oratory, the ability to do retail politics, all of those things, she has it all. The problem with Nikki Haley, however, is that usually when the light shines brightest, when you have to stand for something, she's a bit adiaphorous (ph). She plays back and forth on her policy positions, and that's going to hurt her when the light shines bright if it is a Donald Trump, Nikki Haley race.I think Donald Trump is in it by himself, and I do think that even when they come to South Carolina, where she was a former two-term governor, although she quit in the middle of her second term, it's going to be really tough for her to win in South Carolina. The former president has the governor, has Lindsey Graham, has all of these individuals who are supporting him up and down. Andre Bauer, former lieutenant governor, congresspersons, everybody supporting him, and he actually came to the Carolina Clemson game and got a rousing ovation from the crowd. I mean, it was mixed with a few boos, but you can tell his popularity here. Nikki Haley can't command that.

And then, and the third, who was injured, retreated back into the building.And even after a ceasefire order, when the third Israeli hostage kind of staggered back out, he was shot and killed as well. So, all three dead, which of course really means here that there is mounting pressure on the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure the release of the around 120 remaining hostages who are currently being held. The Israelis who were taken on October 7th in that horrific Hamas terror attack that Israel has vowed retribution for but is now facing mounting international criticism and pressure for the skyrocketing death toll. Many civilians included in Gaza, the numbers inching closer and closer to 20,000. Israel trying to show and trying to make the point here on the ground that it is Hamas that is using civilians as shields. They even released video from inside a civilian home showing a child's bedroom and they lifted up the child's bed, a cot that a child was apparently sleeping on, the IDF says, showing a tunnel entrance, these tunnels that were used to stage attacks, to use as a command center for Hamas, used to smuggle in supplies from Egypt. Israel even releasing video of what they say is the largest Hamas tunnel in Gaza that they've discovered so far, more than two and a half miles long, wide enough to drive a very large vehicle inside, even construct a makeshift railroad. Israel now in the process of trying to hunt down this labyrinth of underground tunnels and destroy them, possibly using means like flooding them with water or other methods as the death toll above ground continues to escalate and to rise every single day.

Hagar, thank you so much for being with us today. So we see Secretary Lloyd Austin in Israel today. A few days ago, it was National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State Tony Blinken was there a few weeks prior. Do you think these meetings are actually moving the needle with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu?HAGAR CHEMALI, FORMER SPOKESWOMAN, U.S. MISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Well, you've definitely had a flurry of U.S. officials going there and becoming very, very public in their tougher message, for sure, as you're noting. But the thing is, while we know that the Israelis are somewhat receptive to this message and the U.S. officials are saying that and the Israeli officials are saying that as well, I believe that with Prime Minister Netanyahu at the helm, there's only going to be so much difference that you're going to see on the ground. And that's ultimately because their goal and that stated is to defeat Hamas completely. Hamas has said on a number, on a number of times that they will, they intend to pursue additional October 7th style attacks. And so, Israel believes very deeply that they need to neutralize that threat. They need to get rid of it. The United States is in agreement with that, that they need to release the hostages as well and prevent this from expanding into a global war. So, they're on the same page when it comes to the goals at hand. But when it comes to how to pursue them and to transition to lower intensity operations, as you said, that Secretary Austin has reinforced, I'm not, I'm seeing, they're saying publicly the Israelis that they're receptive to the message, but personally, I'm not seeing it completely in practice on the ground.
