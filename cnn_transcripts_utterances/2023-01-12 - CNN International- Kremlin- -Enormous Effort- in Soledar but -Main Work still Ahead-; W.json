In Ukraine, the Chief of the Russian General Staff, Valery Gerasimov will take charge of the campaign in Ukraine.He was a key figure in planning Russia's invasion. He replaces the current commander.

But the interesting thing is what happens to Sergey Surovikin, who is the outgoing Head of the operation in Ukraine. He is not being sacked; he is simply becoming one of the three deputies to Gerasimov.But you could argue that isn't that much of a demotion when the guy taking the job was your boss anyway, so that is interesting. I think it's worth looking at one line from the ministry of defense statement on this, they say the increase in the level of leadership, especially military operation is related to the amplified range of tasks. I think that's a roundabout way of talking about an expansion of the operation here and expansion of the wall. We've seen a lot of that kind of messaging coming out of Russia recently, Putin's appearance in front of a lot of Defense Ministry officials, lots of visits to military headquarters, talking about unlimited resources for the military. We know that Ukraine is very concerned about another offensive in the coming months as soon as maybe even before the spring starts. And I think bringing in the essentially the equivalent of the Joint Chiefs, the Head of the Joint Chiefs, as the Commander of the operation in Ukraine. He commands all of the Russian Armed Forces. This speaks to that a potential expansion of the operation.",

Travel recovering from Wednesday's ground stoppage at U.S. airports the cause of the FAA system failure has been traced to a single corrupt file. That's right, just one file but the investigation is continuing.A source tells CNN after that fire was detected, authorities decided to reboot the pilots safety alert system. But it took longer than expected that led to some 10,000 delays, and 1300 cancellations. CNN aviation correspondent Pete Muntean joins us from Reagan National Airport outside Washington D.C.

Today really pales in comparison, we've only seen about 600 delays nationwide here in the U.S.It's important to note that this system also had a ripple effect internationally. Flights coming into and out of the U.S. were held on the ground because of this massive meltdown is a nationwide ground step. We have not seen that since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. And we now know what is so interesting here is that this all goes back to one damage database file according to the FAA. And we're hearing from multiple sources that this FAA computer was reset overnight on Wednesday. Ultimately, that did not work. They thought it would be during a time when air traffic was relatively low. And that is what led to this nationwide ground stop. Here's what's interesting about the file multiple sources are also telling us that they can't trace it to any one particular person. It's unclear if one person is even behind this also unclear if any one specific action led to this crash of this NOTAM system and notice is the air mission system. That is what pilots need the critical information, the add on information that they need. It's not already published by the FAA. This is the dynamic stuff changing all the time. They need it simply to take off. So this is so, so critical and the meltdown of that system led to this nationwide ground stop. The good news here is that we're over the hump. The all other good news here is that the FAA and the Department of Transportation really owns this issue. Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said yesterday that they're doing an internal investigation into exactly what went wrong here and trying to figure out the exact source of this computer system crash. The other big question here is why this happened in the first place and how this possibly happened in the first place because the FAA has been faced by critics who say that they are woefully underfunded that these systems are way outdated. And so now there will likely be Congressional investigations into this Senator Ted Cruz, who is the top ranking Republican on the Senate committee overseeing airlines and aviation says this is completely unacceptable. So we'll see as this unfolds, also, there's no permanent leader of the FAA right now. There's a nominee to lead that organization, that agency but nobody is still just yet an Acting Administrator right now a lot of things still to unfold here, Max.",

But the key differences are worth focusing on because they are material, they're fundamental to understanding the context here.So in the case of Donald Trump, you've got more than 325 documents, right over 60 top secret that he's being investigated for obstruction of justice, because the Department of Justice ultimately went to Mar- a-Lago, because there had been a resistance to handing over all the documents. In the case of President Biden, while it is absolutely inappropriate to have top secret documents in your private possession. When these were found by his lawyers cleaning out an old office, they immediately contacted the NARA, which is the national records Association, who then contacted the Justice Department. Now it is troubling for the White House for Americans that a second tranche of documents has been found and the White House needs to be radically transparent, and more so than they have been about what's occurred.

But again, that can't fly a fit; it's fundamentally at odds with the facts.Now on the surface for folks who do want to drive by the cycle, there are parallels obviously; a President who made a big deal about protecting top secret documents is found to have his own top secret documents. That's a fundamental problem that smacks of hypocrisy.
