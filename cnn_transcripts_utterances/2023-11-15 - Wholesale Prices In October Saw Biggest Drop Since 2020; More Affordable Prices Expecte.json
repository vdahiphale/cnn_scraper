The National Retail Federation is expecting that folks will be spending 3 percent to 4 percent more this year.However, that is a decline from what they were spending last year, up 5.4 percent in spending. So basically seeing folks continuing to pull back for holiday spending. Thanksgiving dinner, good news, less expensive this year, about $61 for a family of 10, looking at 12 classic items in your Thanksgiving meal. That's coming down from about $64 in 2022, last year, when we saw a record. You can thank cooling inflation for that. Food prices have come down a little bit. Still high but have come down a little bit. Also, you can thank turkeys for that. This year, the avian flu was a bit more under control, and farmers added about 2 percent to 3 percent more turkeys to their farm. So turkeys really helping to bring down our Thanksgiving meal costs. This year, I think everyone will agree that's good news.",

Obviously, we're keeping a very close eye on this meeting.And now we have Evan Osnos, who is a CNN contributor and staff writer at \"The New Yorker.\" He's the author of \"Joe Biden, The Life, the Run and What Matters Now.\" And Matthew Kroenig, the vice president and senior director of the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security. He's a former CIA and Pentagon official. He's the author of \"The Return of Great Power Rivalry, Democracy Versus Plutocracy from the Ancient World to the U.S. and China.\" All right. Appropriate heavy hitters here to discuss this big meeting. Look, these things, they're not coin flips, right? These are pretty much orchestrated, choreographed down to a tee. So what will make this a success, Matthew? MATTHEW KROENIG, VP &amp; SR. DIRECTOR, ATLANTIC COUNCIL'S SCOWCROFT CENTER FOR STRATEGY &amp; SECURITY: Well, I think just the fact they're talking is a success. This is the first time they've talked in some time. I think it's also important to put it in a bigger context. The United States and China are in a situation that some have referred to as a new Cold War. The reason for the tense relations is not because the two sides haven't met, but because China is threatening its neighbors, systematically stealing intelligent property from the United States, and committing what many are calling a genocide in Xinjiang. So I think it's good that they're talking but I think we also have to be realistic. This one meeting will not suddenly turn the relationship around.",

You're not hearing as much of that from the administration these days.Because, frankly, they've lowered the bar of expectations. They're saying, look -- yesterday, President Biden said what we want to get out of this is that they will pick up the phone when we call. That's not abstract. They actually really have had trouble establishing permanent and reliable channels of communication. Partly because senior Chinese officials have disappeared in the last year, the foreign minister, the defense minister. This is about saying, look, we've had a lot of trouble in the last 12 months. Let's set a new clock running and start talking about the issues for the next year.",

I think this is an opportunity at a really tense time, as Matt described it, all of these larger issues.This is an issue that Americans can understand, get their minds around. There are precursor chemicals that are produced in China. It's, in fact, illegal to be used there. But they ship them to Mexico and then they can be processed and turned back into drugs and brought into the United States. If they can do something on that, that sets a baseline expectation. And this is the key. It establishes the idea that it's possible for these two countries, at the same time that they're competing, fighting fiercely on a number of issues, that they can still come together on things that matter. Evan, you had mentioned, hey, we just want them to pick up the phone when we call, right? These are two superpowers. I wonder, as you look back, you know, since the military communication was cut off by China after the visit to Taiwan by Nancy Pelosi, what the consequences of that are? And do you expect that the military communications will be restored after this meeting, Matthew?",

The United States would like to have the military channels. I think many of us, it seems obvious that we want to be able operate in the region without accidents. I think China sees it differently. They don't want the U.S. operating militarily in the Indo-Pacific safely. So I think China benefits by not having this communication channel. They would like the U.S. military to just go home. Another point that I would make, in terms of these possible agreements over Fentanyl, we have to remember that Trump and Xi made an agreement over Fentanyl several years ago. China didn't really follow through. Xi promised Obama in the Rose Garden that they wouldn't militarize islands in the South China Sea, and then they went ahead and just did that. So I feel like I'm being a pessimist here but, even if they make some agreements, I think there are questions about will China really follow through.",

We knew that the FBI was going to take a look again at some people they knew were supportive of Hamas in the United States, a lot of them associated with financing of the group, and to see whether they need to, you know, be concerned about potential attacks here.
