It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, 6 p.m. in Israel and Gaza, and we begin our coverage there. We are just hours away from a four-day truce in the Israel-Hamas war after the two sides agreed to a breakthrough deal to release at least 50 hostages currently held in Gaza. In exchange, 150 Palestinian women and teenagers will be freed from Israeli jails. The IDF says it will continue to target Hamas infrastructure right up until the truce begins. Families of the hostages remain understandably anxious as they wait for word on their loved ones. But, finally, they do have a reason to be hopeful. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, what we do know is that there are potentially three American citizens who could be in the mix ofthat initial 50 hostages who are released. As you know, Kasie, yesterday, we were talking a lot about Abigail Edan. This is the three-year-old toddler, the youngest known American hostage being held in Gaza. There is hope that she is going to be released in the mix of the first 50. But then, U.S. officials also confirmed that there are two adult women as well, who are American citizens. And Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer said on our air this morning that the strong expectation is that these three people, Abigail, and the two adult women would be among those 50 hostages that are first released. Of course, the Biden administration has been intensely focused on getting these hostages out. They have said all of them need to come out. But, understandably, they have been even more so focused on the Americans, the around 10 unaccounted for Americans believed to be in Gaza. So, there are still a lot of questions right now about the other seven or so that are unaccounted for. We don't know, for example, whether we might be talking about male adults. And so, they wouldn't end up meeting the criteria since the first group really is just women and children. But, what U.S. officials are saying is that they hope that the deal is designed in such a way to incentivize Hamas to continue releasing more hostages after that initial 50. So, if they're able to round up 10 more hostages, for example, then that would lead to another extension of a day in the pause and fighting. So, this is potentially a situation where that pause in fighting, this truce as we are calling it, could be extended beyond those four initial days. But, needless to say, the execution is just going to be so key. Officials have said even just getting the hostages out could be an activity that takes not just hours, but even days, not to mention just the medical support that they're going to need once they are actually physically out of Gaza. Obviously, a lot of just relief right now that a deal was finally struck after the weeks of negotiations. But, I think really until these hostages start to physically get out of Gaza, there is not going to be a sigh of relief that the deal was really done and executed to get these people actually out of Gaza.",

And so, Israel didn't havemuch faith that Hamas would release more hostages. So, they decided to go into Gaza on October 27. And then what followed was weeks of furious negotiating. Qatar was really at the center of all this because they're the only ones alongside Egypt who speak directly with Hamas. This was spearheaded from the U.S. standpoint in a large way by the CIA Director Bill Burns, who was conferring with his Israeli counterpart David Barnea, who, by the way, is back in Doha today. And of course the Egyptians and Hamas speaking -- Egyptians and the Israeli -- and Qatar speaking directly with Hamas. But, it was really only in recent days that Hamas was able to come up with 50 names, identifying who the -- this first group was, and they were actually able to get this deal across the finish line. And of course, it's extremely tenuous. It's extremely complex. There are many ways in which it could fall apart.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JON FINER, U.S. DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: What we will be looking at is whether there is a way to build on what is happening over the next several days to get more hostages out.

Israel is kind of leaving the door open to say, hey, if you keep giving us these hostages back, we will continue to give -- release more people. There seems to be some optimism. There seems to be a lot of political pressure on Netanyahu to kind of get this done. Do you get the sense -- I mean, what do you think Netanyahu does next?

And I think that's when we're talking about the men in there and the Israelisoldiers and the questions of how many they have. That is the biggest amount of leverage that really Hamas has in this situation. Netanyahu essentially has two competing forces that he is dealing with, immense pressure from the Israeli public to get all of the hostages out. And remember, there are some 236. So, even if these 50 come out, you're still going to have the vast majority who are inside. And then there is also the pressure to continue with his operation to dismantle Hamas and eradicate them. What Netanyahu has made clear and he said this last night before the cabinet meeting, is that when this pause is over, whether it's four days, five days, six days, whatever, they're going to go back to the fighting. They'll go back to the fighting, presumably the negotiating would continue. What we have seen from the U.S. side is growing discomfort with the way that Israel is prosecuting this war with the extraordinary number of deaths, more than 12,000 in Gaza now, and the extraordinary level of destruction. So, will the pressure from the U.S. side grow on Israel to slow down its military campaign, to make it more targeted, which is something that they've been doing in the past few weeks to reduce the number of airstrikes and do more sort of surgical counterterrorism operations on the ground? The last thing that I'm told will certain -- will continue, should continue, if all goes according to plan, is the aid coming into Gaza. One of the big demands by Hamas was that hundreds of aid trucks, 300 per day be allowed to come into Gaza. And what this deal says is, regardless of how long this pause lasts, that those 300 per day would continue, because that aid is so desperately needed.",

There is a domestic political clock in Israel about, we want revenge for October 7, but we also want our hostages back. There is the American political clock, which is increasing dissatisfaction at the White House and elsewhere, and include particularly in the Democratic Party about what's going on. There is the broader international Arab world and their kind of views about this. And all these clocks are running at different speed. And then there is finally the actual military clock, about how long it would take to actually do this operation, which really could be several months, given when we think about urban warfare, for instance, the fight against ISIS and Mosul, which took nine months.

What is significant, however, is that the deal is in place, and sometime after 10 a.m., after we see that pause in fighting, we expect to see the first Israeli hostages released, the first group of 10 or 12 or so, women and children who will leave Gaza for the first time after nearly seven weeks of fighting, and then will make their way back into Israel. That will be accompanied by whether it's at the exact same time, whether there is a short difference in time, again, that part not important. But, there will also be a subsequent release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, women and children. And this will play out over and over again over the course of four days until it becomes 50 Israeli hostages released for 150 Palestinian prisoners. Crucially, there is a chance for this to continue. Israel has made clear that for every 10 Israeli hostages released there would be another pause in fighting for a day, and a subsequent release of more Palestinian prisoners. Israel put out a full list of 300 women and children who could be released. So, clearly, setting up the possibility that this extends beyond the initial four days. Now, it is also worth noting that we see continued fighting in Gaza, Israeli airstrikes in northern Gaza. We have seen red alerts indicating rocket fire coming from Gaza. That doesn't mean the deal is off. It just means, Kasie, that the pause in fighting hasn't taken effect yet. We expect to see fighting pretty much up until that minute.

We're going to see a lot of money being spent in our state, because we are a true 50:50 state. And frankly, with our race, I think we've provided a good roadmap to do that. I'm one of only six Republican -- six Democrats who flipped a Republican seat in the last election, and we campaigned on women's rights. We campaigned against MAGA extremism, and we won by three points in a district that people didn't think we were going to be able to win. So, when you put that message out there, those are the things that North Carolina voters care about. And the Biden team, they're on the right side of these issues.",
