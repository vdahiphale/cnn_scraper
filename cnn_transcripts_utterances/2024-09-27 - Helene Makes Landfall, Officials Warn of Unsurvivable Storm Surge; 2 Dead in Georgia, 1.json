We'll get the occasional rain gust.But really, spared the worst from what Hurricane Helene offered just 50 miles to my East. And my heart breaks for the people who are going through what is undoubtedly the worst night of their life. This storm came in so -- so powerfully. It really took advantage of that abnormally warm ocean waters. And it's going to leave a path of destruction that is going to be tough to see once we get first light in the morning. You know, there's this extreme wind warning -- and new extreme warning has actually just been issued by the National Weather Service. And I want to read you this, because they've got it in bold and in -- and highlighted. They say this is an extremely dangerous and life- threatening situation. Places in Madison County, Northern Taylor County, take cover now. Treat these imminent extreme winds as if a tornado was approaching and a moot -- and a moot -- immediately move into a safe room of your house or your shelter. So, this is what people are dealing with if they chose not to evacuate. Here in Franklin County where I'm located, there was mandatory evacuations, but there were certainly people who decided to ride it out and will honestly say they got lucky. But that is just not the case for so many others who are now plunged into darkness. We're fortunate to have power here still. But as this storm makes its rampage Northward, I-75, I-10, these are the areas you do not want to be on the road. Chad was talking about it. These are some of the regions that have these extreme wind warnings. And think about the amount of truckers that drive up and down North and South and East and West over those areas, getting buffeted by 100- mile-per-hour hurricane-force Category 2 winds. That'll topple, jackknife 18-wheelers in a heartbeat. There's going to be trees down. There's going to be power down. We have already reached a million customers without power, and that number is going to continue to climb exponentially. And you know, as this storm interacts with an approaching front, that we have been discussing for the past couple of days, it is going to squeeze out all of the tropical moisture that it carried in from the Gulf of Mexico. And you guessed it. It's going to form and deposit that in the form of heavy rainfall. And that's ongoing. And I'm really worried about those mountainous regions up in the Southern Appalachians, Western North Carolina, Western portions of South Carolina, even portions of Georgia into the Piedmont. These areas are getting unprecedented and historic amounts of rain. This will cause life-threatening storm -- water levels. And there will certainly be swift-water rescues that are either ongoing now or will begin shortly overnight. Just at my house alone in Atlanta, we've had 8.5 inches of rain since yesterday. And the bulk of the rain still has not arrived yet. So, this just gives people an understanding of how much water will fall from the sky as this storm rings itself out across the Southeastern U.S. We talk about the storm surge threat here along the coast, the extreme winds, Laura, that are battering these coastlines. But this storm will be felt well inland. And, you know, I think it's pretty safe to say that this will be yet another billion-dollar plus U.S. weather disaster for the year of 2024.",

      "sentences": "Well, Laura, so many hours after the storm stayed to the West of us and continued on North. And we are still dealing with some rainfall at this hour.And we're dealing with a significant amount of flooding. We are in a neighborhood in the St. Petersburg area that really has seen some pretty significant storm surge. And one of the more interesting things in the last hour or so, we had a line of storms move through and some rain. And whereas the last time we joined you, the water was coming in from the bay, it's now coming from atop the hill. It seems like this water that's pushing down on an already saturated part of the neighborhood that we're in is contributing to yet more flooding in this particular part of the St. Petersburg area. As you can see behind me, or as much as you can, because there's not much power out here. It is just littered with debris. A lot of this, we believe, came from a pier that is a few feet from where we are that broke in half. And so, we believe some of this is some Styrofoam and as well as some concrete that was further up the road when we first got here earlier tonight. As some folks were talking about just a few minutes ago, the governor announced a death here in Florida in Ybor City. That's in the Tampa area. One person died. Apparently was driving their car when a sign fell on. And so that's at least one of the confirmed fatalities. And at least one injury that we know of that has taken place kind of in the Tampa Bay area. But again, right now as we head into the 12:30, 1 a.m. hour, we expect that a lot of this flooding is going to be here through at least 5 or 6 in the morning. That's at least what our team of meteorologists are telling us. And we're about to hit high tide right now. So, this is probably the most that the water is going to accumulate out here. There had been some concerns that, if we had more rainfall and some more storm surge, that things might get a little bit more dicey once we hit high tide. But we're about to hit that point right now. And then low tide will be in the morning. And then once we're -- there's daybreak out here, Laura, we'll get a sense of just how much damage there is across Pinellas County and, of course, what the recovery effort is going to look like once folks are able to leave their homes, if it is safe enough for them to do so -- Laura.",

We've got a lot of people that may not have evacuated, as you reported earlier, these coastal areas. There are going to be people that are cut off. Big issue is going to be getting roads open tomorrow. You can't really get the utility crews in there until they can get the debris off the roads. And that will start the process of getting power back up. FEMA has moved a lot of resources. And again, I think, you know, everybody's focused on Florida now. We're talking about Georgia. This is going to be a multi-state, multi-day event. So, for FEMA, they've been basically getting ready for different phases and resources that are going to be needed across this area.",

Can you put into context how dangerous that could be? FUGATE (via phone): Yes, I've kayaked this area. Everything from the Aucilla River down to Cedar Key. I know this area very well. It's flat, very shallow. That water has nowhere to go but up an in. And the -- you know, we talked about it as deadly. Well, the two major causes of deaths will be drowning and crush injuries: blunt trauma from cars and propane tanks and the walls of buildings crashing into people. And so, this not only is going to be very dangerous, it's going to be a very difficult operation to get back in there. Most of these roads are 20 to 30 miles that you have to drive down to get these communities, will be flooded and covered with debris. You're going to have a lot of hazardous materials that have -- everything from flooded gas tanks to propane tanks that have broken loose. So, it's going to be dangerous for the responders just to get down there, much less for the people that stayed.",

FUGATE (via phone): Yes. I mean, for most of the people that haven't been through this, you know, you're used to being able to call 911 and get help. And for most of this area, you're not going to be even get help. The rescue workers are staying in places that are safe. We've lost a lot of communications. In fact, the other than my phone, my only other way to get information is by radio. So, for a lot of these communities, they don't have information. Most of their communications are going to be down. So, it's going to be a huge operation to support that. And, again, make it easier for the responders. Stay inside, stay safe, so they can get to the people that need help immediately.",

We put a state of emergency in place, through -- through our mayor and chairman, put a state of emergency in place. We opened up a shelter. The shelter is open now. And we have some 125 people taking shelter tonight as taking into consideration the dangers and the effects of Helene coming through our community. So, that shelter is in place. And we were able to get people out of homes that they thought may not be as stable to withstand. We also made sandbags available for our residents, as well. We have experienced some -- some power outages. We've seen the rain begin to come in and kind of go out on us a few times. The wind has picked up a bit, like the mayor said. And were still looking at a window of time still ahead of us, with certainly not -- not out of harm's way. And we want to stay vigilant. And we want to encourage our citizens, just because it appears that the rain and wind that we were expecting at those very higher size, maybe close to Category 1 winds, perhaps that may or may not come our way. We're still watching it very closely. But we want our citizens to still take it serious. We want you to stay in. If you don't have to go outside, stay inside. We put a curfew in place this evening in Albany and Dougherty County from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. We did that for the protection of our citizens. So, we've taken a number of precautions to be ready. As I mentioned, we've had quite a bit of experience with this, but it still doesn't make it any less stressful. We continue to worry about our citizens, our residents, and trying to make sure that we assured that we provide them all the information we can so that they can be as safe as possible.",

We are seeing a couple of cars here on the road, might be media, driving around here, as well.The wind hasn't been a massive factor here in Tallahassee, but there are those moments when the wind comes in really strong. And then it dies down just a little bit. Where I'm standing, I have a really good vantage point in terms of power outages. I can still see some buildings in the vicinity here in the background with power on. But when I take a look at the county and the power outages that we're looking at here in Leon County, there's 130,000 customers, about, without power. And when you look at the population of Leon County, it's a little less than 300,000. So, putting that into perspective, it is a good amount of people here and homes without power. Now, we do know that there are about eight shelters throughout the county that are open to the public. About 1,700 people are currently staying in those shelters. About 200 pets also. But it really does paint a picture in terms of all the power outages currently now and the power restoration efforts that are going to take place starting tomorrow after it's safe for those crews to get out onto those roads. Now, I'm not seeing anything drastic in terms of trees or power lines down. So that might make the work a little bit easier. For those crews tomorrow, we know the city here in Tallahassee was very prepared. They even tripled their workforce to get on power restoration early -- Laura.",
