Mr. Trump's first lie was told, just seconds into the night, with his false familiar claim that the 2020 election was, quote, a \"Rigged\" election. And the falsehoods kept coming, fast and furious, about the January 6 insurrection, about the threat to Vice President Pence, about Pence's ability, to overturn the election, about COVID, about the economy and more. He called the Black law enforcement officer, a \"Thug.\" He said people, here in Washington, D.C., at Chinatown, don't speak English. He attacked Kaitlan, as a nasty woman, because she was trying to get him to answer a question. Perhaps most chillingly, the day after a nine-person jury, of his peers, in New York, found him liable, for sexual battery, defamation, and ordered him to pay, Writer, E. Jean Carroll, $5 million, he made fun of her account, of her sexual assault. And many in the audience laughed!",

The idea that he was going to show up, and say, \"You know, I've thought this through, and I really, I should have done a few things differently,\" that might have been good political advice, for a general election. That's not who he is. And that sort of -- that authentically, who is who Donald Trump is. But it does underscore one thing, and I don't use this term lightly. There are lots of professions, in which sort of being a sociopath, you get punished for. It's not a quality that is an advantage, in many settings.

But half the United States still like this guy, right? You heard John King say, he may be the next President of the United States, right? He may be the next President of the United States. So, I know there's this, you know, he's a terrible human being. He did all these -- said all these bad things. But a lot of Americans listened to what he said, and said, \"Well, yes, that's bad. But it's better than the current situation,\" or \"It's bad. But I can't take any more of this.\" The border, they're watching what's happening, on the border now, and they say, \"Well at least, when Trump was in, it was this,\" right? So, I hear what everyone's saying. It was, \"He did this.\" He's much better at -- President's much better -- I always say this, what he's talking about prospective things, or his record, rather than, talking about 2020, and the election, and that was stolen, or January 6, I think he's got a large record of accomplishments, he could have talked about, tonight, and ran on, which he didn't, and which, I was hoping to hear more of that. But everybody, who's watched it out, on this CNN network, who may be wringing their hands, and saying, \"This guy's terrible,\" they better get ready, because he may be the next President of the United States. I will say, he did make news, at least in my opinion, on the abortion front, because every other candidate that I've heard, they've said, \"I will vote, unceremoniously. I will support a total ban on abortion, at the federal level.\" And president -- and former President Trump refused to say that. He said, \"I will negotiate something that's best for the most amount of people.\" I mean, it seemed almost like he was going to try to go back to 15 weeks, or whatever it was, kind of under a lot of states, and not a six-weeks ban, like a lot of people asking for. So, I did think that he -- and listen, he was a lot of the things you're saying. But in certain things, like, on the gun part, you talk about Christian, he kind of struck almost, I don't want to say, conciliatory tone, but. And Van, on Russia, I think that the point that he made was, I don't think he's saying \"I'm going to turn over Ukraine.\" I think it's much more of a -- listen, I'm a military. I think what happened, the invasion, needs to be stopped. It was unfettered aggression, by Vladimir Putin. But, at a certain point, we got to figure out, like, what's the endgame here, for the world?
