We'll get a lot of the West was responsible for the war, perhaps a little bit of a history lesson that we've become used to hearing from Putin, essentially arguing that Ukraine was always supposed to be part of Russia.We will very likely, I think, hear him talking up the Russian military, the military industrial complex, the Russian economy and its resilience in the face of sanctions. He has, though, made news in the past. Last year, he did announce that Russia was withdrawing from the New START treaty, that nuclear disarmament treaty with the U.S. We could potentially look at some more nuclear rhetoric. He did himself fly a nuclear capable bomber in recent days. So that is clearly part of the sort of strongman pre-election image that he's looking to curate in terms of the elections. That is an important part of the context. Putin himself was quoted by state media recently as saying that he will be setting out his goals in the speech for the next six years. So barely a pretense, I think, that these are sort of real elections with a real opponent. But we may likely hear some sort of campaign of sorts, some sort of pre-election program. And of course, the context around the war is really important to consider because, of course, Putin has the wind in his sails. He's likely to bank recent victories like Avdiivka -- like Avdiivka used that to talk up their position. And obviously with the elections two weeks away, I think, you know, that is critical to consider here, especially given the death of Alexei Navalny and what we understand based on what the family is saying about the funeral preparations, to be a level of Kremlin and Russian state discomfort around the expressions of mourning and support that we've seen for Navalny.",

Trump issued a statement saying, quote: Legal scholars are extremely thankful for the Supreme Court's decision today to take up presidential immunity. Without presidential immunity, a president will not be able to properly function or make decisions in the best interests of the United States of America. Now, we're still waiting for the court's ruling in another separate case. Earlier this month, the court heard arguments in a case questioning whether Trump could be disqualified from running for a second term under the 14th Amendment's insurrection ban. In December, the Supreme Court rejected the special counsel's request to hear the immunity case then. And three weeks have passed since the D.C. appeals court dismissed Trump's immunity claims. Now, even if the Supreme Court ends up ruling that Trump doesn't have immunity, the calendar is shrinking and so is the likelihood of a verdict before November. Evan Perez, CNN, Washington.

And ever since October the 8th, the day after the Hamas terrorist attacks, Hezbollah has been firing rockets towards Israel. Israel has been retaliating with drone strikes, with missile strikes and the like. And you have also got the situation where some 80,000 people in Israel are now displaced. Many of the cities and kibbutzim communities in the northern part of Israel are like ghost towns. There's been a lot of thousands of people displaced in southern Lebanon as well. And what Israel has said from the prime minister, defense minister and downwards, they've been saying now for weeks, for months, that Hezbollah has to abide by the UN resolution from 2006, which brought the last conflict between these two parties to a close and move back the 18 miles north to the Litani River. And that if they don't do that, then Israel will make them do that. So now there are concerns that Israel is actually considering this ground operation, that it could happen by late spring or early summer. There is no firm decision just yet, and it could be more of a threat than an actual plan to enact such a threat. But there is concern that it could happen, not least because any war between Israel and Hezbollah, as we saw in 2006, could be far more devastating even than what we're seeing in Gaza for the simple reason that the arsenal that Hezbollah has to hand is that much greater and that much more powerful. So there are big concerns there. And just last night, we had the Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Galant, speaking with his counterpart, Lloyd Austin, in the U.S., saying the parties that they discussed this and Galant saying that about the attacks from Hezbollah, the state of Israel will not tolerate threats against its citizens and violations of its sovereignty and will take the measures required to ensure their security. And if right and as if right on cue, just in the last few minutes before I came on air to talk to you, sirens have been sounding in northern Israel ahead of expected.",
