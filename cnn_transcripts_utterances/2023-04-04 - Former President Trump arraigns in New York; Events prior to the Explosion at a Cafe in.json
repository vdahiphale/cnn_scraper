An aid to the former president tells CNN, Mr. Trump has been huddling with legal and campaign advisers at Trump Towers.

JOE TACOPINA, DONALD TRUMP'S DEFENSE LAWYER: The team will look at every potential issue that we will be able to challenge and we will challenge. And of course, I very much anticipated motion to dismiss coming because there's no law that fits this. REID (voice-over): But those legal challenges will have to wait for the charges to be unsealed, which may not be until Trump's arrangement. As Trump faces criminal charges for the first time, he just added another white collar attorney, Todd Blanche, to his defense team. He previously represented former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. A grand jury returned an indictment Thursday after years- long probe into a hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the days leading up to the 2016 election. CNN has learned the charges include more than 30 counts related to business fraud. Trump is expected to be fingerprinted just like any other defendant, but it's not clear if he will have a mugshot, according to sources, who say there are concerns about whether it could leak in violation of state law.",

The evidence I think is incontrovertible that it is strengthening him for the Republican nomination. Simultaneously, it may well be weakening him as a potential general election candidate, if he does win that nomination. I mean, Laila, this indictment resurfaces all of the issues that caused so many swing voters and independent voters to pull away from Trump over the course of his presidency, even if they like some of the policies that he was pursuing, the chaos, the vitriol, the unpredictability, the scandal. CNN poll out today, 60 percent of Americans say the indictment is justified and those are the favorable view of him have fallen to only 34 percent. It is, in some ways, the most difficult possible situations where the Republican skeptical of Trump, because this is both strengthening him in the near term against his Republican rivals but potentially weakening and if he does, in fact, win the nomination.

I mean, he is just not going to, I think, in any way, and perhaps maybe the most minimal way possible throughout comment on this because he does not want to give Trump any further ammunition to present this and a political frame. And, frankly, you know, I think there is a broad view among Democrats after the '22 election. Maybe this will be wishful thinking. But after the Trump-backed candidates performed so poorly in the states of the absolute tipping point of American elections, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Democrats generally believe that Trump is the easiest Republican for them to beat and in part because he's, you know, almost as old as Biden is. So there's also an incentive for Democrats to stay out of the way given the dynamic that we were just discussing that this may make it more likely that Trump wins the nomination while simultaneously weakening him if he, in fact, does become that nominee.",

The latest video shows an interaction between Vladen Tatarsky and a woman who would later be arrested by Russian authorities in connection with the blast. Take a look. (VIDEO PLAYING) CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The moment a massive blast ripped through a St. Petersburg cafe, wounding dozens and killing prominent Russian military blogger, Vladen Tatarsky. This video shows the run up to the blast as Tatarsky received a statuette authorities believed was laced with explosives, allegedly given to him by this woman, Daria Trepova, now in custody. In an interrogation video released by Russian investigators, they asked if she why she was detained. Trepova says for giving Tatarsky the statuette. It's not clear whether Trepova was being coerced to speak in the video, but Russian authorities released images showing a woman looking like Trepova entering the cafe before the blast. After giving the box with the statuette to the host, Tripova went to a different part of the room, a witness says. Investigators asked her where she got the statuette from which she declines to answer. The Kremlin called the killing an act of terror, and investigators say they believe Ukrainian Intelligence Agencies and the organization of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny were involved. Supporters of Navalny have denied that, while Ukraine has brushed off the allegations altogether. Vladen Tatarsky's real name was Maxim Fomin. Military bloggers like him have become extremely influential since Russia's full-on invasion of Ukraine. Tatarsky was a staunch supporter of the war but sometimes critical of Russia's military leadership, which he felt was not effective enough. [03:15:02] We will beat everyone, we will kill everyone, we will rob everyone who needs to be robbed. Everything will be the way we love, God is with us, he said inside the Kremlin after Russia annexed four Ukrainian regions last year. The St. Petersburg cafe that was blown up was once affiliated with the head of the Wagner private military company, the spearhead of Russia's efforts to take Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, even commemorating the bloggers' death. Behind me is the Bakhmut City administrative building, he says. This is a Russian flag. It says on the flag in good memory of Vladen Tatarski. But Russia's pro-war establishment fields it's under attack. Vladen Tatarsky was acquainted with hard line political scientist Daria Dugena (ph), who was assassinated in Moscow last year. The Kremlin, then also pointing its finger at Kyiv. This is a regime that has been behind killings for many years since 2014, the Kremlin spokesman said. This is why the special military operation is being carried out. (on-camera): And Daria Trepova has since been moved to Moscow, where she is in detention, and she has another preventive detention hearing that is going to take place on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Russian government has moved to award the Order of Courage of the Russian Federation to this military blogger for what they say is bravery in the line of his duty.

But at the same time, we are told that the Chinese government was able to remotely erase the data on that spy balloon, making it possible that the U.S. government will not ever know for sure what the Chinese government was able to glean from that balloon. In other words, the Chinese government may have been able to wipe all of the data on that device before the U.S. government was able to get its hands on it. So the U.S. government does have some idea here of what the Chinese were able to gather because they were able to determine that there were some pictures as well as some signs that there were some signals intelligence gathered by this balloon. But at this point, the U.S. is saying that they do not believe that any of this intelligence at the Chinese gathered anyway was more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to gather as they orbit above the country on a daily basis. Now, it remains unclear how much longer the FBI is going to be investigating this balloon. They have had it, of course, now for well over -- for about two months now.

We are learning that the lawyers for Trump planned to file a motion to have the judge recused from the case, to have the case moved out of New York City to argue that he can't get a fair trial.So, we know that Trump has been very critical of the judicial process, particularly when judges make decisions or rulings that are not in his favor. So, I expect that he will continue unless he decides to listen to counsel, but we should expect him to continue the kind of vitriol towards this judge and we know towards this district attorney.",

My colleague, Evan Perez and I have been able to nail down that some of the witnesses have provided information to a federal grand jury things like notes, texts, e-mail, photographs, all of the things that will allow the Justice Department to potentially button up a case and put it into its final stage as they wrap up an investigation into Donald Trump, his handling of classified records after the presidency and possible obstruction of justice. Another thing that's significant here is that we now know through Kaitlan Collins reporting here at CNN that Molly Michael, an assistant to Donald Trump, she turned over her notes to the grand jury investigation showing what Donald Trump was doing and also whom he was meeting with at Mar-a-Lago at key moments when the Justice Department is looking into the handling of records over the past year or so. We also know on top of that, that there are witnesses being forced into the grand jury now to tell a story for the second time, stories that they have already told to the FBI. So that is the sort of thing where the Justice Department is locking in testimony under oath at the grand jury. And I hear that the grand jury activity in the coming weeks is going to be at a pretty significant clip. All of this taken together. We don't know where this will lead and if Donald Trump will be charged or if others would be charged with a crime in this federal criminal investigation, but we do know that this is very serious legal jeopardy for the former president of the United States, even while he's facing this totally separate case in New York City for his indictment.
