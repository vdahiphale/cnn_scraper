Clearly, they're taking -- that's either taking place based on their own decisions or based on the level of fighting and where the Israelis plan on conducting operations, and they want to minimize, certainly, they want to minimize casualties on the Israeli side.But what we're really seeing is this conflict now has completely grown and what is going -- what we're going to see over the course of time will be an incursion into Gaza at different locations. Bear in mind, Gaza is about two plus million people. About 130 square miles, densely populated. And what Hamas does is they co-locate. They connect their command and control structure with the civilian population. So you buy a cup of coffee here in the booth next door, and you've got a command and control location. So targeting becomes very, very important. Obviously, Israel knows how to target very precisely. I just simply don't know how this escalates, whether there will be any type of restraint. Of course, there will be, but I don't know the extent of that restraint that the Israelis will apply as they go after these Hamas targets.",

Are they those who came across and laid low after yesterday morning? Or are there others still trying to get through the fence in other places where Israel isn't expecting it? I think this is why we're seeing so much drone activity to get that intense overview. At times, we've seen several drones operating in the same area. But absolutely, the concern is that Hamas is still trying to get across the border to either capture or kill Israeli citizens and try to create havoc, create more havoc and create that sense of vulnerability. Because that's what Hamas succeeded in doing yesterday. They created a sense of vulnerability in communities like this here. There are people in the houses here today who are literally hiding barricaded inside with Hamas outside trying to get in yesterday. That's a sense of vulnerability. A type of vulnerability people here haven't felt before. They've known about the missiles and rockets, the bomb shelters. Just literally, I can see the next one just down the street here. That all around people here know to run to those for shelter. What they've not been had any experience or real training for is what to do when Hamas is banging on your front door with a weapon.

But something like this, the scale of what we're seeing right now is not something we haven't really seen in about 50 years since the Yom Kippur War, where there's a threat, a physical threat of like enemy forces actually entering Israeli territory. And that's something which is new to us, you know, who passed a few generations.And we've -- all of our responders go through a lot of training, especially with mass casualty incident training, which we've conducted over the many years. But this is something that's definitely new. We've had a number of our first responders come under attack. Earlier today, one of our ambulances sustained fire while it was treating various injured people. Yesterday, one of our first responders, Rabbi in his -- in his everyday life in the city of Sderot, was trying to reach a police officer to try and save his life after the police officer had been injured. And he was shot. So there's really been no deterrence against the Hamas terrorists from taking aim at first responders as well. As a matter of fact, they seem to be doing it a little bit purposely. And we've got a number of first responders injured, unfortunately. That's something that's really horrific to see on any time, but specifically in this instance, even more so added with the tragedy and human tragedy that's taking place across the country.",

We've treated -- yesterday alone, we treated about a thousand people. Today, we've treated several hundred more. And it was so intense in such a small area that we actually ran out of medical supplies and had to resupply from the main logistics center. So currently, we're trying to resupply because we've used most of our reserve medical equipment. We're sent to the south, both for our teams. We've also been supplying the IDF to an extent from their medical units who were working hand-in-hand together with in staging areas as both civilians and military personnel are being brought out of the conflict regions. We're treating them and then medivacking them to hospitals for further care, either getting them out by ambulance or getting them out by helicopters. And the volunteers are working non- stop. People are doing 18 hour, 20 hour shifts in order to provide as much medical coverage as possible. We set up a medical clinic down. A number of medical clinics actually down in the Gaza periphery, which are treating both civilians and military personnel who are injured. And we've -- we're getting to the point where we're very quickly running out of supplies. So we have to restock continuously and that's been very, very taxing on the whole organization as a whole. Obviously, we're pulling equipment and bandages, gauze, tourniquets from other places in the country as needed. But we're going to need to resupply those as well because there's a whole home front that still needs our services.

The Prime Minister has made clear on many occasions that he will do whatever he has to do to prevent that regime from developing nuclear weapons. But Iran also is the supporter, as you said, of Hamas. I mentioned 93% of their military budget comes from Iran. They're a supporter of Hezbollah in the north. They're a supporter of Shia militias in Iraq. They're the supporter of the Houthis in Yemen.They have stirred the pot throughout this region, and they are doing their best to also, just like Hamas, to kill Jews. And to potentially scuttle a potential historic breakthrough in the Middle East. There are forces of peace, and there are forces of war. Hamas and Iran are forces of war. Israel and I hope Saudi Arabia and others will rally together and become forces of peace. And maybe after this horrific day, we can look forward to many days, not only right now, which will be difficult days of restoring security, restoring deterrence of achieving victory, but ultimately that victory hopefully will lead to peace.",

You know, one thing I do want to talk about this is we partner with Israel to make sure that they're protected from terrorist activities like this that Hamas is also sponsored by Iran. And we do that by having several defense systems put in, including David's Sling and then the Iron Dome. We know that there was over 5,000 rockets that were -- that were fired.
