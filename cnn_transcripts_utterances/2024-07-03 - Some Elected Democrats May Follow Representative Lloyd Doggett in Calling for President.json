And the Biden campaign is going to take a closer look at some of this. But John, you could feel things change throughout the day into the afternoon and evening hours yesterday. There is a sense that Biden advisers know, obviously, how serious this is. The president is the bigger question here. Of course, he wants what's best for the Democratic Party. The question is, is that still him? But yesterday, the conversation also began to increasingly focus on Vice President Kamala Harris. She, of course, has been a big defender of President Biden. She said the debate was not good but said his entire candidacy and presidency should not hinge on that one debate. But she also is speaking out forcefully about needing to take on Donald Trump. Yesterday on the campaign trail, she said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, (D) VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Joe Biden is our nominee.

You are now saying it is time for Joe Biden to step aside, and you are saying, and let Kamala Harris lead the ticket now. Since you spoke out yesterday, have you heard from the White House or the Biden campaign? TIM RYAN (D), FORMER OHIO CONGRESSMAN: No, I have not. But I've heard from a lot of worried Democrats around the country and in Congress that they were thankful that I said what I said because I think that the consternation, the angst that's out there is very deep and very real. What we saw on Thursday, you know, was a lot more than a bad performance. But what we worry about is how Donald Trump was able to completely shape the discussion around COVID, around the economy, around all of these issues without any pushback. And I just think Kamala Harris would thrive in a - in a debate with Donald Trump and prosecute the issue around choice. She would be, I think, very well received in the industrial Midwest with working-class voters. I've watched her campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire during the presidential a few years back, and she has the ability to connect. So, you know, I just say, what are waiting for? Let's get moving here and let's take the fight to Trump before, you know, before it's too late.",

And then you envision Donald Trump running roughshod the next four months, becoming president, a Republican Senate because we're - our down-ballot races are hurt. Donald Trump's going to appoint federal judges in all across the United States, U.S. attorneys all across the state, coming out of the Federalist Society. Like Democrats need to wake up and realize, you know, that we've got to act with conviction. We saw what we saw. We love him. This happens. People get older. It's the - he didn't do anything wrong. But we've got to move on and we've got to put a candidate that can prosecute. There's so much at stake for women, you know, let's have a Kamala Harris, former attorney general, prosecute that case against Donald Trump on the choice issue for women. Brag about the Inflation Reduction Act, the reindustrialization of the United States, our energy policy. Like she could do that and, you know, I would be excited, I think our base would be excited. You know, young people who - we're bleeding out now young people, that they're just so disengaged. I think the minority communities, we're soft support there.

That replacing - finding someone to replace Joe Biden carries serious risk with it as well, in terms of success in winning the White House. What do you say to that? The risk is more worth it.[08:10:00] RYAN: Yes, I mean, there's risks in everything you do in life and it's risky to, you know, say we're going to go to the convention. It's risky to say we're going, you know, put Kamala Harris in and unite behind the vice president. But I think the highest risk that we have, the highest risk is the status quo. And because of what we saw, and I just - what I get nervous about, just to reiterate it, Kate, watching Donald Trump reframe COVID, reframe the economy when he was president, reframe his tax policy without any pushback. And so, that to me is the highest risk that we have, is to let him speak how he spoke. And he's, obviously, you know, knows how to persuade people, lies like hell, but you know, he could be persuasive to do that without any pushback at the - at the level and the intensity, with the vigor that is needed scares the crap out of me.",

It's got to be a barnstorm. It's got to be townhalls in hostile environments, probably like Fox News and show us you can make the case. And real quick, I've been thinking a lot about the Cuban Missile Crisis with President Kennedy, 13 days, the top brass in the country, joint chiefs of staff bullying him, trying to push him around to go into World War III and he had the mental capabilities, the intestinal fortitude, the energy to be able to push back and prevent World War III. That's what happens, you know, for presidents. And people sitting on bar stools in Ohio or coffee shops, they didn't see someone who could do that on Thursday night. And it's sad and it's heartbreaking but there's too much at stake for any one personality, one person to prevent us from beating Donald Trump and having an elevated, aspirational message that I think someone like Kamala could give to hit the reset button. The double haters, I don't like - I don't want to vote for Biden. I don't want to vote for Trump.
