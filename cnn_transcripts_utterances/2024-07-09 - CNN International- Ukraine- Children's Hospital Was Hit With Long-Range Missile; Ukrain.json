      "sentences": "Yeah. First of all, I think you're absolutely right. It's remarkable to see how fast the rescue efforts started, and then the cleanup efforts have been going on as well.I'm actually right at the impact site where that missile hit that building, and I'm going to get out of your way real quick, Paula, we can pan up and you can see that large parts of that building has absolutely been annihilated by that missile hit. You can see that a lot of the debris over there. I was looking through it a little bit before. There is a lot of medical equipment that's actually still embedded and destroyed in that degree. So, a lot of that medical equipment right now is so important, of course, for this country, as this war is going on, also that has been lost as well, including two lives, and dozens of people who were wounded just at this site alone. Of course, we know that in Kyiv yesterday, as that massive missile attack took place, that 29 people at least were killed here in Ukraine's capital city. I was able to speak to a doctor just a couple of minutes ago, Paula, who was actually on the scene when the strike took place. She was in an adjacent building, and she described some of the chaos in the aftermath, and how immediately a lot of the hospital staff came out and started trying to help in any way that they could. And she said the most traumatizing thing for her was coming here, seeing that building, having a lot of colleagues who worked there, patients who were in there, and not knowing whether or not they had been able to bring themselves to safety. So, needless to say that for the Ukrainians, this is obviously not only a tragic event then, one that they're really angry about as well. The Russians, of course, have hinted that they believed that there might be some sort of Ukrainian interceptor that went astray and caused this. The Ukrainians are saying, absolutely not. They say unequivocally this was a Russian missile. They are calling this an attack on their medical system, an attack on the Ukrainian children as well, Paula.",

Given the state of his war effort right now, he needs to lobby for more weaponry and support. Fred, in your estimation, having been on the ground now pretty much since the conflict started, do you think this is his strongest position now to be able to demand the weaponry and the support crucially of getting all that he needs from those NATO allies?",

Appreciate it.Now, Russia's latest attacks on Ukraine and what can be done to stop them will be, of course, a major topic, as we were just discussing, as those leaders gather in Washington. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy obviously on hand for this NATO summit, and sources tell CNN, a draft of NATO's joint communique describes Ukraine's path to the alliance as \"irreversible\". Now, close attention will also be paid to you as President Joe Biden. He faces mounting pressure from inside his own party to drop out of that presidential race. This amid questions about what happens if Donald Trump returns to the White House. Trump has actively encouraged Russia to attack NATO allies, not meeting their defense spending guidelines, and U.S. policy toward Ukraine and the alliance could shift dramatically if he gets a second term. CNN's International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson is in London for us and observing all of this. A decade now, Nic, a decade since NATO has had to pivot to that defense of Europe, arguably when Russia took over Crimea, and now this war of aggression in Ukraine. How will NATO reset yet again, given the 75th anniversary?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I think one of the things that they'll try to do is present a really strong picture of unity, despite a few outliers, Viktor Orban of Hungary being the obvious one recently, but present that picture of unity, and by going back to the same venue that was used in 1949 to inaugurate and get NATO off the ground. They'll be trying to sort of conjure up the spirit, what's been achieved since then, but also focus on the challenges and the things that have changed and that 2014 decision at the NATO summit in Wales, UK, to increase defense spending to two percent GDP.Obviously, some countries, we've heard from the Polish official saying that they think that actually Ukrainian defense spending should, rather, NATO defense spending contribution should actually go up significantly because of the substance of the threat. We heard from Germany's Deputy Defense Minister speaking about the same issue that really they feel that the threat is so great. He needs to grow his military more or more quickly than his budget will allow. But, the projection that you will hear won't be these little differences. It'll be that unifying message. And of course, President Zelenskyy has said specifically, he wants concrete steps and answers on air defense systems, as Fred was saying, and the indications are he'll get something on that. The other thing that he wants, of course, you were talking about it there that could be in the communique, the word \"irreversible\" on a path to becoming a NATO member. That was something he so wanted last year in Vilnius when the NATO summit was there, and he didn't get it, and he is going to want that strong language, because that for him is the strongest message to President Putin that NATO isn't going away because they're giving him this irreversible path. John Kirby, that U.S. -- the White House's National Security Spokesperson, spoke about this specific issue. He didn't use the word \"irreversible\", though. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESPERSON: NATO is in Ukraine's future, and there is going to be a path, what we call a bridge to NATO, that the allies will talk about this coming week, to include the signing of bilateral security agreements, which has already happened, to make sure that they have long-term defense needs met for whenever however this war ends.

As much as that may be true, and we can argue that, how much is the current state of U.S. politics a liability? I mean, when allies look to the U.S., they are seeing, on the one hand, arguably a diminished President, and on the other, potentially an incoming former President that does not value NATO the way they would like to see it valued.",

But, in the Republican Party, there is strong support for NATO to support Ukraine and for the United States to support Ukraine. So, even if Mr. Trump is elected, he is going to have trouble with his own party. They don't want to turn Ukraine over to Russia. 75 percent of the American people support continued assistance to Ukraine.The real issue is, it's not a stalemate. It just looks like a stalemate right now. It's very dynamic. Russia is producing it 24x7 from its industrial complex, lining up China, bringing systems in from North Korea. Iran is there with the drones. The question is, can the West keep up? Can we get ahead? Can we break the momentum that Russia has and convince Putin that he is going to lose and that he should pull back?",

But, they also are fully aware of the debate that's currently playing up out on Capitol Hill. Sources in and around the White House and campaign acknowledge how critical of a day to day will be as these Democratic lawmakers are assembling together for the first time since -- in-person, since that debate performance last month.Now, the President and his team have been conducting outreach in recent days. And what they've also been quick to highlight is the support that the President has been getting, even as there is a small group that has publicly called for the President to step aside in this race. So far, there have only been six House Democratic lawmakers who have said that it's time for Biden to go. Others have expressed these concerns privately. But, at the same time, you do have some rallying of support around the President, particularly from the Congressional Black Caucus. President Biden yesterday spent a little over 30 minutes on the phone in a virtual meeting with these lawmakers of the CBC where he thanked them and asked them for his support going forward. A source telling CNN that there was no pushback from these lawmakers in the meeting. Those are some of the most forceful defenders that you've seen from President -- of President Biden since this debate has played out. The President also spent some time yesterday on the phone speaking with the donors of his National Finance Committee. And I'm told that today, the President also will be reaching out to Democratic mayors from across the country. A source telling me that tonight, the President will join a virtual zoom call with these mayors, part of his latest effort to try to shore up support within his party. But, of course, a lot of eyes will also be on the President, as he conducts himself throughout the NATO summit playing out here in Washington, D.C. this week. On Thursday, the President will hold a solo news conference, which is something that lawmakers -- that aides and lawmakers and Democrats are watching very closely, as the President's team has acknowledged that he needs to be out there doing these more impromptu events, taking questions from the reporters, all in the hopes of showing Americans that he is up for serving a second term in office. So, the White House and campaign are fully cognizant of what a critical week this is for President Biden, as he looks to continue to rally support around him.

And one source telling CNN that the sense in the room, as they huddled this morning just off of on Capitol Hill, was one of sadness. And this person said it was a sadness that comes from talking about someone you love, who is in obvious decline. That notable comment that that tone was what was paramount in this meeting today.Now, we heard that this was essentially a listening session among top leaders in the room, listening to what the House Democrats believe, and that both viewpoints were heard that many people just essentially went up to an open mic and told the room what they felt about Biden's future. Now, we heard from Congressman Jerry Nadler going into the room. Now, he was one of those people, one of those congressman that privately has expressed that he does not think Biden should continue on top of the ticket.

But, the reality is, Paula, you say I'm one of Biden's biggest supporters, and I do support him, and the reason I support him is because I have been listening to a lot of what the grassroots voters are saying out in the states, even in the swing states. There was a recent Bloomberg poll that actually had President Biden closing the gap with Donald Trump and had him up in every single swing state except Pennsylvania, where he was tied. There was a Reuters/Ipsos poll that had Trump and Biden tied. And if you remember, in 2022, all of these polls, and so many talking heads, were warning how the Democrats were going to get blown out of the water in the midterm elections. There was a huge red tsunami coming and it didn't materialize. Because you know why, Paula? A lot of the voters out in the states are not -- their sentiments are not being measured correctly by these polls. And what I'm hearing from these grassroots Democrats is they are still firmly backing President Biden because he delivered for them, and they prefer Biden on his worst day than somebody who represents an existential threat to our democracy, to their communities, and, frankly, to the global world order, if Donald Trump gets anywhere near the White House. And so, as long as that is the case, as long as President Biden enjoys the continued support of grassroots Democrats, the 14 million people who voted for him during the nomination process, the 4,000 delegates that are promised to him, he is going to stay on the ticket. And if he is going to stay on the ticket, the only way he wins is for the vast majority of Democrats, including lawmakers, to support him.",

Appreciate it.Now, jury selection is underway in Alec Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter trial in New Mexico. This follows the fatal shooting of a cinematographer nearly three years ago on the set of the film \"Rust\". Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to one felony charge. Now, he previously told CNN, he did not pull the trigger. But, he has admitted to pulling back the hammer of the gun. The charges against Baldwin were previously dismissed. However, last October, prosecutors said new facts in the case showed Baldwin had culpability in this shooting. Joining us from Los Angeles now with the latest is Elizabeth Wagmeister. You've been following this case very closely. We did have a ruling early on that seemed to perhaps be in Baldwin's favor. What more do we know?",
