If those conditions are not met, what the unions are threatening is what they`re calling a siege of Paris. Already, some 15,000 police, men and women in security forces have been stationed to petrol stations and farmer`s markets to try and prevent the situation from spiraling out of control. This is a movement that has now spread to the four corners of France, although it began in the south and was led initially by just two farmers unions. The farmers have been causing major disruption across the country with the setting up of roadblocks on key motorways, the setting, a light of tires and waste, and the dumping of manure outside local stores. The government in the shape of the newly appointed Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, has already offered concessions, but that say the farmers is not enough. We expect new announcements to be made by the government this week to help what they describe as the farming world. But for now, farmers here in France appear determined to keep going.

Belgium farmers are also upset by environmental regulations that leave them undercut by imports. And protests of a different kind are happening in another neighboring country, Germany. As CNN Sebastian Shukla explains these demonstrations have just as much to do with the direction of their government as they do with immediate economic concerns.

Weekends in Berlin and across Germany are quickly becoming days of demonstration. These anti-far-right protestors have a message of light for Germans. Never again means now, as they fear the rise of the far-right? LOUIS MOTAAL, SPOKESPERSON, FRIDAY`S FOR FUTURE:  Never again is now.

Sincethen women have taken on more leadership roles within this conservative country. That includes the North Korean leader sister, Kim Yo Jong, who has become one of his, his closest advisors and the first woman to be featured prominently in North Korea`s international diplomacy. CNN`s Will Ripley examines the women in this new power circle and what that means for the country`s next leader. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  North Korea`s most powerful man making an emotional appeal to women. Kim Jong-un wiping away tears, urging moms to have more babies, to boost the plunging birth rate. Pyongyang`s patriarch persists, observers say, but things may be changing in Kim`s Korea. The North Korean leader bringing powerful women into his orbit. Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui who recently met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kim`s younger sister Kim Yo Jong, a close aid and trusted confidante, famous for fiery speeches. And this dramatic demolition of the Inter-Korean liaison office. The younger Kim`s meteoric rise likely fueled by her close brotherly bond and powerful Kim family bloodline. The family photo that shook the world, the supreme leader revealing his daughter believed to be Kim Ju-ae at a missile launch in late 2022, the first in a series of carefully staged father- daughter photo-ops, elevating the profile of Kim`s elementary-aged child, raising questions about succession.
