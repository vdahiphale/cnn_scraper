Zelenskyy vows to keep defending besieged Bakhmut. Thousands take to the streets of Israel to protest the government's judicial plans. And later in the show. Mo Salah's as a magical night at Anfield. We start with a nuclear progress report out of Vienna. Iran set to allow increased monitoring of its nuclear facilities. Now the head of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog announcing that information today amid growing international concern over Iran's nuclear activities. Rafael Grossi say and I quote him here. \"Concrete access will be given to certain individuals a uranium enrichment sites.\" Just last week, uranium particle enriched to well beyond stated limits were found at undeclared sites. Grossi says, Iran will assist in an investigation of those articles. Well, he traveled to Tehran after the discovery of those particles which were enriched to near weapons grade level. He talked with high-level officials about access for monitors and efforts to jumpstart talks on reviving the nuclear deal. And Rafael Grosi joins me now live from Vienna. So, it's very good to have you. How did you find your meetings with the leadership?",

And this is what prompted me to go there and to meet with the leadership. What I think was important was my first meeting with President Raisi.

A lifeline for Ukrainian defenders, with one Ukrainian commander tweeting that there are many ways still to get into the city. Analysts have questioned the strategic importance of Bakhmut but that has not stopped Moscow's intense campaign to capture the city. Nor Ukraine's existential fight to keep it. The unceasing barrage of artillery fire hasn't just killed or forced out most of the city's civilians. It's taken a huge toll on Ukrainian soldiers too, as the battle turns to close quarters street fighting.
