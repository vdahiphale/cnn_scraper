It is part of the intense fighting that is ongoing across the Donetsk region as Ukrainian forces battle Russian troops for control of a number of towns and cities. Ukraine says the situation remains difficult in several areas in the east, including in Vuhledar and Bakhmut.Now, Ukraine is up to receive dozens of battle tanks from allies as part of the first wave of deliveries from 12 countries as it prepares for unexpected spring offensive from Russia. Western officials say Russia is struggling to replace its losses and is unlikely to see strategic success in any upcoming offensive. One official says attacks by Russian troops are turning the city of Bakhmut into a total ruin, and in the ongoing fight there, Ukrainian forces are also having to battle fighters from the Wagner mercenary group. CNN's Fred Pleitgen gives us an inside look at what they're facing.

Look, Ukrainians are once again trying to push the limits of what is possible in terms of western deliveries of weapons, and their latest ask, frankly, is a big one.Ukrainian foreign minister said yesterday that he has instructed his diplomats in western capitals to make it their priority to lobby for two things in particular. One, fighter jets, western fighter jets, and number two, long-range missiles that can strike targets up to 300 kilometers. That kind of a range would allow the Ukrainians to easily strike inside Russian territory, Russia itself, not just Russian-held territory. The -- and, of course, one of the concerns of the west in sending any kind of weapon systems is that this may escalate the actual conflict, escalate the war. The Ukrainians say that, look, this is for defense and deterrence only. But an adviser to President Zelenskyy made this argument also more broadly. He said that some E.U. states' representatives believe Ukraine shouldn't be given weapons as the war will spread to Europe. But, one, war is already in the center of Europe and Russian federation kills people in the most anti-human way. Number two, if Ukraine doesn't get weapons, war will spread to the E.U. as Russia won't stop the expansion. And of course, it is not just jets and not just long-range missiles. The Ukrainians are also keeping up their efforts to get more of what they already have. For instance, France has agreed to send more of the howitzer artillery systems than it has already sent to Ukraine. France, of course, is one of 12 countries now sending tanks also to Ukraine, which is pretty incredible considering that just over three weeks ago, not a single country had agreed to send tanks to Ukraine. Now, they are getting more than 120, they expect in the first round of shipments, and they are hoping for even more than that. In terms of the jets, the fighter jets, the door is not completely closed, though, it seems that it is in some places. President Biden said very clearly, no. The German chancellor said something similar. But the Ukrainian defense minister said that, look, the answer was the same when we asked for other weapon systems in the past. He is actually in France at the moment and he says that he is optimistic about getting these things. His French counterpart, the French defense minister, said that, look, nothing is off the table, but anything that gets sent has to be for defensive purposes only and it has to be useful. That is one problem that the British had brought up. They believe that sending fighter jets, frankly, is not that practical because these are extremely sophisticated machines and even trained Ukrainian fighter pilot would have to train for months and months to actually figure out how to fly, in any kind of a competent way, the western version of these planes.

GALDOS (voice-over):  The protests began as support for one politician and his failed coup. But they are beyond that now. This is a cry of anger from people who don't feel valued by the leaders of their country. They believe their lives are seen as worthless by a government they think just doesn't care, whether they live or die. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And the government is expecting significant disruption across the public sector. Of course, this is all part of a long running row between the trade unions and the government over working conditions and crucially pay.These trade unions, of course, calling for their pay rises to be increased in relation to the cost-of-living crisis and the inflation rates that we are seeing in the United Kingdom. Now, this is going to impact a range of industries and public sectors, workers of course, crucially teachers are beginning what is set to be several days of strike action across England and Wales. We heard just yesterday from the general secretary of the National Education Union, which is orchestrating the strike, Kevin Courtney. He spoke to the national broadcaster, the BBC. He said that he anticipates to set up to 200,000 teachers will take part in the strike across the country. And he also pushed back on any suggestion that negotiations have been moving forward with the British government. Now, Rishi Sunak's government has said that its door remains open and they are willing to talk with the union to salvage some sort of resolution. But Kevin Courtney, the general secretary of the Teacher's union described this as fanciful. But of course, we are seeing walkouts by other interesting sectors including transport, rail services, set to be hugely disruptive and civil servants also now joining the strikes. Rosemary?",

Well, the cost-of-living crisis is also fueling deep dissatisfaction in France where massive crowds held a second round of strikes. They are protesting the government's deeply unpopular pension reform plans. Police say Tuesday's demonstration drew about 1.3 million people nationwide. A bigger turnout than the initial walkouts.Many trains were canceled and schools were closed forcing millions to change their routines. Two more days of strikes are planned for next week, but the French government shows no sign of backing down from its plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.

So, President Macron's party needs alliances in order to pass this law through. As we have said, the debate that has started in the national assembly now is going to be around literally thousands of amendments, some of which are just going to sort of get absolute two (inaudible) reactions, but some are going to be fought over bitterly in order to mitigate the effects of the law.And one of the things that you've got to understand is the French pension system is a (inaudible) system. So, what happens is I pay now for many that are going to be paid for people who go and retire, and they will be paid tomorrow by people who retire tomorrow -- who haven't retired yet tomorrow. When we created the system in 1946, we had it eight people at work for one part pensioner and it was easily in the block. You have a little fewer than 2 people paying for one pensioner nowadays and it's very obvious that the demographic change and the aging of the population has made the system completely unsustainable.",

But really why are people worried so much. It's not so much the question of the retirement age. It's that France is a country that has structure and employment. It's between 8 and 10 percent has been for three decades at least.And what this also means is that employers tend to get rid of workers after 50. What people are looking terrifyingly at is the possibility of having two more years unemployed, with nobody wanting to hire them, although they are sort of having regret of life (ph) and having it to sort of continue a bit further. And that's what colors it. That's when of course the cost-of-living prices, which as you said earlier, is making everybody worried that their hob will be next.",

They were transporting this item from one month to another in Perth when it became dislodged. They pointed out investigation is underway.
