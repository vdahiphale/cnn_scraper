But, certainly, for the Secret Service and for Ronald Rowe, he is now forcefully saying that he went to the roof of the AGR building, where the shooter took aim at the former president, something, by the way, that the former director did not do before her hearing. So he went there. And you saw these extraordinary images that he showed at this hearing where he showed you the vantage point from the roof, the nearby roof, where, according to the information we got from the hearing today, local law enforcement snipers were supposed to be keeping watch. It appeared that, at least during a part of that, one or more of them perhaps left their post to go find this suspicious person that was being reported by other law enforcement. That was a very big piece of information. We finally get some clarity about what happened there. But you could see the outrage that he shared during the hearing there. Now, listen to this exchange with Senator Durbin, where he describes some of the lack of communication that happened with law enforcement, the local law enforcement. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's exactly what the Secret Service needs at this stage. He took responsibility for what happened, was contrite and somewhat shameful about just what was so glaringly obvious to those of us seeing it. He talked about what specific gaps there were. So we learned about why the drones weren't up or the counterdrones weren't up. We learned about the communications challenges between text and radio. But my big takeaway on the safety and security, which I think will help the Secret Service in the future, is what he talked about in terms of assumptions. He said, basically, we just make assumptions about state and locals. He didn't throw them under the bus. And he said the Secret Service in their responsibility as leaders to protect the nominee and former president needed to challenge those assumptions, stress-test them, put them under duress, because, clearly, that gap in coverage, which we all know existed, was there. So that's -- I think it was helpful. I think it was illuminating. I think it will help. The most important thing is that it's going to get the Secret Service to fill in the gaps that we obviously saw. On the politics side, I will say, I have never seen -- I mean, he was good. I mean, look, they want -- the senators want some blood. He's not going to give it to them yet. He wants a thorough investigation about what happened. We have to assume agents are going to be fired at some stage. But he's not going to do it on the senator's sort of political time frame. That's hard to do as an acting. Maybe he just feels like he has nothing else to lose. But I thought, in that regard, he really did quiet some of the GOP clamor, which is important, because we have an election with the threat environment as high as it is.",

And that is every member of the House of Representatives voted to create this task force, 416-0. So every voting member voted to create it, because this is a moment for us to -- in a nonpartisan and bipartisan way to get answers about a very troubling incident. This should not have happened.

It's a difficult thing to achieve. But, if you don't achieve it, everything else can fall apart, right?

It still seems to be a fairly chaotic scene. We have seen pictures of smoke rising from that part of the city. But, certainly, that is what we know at this point. It is the first time the southern suburbs of Beirut have been hit since early January, when the Israelis killed a senior Hamas leader who was in that area. But, as I said, this is the first strike since then. And Hezbollah has made it very clear all along that, if Beirut is struck, they will answer accordingly. They have said that they will meet escalation with escalation in the aftermath of last Saturday's attack on the Golan -- the Israeli- occupied Syrian Golan Heights that left 12 children dead.

The IDF usually waits until the later hours of the evening, where they can assure that there's no collateral damage on civilian casualties when they conduct a strike.

There are areas there within and around the capital where Hezbollah has centers. Let's just call them that, anything from cells to intelligence centers to military command structures in and around the area of Beirut. They have always had that. So, when you're talking about the potential to limit that and not go near the capital area or near the airport, I just find that a little bit -- that -- it's a little bit of hyperbole from the standpoint of someone hoping for the best that this wouldn't happen. So, if it is -- and I will say one more thing. If it's just a couple of explosions, as Ben has reported, two explosions, that is a proportional response so far. It could get bigger, but when you're talking about what happened the other day with the killing of civilians and especially children in that playground or that soccer field, you're talking about the potential for a much greater response by Israel. And, again, this could just be step one.

The United States has repeatedly warned Israel about any potential attacks going into Beirut specifically, but we heard John Kirby, the spokesperson for the NSC, recently say that concerns about a wider conflict based on an Israeli response are exaggerated.

As we get word of this, a targeted strike, Israel says, Israeli military says, on this Hezbollah commander that they say was behind this attack that killed 12 children in Northern Israel, what are you -- what are your thoughts as you see this news? CROW:  Israel absolutely has a right and I'd even say an obligation to respond to this attack that killed 12 children by Hezbollah. But why we talk about issues of proportionality is that it goes directly to the concern about escalation. And I'm going to talk about why escalation in this case is a larger concern than maybe it has been in the past. What we have to do is, we have to zoom out and talk about Iran. Iran works through these regional proxies, these proxy forces, right? Hamas is one of them. Hezbollah is one of them, the Houthis. They have other militias and forces throughout the Middle East. But Hezbollah is the largest and the most capable of all of those proxy forces, right? So the concern about escalation is the most acute when we're talking about Hezbollah, right? The thing that could lead to a larger regional war is if Hezbollah opens up a northern front. They have far more rockets, far more personnel, far more sophisticated weaponry, and more capability across the board. And that could be very devastating in the north.",

But when you are talking about the fact that it was potentially, or at least the IDF is saying it was a drone strike, again, I go back to what I said earlier. That is a very good thing, because it shows a limited kinetic operation against a specific target, as opposed to a massive campaign either by air or ground against multiple targets in Beirut. The thing I have been very concerned about is an incursion into Lebanon by the Israeli Defense Forces. They are already having some challenges in Gaza and in the West Bank, and to have another front opening up with a massive amount of forces -- which we know Israel has mobilized forces for the potential of going into Lebanon. It is very concerning, because it would certainly widen that war and bring other actors in.
