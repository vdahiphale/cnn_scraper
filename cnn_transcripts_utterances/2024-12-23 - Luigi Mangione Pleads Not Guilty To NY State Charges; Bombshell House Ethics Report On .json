He's accused of using cocaine, taking excessive gifts, and having sex with a 17-year-old girl. Also this hour, deja vu. Donald Trump sets his sights on Greenland once again.

Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD. The suspect in the murder of the UnitedHealthcare CEO has pleaded not guilty to state murder and terror charges. A short time ago, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione made an appearance in a New York courtroom. He faces 11 state counts in New York, in addition to four federal charges. He could potentially get the death penalty if convicted on a federal murder charge. During today's hearing, Mangione's lawyer expressed concern about whether he could get a fair trial. Here's what she had to say in court. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO, LUIGI MANGIONE'S LAWYER: I'm very concerned about my client's right to a fair trial in this case. He's being prejudiced by some statements that are being made by government officials. Like every other defendant, he's entitled to a presumption of innocence. But unfortunately, the way this has been handled so far, he -- his rights are being violated. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But what the committee's findings here are, are things that they say are backed up, not just by text messages they have, other documentary evidence, but also testimony from witnesses and that victim, that alleged victim, the woman who was underage at the time, Matt Gaetz, had sex with her at a party twice in July of 2017 when she was headed into her senior year of high school, 17 years old. The big findings here in the House report are that Matt Gaetz engaged in commercial sex. So, was providing payment to women for sex and/or drugs, at least 20 times, that he was engaging in statutory rape, that is the relationship with the underage girl in 2017. And then also that he was using illicit drugs. All of this put together is the House saying, we investigated this. This is what we found. We're putting this out in the public, even though he's no longer a congressman, even though the Justice Department looked at the possibility Gaetz had broken federal laws here and declined to charge him with any crime.

      "sentences": "In one of his last major acts as President, President Biden is using his presidential clemency power tocommute the death sentences of 37 inmates that are currently on federal death row to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Now remember back in 2020, President Biden campaigned on getting rid of the federal death penalty. And in recent weeks, there had been a swirl of speculation about whether he might take this kind of action before he leaves office, particularly as he was under a good amount of pressure from human rights activists and a number of advocacy groups, some of whom have argued that the death penalty tends to disproportionately affect black people and other people of color. Now President Biden, in his statement, announcing these commutations, said this, make no mistake, I condemn these murders, but guided by my conscience and my experience, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted. That last reference there to a new administration resuming executions I halted, that obviously, is a reference to incoming President, Donald Trump. Keep in mind that during his first term in office, there were 13 federal death row inmates who were put to death. And in his most recent presidential campaign, Trump has made very clear that he is set on moving forward with additional federal executions once he returns to office. This is a little bit of what Donald Trump has said over the last year on this issue.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF UNITED STATES: Has anyone ever heard of the Panama Canal? Huh? Because we're being ripped off at the Panama Canal like we're being ripped off everywhere else. A secure? He just said take it back. That's a good idea. It was given to Panama and to the people of Panama, but it has provisions. You got to treat us fairly, and they haven't treated us fairly. If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America.

We saw it with him throwing out this idea and threats to institute tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We've seen it with his provocations with China. And certainly, in that sense, this idea to seize back control of the Panama Canal is sort of fitting in that theme. Although I have to say even some people close to Trump did not see this specific idea coming and were sort of thrown off by this idea, you know, Trump often dines with people right across the water from me at Mar-a-Lago where he's meeting with business leaders and advisors and close friends who throw out ideas and Trump goes on to echo them. And I'm not saying and that is what transpired here, but that is sometimes the origin of these ideas. Greenland, as you mentioned, is something that he has been somewhat infatuated with going all the way back to his first term. And yesterday, he sort of revived this idea that the U.S. could somehow acquire Greenland, even though, as you said, the prime minister of Denmark had previously called that idea absurd. But Trump hosting last night that he intended to name a new ambassador to Denmark. And in that post he wrote, for purposes of national security and freedom throughout the world, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity. So it is somewhat jarring to hear Donald Trump continue to float these ideas of expanding American sovereignty when he has also campaigned aggressively on the idea that U.S. needs to pull back from the world stage and is too involved in world affairs. And yet, here he is suggesting the U.S. needs to take control of the Panama Canal, buying Greenland. And I should also point out he has floated, although I think mostly in jest, the idea of absorbing Canada as the 51st state.",

If I was goingto place a bet, I would say that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear it. They're going to stay this while they make a decision, which will allow the new administration to come to power. Because this is only like a few days in advance. When the new administration comes to power, some decisions will be made. That's my guess, if I had to guess. Of course, it's impossible to tell. This is not something that any of us are going to have any power over. I know for a fact that everybody is scrambling to figure out what to do with the aftermath. One of the things that's not being talked about enough is that there are not only there are 170 million TikTok users actively every month, there are tens of millions, and I mean tens of millions of cottage industries. The creator economy is what it's generally known as people who make their living substantial amount of their living on TikTok. And I have to say very -- YouTube is going to be the beneficiary as well Meta and Instagram. Their Instagram property. But realistically --",

However, when the Rockettes audition came around, I did not know who the Rockettes were. And a peer said to me, Jennifer, you should go to the audition. You would make a great Rockette. And being very green in the business and very nervous at auditions, that morning, I decided to go to the audition. And when I got to Radio City Music Hall at ten o'clock, the time of the audition, there was a line of women wrapped around the music hall, beautiful, long legs, they knew how to do their hair, makeup. And I got at the end of the line. And I thought about leaving numerous times. I thought I could make my favorite jazz class at eleven o'clock because I figured they were not going to pick me. And I thought about leaving numerous times and then a voice inside me said, stay. And if I did not have the voice or the intuition to listen to my inner voice, my life would not have changed the way it did on such a worldwide magnitude.
