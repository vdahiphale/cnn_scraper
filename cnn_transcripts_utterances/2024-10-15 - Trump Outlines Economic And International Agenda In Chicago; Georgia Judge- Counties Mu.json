Or is he promising certain things that, if he comes back into office one day, those would -- those would be major issues, major concerns of mine. But again, we just don't know. And it's worth -- then again, it's not unusual for world leaders to maintain friendships, relationships beyond their terms in office. What's unusual, again, is this is Vladimir Putin. He's an adversary. He's doing things to harm the United States and our allies. And what he's doing against Ukraine it's just terrible. So this is why my concern is particularly peaked here.",

But it was a question that was asked that I thought illuminated Trump's worldview more broadly.The moderator -- moderator was asking him about how the U.S. won the Cold War against the USSR. And it had to do with uniting allies. He was asking about his approach in alienating folks that are supposed to be your friends on the world stage through the threat of tariffs, through some of his -- his rhetoric and whether he thought that that would ultimately cost the United States in what he views as a current Cold War with China. I wonder what you make of that approach and that statement from Trump?",

      "sentences": "Sure, it's a great question and it's a terrific issue. Look, I'm a Reagan Republican. And what Ronald Reagan did was rally the West.And he led. And what Reagan did during the '80s, along with Margaret Thatcher and others, was to basically defeat the Soviet Union through soft power and pushing back here and there. But we did it with allies and partners. And in today's context, the 21st century, where I see China as our greatest strategic advisor -- adversary, followed by Russia, Iran, North Korea, we have a great lineup of allies, the Europeans, the Japanese, Australians, Filipinos. You go around the world, we have dozens, dozens of treaty allies and even more partners. The other side, the China team, the Russia team, what they have are the four of them plus Nicaragua and Mali. It's not a very -- it's not a very good team. So it's important that we kind of keep the big picture in focus. That means democracy has to win here in the 21st century. And we're only going to do that if we, the democracies of the world, our allies and partners, work together. And what that means is making sure that we don't do things unnecessarily to fracture that alliance, to fracture those partnerships. And that would be my concern. We talk about 100 percent tariffs across the board, or breaking up trade agreements, things like that. Look, it's -- it's fair to look at those things. It's fair to assess trade agreements to make sure their current with the times, that they're meeting our interests. That's fine. But to threaten those things and possibly fracture these important alliances and partnerships in this standoff we're now against autocracies of the world, I think is what concerns me.",

You know, the interviewer was trying to get macro answers about the economy, what tariffs would do to the economy, et cetera, et cetera. And instead, Donald Trump is talking about, well, John Deere or I told -- I told this person who is building plants in Mexico this and that. So he doesn't really answer in a macro way. He answers in terms of his own experiences and his own stories. And then he weaves from one to the next. So it's kind of difficult to keep track. He calls it a weave. I'm not really sure what we should call it. You know?",

      "sentences": "Well, I thought that -- I've always thought that the issues that Trump was most sincerely passionate about, the issues that he's been talking about the same ways for decades, are immigration and trade.He has a view of trade that is very different from the mainstream view of economists. He believes trade deficits are really important, whereas economists would say they actually don't matter much. He believes that other countries pay the price for tariffs, whereas almost all economists would agree that American consumers pay the price for tariffs. But to give him credit, he's had a coherent philosophy around it. He's probably -- in our time, he's probably the most effective communicator of that philosophy, even though it's one experts don't share. And so in some way, when you get Donald Trump talking about tariffs and trade deficits and negotiations, especially, you're seeing him at his best, even though he does have this weaving style of communication. I'd argue it's not that different from how a lot of politicians speak. A lot of politicians will respond with an anecdote rather than directly address the question. Soin some way, you're seeing the crux of the difference between Donald Trump and how the consensus of economists view this issue.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's a very good question. And it's something we're thinking about.Trump -- when Trump does things, like threaten to pull out of NATO, it makes the hair on my arm raise because I think NATO is an incredibly important alliance, not something that should be spoken so lightly of. On the other hand, Trump, since for decades, he has prized himself as this great negotiator. And he has said that one of his negotiation strategies is to threaten something crazy in order to get some result, right? And again, this is his instinct. It's an instinct that can be dangerous because you have to be willing to do the crazy thing, or at least, you know, South Korea has to actually be worried that he's going to pull troops out, which I think would be a terrible idea. But they have to really be worried in order to actually respond. And from Trump's perspective, he has to make the crazy threat in order to get our NATO allies to pave the 2 percent of their GDP and so forth. But again, there are these examples where he calls the leader of North Korea Little Rocket Man, which is such a flagrant and flippant and dangerous move and could have terrible consequences. So there are two sides to it in that he feels he can get concessions out of these countries by threatening crazy things. But on the other hand, you have to actually threaten those crazy things, and as a world leader of the most important country on earth, you don't really want your leader to threaten crazy things.",

I remember reporting about Donald Trump with some real estate executives and they said, you know, he'd walk into a meeting. They we're about to cut some deal and he would just blow it up. And then walk out. Because he wanted a better deal or he wanted something else. And this is -- you know, this is -- this is what he does. He blows things up and then comes back to the table. And I think that's kind of what you're hearing from him. So it's been a constant in his life for decades. And you know, Donald Trump hasn't changed since the '70s, right?
