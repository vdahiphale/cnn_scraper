If I move out of my house, I cannot have the keys still and go back any time I feel like and say, I used to live here. I liked the bed. Can I stay a little bit.The same thing is true when you're talking about classified documents. You do not have the authority -- he's absolutely right about the word authorization. That's going to be the key to all of this. Did you have the authorization? Did you know you didn't - you no longer had the authorization to have the documents? He did not have any longer. One other point. Evan Corcoran, that is going to be extraordinarily important testimony. And he is absolutely right that they're going to have to probably relitigate what is going to be admissible in an actual court of law in front of a jury or not, but that crime fraud exception, the reason why the attorney/client privilege is so sacrosanct is because you want to make sure that it's not being used for nefarious purposes. I don't get to say and plot crimes and then say, I talked to my lawyer. Don't worry, everyone, we're safe about this. If that is coming up, that will be important.",

It burst into flames before a stretch of I-95 collapsed. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is set to visit the site today.And I want to bring in CNN's Danny Freeman, who is live near the scene.

State officials told us in a news conference that basically almost 48 hours ago to this moment on Sunday morning a tanker truck carrying 8,500 gallons of gasoline was traveling northbound on I-95, tried to get off the exit ramp, took the curve hard, though, lost control, crashed, landed on its side, and eventually ruptured, and that ignited a fire that caused I-95 to ultimately collapse on the northbound lanes. Then yesterday we learned that the southbound lanes, they are not structurally safe, so they will have to come down as well. We've been seeing -- actually demolition begin and chip really into the southbound lanes last night and into this morning. Now, of course, as you said, initially there were no reported injuries, but then late yesterday afternoon Pennsylvania State Police did confirm one body was pulled from the wreckage, but the Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office still has not yet officially identified that person. Now, Phil, you've been asking, everyone's been asking that big question, when will things get up and running right here. Well, the best estimate that we have was from Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. He said some number of months. But as you mentioned, Secretary Buttigieg, he'll be on the ground today. We'll ask him that same question. Meanwhile, traffic in these small streets behind us, still a nightmare. Government officials hoping folks take public transit if they can. Phil.",

You can talk about funding and all those aspects of it. But you can also address the legitimacy and the validity of a very serious allegation contained in this indictment. You're talking about somebody -- this is allegations, again, presumption of innocence certainly, but you can actually articulate that this is something worthwhile without undermining the entire institutions.And I just offer, you know this, John, a quick civics lesson. You want to be the head of the executive branch of government. Their job is to enforce the laws. And under their org chart, what is it, the FBI and everything else. Either you are pro-executive branch or you're not. AVLON: And - but let me actually just double down on the political problem Republicans find themselves in -- and I have a new column up on CNN Opinion about this -- regarding the threats of violence that Trump and some of his surrogates are putting forward. There's nothing less conservative than the threat of mob violence. If a party has defined itself historically as being a party of patriotism, individual responsibility, national security, law and order, following Donald Trump down this path is the worst thing you can possibly do for your brand on those core principles.
