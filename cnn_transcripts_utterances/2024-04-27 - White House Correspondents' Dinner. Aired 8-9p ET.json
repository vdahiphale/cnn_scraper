And I know that Mr. Berman always likes to say that I'm not invited, but the fact is he is invited. He gets -- he's invited to watch the speech on television like the rest of America. They are joining us here this evening. So Berman is an American and, you know, I would just tell you, we've had a load of stars that have come out so far and stars that may not be folks that are in the memory bank of our young ends, but in the memory banks of me. I saw Molly Ringwald? I saw Andrew McCarthy, both part of those brat pack movies in the 1980s that was great. I got to see Fran Drescher, again that we saw -- I saw her last year. And here's the big thing, guys. She actually remembered me. She actually remembered me, which was to me the greatest thing that has ever happened to me on a red carpet of any sort, whether it be this or if I'm ever invited to the Oscars in the future. So that one's going in the memory bank and we've had a slew of CNN folks that have come out and we've spoken with so far. So, you know, I love to get roasted by folks when I'm in the chair, I'm at the wall and everyone else is asking me the questions, but I like to turn the tables once in a while and I was able to ask them the question.

Good evening. We're really here. Thank you to The President's Own Marine Corps Band led by drum major, Master Gunnery Sergeant Duane King. Good evening and welcome to a great Washington tradition. What began as a simple dinner for about 50 reporters back in 1921, has grown and grown to this. I need a little help from The President's Own. (BAND PLAYING) O'DONNELL: Thank you, sir. More than 100 years of heritage, we only get dressed up like this once a year, and now you are a part of the story. Welcome to the 2024 White House Correspondents' Dinner. Mr. President, Vice President Harris, Dr. Biden, and Mr. Emhoff, thank you for the gift of your time. This is a complex moment for our nation and a campaign year, with far away conflicts leave many worried, and wondering about the future, understandably so. We know that, is our backdrop tonight. We also know there is value in praising exceptional work and promising student journalists. This event is the primary fundraiser for our association and the scholarships we will highlight. So if you believe in our purpose, we welcome your donations and appreciate your generosity. Master Sergeant, I think we might need a little boost for that. Don't you, sir? (BAND PLAYING) O'DONNELL: That's the call to donate. And let there be laughter. I hope for lots of side splitting, light the internet on fire laughter. Remember the bowl room is filled with newsmakers, politicians of both parties, cabinet secretaries, senior officials, media executives, entertainers, and journalist and more. So the last year you will hear tonight comes from all those different corners. So get ready to roast. The humor is intended to zing and skewer across the political spectrum and aimed at the national media, too. But before we get really going, let me offer some thanks to my employers, Mike Cavanagh, Cesar Conde and NBC News for three decades of adventure, and for your support building to this special night and importantly for giving me the time needed to do this job, to serve as president of the WHCA, which can be --",
