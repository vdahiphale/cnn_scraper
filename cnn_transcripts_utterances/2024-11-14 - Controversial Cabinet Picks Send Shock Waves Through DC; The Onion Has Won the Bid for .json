So I am guessing here, and this is the difficult part here that will obviously have to be pored over is you have a headline that you know, Kennedy anti-vaxxer and a nuanced response that might make it more difficult for people to understand exactly where he stands.

So I think a lot of it is coming from that. I think just as with the Matt Gaetz nomination particularly, there is going to be a lot of question whether RFK, Jr. can win confirmation in the Senate. He is going to be out there for two months now until Trump can formally nominate him once he becomes president and there is going to be a massive campaign against him, and we are going to have to watch four or five or six senators who could be the key people here to work out what his chances are of confirmation.",

It is not just a popular democracy and anyone who wins can do exactly what they want. In the Senate, there are some senators who are going to be up for re- election in two years, who perhaps might not like to go on the campaign trail and defend picks and votes for Gaetz and RFK, Jr., for example. There are some senators who are retiring and won't be beholden to the Trump machine and there are some senators who have just been elected who don't have to face re-election for six years, and Donald Trump is effectively a lame duck because he is in his second term, so there is a little bit more political insulation. I find it hard that all of these picks -- to believe that all of these picks are going to make it through, but such is the provocative nature of some of these that, you know by design, some of them are going to get through and were going to have people who are regarded by many experts in their fields as completely unfit to serve in the jobs to which Trump has nominated them.",

We are going to see tariffs and then tariffs on top of tariffs. So that's a reality. And yes, the security side of the relationship again has become a little bit more uncertain, so for a lot of these countries, they are going to have to decide. Do they become more self-sufficient?

So think about half of the equity allocation is in Australian equities because it is valuable, it is more valuable for them to do that. It is not going to be the case here. Rachel Reeves has made very clear there won't be any mandates for UK investment. There won't be any incentives. So you've got to question how this allocation is going to happen. It will be a huge pension fund. I think we have a comparison for you, Richard. It will sit -- currently, it would sit around, I think top six or seven in the world.

We spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to open up the blood brain barrier to get medications from the bloodstream into the brain to allow amyloid plaque, for example, from the brain to actually get back out of the brain into the bloodstream. The idea that just Wi-Fi would do something that we have spent decades trying to do in the lab, you know, it sounds preposterous.

Look, let us investigate what you're saying, because let us give you the benefit of the doubt that maybe there is some reason that you are saying this. But so many times, Richard, it has come back to be demonstrably false. And again, I realize with the vaccines, that becomes the metaphor for so many things. But the idea that vaccines cause autism. Okay. That was raised decades ago as a possibility. And it was studied in studies that involved hundreds of thousands of children in dozens of countries for a decade and a half following these children and found not to be true. At which point do you say, hey, look, okay, we can settle some of these issues as opposed to continuously moving the goalposts. Recently he said vaccines are not studied. They are studied. There's pre-licensure study with the FDA before they're actually administered, and then they are followed as people take it. So you have real world data, for example, on childhood vaccines and the COVID vaccine. But I think every time something like this is raised, the goalposts get moved even further, which makes it really challenging.",

It flies further and more efficient, fuel efficient than the alternatives. With nearly 5,000 mile range, it can go all the way from London to Vancouver. But it is a narrow bodied. And that narrow single aisle means changes on board for passengers and staff meal courses. For example, on the Iberia flight, all served at once.

We learned that he was about to officially tap Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. And just a few minutes later, he made that announcement official.

He feels that this has given him a mandate to actually deliver on the promises that he said he was going to deliver on the campaign trail. What's so fascinating about this, there been much speculation about the relationship between Donald Trump and RFK Jr. particularly because many people close to Donald Trump believed that he needed the help of RFK Jr. York to win over specific demographics, one of them being independent voters, one of them being suburban women, because of the fact that RFK had focused so much on this Make America Healthy Again agenda, talking about vaccines. There is a population of the United States who believes that nobody should get vaccines. RFK Jr. has perpetuated that theory, saying at times, without evidence that vaccines lead to autism. Some of just the bare minimum of the controversial things that RFK Jr. has said. But on the campaign trail, and Donald Trump often said that RFK Jr. Was going to lead the health agenda for the Make America Great Again administration for Donald Trump administration. And I'm told that him, this is him delivering on that promise. One of the things that Donald Trump has spent a lot of time doing is thanking the people around him, and that includes RFK Jr. who really spent an enormous amount of time campaigning for Donald Trump, both by Donald Trump's side and also just by himself out there trying to meet with voters. Now, one interesting thing I want to point out here, there was a lot of speculation that he was kind of going to get pushed to the side, particularly given the fact that he's so controversial and many people think he can't get confirmed in Congress. And in fact, in an interview with our own Caitlin Collins, Howard Lutnick, the head of the transition team, kind of laughed off the idea that he could be secretary, that RFK could be secretary of HHS. And that was just a few weeks ago. And now here he is as the actual pick a lot of questions as to what this means for confirmation. But again, when we ask those questions, I'm told that the Trump team doesn't really care. They're aware that some of these candidates that they're putting up for nomination are not going to get confirmed, but they say they're going to do everything in their power to try and get them confirmed. But again, this is surprising, particularly given the conversation were hearing around RFK that it would be so hard to confirm him. They give him some kind of SAR role over all the health departments where he would be able to do some stuff with a health agenda, but not this. And this is obviously a confirmed position or a confirmable position that he has now been nominated for.",
