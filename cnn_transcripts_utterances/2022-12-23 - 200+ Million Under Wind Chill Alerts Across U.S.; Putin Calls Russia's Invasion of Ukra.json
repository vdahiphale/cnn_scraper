A Christmas gut punch from Mother Nature as a once in a generation storm blasts across the country with the worst yet to come. Right now, more than half the U.S. population is under some kind of weather alert from the Canadian border to Mexican border. From Florida, all the way west to Washington state, more than 200 million people are under wind chill alerts. More than 80 million under winter weather alerts. More than 40 million under a hard freeze alert. And other 10 million bracing for high winds. Needless to say, it is a mess for holiday travelers. This is video just in from Detroit metro airport, thousands of flights were canceled Thursday. Nearly 2,700 flights already canceled today with hundreds more delayed. And look at power outages already. Tens of thousands in southern states like Texas, Georgia, Tennessee. Let's get to meteorologist Britley Ritz. What's the latest on this monster storm, Britley?",

Then we factor in the wind and that's what counts. What it feels like.Your wind chill, if you will, Des Moines, 36 below. The wind gusts in the Ohio valley 45 miles per hour. In Indianapolis, sustained winds of 32 miles per hour. Hence why we have wind chill warnings. From the northern plains down to Texas, all the way up into the mid-Atlantic and other areas dealing with advisories. Regardless, it's dangerously cold. It will stay that way for several hours. 84 hours for Jackson, Mississippi. When that happens, now we're talking about your pipes freezing. Make sure you're keeping them warm. Make sure your house is 65 degrees and the pipe is dripping. Make sure the faucet is dripping. Water needs to move. Frostbite comes into play. It only takes five to ten minutes to get frostbite. If you don't have to go outside, don't. We have wind chills going to last below zero for several days in Minneapolis Friday, 22 below, 25 below in Chicago. And not only that, but the snow continues to fall and blow around. Blizzard warnings still in effect for the Northern Plains, across the Great Lakes, and now up for parts of New York around the lakes where visibilities are expected to drop down below 1/4 of a mile for many hours. The Great Lakes, that's where you can expect most of the snowfall, especially back over towards Watertown and Buffalo where we could pick up nearly two feet of snow when it's all said and done -- Christine.",

It comes nearly two days after the committee expected to release, it all because of typographical errors and printing issues. But it is nearly 900 pages within comprehensive narrative of what occurred, before,, during and immediately before January six.Most importantly here, it also lays out 11 specific recommendations from the committee about how the various agencies and Congress can move forward. And key among those recommendations, is the committee is pointing to a section of the Constitution, the 14th Amendment, section three. That clearly states that anyone who is engaged in an insurrection can be disqualified from holding office. The committee says that that constitutional provision should be enforced, and while they don't see it directly, the takeaway here is that they believe that Donald Trump should be barred from holding office again, especially because he is now announced his plan to run in 2024. The committee separately is also pushing for passage of the Presidential Election Reform Act, that had made clear that vice presidents do not have the power to overturn elections, of, course as Trump pressured Pence to do, and the committee is also recommending that federal intelligence and security agencies, really take a much closer look to the dangers of violent extremism, especially since members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were at the forefront of the Capitol attack. Plus, there's a host of new details in this 800 plus-page report, including about how John Eastman, the first contacted Donald Trump at the White House, December 23rd, almost two years ago, to fill Trump in on his plan to overturn the election, of course, Pence refused to do that. And, of course, how a little known attorney named Kenneth Chesebro, allegedly came up with that plot to appoint fake electors in battleground states, to try to claim that Trump had actually won in those states. And crucially here, that fake elector plot is exactly what is now being investigated by state prosecutors, including in Georgia, also federal prosecutors for the special counselor's office. And those prosecutors from the special counselor's office, they have even served subpoenas to election officials and several background states, as part of its ramped up investigation. So, the committee ramping up its support. But still potentially a long way to go on the criminal side. Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
