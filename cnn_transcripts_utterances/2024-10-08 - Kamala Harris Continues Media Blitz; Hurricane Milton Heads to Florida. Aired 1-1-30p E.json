The National Hurricane Center is warning about a vast area of destruction, and Florida's governor says time is running out for people to evacuate.Plus, Harris hits the airwaves and former President Trump, the vice president delivering sharp criticism of her opponent during an appearance on \"The View,\" saying that he lacks empathy as he spreads misinformation about the federal response in the wake of Helene. And 14 states now suing TikTok. Why a bipartisan group of attorneys general say the social media platform is harming children's mental health. We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Hello. I'm Brianna Keilar in Washington, and my colleague and co-host Boris Sanchez is live in Florida following the very latest on Hurricane Milton, which is where we begin this hour. We are watching as this powerful Category 4 storm is barreling through the Gulf of Mexico with Florida directly in its sights. Right now, mass evacuations are under way across the state, and we're seeing this, long lines, traffic jams, and also many gas stations that are running out of fuel. The mayor of Tampa says tankers are on their way to refill gas stations in the area. And here's a look at Milton from space. This storm, it is just huge as you can see here. The impacts could be catastrophic with potentially life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds. Here's how Tampa's mayor put it bluntly: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JANE CASTOR (D), MAYOR OF TAMPA, FLORIDA:  I can say without any dramatization whatsoever, if you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you're going to die. This is something that I have never seen in my life, and I can tell you that anyone who was born and raised in the Tampa Bay area has never seen anything like this before. People need to get out.

      "sentences": "Brianna, the absolute worst.It's hard to imagine seeing the state of this community in Treasure Island, a barrier island on the Gulf Coast of Florida, and imagining that anyone could survive what they are about to witness from Hurricane Milton. What you see here around me is the result of Hurricane Helene. This is debris from a Category 4 storm that made landfall hundreds of miles from here. And this debris, we're talking about mattresses, water heaters, scrap metal, glass, is just out for blocks and blocks and blocks. One of the first things that you notice when you come into Treasure Island is the smell, because the trash is everywhere. And when you're looking at a potential 15-foot storm surge on top of about a foot of water in rainfall, plus 125-mile-an-hour winds, this, as one neighbor told me, has the potential to become a countless number of missiles. And it's not just this pile here or further down this block. I want you to look at a scene that we have seen multiple times across Pinellas County. There is trash everywhere. And this enormous pile, nearly 20 feet high, is roughly a few hundred yards from the beach. The beach is actually just behind those buildings over there. And on the other side, there's a bay. So you can imagine, the water is going to come into this community, if the forecast stands as it is, and essentially make an enormous mess of things. I spoke to one neighbor named Matt, who was here for Hurricane Helene. He said that he had to get out from his first-floor apartment. He got into chest-high water. He made it to the second floor and survived. This time, he says he's not taking any chances. Here's more of what he shared with me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She's been designated to help evacuate folks that want to get out. She says that people here have until 4:00 p.m. to register to evacuate. But so far today, only about three hours from that deadline, her bus is completely empty. Nobody has come at this point to evacuate yet. I want to get the latest on the forecast now and see exactly where Milton stands. Let's go live to Elisa Raffa, who's in the Weather Center for us. Elisa, where is the hurricane now? And in terms of strength, what are we seeing? I know there was some speculation that it might be reinvigorated to a Category 5. I guess the latest word is that it's going to stay at a strong Category 4?",

      "sentences": "Yes, right now it is teetering on that Category 5 strength. It's got 150-mile-per-hour winds; 156 miles per hour makes it a Category 5. So, again, we're kind of splitting hairs, kind of teetering along that border, but that eye is wakening up.It looks clear and symmetrical, so it's still keeping its intensity and its strength, still at that Category 4 storm 500 miles south and west of Tampa Bay. We still have it waning a little bit in that intensity, still, though, being a major hurricane as it makes landfill. And the problem with the kind of wobbling that it's doing in the intensity is what that will do is make the storm wider. It's going to double in size, becoming fatter, so it will have a much greater reach for those damaging winds. That's why we now have hurricane warnings in effect from coast to coast, from the East Coast all the way to the Atlantic coast. We could see a Category 2 hurricane swiping through Orlando. That's how far wide-reaching this thing could have. And I was incredibly troubled to see that huge mountain of debris behind you because we're looking at 110 mile-per-hour winds from Tampa down to Sarasota. That -- all of those things behind you will absolutely be projectiles, hurricane-force winds going towards the East Coast. Here's what I'm talking about, the storm again getting wider, tropical-storm-force winds taking over much of the peninsula, the hurricane-force winds from coast to coast. That means widespread power outages. And this is the unsurvivable part. This is why you're hearing the officials use such grave wording, because 10 to 15 feet of storm surge, you have to escape that. You have that from Tampa down to Sarasota, storm surge even still to 10 feet, even as far south as Fort Myers. The entire coast will have that ocean sloshing inland. Plus, you have the heavy rain coming down from the sky up to a foot possible, so multiple hazards -- Boris.",

I'm joined now by Dan Whelan. He's the vice president of operations for College HUNKS. You folks help to remove debris and move around the sort of stuff that comes loose after hurricanes.

That, to me, as a Republican, a disgruntled Republican who is voting for Kamala Harris and actively supporting her, is very important, because what I have learned through many, many decades now of being an American is that big problems in America require bipartisan solutions. And I think it's important that we not live and govern in an echo chamber, where everybody agrees and everybody is a yes-man or a yes- woman, and everybody comes from the same experience. So, for me, that tells me a lot about this coalition that Kamala Harris is building, where she's got people like Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney on the right and people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders on the left, because we need a president that will represent all Americans. And I think that's what she's signaling by saying, I will have a Republican in my Cabinet, something that Bill Clinton did.
