He was leaving a Democratic caucus meeting where they were discussing the strategy, trying to figure out what is next and whether they should accept the House plan, which was approved overwhelmingly in the House -- a majority of House Republicans supported this, as well as all but -- 90 House Republicans voted against it, just one House Democrat voted against it. It would be very difficult for the Senate to simply just walk away from this plan, even though it does not many of the provisions that senators from both parties wanted namely $6.2 billion in aid to Ukraine. That was what the Senate was moving towards. They were trying to move a bipartisan proposal that included aid to Ukraine.Kevin McCarthy ultimately decided to forego amid divisions within his own conference. But McCarthy backtracked significantly, retreated from his position to demand spending cuts and border security measures, dropped all of that in this bill, which would be a straight extension of government funding for the next 45 days. After it was approved in the House, now it's sitting here in Senate. In order to move forward with a vote in the Senate, it requires all 100 members to agree on a vote. One senator can object. If he or she were to object, it could drag out the process past the midnight deadline. That is not expected. Even the Republicans who typically vote against continuing resolutions, these stop gap measures are indicating that they don't plan to drag out the process. And Manchin's indication there, it's pretty clear that Democrats believe they have really no choice but to move ahead and approve this House bill, pulling Washington back from the brink of a shutdown, amid all these fears that that would happen, given the divisions within the GOP ranks. But Jim, the political fallout is only just beginning for the Speaker of the House. He had indicated for some time that he wanted to try to get this through on Republican votes alone. That didn't happen among push-back from the right. Those same members warned him, if he cut a deal with Democrats or allowed Democrats to vote for this bill, put a bill on the floor that Democrats could carry essentially carry across the finish line, that could be enough to end his speakership. So that fight over his future is almost certain to play out in the days ahead. The question is, will those members on the far right have the votes to push him out? How will the Speaker respond? He's indicating he's ready for a fight within his own party in the aftermath of this move, Jim.",

I voted, as did over 99 percent of House Democrats and about half of House Republicans to ensure that we didn't have a government shutdown, which really would have been devastating for the American people. You would have had millions of people going to work on Monday but without pay, including our men and women in our Armed Forces. So, the responsible vote here was a vote to keep the government funded.

BOYLE: You know, the reality is we now see, and this is a critical moment, a slight majority of House Republicans as they voted last night and showed again today, a slight majority of them are against funding the war effort in Ukraine. Fortunately, 100 percent of Democrats, as well as, I think, still a majority of Senate Republicans are in favor of standing up to Putin. So, I am confident that come mid-November and the next fiscal year, we will ensure that funding for the Ukrainian war effort is there. But certainly, as time goes on, and the MAGA caucus continues to grow and Donald Trump continues to cheerlead from the sidelines for Russia, it will continue to be a struggle here to ensure that the United States of America leads the transatlantic alliance in standing up to Putin.",

And I am glad that he finally agreed to put this bill on the House floor. As I mentioned, almost every single House Democrat voted for it, and about half of House Republicans. But the underlying issue is that the House Republicans continue to be so badly divided that they continue to have these recurring issues. Their dysfunction is actually impacting the ability to pass legislation around here. We saw it with the debt ceiling and we saw it with this.

It's not always pleasant watching the sausage get made up on Capitol Hill. I guess today was -- today was one of those days over in the House. What happened? Why did you and your fellow Democrats ultimately work with the House Speaker to get this done? REP. SETH MOULTON (D-MA): Because this is what Democrats always do. We always bail out the Republicans at the last minute when they can't get their own act together and properly fund the government. We did the right thing for the American people, because of how many thousands and thousands of families were about to go without money to put food on the table. We did the right thing for our troops, who were worried about whether they will get paid in the few weeks if we had a government shutdown. But of course, the chaos within the Republican Party continues. And when I was in the House gym this morning early on, talking to Republicans about what was going to happen today, at 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning, they had no idea.

And so, while the American people and federal employees and our troops were watching what would happen today on Capitol Hill, make no mistake, Vladimir Putin had a really good day. He was watching this, too. Xi Jinping over in China who's made clear his ambitions to take over Taiwan, he was watching this, too. He had a good day, seeing Americans fail to support Ukraine.

But at the end of the day, we needed to get through this shutdown. A shutdown is not good for our national security. A shutdown is not good for Ukraine, either. If we had plowed into a shutdown, we wouldn't have been providing Ukraine funding under that scenario, as well. So, this was the right thing to do, but am I confident we can get Ukraine the funding?

This is the responsibility of governing if you control the House of Representatives. Over in the Senate, where Democrats have narrow control, they've been doing this. They have not only been passing appropriations bills, they've been doing it in a cooperative, bipartisan manner. That's what Kevin McCarthy should be doing in the House. Instead, of course, he's just been catering to the most extreme members of his caucus, really subservient to this dangerous far right wing of the Republican Party that's really controlling the debate.

That's not good bipartisanship work. Kevin McCarthy made a deal on government funding with the president of the United States several months ago, and he's reneged on that deal.

One of the last centrists in Congress, Feinstein was legendary for her willingness and ability to forge tough deals across the aisle. Her former Senate colleague from California, Barbara Boxer, joins us now. Senator, great to see you, as always. I got to speak to you yesterday on CNN Max as all of this was unfolding and we were remembering Senator Feinstein yesterday. But I did want to ask you, if you saw some of the news that came out this afternoon that former Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be accompanying Senator Feinstein on a military plane on her final journey home. I suppose that's how Senator Feinstein would have wanted it. BARBARA BOXER, (D), FORMER U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA: No question. No question. She had so much admiration for the speaker. I understand, also her daughter will be there. So, it's -- it's good. But I also know that she would have been -- she would have been so happy to see the House, the sensible members come together to keep the government going. Her last vote was essentially to do just that, and hours later, she passed. So, she knew, as she told us all, that the work has to get done. You don't shut government down. You argue about what the issues should be, and how would you resolve them, and you come to a compromise. Nobody gets everything they want. You never do. You never can. So --",

And Speaker McCarthy, good, he finally realized, he's going to haveall the blame for a shutdown. And having gone through those shutdowns, they are painful. But you asked me when the attitude started to change. And remember -- well, you wouldn't remember, but I remember. I got elected to the House in 1982 during the Reagan administration. Tip O'Neil and Ronald Reagan didn't agree on a thing, they loved each other. And there was a different spirit across the aisle. When you could find agreement, you would move forward. And then, Newt Gingrich came into the game. I wrote my memoir and I wrote about that, changed everything. His whole attitude was that Democrats, we have to paint them as unpatriotic and treasonous and baby killers and all these crazy things. And he was so extreme and he tried to paint us as being extreme, and all the goodwill, you know, left. I'll never forget, we had a big battle over shutting down the government over regulation. He wanted no health and safety regulation. And the women -- there were hardly any women then, 25 or so of us. He wanted to do away with regulations with mammograms and all kinds of things. And we won that battle, but it got ugly after that, slowly but surely. And again, bringing it back to my dear colleague, she had none of that. When we got elected, we didn't always agree. We came from different parts of the party. She was more to the center and I was more liberal. And we knew from time to time we wouldn't agree, but we always said we'd have each other's back and we would care about each other and we wouldn't do anything that the other one didn't know about. And that's the way I grew up in politics. Your word was your bond, and this wasn't personal. It was about the people, and what we need to do to make life better.
