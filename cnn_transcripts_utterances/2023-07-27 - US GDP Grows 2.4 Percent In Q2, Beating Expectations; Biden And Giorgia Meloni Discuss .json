I think there are few people who predicted or could havepredicted a little over a year ago that when the Fed raised interest rates, that unemployment would not budge. And in fact, unemployment is at 3.6 percent. It's exactly where it was when the Fed started hiking rates. I draw that number out, because that is one of the key indicators people were looking at for signs of a recession. And not only has unemployment, of course, bested those expectations, GDP, as we saw today has hiring growth. Even, you know, you mentioned that inflation is higher than people are comfortable with, certainly higher than the Fed is comfortable with, but even that has come down quite a bit. So yes, we've been pleasantly surprised by this run of better than expected numbers and I don't know that it will continue, but I sure hope it does.",

Thank you.The steady growth of its layoffs and other signs of trouble has some analysts suggesting the US is in a rolling recession. It is the idea that some sectors might shrink as others regain their footing. For instance, US housing sales fell quickly and fell last year as the Fed started raising rates, and that was followed by a slowdown in manufacturing, and then the tech downturn. But in this idea of a rolling recession of different sectors, industries like travel have barreled along, and that's helped pull things up in a different direction.

That idea is that wages aren't necessarily reflecting or growth in wages reflect change the unemployment rate. But those earlier calculations were for a much less competitive market than we have today, and for some time, the linkage between unemployment wages and inflation hasn't been anywhere near what it has been in the past, much looser reaction. But I think you've put your finger on what's new this time and that's the pandemic that initially created a shutdown, that restricted supply on the service sector and focus demand in the goods sector, produced bottlenecks that shot up inflation in the goods sector that is now going away.

You know, back when she was elected to that position, President Biden not only greeted her election with caution, but also with a warning effectively. He was talking at a pair of fundraisers a few days apart, where he talked about the fact he was talking about democracies, and we all know that Joe Biden talks about the importance of democracy in the world, and his big vision of democracy versus autocracy and in that context, he said, you saw what has just happened in Italy in that election, talking about the ascendance of this far-right politician to the Prime Minister's Office in Italy. But since then, a lot has changed. Not only has Meloni perhaps moderated a bit in her time as prime minister, but you've also seen in particular in what matters most of the Biden administration is the fact that Meloni has been a really stalwart supporter of Ukraine and in continuing to kind of hold the line alongside other members of the NATO Alliance in term providing funding and support for Ukraine's war effort to push back on this Russian invasion and since then, the White House's national security spokesman, John Kirby, he has said that the two leaders have enjoyed a really strong working relationship. So Ukraine is certainly going to be a key topic on the agenda today and also the fact that next year, Italy ascends the presidency of the G7 and so that's also an important mile marker there, too.",

But the ace up Prigozhin's sleeve all along, remembering that he wasunderstood to be in some sort of exile to Belarus, because of his failed effort to push the defense chiefs in Russia out and also essentially threaten Putin's power. Putin said there'll be severe consequences. All of that that we know about, yet here's Prigozhin, the same city as Putin, meeting with one of the delegates to that conference that Putin is holding. Why? Look, I think it's because Prigozhin is intertwined with the Kremlin's activities in some African countries -- Mali, Sudan -- with the Wagner mercenary deals. Prigozhin set those deals up. So the leaders in those countries get security and the Russians get things like gold, diamonds, minerals. So he's got his hands inside those deals. So it's not so easy for Putin to cut him out of that sector of his business empire, as it has been apparently to cut him out of the fight in Ukraine.",

Before I go there, let's have a look at today's Call to Earth, where we meet an animal once nearly lost to Mongolia, that could help protect the country's biodiversity. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over):  On the vast Mongolian steppe, there are predators, there are prey and there are protectors. For centuries, Bankhar dogs guarded herd animals from wolves, eagles and other dangers here. Communist campaigns against traditional herding lifestyles in the 19th century almost wiped the dogs out. But the Mongolian Bankhar Dog Project is helping their numbers to return and protect biodiversity in the process. At a center in central Mongolia, 100 kilometers from the capital, Batbaatar Tumurbaatar and his team research and breed the Bankhars. After getting a trained Bankhar, some herders tell him that livestock losses of around 60 are now down to zero. This stops them from hunting predators, which are often endangered species themselves.",
