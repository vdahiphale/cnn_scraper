      "sentences": "Welcome to THE WHOLE STORY. I'm Anderson Cooper.Last week, former President Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court to take up the issue of presidential immunity, further delaying his federal criminal trial related to the 2020 election and the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Now the claim was already heard and rejected by a federal appeals court. It's now up to the highest court to decide to take the case or to let the ruling stand and clear the way for this trial to begin. Now the timing is crucial because the former president is likely to become the Republican nominee. And he wants to delay the trial until after voters head to the polls in November. He's charged with four counts of obstruction and conspiracy. But what exactly is he accused of doing to subvert the election? And is it his actions that matter or his intent? Over the next hour, CNN anchor and chief legal analyst, Laura Coates, will lay out the facts of the federal indictment, most of which are undisputed by the former president and his attorneys, and examine the strengths and the weaknesses of the case against him.
