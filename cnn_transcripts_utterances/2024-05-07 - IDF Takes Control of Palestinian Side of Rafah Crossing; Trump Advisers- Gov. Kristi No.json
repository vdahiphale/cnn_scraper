      "sentences": "This morning, the Rafah crossing on the Gaza side is now in Israeli military hands. Overnight IDF troops captured the critical entry point taking it out of Palestinian control. Airstrikes this morning are coming fast and furious which is inflaming tensions as ceasefire negotiations resume today.With me now a CNN Military Analyst retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. So nice to -- to speak to you this morning. Thank you for being here. Let's just take a look at kind of what Rafah looks like right now. This is where across Rafah there's eastern Rafah which they told people to evacuate from. More than a million people who have been in Rafah sheltering trying to get out of the way of danger. How does -- how does Israel maneuver this incursion here and avoid killing scores of innocent Palestinians? You look at just the denseness of the situation there with so many people in harm's way potentially. LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING, (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's very challenging, Sara. What we're talking about right now are two brigades of the Israeli Defense Forces, the Givati Brigade and the -- what they call the 401st Iron Tracks Brigade. Those are both brigades with -- with Merkava tanks, mechanized vehicles, artillery pieces. But this is a limited counter-insurgency operation in east Rafah and it is really tough combat in the cities. That's why they dropped the leaflet yesterday saying to all the Palestinian or the Gazan residents that were in east Rafah to get out of there, to go to the Al-Mawasi camps and to western Rafah. They found a lot of intelligence. The Israeli Defense Forces found a lot of intelligence of significant number of Hamas terrorists in east Rafah. So far during the operations, my reports early this morning say that they've uncovered multiple shafts into the tunnel complexes. They had mortar firing positions, specifically the ones that fired on the Rafah crossing point -- uh, excuse me from Rafah to the Kerem Shalom crossing point the other day. They killed four Israeli soldiers. So the intelligence is what's driving the operations. But as you see the films that are showing right now with tanks and armored personnel carriers going through a lot of the areas with housing and construction, it's very difficult. As an armor guy, I'll tell you it's tough to conduct combat in the cities like that because you don't know where the enemy is, where the sniper positions are, where you're going to be fired on.",

Putin won 87% of the vote in the country's March presidential election, according to the country's election commission. An election victory that was seen really by the world is a foregone conclusion, with most of his political opponents either dead, jailed, exiled or barred from running. The Russian president faced no credible challenge and is now the country's longest serving leader since Joseph Stalin. Putin will now rule until at least 2030.The Phi Delta Theta fraternity has revoked the membership of one person following the confrontation between pro-Palestinian protesters and a large group of counter protesters at Ole Miss. Videos of the heated exchange and incident, it went viral last week. One clip, especially showing a group of mostly white students yelling at a black student who was part of the pro-Palestinian protests. And also in the video people seen making what appeared to be racist gestures at her. And in a statement, the fraternity said this. \"After reviewing the incident, it was determined that the individual's behavior was unacceptable. The action in question was offensive outside the bounds of this discourse and contradictory to our values.\" Now, the fraternity has not identified who that person was that was removed and CNN has also not been not been able to identify any of the counter protesters in the video. House Speaker Mike Johnson still holding on to his job today. He is expected to meet with Republican congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been threatening for weeks to force a vote to oust him. The two met yesterday meeting again today. This is as frustrations continue growing within Republican ranks in the House, especially mostly against what Green is trying to do here, not against what Johnson's been doing. Marjorie Taylor Greene continues to point to the speaker's move to allow a vote on foreign aid for Ukraine and Israel that had bipartisan support as a source of her main frustration. House Democrats have made clear they will help save Johnson's job if it comes to that, which is rare to say the least. Sara?",

This is a wide-open race.Yes, I would say if I was, you know, putting my thumb on the scale, it would either be Tim Scott or Doug Burgum.

So when you look at, you know, the governor, when you look at Senator Tim Scott, they're certainly in a strong position, A, to bring value to the campaign, whether it's economic value or whether it's votes. But they also do the most important thing. They don't outshine President Trump.

He wants somebody who's going to go out and defend even the most outrageous, egregious and sometimes even potentially criminal things that Donald Trump says.So, you know, no matter who he picks out of this field, you're going to have somebody who is going to be out of step with where most voters are on abortion.

And Georgia is a swing state today. And what we're seeing is President Trump has a significant lead in Georgia, in spite of Geoff Duncan's, you know, op-ed or his feelings.
