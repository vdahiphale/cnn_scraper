This as the U.K. defense ministry says the city of Bakhmut is under increasingly severe pressure, as Russian forces advance in the city. Russian forces continue to attempt to surround Bakhmut. The Ukrainian army reports intense fighting taking place in and around the eastern city. Officials believe more than 4,000 civilians are trapped by the fighting. Meanwhile, to the north, Ukrainian officials say constant Russian shelling has forced mandatory evacuations in the eastern of Kupyansk. People with limited mobility, disabilities and children are being told to get out now. Ukrainian troops liberated the city in September but the fighting remains close by at the front lines, some 12 miles or 20 kilometers from the city. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins me now.

I want to take a look at the video, showing, of course, Russia's defense minister there, visiting the front lines, visiting troops, visiting what they described as forward positions for Moscow's forces in the area.You can also see him handing out medals to some of those troops in serving damaged buildings. He gave a short statement there, saying, the hard work continues -- I'm paraphrasing there. But those were his words. A very rare visit from a top Kremlin official. As more fears, more concerns, grow, that Bakhmut may soon fall to Russian troops, you updated our viewers there, on the latest on the battlefield. But just to expand on that, Bakhmut is a city that has been pummeled by Russian troops for months. Much of it has been damaged and destroyed. A large portion of its population has fled the city. It's only about 4,500 civilians, a few of them children, dozens of children as well, among those civilians still trapped inside. There is one key supply route, one vital supply route that has been blown up. It was a bridge that has been blown up by Russian forces just about in the last day. That means, again, that small group of civilians and those troops inside are now cut off, largely, from humanitarian aid and more weapons. Russian forces, to be more exact, Wagner troops, the head of the Wagner forces, said they were able to surround the city of Bakhmut. Ukrainian troops say that's absolutely not true. So far, they are still holding the line of resistance. But President Zelenskyy himself admits, this is an extremely difficult battle for his troops on the ground. Officials saying, Ukrainian officials saying, they're willing to strategically withdraw from the city if necessary. Look, this would be a symbolic victory for President Putin, who has seen very few gains on the ground in the last few months. This would be an opportunity for the Kremlin to say we need a win, particularly because it's in the Donbas region, a region that President Putin has illegally annexed, despite not having full control of it on the ground. Beyond the symbolism of that win, again, a win that comes at a very high cost for Russia, thousands of troops potentially that have been lost there, a majorly depleted Russian arsenal, it's mostly a symbolic and not a strategic win. For President Zelenskyy, it's the same. He absolutely does not want to back down from any Ukrainian land, whether or not it is geopolitically strategic. That was his vow to his countrymen, that no drop of blood will be lost in vain. So you're going to see both sides here, really digging in their heels. Again, there are major concerns that Russia is preparing to really step into Bakhmut and that Ukrainian forces simply can't hold the line much longer. Kim.",

It reports that in 2021, the latest available annual figures, there were more than 2,700 anti-Semitic incidents. That's an increase of more than a third from the year before. Their research also includes a rare detail about the particular nature of anti-Semitism, how it centers on stereotypes of Jews.

If you go to anti-Black for instance, anti-Black and anti- socialist. So these fears and stereotypes are tied together.
