Right now, there are approximately 20 known documents with classified markings that have been uncovered at two different locations connected to the President.The first is his former office here in D.C. We know 10 documents have been uncovered there. And they include top secret information. Now the rest of the material has been uncovered at his Wilmington home. And there was one document that they thought just consisted of a single page. And then they realized late last week that it was actually six pages consisting of multiple documents. And John, I'm sure a lot of people asking, OK, well, is this it? And I can tell you definitively, we have no idea, because we still know from our sources that not every possible location has been searched. The U.S. attorney when he was conducting this initial review, he didn't do any searches, he allowed the Biden team to do that. It's taken quite a long time to only search locations where they know documents were shipped during the transition. And now there are other spots, though that could be searched. And it remains to be seen whether the Biden team will do any of those searches, or if that will be passed off to the Special Counsel and the FBI. Also unclear right now, John, if we will be alerted to any additional classified material that is uncovered.",

And then followed by begrudging confirming statements from the President's lawyers. And they took a lot of heat for that.Now, the White House argued they wanted to defer to the Justice Department, let the process play out. But it was interesting over the weekend, they got out in front of this, they disclosed these additional five pages, but they said effectively don't get used to this. They said going forward, they want to now defer to the Special Counsel and that ongoing investigation. They emphasize they are cooperating, but as of right now, John, it's not clear if they are going to update us if additional classified material is found. And that's how potentially this could continue to balloon into even a bigger political problem.

And part of his reasoning is that he says the Biden administration has not been fully transparent throughout this process, noting that the administration did not reveal the discovery of these documents shortly before the November election. Here's a little bit more of what Comer had to say with our Jake Tapper yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES COMER (R), CHAIRMAN, OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: We want to know the visitor logs to the residents. We want to know who had access to the Biden center for diplomacy because this is the same type of investigation that the Democrats were so outraged and launched and demanded happened to President Trump. The administration hasn't been transparent about what's going on with President Biden's possession of classified documents, and we just won't equal treatment here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And Paula's answer to that was, we just don't know. There's still could be more documents out there in Biden world. How much of a problem is that? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, look, I mean, obviously, this is not something that the White House wanted to be dealing with right now, right, as President Biden's approval ratings were just starting to improve earlier this year. And he was feeling pretty emboldened after the midterms went better than Democrats expected. And, of course, when you're sitting president, you don't want to necessarily have to look at the fact that you're being investigated by a Special Counsel. But Paula was right, we don't know how many documents are left out there. The White House clearly was trying to get ahead of it this weekend with President Biden's personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, who used to be the White House Counsel, under President Obama has now taken that over and he tried to put out a more full timeline to the press this weekend.

How did they get there? Why were they still in the Vice President's belongings, the former vice president's belongings, and trying to understand the backstory.

Those questions, if they have volunteered all that, they might have nipped this in the bud. But for reasons we don't know, at this point, they were slow. They were -- you know, national security information is delicate.

And, you know, standing here you can up close, you can really see that the structure was just absolutely flattened all the way to the ground, all the way to the ground floor.And you can still see the rescue crews that you were just talking about. They are indeed still sort of sifting through the buildings still, of course, hoping to maybe find people who might be buried somewhere, trapped somewhere. But, you know, John, I spoke to the local mayor here a couple of minutes ago, and he was telling me, yes, this is still a search and rescue operation. But they do understand that the chances of finding anybody alive underneath that are very slim. And, of course, throughout the course of the day, we have seen the death toll really jump from from about 30 early this morning to 40. Now and, of course, the rescue crews here, they do fear that there could be more people who lie dead underneath that rubble, but an absolute scene of devastation. You know, we have seen some really tragic things play out throughout the course of the day. We were at the funeral of a 15-year-old girl earlier today. And there were just a lot of her classmates, a lot of her teachers who were also there who are an absolute grief and agony. A lot of them cursing the Russians. And, you know, you mentioned that the Kremlin has said that the Russians deny being behind all this thing. They don't target civilian areas. But the Ukrainians do say that they are certain that the missile that hit this building was that Kh-22 cruise missile. And, you know, we have to tell our viewers that that missile is one that was designed to destroy aircraft carriers. And, obviously, if a missile like that hits a residential building like this, it leads to the kind of destruction that you're seeing behind me right now. The other thing about that missiles, it's also one that was developed in the time of the Soviet Union, is known to be very inaccurate. The sort of margin of error with that rocket is about 500 yards that it could miss its target. And the mayor told me, there are some power plants here, some critical infrastructure in the vicinity of this area, but certainly no military installations whatsoever. The Ukrainians, obviously, extremely angry. One of the things an official told me is they say this once again shows that they need more modern air defenses. Of course, we know that Ukrainians are currently learning to use those U.S. patriots missile defense systems, anti-aircraft systems, and they say that's certainly something that is needed and could possibly help them to defend against strikes like the one that we saw here.",

Colonel, thank you so much for being with us. First, is it reasonable to think that Patriot missiles or enhanced air defense may have protected that building from this attack? COL. MARK CANCIAN (RET.), SENIOR ADVISER, CSIS INTERNATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAM: Well, in theory, that would certainly be possible. The problem is that just aren't enough air defense assets to go around. Keep in mind, the United States has committed to sending one Patriot battery to Ukraine that will defend one city. The Germans have committed to another battery. That means that they could defend two cities, probably Kyiv and maybe Kharkiv. It's unlikely that Dnipro city would come under that umbrella. The problem with that great offense in general is that NATO got rid of most of its ground-based air defense. So there just isn't a lot of inventory to provide to the Ukrainians.",
