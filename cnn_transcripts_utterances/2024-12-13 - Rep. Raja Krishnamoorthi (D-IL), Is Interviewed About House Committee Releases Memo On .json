      "sentences": "For the first time, the former commandant of the Coast Guard who covered up a damning report about sexual assaults at the Coast Guard Academy, is talking publicly about why he did it. I -- I want to note to everyone we've been asking for months and months to interview this man right here, Karl Schultz, who led the Coast Guard until 2022 about why he buried an inter -- internal investigation known as Operation Fouled Anchor. Now he is speaking out.And just for -- for our viewers, that report is a secret investigation which was revealed by CNN and it showed dozens of rapes and other sexual abuse allegations that have been mishandled by the Coast Guard. Instead of releasing that report to the public years ago and to Congress, Schultz made the decision to conceal it. But he now tells CNN in an exclusive interview off camera after a damning report released by Congress that he did so to protect victims and that he still stands by his decision that he would do it again the same way if he could do it all over again. Now, when CNN first reported on Operation Fouled Anchor last year, it sent shockwaves through the military. Dozens of credible allegations of rape were treated as minor misconduct by Coast Guard command. The assaults were covered up. Perpetrators only received minor punishment, like extra homework. Victims came forward to talk to CNN and testify before Congress and told stories about their lives being derailed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "You know, I often find myself wondering what my -- my future would have been like. Time and time again, the academy and the institution, the -- the policies that are in place don't protect their -- their people. And this is supposed to be a lifesaving service. But in reality it -- it took my life away from me. So it did -- it did nothing to save me when I was asking for help. And it's devastating.(END VIDEO CLIP) BROWN: Multiple congressional committees and the Coast Guard investigated the cover up. And today the House Oversight Committee released a highly critical memo detailing an interview they had with Schultz. The memo says Schultz, quote, personally made the decision to withhold Operation Fouled Anchor from Congress. Schultz stated that was a decision by me. I own that exclusively. And that Schultz acknowledged he missed an opportunity for transparency and wished he could have a, quote, mulligan. But Schultz tells CNN in this interview, the committee took his comments out of context. He said he knew if he had presented the findings to Congress, lawmakers would have seen it as a political opportunity. Schultz telling CNN, quote, I knew they would see it as here's the scandal and that they would blow it up. And he feared the push for more information would eventually reveal the identities of the victims. He said the Mulligan comment wasn't about the overall investigation, but that he was second guessing whether he should have picked up the phone and called the victims. Schultz also said he did not believe he was under any legal obligation to share the findings with Congress. So let's get a reaction from a member of the Oversight Committee, Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. He is on both the House Oversight and Intelligence Committees. Great to have you on. So again, Schultz hasn't spoken before now, despite us asking him for months and months to give us his side of the story. Now because the committee, it appears, released this report detailing what he allegedly told the committee, he now is speaking out to CNN trying to defend himself and why he withheld this damning report from Congress saying he would do it all over again if he had the chance. Your reaction? REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): That's ridiculous. And I think that his reason for withholding that -- that report, I would say concealing that report from Congress is equally absurd. He said he was trying to protect the victims of the persistent harassment and the rapes in the Coast Guard Academy. I think he was trying to protect the perpetrators. That's what he was trying to do. He was trying to basically prevent them from facing accountability. And I think he himself needs to be held accountable.",

I think there's just too many unanswered questions.And as you can tell, many, many more victims and survivors of the harassment are coming forward. They are actually suing the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard has an opportunity to respond. I hope they don't do so in a defensive way. I hope they actually settle these claims and don't put the victims through any more hardship than they've already gone through.",

What we have is definitely the possibility that there is something that has not been reported fully in terms of notifications to the FAA or -- or something like that. That's -- that's a possibility. It's a possibility that somebody is using drones or a company is using drones to test out a particular delivery mechanism, for example FedEx or DHL or a company like that. Or it could be where at least some of these objects that are sighted are ones that, you know, perhaps are questionable in terms of what they're actually doing there. And it could be -- there -- there is certainly the possibility that drones can be used for espionage purposes, that drones can be used, in essence, to map out the critical infrastructure of a particular locality. So this is definitely something that should be looked at and shouldn't be dismissed because it's, you know, relatively easy for somebody to do this.

So it's, you know, sometimes you can be technically correct, but wrong in terms of the big picture.
