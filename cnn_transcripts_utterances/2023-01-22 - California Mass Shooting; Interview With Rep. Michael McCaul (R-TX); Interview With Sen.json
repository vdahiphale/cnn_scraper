So, we will step aside if they begin speaking.But we are at a roadblock here a couple blocks away from the business where this happened. What police have told us so far is that, last night at 10:22 p.m., they were called to shots fired at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio on Garvey Street, where there were lunar new year festivities going on. They arrived at the scene to find people, including victims, in the parking lot of the business. They said, when police went inside, they found additional gunshot victims. There were 10 people pronounced dead on the scene and at least an additional 10 people taken it to local hospitals. Right now, there is very little information about the suspect, who left the scene. Police are asking people to share information if they have any. To give you some context about this, there was supposed to be a city of Monterey Park lunar new year festival that would have closed these streets off as well yesterday during the day and today. But this seems to have been festivities taking place in a business that was off on one of the side streets not the city's official festival. But just imagine. There were supposed to be many, many people here celebrating during the most joyous time of the year for this community. On the Monterey Park city Web site, it shows that this community is 65 percent Asian. They said this festival that they hold every year typically has brought in 100,000 people per day to these streets to celebrate. But, again, this incident seems to have happened in a business, in a dance studio late at night off on one of the side streets a couple blocks away from where we are, just many of the hundreds of celebrations, private and public, happening throughout the metro region this weekend. And it's just incredible that so many people are now in mourning, when this should have been a moment of celebrating a new year, Dana.",

And every city is now dealing with this now. So this is not just about a particular investigation. Mayors and police departments are inevitably assessing their sort of security strategy this morning. There's lots of events throughout the country. And because we live in a time with increased hate crimes towards the Asian community, there will be a focus on that.

They thought he was the carrying what we refer to as a long gun, so a rifle, something larger than a pistol, also described that he was able to quickly reload the weapon in the middle of the shooting, which leads you to believe that it's likely a semiautomatic firing weapon with a replaceable magazine. If that's the case, you probably have spent bullet casings on scene. Those are expelled from the weapon as you shoot. And so that's a piece of forensic evidence. But that is a long way from actually identifying the shooter. I'm sure all that stuff is being collected and looked -- reviewed for potential fingerprints and other identifying data.

And, while we are waiting, I want to turn to the new classified documents that the FBI found at the president's house in Delaware. It was a 13-hour search. That happened on Friday. It's just the latest revelation of the president having classified items that he shouldn't have. You have been in Congress for 40 years.

I mean, that's how carefully we review these documents. To think that any of them ended up in boxes in storage one place or the other is just unacceptable. But, having said that, let me make this point clear. Joe Biden has said from the start:  We are going to be totally transparent about this. Let the chips fall where they may. I'm going to open my home voluntarily to a search, not the first search, I'm sure, of his offices and home. He has shown total cooperation in this effort.

Contrast that with Joe Biden. Embarrassed by the situation, as he should have been, he invited the government agencies in to carefully look through all the boxes he had accumulated.

Almost 25 percent of all of the national debt accumulated over the history of the United States, 230 years, was accumulated during the four years of Donald Trump. So, the notion that there is some partisan holy position that they're taking and that they're going to fight this battle of the matter of principle, when they enacted tax cuts for the wealthiest people of America during the Trump administration, they added dramatically to the national debt which we are now facing. Having done that, they need to face the responsibility of paying for it. That is what the debt limit is about. And if we play games with this, if we delay this, if we have short-term extensions of the national debt, we run the very risk of a recession in this economy, millions of Americans out of work and interest rates going even higher, denying people an opportunity to buy a home or a car.

Because we know, with the new general Putin put in place, they're going to start a major offensive on the eastern flank in the Donbass. And we know that's going to happen. The tanks can help stop that. Germany will not put one tank in. Remember Germany, Nord Stream 2 pipeline? They won't put one tank in until we give them reassurances we're going to put our Abrams in. If we did that publicly, that would unleash so many Leopard tanks, because there are 10 other nations that are looking for Germany to sign off on the tanks that they have given them.
