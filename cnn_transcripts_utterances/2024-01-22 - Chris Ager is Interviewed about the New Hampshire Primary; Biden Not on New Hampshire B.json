General Don Bolduc was up by 10 percentage points in all the polls, except for one outlier. He only won by less than 1 percent. So, you never know what the electorate's going to do.

They are loud and proud. And so I don't think they're understandable. Some of Nikki Haley supporters, you know, potentially could be. So, you know, that's how - how the dynamics change in the polling and you get these big double-digit swings is because people really don't like necessarily to share who they're going to vote for.

And so we've also seen where, at the top of the ticket, all the Democrats have won. Congress, Senate, president. But statewide, we're the only state north of Georgia, along the East Coast, that is solid Republican at the statehouse. And we just won a Manchester City race and the aldermanic (ph) race. So, the largest city is the three northern New England states is solid Republican. So, there's a lot of good indicators for us that it's going to be a good Republican year, whether we win at the top of the ticket or not, down ticket, we're going to do just fine in New Hampshire.

New Hampshire, their state law says, no, we go first, and they did not give into the DNC here. They scheduled their primary early. But for the president, he says, I have to abide by the rules, which means I'm not going to run in this primary, which means his name is now on the ballot.So, there's not a really -- a competitive race. I mean if you look at the polling, you've got Dean Phillips, Maryanne Williamson down around 10 percent a piece.

They pass Tom Brady and Ron Gronkowski for the most by a QB/receiver combo in playoff history. And watch Kelce throw up the heart hands. Taylor Swift's up there somewhere. There she is. And so is her brother, who's everyone's spirit animal. Shirt is off, but still looks like he has a sweater on. Josh Allen and the Bills, they jabbed right back. Allen scoring one of his three total touchdowns on the night. Back and forth this game went. Six lead changes in all. But the Bills dropped several opportunities on their final drive, including this perfect pass to Stefon Diggs. And then, with over a minute to go, kicker Tyler Bass, wide right on the chance to tie it. Chiefs win 27-24. They advance to the AFC championship game. For the six straight season they'll face the Ravens. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
