      "sentences": "Tension between the U.S. and Israel over the war with Hamas. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.On Friday, the Biden administration said that it is reasonable to assess that U.S. weapons have been used by Israeli forces in Gaza in ways that are, quote, \"Inconsistent with international humanitarian law.\" But they stopped short of officially saying that Israel violated that law. The report drafted by the State Department said investigations are ongoing but that the U.S. does not have complete information. This followed Israel's security cabinet approval of an expansion of the area of operation of the shelling in Rafah after President Joe Biden threatened to withhold U.S. weapons if Israel were to carry out an all-out offensive in that city. The increased military operation and Rafah has put ceasefire for hostage talks on pause to U.S. officials told CNN. All of this follows a turning point in U.S.-Israel relations this week when President Biden's previously unwavering public support began to waver. The highly visible pro-Palestinian campus protests have been threatening to splinter Biden's fragile Democratic coalition. In a sit down interview with CNN's Erin Burnett, Biden threatened to halt some weapons shipments the first significant conditioning of U.S. military aid to Israel since the start of the war. But Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that to avenge Hamas's October 7 terror attacks, quote, \"If we need to stand alone, we will stand alone. I have said that if necessary, we will fight with our fingernails.\" Joining me now to discuss is Thomas L. Friedman. He's a three time Pulitzer Prize winning columnist for \"The New York Times\" where his latest piece just out is titled \"Biden's Real Mistake in Pausing Military Aid to Israel.\" And his many bestsellers include the National Book Award winner \"From Beirut to Jerusalem,\" which has a new audio forward. Tom, always great when you're here. What will be the impact of this State Department report that said, Israel most likely failed to protect civilians in Gaza, but did not find specific instances? THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, COLUMNIST, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": Gosh, Michael, I don't think it's going to have much impact whatsoever. I think what matters is what's happening on the ground right now, particularly in and around Rafah. And around the limited embargo that President Biden has imposed on Israel to drive home the point that if it's going to go into Rafa, it has to do so in a way that simply does not cause mass civilian casualties as its entrance into Gaza City and Khan Yunis (ph).",

How should President Biden be using his leverage with Netanyahu? FRIEDMANA Palestinian partner for you is key, first of all, to be able to say to the world, we are going to remove Hamas, but we're going to replace it with a legitimate decent Palestinian government. It's the key to having a regional lines that you need against Iran, because Israel's moderate Arab partners are not going to sign on to protect Israel, if it's perceived as trying to destroy the Palestinian people and not just Hamas. If Israel had a partner with a PA, that would make it much easier for UAE, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia to partner with Israel against Iran. Its Palestinian partner, stupid. It's the keystone to everything. If Israel does not have that, Michael, it has no exit strategy for Gaza. It has no way of building a regional alliance against Iran.

Netanyahu government is refusing to do that. So the administration while tying up the Saudi deal is now trying to figure out do they take the more limited deal to Congress and try to get it through where they promised from Saudi Arabia that it would normalize with Israel if and when an Israeli government came along, ready to do that?Or does this just, you know, scotch the whole deal?

And if you're not talking about a two state solution but you're talking about a Palestinian state from the river to the sea, you're not morally serious. OK?There's only one solution here. And that is two states for two indigenous people between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean. And if you're not for that, if you're not for ending the violence, and for a hostage release, if you're only condemning one side and not the other, you're not morally serious.

Adult film actress Stormy Daniels spent two days on the witness stand testifying and then being cross examined about her 2006 encounter with Donald Trump that led to the hush money payments just before the 2016 election. After the defense repeatedly tried to cast doubt on Daniels' story, character and motivation, she provocatively tweeted, \"Real men respond to testimony by being sworn in and taking the stand in court. Oh, wait. Nevermind.\"Trump's legal team tried to get Judge Juan Merchan to modify his gag order so that Trump could respond but the motion was denied. The jury finally saw a chart of those 34 business records that prosecutors allege were falsified, 11 invoices, 12 vouchers, 11 checks, which is why the indictment has 34 accounts. The prosecution despite saying that they would need six weeks to present their case now say they could wrap up next week, which will be the fourth week of testimony. So what's left, former Trump Attorney Michael Cohen. Joining me now is CNN Senior Legal Analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig. Elie, OK, I'm convinced. They convinced me, he wore the silk pajamas and he was not wearing something else that perhaps he should have been wearing. But having sex with an adult film star that's not illegal, nor is paying her for her silence. So, where are we on the important matter of Trump's intent?",

And the person who is going to need to get them all the way there as Michael Cohen.And here's what I mean. I think it's quite clear, based on the evidence we've seen so far, A, that stormy Daniels was paid $130,000 hush money. No question. B, that Donald Trump was aware of that. C, that Donald Trump knew he was reimbursing Michael Cohen over the subsequent months. But what you have to show is that Donald Trump was in on a plan to falsify business records. Let's set this up. Let's structure the internal accounting on this to hide it to make it look like legal fees as opposed to a hush money payment, that's where the prosecution hasn't quite driven at home.

Your denial puts the jury in a position of having to choose who they believe, Donald Trump who denies there was an encounter or Stormy Daniels who claims that there was.

I do think they needed to call Stormy Daniels not as a technical matter, but as a human matter, as explaining the case to the jury. I think it would have been really conspicuous if they had not called Stormy Daniels.Now, when they got too deep, I think into the salacious details of the sex, and the judge did sustain several objections from Trump's team about the details, I guess the upside is the more details that Stormy Daniels gives tends to make her more credible, right? If she just said, well, I had sex with them in a hotel room in 2006, and that's it, that's not all that credible. But if she says, oh, I remember the magazine he was holding, I remember the pajamas, you tend to believe it more. The downside for prosecutors though, is you get away from the ball, you get away from the ballgame here, which is falsification of business records. And the more time you spend in silk pajamas in that hotel room, the more the jury may be wondering, wait a second, the charge here is accounting, essentially. So, why are we spending so much time in detail in this hotel room? It's a tough call for prosecutors. I think they were right to call Stormy Daniels but I think they went too far into the nuances of it.",

I think I coined the term this week, pre-corroborating Michael Cohen, a lot of what he's going to testify about. Not all of it, but a lot of it. They've already heard, they've already seen checks. They've seen handwriting on the internal accounting documents. They've heard from other witnesses. And so a lot of what they're going to hear from Michael Cohen and prosecutors will argue just this in closing, they're going to say, folks, you don't need to take Michael Cohen at his word, because virtually everything he says is backed up.
