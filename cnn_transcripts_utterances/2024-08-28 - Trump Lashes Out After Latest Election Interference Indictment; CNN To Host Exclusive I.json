He, of course, is trying to turn it to his advantage in this upcoming election after special counsel Jack Smith unsealed the charges in D.C. on Tuesday. Trump's campaign fired off this email telling supporters, \"How many times do I have to go through this\" before asking for donations. Trump also lashed out on social media. He posted several paragraphs about the charges and declared the case a \"persecution of a political opponent.\" And in a new interview with Dr. Phil, Trump complained about his legal woes, baselessly blaming President Biden and Vice President Harris for them, and then discussing the assassination attempt on his life. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  When this happened people would ask whose fault is it? I think to a certain extent it's Biden's fault and Harris' fault. And I'm the opponent. Look, they were weaponizing government against me. They brought in the whole DOJ to try and get me. They weren't too interested in my health and safety. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And when it comes to lowering taxes, how exactly do you do that without blowing up the national deficit?And so all these questions are in the -- in the front of mind of many voters and it's something that the Trump campaign is going to hit really hard on.

They want to be invited to the same one as everybody else. They want to be included within the larger American story. They want to lean into their Americanness.\" Now, he says he thinks it's been one of the strengths of the Harris campaign, in part because in her first Latino-focused ad it didn't just run in Spanish; it also ran in English. And he called it \"an invitation to Latinos while not being othering or exclusionary of others.\" What do you think of how he frames this, and is this something that we should be thinking about as we look at how these campaigns are trying to reach Latinos?",
