      "sentences": "Straight from The Source tonight, I have new reporting on the aggressive race to staff a new Trump administration, and how Elon Musk is fitting into all of that. The world's richest man joined in when Donald Trump, the President-elect now, had his first official call with President Zelenskyy, and I'm learning that's not all. Also tonight, Nancy Pelosi is now openly pointing the finger at President Biden for her party's crushing defeat on Tuesday night, what she says would have been a better way. And Jack Smith is signaling the beginning of the end for his prosecutions of Donald Trump. But, does he plan to issue a public report, ala Robert Mueller? We'll ask our experts.I'm Kaitlan Collins, and this is The Source. Judging by the pace of the transition underway right now at Mar-a- Lago, the names for the top positions in a second Trump term could drop at any moment. Instead of staring at the Trump Tower elevator bank, like we were doing about this time in 2016, tonight, instead, we're keeping a close eye on the comings and goings at Trump's South Florida club, given who gets a job is often determined by the last influence that Trump heard from. One person who has been seen there constantly since Tuesday is not someone that we expect to take a formal job inside the administration, but it is someone who is expected to have a lot of influence. Tonight, I have new reporting that not only was Elon Musk on the President- elect's first call with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, he has also joined other key calls that Trump has had since he won Tuesday night. Musk has been present for conversations where Trump has been mulling over staff decisions, both of these instances showcasing how important Musk could be during the incoming administration. Now, sources have described Trump is enamored with Musk, which is really, if you listen to what he is saying publicly, something that he has made quite clear himself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL- ELECT: To me, every day is a good endorsement from Elon. Nobody is smarter than Elon. But, he is character. He is a special guy. He is a super genius. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "A super genius, and of course, that is someone who was on that call with Trump and Zelenskyy yesterday. We're told during that the Ukrainian leader was thanking Musk for providing the Starlink satellite communications on the Ukrainian battlefield. We are told that no policy was discussed during that conversation that Musk was a part of, though, of course, tonight, a major question how Trump is going to handle Russia's war in Ukraine is still a big one tonight.Now, all of this is coming as the North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum has also been seen at Mar-a-Lago this week. Trump and Burgum developed a close relationship on the campaign trail after Burgum was running against him and then dropped out of the race. And I'm hearing tonight that Burgum is under consideration for a role as energy czar. Now, it remains to be seen what exactly that profile looks like, or what that job would be, if Burgum does get it, but this comes as, we know, Trump wanted Burgum to be his energy secretary, something I'm told the North Dakota governor has maintained to the President-elect. He is not interested in it and more interested in other positions. Now, to top off this entire job search, and what we're learning tonight, New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who is a member of House leadership and one of Donald Trump's biggest defenders, of course, is also under consideration to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. A lot of moving parts tonight. My inside source is CNN's Political Analyst and Senior Political Correspondent for The New York Times, Maggie Haberman. And Maggie, what else have you been hearing from sources? Because you were reporting on this call with Zelenskyy that Musk was on. What are you hearing from people about how this went down? MAGGIE HABERMAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, &amp; SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NY TIMES: So, they were together. Zelenskyy apparently called Trump to congratulate him, and Trump, literally, at some point early on in this conversation, hands the phone to Elon Musk, and encourages Zelenskyy to talk to Musk. There is some discussion between Musk and Zelenskyy about the communications apparatus that Elon Musk's company, Starlink, is providing in Ukraine. We're not sure what other details were discussed. But, it's a little reminiscent, Kaitlan, of when Trump won in 2016 and he had his daughter Ivanka next to him when he was having foreign leader calls, and he would put her on the phone with people. In this case, it's the richest man in the world who has business with government, and it's slightly different, but it's pretty in keeping with Trump's character. COLLINS: Yeah. I just wonder how people are looking at this, because he is a major defense contractor, but -- and he does have a national security --",

I also think it's something of a dominance play. Musk has a relationship with Vladimir Putin. There has been a lot of reporting about that in The Wall Street Journal, and I don't think that that is completely out of Donald Trump's head when he is doing this. So yes, I mean, this call attracted a lot of attention for a variety of reasons.

He has been talking about transition with a number of people. He is going to have opinions on who should be in what jobs. And so, I do think that he will be influential.

She is the first female White House Chief of Staff. I think she was the first female Chief of Staff to Jacksonville Mayor previously. But -- so, she brings with her a certain core group, and that fills a number of roles. This then turns to now cabinet appointments and what that ends up looking like.There is, as you said, this jockeying. There are a lot of people who are trying to have influence on the process. There are a lot of wealthy people who are trying to be in Trump's ear, not just Elon Musk, members of Mar-a-Lago who he talks to, other donors who he talks to. There is the RFK component. There is Tulsi Gabbard, and what happens with her. There is J.D. Vance's group, and there are various groups that may have some overlap in some cases, but they are trying to influence appointments.

There is certainly a lot of behind-the-scenes maneuvering, some of it playing out pretty publicly.There are some campaigns on social media to try to knock off certain candidates like Mike Pompeo, for instance. There has been a lot of pushback on him rejoining the government as the Secretary of Defense.

The criticisms about Pompeo have been that he is supportive of aid to Ukraine, and this is the argument made on X. I'm not saying this necessarily comports with reality, but that he would favor an expansion of NATO, and that's what some of Trump's allies, who he has been listening to at various points in this campaign, are saying publicly.

Maybe there are these potential candidates who would rather have their prioritizing access to Trump, maybe being in the West Wing, having an office there over into the more traditional bureaucratic secretary position, where you're in a totally separate building than Donald Trump, and of course, access to him is everything.",

So, it's not a surprise that that's where he is still. I've also heard his name for Energy Secretary. The assumption of people around Trump is he'll take it if it's offered to him. I don't know if that's true. That is their assumption is that people don't generally turn down cabinet positions.However, there are a lot of people who are not putting their hands up to be in cabinet positions in this second Trump administration for a number of reasons. Either they have personal issues, they don't want to digest from their businesses, or even if they're not saying this out loud, they watched him fire people by tweet over and over and over last time, and a lot of people don't want to go through that and don't think it would help them for their future careers.",

They are not expected to take on formal roles, certainly not Ivanka Trump, TBD on Jared Kushner, though. Obviously he has a fund, and that would create problems there.

I, at the moment, anticipate that's the case.

So, there is that.It will look like other people have more authority, and it will, frankly, create clearer lanes, because the presence of these sort of super staffers who are also family members was very complicated for people working in the White House. However, I don't think that's going to change Donald Trump's habit of asking two people to serve in the same role, or at least perform the same functions. He likes, as you know, pitting people against each other and seeing them argue. We saw some of that toward the end of his campaign. Susie Wiles, the incoming Chief of Staff, is the only campaign official who has survived an attempted ouster. But, we will see what this looks like when he is back in government.",

That has been replaced by coastal elite Democrats, people who don't talk to the working person, but talk down to them like they're slope-headed rubes. And I think the American people on Tuesday sent a message that we are done with the virtue signaling and the identity politics and all of that put together.

Initially, in the first 24 hours after Tuesday's results kind of trickled out, I talked to a lot of Democrats close to the Vice President who privately questioned to me whether or not she should actually run again because of the results of the election and because of the fact that this is now her second national campaign that didn't end the way that she wanted to with her being at the top of the ticket. But, I think that that conversation has shifted, not just in thezeitgeist, but also in my private conversations with Democrats, one, because I think the conversation around the loss has changed. I think it's been more focused in the last 24 to 48 hours on Democrats' problem with addressing the issues that it has structurally, and I think a lot of the focus has been on what Biden's role in the election has been. And so, now I think that there has been a little bit of an opening of the -- or for the Vice President, among her allies, to see if she would want to rejoin or kind of recreate her political career, what that would look like. I talked to one official who said that maybe she would want to become Democratic governor of California. That could be a way for her to reclaim the spotlight, or potentially try to fill the vacuum that exists right now in the Democratic Party and become its leader. I talked to one aide the day of her concession speech on Wednesday at Howard University, and they told me, that doesn't sound like a politician that is ready to lay down. So, I think that there are a lot of options for the Vice President. The real question, though, is, one, has anyone actually talked to the Vice President about what her options are? And then, two, do Americans actually want to hear from her? Because really, one of the real questions or real problems of her campaign was whether or not she was able to articulate why she wanted to be Vice President, and I think that that question is going to follow her if she did run again.",

They involve a lot of money. They don't necessarily involve a lot of door knocking, but it is a lot of kind of a chattier word to mouth, or mouth to word, type of campaigns. And so, that's something that she is more understanding of potentially so she could run, and she obviously has a team in California, people that she has worked with before.But, again, I think that the question is, who is talking to the Vice President, and how does the Vice President feel going on?
