      "sentences": "I'm Kim Brunhuber at CNN in Atlanta. We're following breaking news this hour. It is 9 A.M. in Gaza, where Israel has resumed combat operations after a seven-day truce with Hamas expired. The Israeli military says Hamas violated the agreement by firing a rocket toward Israel, which was intercepted. More rockets were fired after the deadline passed, the IDF said. No injuries have been reported.The Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry in Gaza reports, Israeli aircraft in the skies over Gaza and military vehicles firing in the area. Sources tell CNN negotiations over hostages continued despite the resumption of fighting. Now the pause had been extended on Thursday when Hamas agreed to release additional hostages. Two women were freed earlier in the day following by a group of six people. Another 30 Palestinian women and children were released from Israeli prisons as part of the agreement with Hamas. Many had been only detained and were never officially charged. CNN's Scott McLean is following developments and joins us now from Istanbul. So, Scott, what more are we learning about how this truce ended and how the war is now restarting?",

      "sentences": "Hey, good morning, Kim. Yeah, we know that the Qataris who've been mediating these talks along with the Americans and the Egyptians who have been involved as well, had all been pushing for this truce to be extended for another day, but ultimately it is the Israelis and it is Hamas that needs to agree.As you mentioned, an hour before this truce was set to expire, Israel said that it intercepted a rocket launched from Gaza toward Israel. Whether that was Hamas or some other militant group is not clear, but it has obviously set off or helped to set off what we're seeing right now. The Israeli Defense Minister said yesterday that its troops would be ready for a quick transition back to fighting. Hamas had also told its militant forces to be ready for the fighting to resume. And now, as you said, Israel is now striking targets inside of Gaza, Rafah in the far south, Khan Younis in central Gaza have all been targets for military strikes from Israel, and we are already starting to see videos emerging from the damage from those strikes on the ground. We also have this statement from the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, Kim. It says, quote, Hamas violated the outline, did not live up to its duty to release all the kidnapped women today and launched rockets at the citizens of Israel. With the return of fighting, we will emphasize the Israeli government committed to achieving the goals of the war to release our hostages, eliminate Hamas, and ensure that Gaza will never again pose a threat to the residents of Israel. So, why was this truce not extended? It is not entirely clear, but yesterday Israel reluctantly agreed to accept only eight hostages rather than the expected 10, agreeing to include two Israeli-Russian citizens or Russian-Israeli citizens who had been released on Wednesday as part of Thursday's total. And perhaps Hamas is running out of women and children hostages it is willing or maybe even able to hand over. There are other militant groups inside Gaza that we understand are also holding some of those hostages. Now, Israel knows that once we get into male hostages and Israeli soldiers, that the price is going to be higher. We also heard yesterday from a member of the Israeli Knesset and a former Israeli ambassador to the U.N. who said that, look, Hamas wants to change the price from one hostage to three prisoners to something much higher and he said look, the price that Israel's paying already is high. It is willing to pay perhaps a higher price to get the men and the soldiers out but they're willing to talk. He said as long as they are willing to hand over hostages, they are willing to talk. The question, of course now is where those talks actually stand and what impact the fighting will have on whether things can get back on track. Kim.",

I would go so far as to say route Hamas. And I think that it has to be done in a fairly decisive manner.

Now, that's a fraction of what was allowed to enter Gaza before the war. The aid comprises medical supplies, food, water, tents, and other relief materials. On Thursday, a CNN team driving towards the Rafah crossing on theEgyptian side observed hundreds of trucks loaded with aid awaiting entry into Gaza. One truck driver says he's been waiting for 10 days to enter the Palestinian enclave. Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza has left much of the landscape a wasteland. Homes, businesses, infrastructure in ruins. Many have become internally displaced refugees struggling to survive every day. CNN Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman has a closer look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): There isn't much left to retrieve from the moonscape that was Zahra city in central Gaza. Just some scraps of wood pulled from the ruins. The odds and ends that were once people's lives. We've come to get what we can, says Amjad the Shanti. The kids' things, our clothing, whatever we can get from under the rubble. Here, I found this, a daughter's toy. No one can live here anymore. The destruction -- total. Life in Gaza has been reduced to the basics. A pre-industrial existence where people have become hewers of wood where they can find it. And drawers of water, even if that water is barely potable. Bassem Al-Attar goes out early every day to collect the firewood his wife uses to prepare meals. The United Nations estimates around 80 percent of Gaza's population has been displaced, more than a million jammed into schools, converted into shelters. People here are living on top of one another, says Bassem. The place is full of filth. All these kids are going to get sick. The World Health Organization reports that without adequate hygiene, health care and food, disease is spreading. Bassem's wife Hitam tears up the daily bread, old and stale, to be made into a thin soup with lentils. We used to feed this to the sheep, now we give it to the children, she says. There's no more room at this school in Marazi, central Gaza. Um Shady and her extended family of more than 20 sleep in the back of a truck, protected from the elements by a plastic tarp. She fled from northern Gaza with only what she could carry, desperate now to find enough food to feed her children. When my son tells me, I'm hungry, what can I say, she asks. We try but we can't find anything. Our life is hard. Hard, perhaps, is an understatement. Welcome to the apocalypse -- now. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The judge presiding over the civil fraud trial says he intends to enforce that a gag order, quote, vigorously, and rigorously.CNN's Evan Perez has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  A New York state appeals court reinstated an order prohibiting Donald Trump from making certain public statements about court staff in his ongoing fraud trial. The order was initially put in place several weeks ago, and temporarily suspended by the appellate court while Trump filed a legal challenge. In a ruling Thursday, the appeals court ruled, quote, upon reading and filing the papers with respect to the motion, and due deliberation having been had there on, it is ordered that the motion is denied. Trump's attorney Chris Kise called it a tragic day for the rule of law. The order means that Trump and his family members and others in the case can't make comments about it the court clerk, who works with Judge Arthur Engoron who has been subjected to threats after Trump claimed she was biased against him. Trump lately has been posting angry social media claims about the wife of the judge, claiming that she posted anti-Trump comments on the site known as X, formerly called Twitter. But it appears the social media account that Trump and his supporters have been focused on does not even belong to the judge's wife. The court says that the judge's wife does not have such an account, and hasn't sent social media postings about Trump. Evan Perez, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
