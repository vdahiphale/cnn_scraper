He also tapped a team of allies to help make some of these calls. And we did spot Marjorie Taylor Greene, a potential critic, a member of the pro-Trump Freedom Caucus, going in and out of his office yesterday. She declined to say whether she's going to support him for speaker. But sources tell me that there are around two dozen members of the Freedom Caucus who are threatening to vote against McCarthy.

They want more representation on the Steering Committee, which doles out the committee assignments. They want more time to review non-controversial bills before they come to the floor. And look, as speaker, McCarthy has a whole number of perks at his disposal. As one Republican told me, he has a lot of chips to cash in. But he might need to cash in every single one of them.

Seven election deniers won. But these are predominantly incumbents in deep-red states. Now if you want to add Florida to that category. And this was sort of pro forma. The one new governor in this category is Sarah Huckabee Sanders from Arkansas. The key thing is the 12 folks who lost, because these were people who were running for the office now, largely on the back of being an election denier, including in some critical states like Pennsylvania, which typically acts to swing presidential elections, and where the governor appoints the secretary of state. So this is kind of decisive loss for 12 election deniers for governor is really significant. It shows the gravity of the rejection of this wing of the party. That said, there are three governors out to date, Arizona and Nevada among them. That's one of the many reasons why it's so critical to get answers about what happens in those states.

And it's -- it's a huge loss for -- for Trump. LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN (R-GA): I think it sends a message to the country, along with some other states, that this is truly a pivot point for the Republican Party. This is a time that Donald Trump is, no doubt, in the rearview mirror, and it's time to move on with the party. It's time to move on with candidate quality. JOHN KASICH (R), FORMER OHIO GOVERNOR/FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's an opportunity to reassess what Trump's role is inside the Republican Party and are people willing to stand up rather than caving in on him. REP. ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL): The question is, does the rest of the Republicans have the courage to stand up to Trump, or do they once again acquiesce to him. Because we all know him. He's not going to take the blame for this, at least in his own mind. This is certainly a rejection of the MAGA base. GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH): Governor DeSantis did it incredibly well in Florida. He just knocked the cover off the ball there. And I think that people are now saying, OK, we're moving forward. And if you just look at the Trump versus DeSantis stuff today, it's a heck of a lot different than it was just three months ago and definitely a year ago. NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE/FOX NEWS POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: You know, I think Governor DeSantis is the biggest single winner of the night, and he will almost certainly become the rallying point for everybody in the Republican Party who wants to move beyond President Trump.

If not, then you are looking -- and look, a lot of these candidates had tougher races than they should have, given everything. We will know in the next few months if, among other things, DOJ moves forward against him. Does Ron DeSantis start making more moves than he's been doing? And DeSantis is really the one to watch, as we just heard. Trump is never going to acknowledge that something is wrong. And folks around him spent all day yesterday insisting nothing bad really happened. Something bad happened. We're just not sure what it means.",

The focal point of his anger was the Oz race in particular, because that was not a natural fit for him, and he was convinced to do it. And of course, he never takes responsibility for any of his own decisions. It's always that somebody -- some staffer tricked him. And I think, Kaitlan, to your question, this is something that I heard a lot of complaining about from people around him yesterday. You know, his -- his aides who are in his world, paid aides, are all insisting nothing is wrong, status quo. Everything goes forward.

It's pretty striking, Poppy, hearing Pence talking about this in his own words. I mean, he is talking about -- he confirms much of the reporting that's been out there already. So yes, there are people who are going to read this and say, Well, we knew this, except we didn't know it in first person from Mike Pence. He explains why he didn't want to leave the building, and it's not because he thought that he was going to be, essentially, kidnapped by the Secret Service as part of a plot. It's that he didn't want the image of his caravan fleeing the area -- his motorcade fleeing the Capitol. He confirms conversations that he had with Trump. He describes this lengthy pressure campaign. And then a really interesting moment: after January 6th, in his first conversation with Trump -- I think it's five days later -- orchestrated by Trump's son-in-law and daughter, Trump has a moment where he says, what if -- basically, what if that rally didn't happen. It's too terrible to end this way. That's the only time I have heard of any real reflection from Trump, and it was that scenario.",

And it may not have gotten that far. He said, you know, I had compassion for the people. When I drove up and I saw, you know, the people at the rally, as I was on my way to the Capitol, I had compassion for them. Perhaps if he had been more honest with the former president and with those people, then it would not have gotten to that moment. I don't. So I read him staying there as, you know, not the way that you have. I feel that this is reputation rehab for Mike Pence. This book. And I don't ascribe to the belief that Mike Pence is a hero because he did his job. We have to have higher standards than that, especially for elected officials, especially if you are the person who is second in power. You have to be able to stand up to the boss when you know that you're on the right side of history, the law is with you, and it's your oath.",

We've heard that criticism, not just about Pence but a number of former Trump aides.The way that I have come to look at it, looking at everything that happened and just given the intensity of everything that was happening during that three-month period of time, people in the administration, those of us covering it, it's sort of shocking to look back and look at how much was taking place. I am not sure -- I mean, Pence is in a different position, so I agree with you that I think if he had said something publicly, it might have been different. I actually am no longer convinced how much that any one person could have done. Bill Barr did come out in December and say there was no widespread voter fraud. And Trump just rolled right over that and looked to find other people who were going to do the job. In Pence's case, if Pence said I'm not going to do this, then they would have just proceeded without him. I wonder a lot about what would have happened at the end of the final two weeks, had the riot had not happened? Would Trump have walked out of that door willingly? So there are so many unknowns. I hear what you're saying, and I think that there are people, as I said, who do feel that way. I just don't know that I think that one person saying this is going to matter.",

Now, let's go to the other side, where I can show you also just on the ground some of the sea foam that was coming in earlier when we were here. And then, of course, there's that. There is the Atlantic Ocean that has just been aggressive all night long. Those waves just pounding this area. And -- and you know, today will be much about damage assessment. Much about figuring out exactly what went wrong overnight and how this area moves forward. Because, Poppy, you know this. I constantly talk about timing when we're out here at these storms.
