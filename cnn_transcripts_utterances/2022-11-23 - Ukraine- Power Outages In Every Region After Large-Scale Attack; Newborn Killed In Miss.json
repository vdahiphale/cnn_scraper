The snow has already started to fall. People want the energy for heating and for cooking and they haven't got it. So it's a real crisis situation facing the people of Ukraine.

It's not clear whether it was a target or whether it was, you know, an attempt by the Russians to attack infrastructure there, power infrastructure and it missed.I think there's a degree of carelessness at the very least about Russian targeting of their missiles. Although, no one is ruling out that these civilian infrastructure targets like hospitals could also be deliberately targeted by the Russians. They've done that in Syria and there's lots of suggestions they could well be doing that in Ukraine as well in order to increase the hardship of ordinary people. The specific incident we're talking about here, a massive missile, the strike on that maternity clinic in Zaporizhzhia in central Ukraine. The doctor was pulled from the rubble. A young mother was pulled from the rubble. But the newborn baby that was right there, at least one of them, didn't make it. Two days old. So another tragic story, another loss of life, another family in ruins as a result of these missile strikes and, you know, within this increasingly brutal war between Ukraine and Russia.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, it's good to see you again.This is really interesting because, most of the time, we talk go this type of covert influence operation in terms of what the Russian government or the Chinese government or the Iranian government is doing and how U.S. tech companies are uncovering it. This time, it was an alleged U.S. military campaign, covert, pretending to be authentic users, and not identifying themselves. Some accounts Meta flagged were accounts that were promoting U.S. interests as you'd expect them to do in Afghanistan and Central Asia. For example, right before the chaotic withdrawal that the U.S. had from Afghanistan in August, last August 2021, there was an uptick in posts promoting U.S. interests and talking about Afghanistan. And other examples include posts about Central Asia, the country of Tajikistan, which most Americans might struggle to find on a map, but is a potential ally to the ally in the region against Russian interests. The posts that the military were allegedly running we're talking about how Russia was a threat, and that the only the U.S. was really the stable bulwark in the region. So it was interesting covert activity that the U.S. military is reportedly investigating and seeing if it violated any of their rules of conduct. It certainly violated Facebook's rules -- Boris?",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, the past three years, lawmakers have been arguing in court that they needed these records so that they could assess the IRS' ability to apply tax laws to sitting presidents, particularly those with complex business holdings like former President Trump.And they said once they could look at these records, then they could assess whether they needed to pass or try to pass additional legislation. Now that they have them, I will note though, they are prevented by law from making them public. They're only supposed to use them for the legislative purpose. Also, as you noted, the house is about to change hands. These records will stay with the committee. And, Boris, it will be interesting to see if they do put forward any kind of legislation connected to the original argument they were making for why they needed these. Because there's a much bigger umbrella question here, right? Which is, what are you hiding? Why wouldn't you release these? They may not know what it is they're looking for exactly but there's a big question about why these haven't been released. And again, it is a major loss for the former president. He has been fighting for years. Look, Boris, the former president has a lot of different legal controversies and cases. I covered them closely. But most people in America know he refused to release his returns. This is something he's been fighting for such a long time. And this is one of the biggest losses in recent memory. And it's also a pretty big boost for congressional oversight power.",

And there's really a framework for crafting these arguments that will survive judicial review. But now that Republicans are in charge, they can now use the same legislative purpose framework to craft requests for other presidential financial records.

The state Supreme Court has just rejected an emergency request from Republicans that would have blocked counties from offering early voting on Saturdays. Voting began yesterday in the runoff race between Senator Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker. CNN national politics reporter, Eva McKend, has been closely following the race.

And we have some new reporting concerning Herschel Walker, who Trump has avidly backed his tax records.CNN's \"KFILE\" reviewed them and found that Walker claimed a tax exemption on his house in Texas that's only intended for primary residences. Walker apparently did it in 2021 and 2022 after he announced his Senate run. What is his campaign saying about this? MCKEND: The campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment. From \"KFILE's\" reporting, the tax break saved Walker approximately $1500. On the grand scheme of things, we aren't talking about a whole lot of money. It's surprising he would sort of get ensnared in this when political candidates' finances are so heavily scrutinized but he ran afoul of Texas tax rules and Georgia rules. On the trail, I've only heard this come up once. I was speaking to a man at a Walker rally who indicated to me he was likely going to be a split-ticket voter, voting for Governor kemp and Senator Warnock. And said he was surprised that his fellow conservatives sort of wasn't holding it against Walker that he had so recently lived in Texas. You know, he only registered to vote in the state of Georgia last year when he has mounted this Senate run -- Boris?",

Ten days into this investigation, there are still no arrests and no murder weapon has been found. CNN national correspondent, Natasha Chen, is live in Moscow, Idaho. She joins us now.

From what I understand, we're going to be getting a little more clarity on what the process is like for law enforcement right now. Of course, besides asking about who did this and why, I think a lot of people are going to wonder about the possible motivation, the targeting of this. Police still believe it is targeted. When I asked about that yesterday, the spokesperson told me that, you know, they believe that because of evidence found at the scene and because two people in the house actually survived the attack. And so potentially, if this was a more non-discriminate killing, maybe everyone in the house would be dead. So that's just one theory right now. They are having to combat a lot of rumors that have popped up in the community, online. And that is speculation that's happened in the public because of sort of the lack of details presented to the public. Here is the family of one of the victims, Kaylee Goncalves.
