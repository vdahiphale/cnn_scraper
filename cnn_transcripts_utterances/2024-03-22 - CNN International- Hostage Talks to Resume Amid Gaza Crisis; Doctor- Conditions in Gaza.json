I mean, I remember walking in the pediatric department of Nasser Hospital and going to a room where a child had been killed because a tank shell burst through her window, struck her in the head and instantly killed her. And I remember turning around and seeing 11 children playing ring around the rosy in the department. The world needs to realize that Palestinians are human beings, too.

I think it's for Ukrainians and for Ukraine at large, strikes and attacks like this have become the norm and people have become used to taking shelter and covering themselves for safety because of these Russian airstrikes. But what is different is that over the last short period of time wehaven't really seen attacks like this happening across Ukraine with the widespread nature as we have seen this morning. And don't forget, yesterday was the first time in 44 days that the Ukrainian capital was targeted, which the Ukrainian intelligence services said was a specific attack on one of the Ukrainian intelligence ministries. What we're seeing, though, is a renewed effort from the Russian armed forces to try to target Ukraine's critical infrastructure targets, which was one of the key aims which was happening at the end of 2022 going into 2023, to try and knock out and really squeeze the Ukrainian people at a time when the weather becomes its most brutal. President Zelenskyy has tweeted this morning just about his anger at the situation. I think it's one of his more vociferous comments pleading with the American people and the international community at large to try and get him this aid which his country so desperately needs. He said this morning: Russian missiles do not have delays, as do our aid packages to our country. The Shahed has no indecision like some politicians. It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions. Some quite serious words with a very strong messaging there, guys.",
