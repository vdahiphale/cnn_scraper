      "sentences": "Well, Fredricka, one thing we've heard throughout the course of this conflict from U.S. officials is that it really takes this in-person face-to-face diplomacy to get the Israeli government to move on any of these U.S. requests or demands. So, today, for example, we expect Blinken to really push the Israeli government on the need to open up more access points for humanitarian assistance into Gaza. This is something that has been a perennial ask in almost all of his meetings throughout the five and a half months that this conflict has been going on. Yesterday, Blinken said that Israel needs to do more, that it is not enough to have only this handful of access points getting to the people in need in Gaza.Another thing we expect him to raise is this deterrence of an invasion into Rafah. This is something that the U.S. has said it would not support. Blinken said yesterday it would be a humanitarian disaster. So, he is expected to start these conversations that we expect to continue next week in Washington between Israeli and U.S. officials. At the same time, it's important to note that Blinken's trip is not just to Israel. He was also in Saudi Arabia two days ago. He was in Cairo yesterday, meeting with both bilateral leaders and this sort of Arab Contact Group to discuss what can happen next. So, a lot of this is laying the diplomatic groundwork for when the conflict ends, who will be in control of Gaza, what governance looks like there, what security looks like there, and also pushing for the Saudi-Israel normalization that had been in the works for a while even before October 7, and Blinken said that there is progress there. So, we're not necessarily expecting a lot of concrete results out of his trip. But, it's a lot of laying this groundwork for what comes next, Fred.",

While diplomats talk in Tel Aviv and Doha, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to spiral dramatically. An Israeli raid on Al-Shifa Hospital in the northern part of the besieged enclave is now in its fifth day. The Israeli military says it's continuing to conduct \"precise operations\" and has eliminated more than 140 of what it calls terrorists. As CNN's Jeremy Diamond reports, thousands of civilians are trapped on the premises. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT voice-over): A crowded stairwell at Al-Shifa Hospital, dozens of women and children await Israeli military instructions. For four days, thousands of civilians have been trapped here as the Israeli military raids the hospital, targeting Palestinian militants allegedly operating inside the medical complex. Soldiers are everywhere, the voice on the loudspeaker warns. If you leave the premises, the soldiers will shoot you. We have warned you. We have come here in order to get the Israeli hostages, then we will let you go. Soon, word of evacuations begins to spread. Now, they're forcing out the women, the voice behind the camera says. We don't know where they're going to take us. The Israeli military says they have killed more than 140 militants in and around the hospital, and detained these five men described as senior terror operatives, among more than 600 suspects the Israeli military says they've detained. Eyewitnesses say medical personnel and other civilians have also been rounded up. Outside the hospital, the fighting continues, as seen through the lens of Hamas militants who have been targeting Israeli tanks and troops around the hospital complex. Israeli airstrikes reducing parts of the surrounding al-Rimal neighborhood to rubble, sending thousands fleeing south. It's a journey marked by the sights and smells of death. We walked over the martyrs who are dead in the street. People are reduced to body parts, this woman cries. Where is the humanity? The newly displaced arrive on foot in central Gaza, carrying only backpacks and plastic bags, children clutching dolls and stuffed animals. Others like this mother and her triplets arrive with nothing at all. The tanks and artillery were firing at the buildings around Al-Shifa and forcing people to leave the building, she says. They make them leave with nothing on them, nothing, no pillow, no blanket, not even water. Nussah (ph) isn't just fleeing the fighting, but the starvation that has left her eight-month-old babies thin and frail. You can see them, she says. Each of them is not even two kilos, eight-months-old and not even two kilos. Anyone who sees them would think they're only two- months-old, and they're eight months. It's a catastrophe, no water, no food and siege and gunfire. But, her journey is not over yet. She is heading further south in search of food and shelter, no longer taken for granted in Gaza.

      "sentences": "Well, the scale is absolutely massive. And if we just look at the numbers, they certainly are quite imposing. The Ukrainians are saying that the Russians fired around 155 missiles and drones towards Ukrainian territory. Now, the Ukrainians say that their air defense has actually worked quite well. They managed to take down about 92 of those. But that, of course, means, Fredricka, that a lot of the missiles that were fired by the Russians towards Ukraine actually did hit their targets, or at least hit in the vicinity of the target set that they wanted to hit.And if we look at where are the major damage took place, you mentioned one of those places, which is the hydroelectric power plant near the city of Zaporizhzhia. Anybody who has ever been there knows just how massive that complex is. It also has a big dam as part of it as well. Now, the Ukrainians are saying, luckily, so far, they don't believe that that dam is in danger of collapsing or of breaking. They did say that they had to let some of the water out of that dam in order to secure it. But, as you say, the Ukrainians are saying they're not sure whether or not they're going to be able to get power out of that power plant in the future. And they have similar issues around the country, more than a million people currently without energy. And the strikes really happened in the west of Ukraine, in the south of Ukraine, and also, of course, in those Eastern and Southeastern places like Zaporizhzhia, and like Kharkiv. The Ukrainians are saying that they need more air defense. It was quite interesting because the President of the country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he posted on his social media this warning, seemingly taking a swipe at the Europeans and the United States, of course, with that aid from the U.S. still delayed by House Republican leadership, saying the Russians clearly face no delays as far as getting their missiles, and also they said the Shahed drones which are some of the ones that the Russians fire at Ukrainian territory clearly don't have the same indecision as some of Ukraine's partners. So, you can see the Ukrainian President clearly quite frustrated right now with some of the aid delays that have been going on, and certainly the Ukrainians are saying that those delays are measured in lives and of course also in energy for their people, and a lot of them are without it today. And some people actually in Kharkiv, which is in the east of the country, without water as well, Fredricka.",

Back in the U.S., the clock is ticking, and there is no indication how Donald Trump plans to pay the nearly half a billion dollar bond that is due Monday from his New York civil fraud case. In a legal filing, the New York Attorney General Letitia James has indicated that she could seize his golf course and Seven Springs estate in New York's posh Westchester County. She could also move to take some of his properties in Manhattan. Sources close to Trump say he has ruled out a bankruptcy filing as a way to hold off the seizures. CNN's Kara Scannell is tracking the latest developments for us. So, Kara, good morning to you. So, Trump is not just sitting there sending out social media rants. Do we know what he is trying to do to make this payment and potentially hold on to his properties as well? KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. Good morning, Fred. I mean, Donald Trump has said that he has tried to get someone at an insurance company to underwrite this half a billion dollar bond. His team has said that they've approached 30 different insurance companies. None of them are willing to do it because none of them want to take any property as collateral. So, he has got a real cash crunch problem because he doesn't have enough money to even give to these bond companies that they would be comfortable putting up. So, he has told the judge that he wants to put up a smaller amount. He has asked to not have to put up any amount until this appeal court is over. He has also argued that if he was forced to sell some of his properties now, it would be at a fire sale, and if he ultimately prevailed, that he would not be able to recover the properties that he was forced to sell. So, he is asking for leniency from the appeals court. They have not ruled on this yet. The New York Attorney General's Office has opposed this. And as you said, they're already kind of getting their ducks in a row in order to begin the process of enforcing this judgment, which could mean seizing assets, and that could be some of these properties, the Seven Springs home just north of New York City, a golf course also located in Westchester County, as well as his penthouse apartment at the top of Trump Tower, Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street. There is different apartment buildings that the company owns. And so, they could not even necessarily try to take custody of it. But, they could put liens on some of these companies, collect some of the rent payments that they've received. They could also go after his bank accounts or airplanes. All of this is still a lot of a moving target. Trump has several days to come up with the money, if there is a donor out there who is going to give him the money, is all still unclear. But, the clock is ticking, and we're coming to a head with either Trump is going to post this money, the appeals court is going to step in, or the Attorney General's Office is going to begin to try to enforce these judgments. Whatever happens, though, it's not going to be a quick process, and is likely to be fought by Trump every step of the way. Fred.",

You would get a warrant, and then you would go and begin that process of putting liens on those properties. So, to your point, Fred, that can happen very, very quickly. Within weeks there could be liens. There could be signs on the door in big red that this is going to be seized.However, that's when the legal maneuvering comes in after that point with respect to possibly complicating the actual seizure of the property, because what would happen is, the properties would be seized.

That's the argument. Now, on the other hand, if he is not successful on appeal, that judgment needs to be paid within 10 days of that appellate decision. So, it's also protecting those who are owed the money to keep this money under bonds.So, to your point, Fred, say in these -- during this process of seizure, during this process where the warrants are out there, and the property maybe has liens on it, the money comes to fruition, and he is able to stop the process. This is where it gets into a very, very legally thorny area. It would really depend with respect to each property where it is in that process of seizure, to the extent it has been seized and sold, there'd be no way for him to get it back. But, to the extent it's in that intermediate process, it's likely that all of those process would be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. So, it's highly complicated.

The best hope for him is that the appellate division does step in the standard, and we heard it in the brilliant reporting that just happened, is what's called irreparable harm.

Take a look at this video.(VIDEO PLAYING) So, it's not clear what caused the rush, but officials call it an isolated incident. Between 400 and 600 people were detained for illegally crossing the border between ports of entry. Joining me right now is Senior National Correspondent Ed Lavandera. Good morning to you, Ed. Extraordinary pictures from that border crossing. What else do we know about what precipitated it, and then what happened? ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, from what we've heard from immigration officials here in the El Paso area, there hadn't been any kind of sense of rising tension. Tensions are escalating conflict along those border regions where so many migrants have been on the other side of the border for months, trying to figure out the best way of crossing into the U.S. and in many cases requesting asylum. So, this is why I think officials are saying they believe that this -- particular moment is an isolated incident. But, it was a dramatic intense as these migrants essentially pushed through the fencing and the razor wire, and several national -- Texas National Guard soldiers. And just to kind of give people a lay of the land, this is just on the northern edge of the Rio Grande which separates Mexico from Texas, and those migrants had already from where they kind of entered into that conflict there with the soldiers were already in U.S. territory. And they moved past them and essentially ran up to the wall where they turned themselves in to Border Patrol agents. We witnessed as hundreds of these migrants were loaded onto buses and taken away to a Border Patrol facility where they were later processed. We are told that some of them would be requesting asylum and might have those applications approved to continue on with the asylum process. Others might be deported when a group that large it's kind of hard to tell exactly what the ultimate outcome is going to be. But, very tense moments in that area. And that razor wire that you see in the video there, that's kind of at the heart of the tension that has existed, Fredricka, between Texas authorities and the federal government and immigration. That line of razor wire and fencing is what has been put in place by the state of Texas in recent months. And it's kind of a multi-layered kind of barriers that exist there between the border wall that has been in place for years, and the river, which is the international boundary line in this area of the U.S. southern border.
