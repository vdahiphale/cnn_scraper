And now he has joined a long line of Republicans who have spoken to federal investigators looking into efforts to overturn the 2020 election.Among them, Rudy Giuliani, once Trump's personal lawyer who was questioned in recent weeks, Former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Former Aide Stephen Miller, Former Deputy Chief of Staff and Social Media Director Dan Scavino, Former National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, and on and on it goes. Suffice to say, it's a lot of Trump insiders being asked what they saw and heard about any effort to undo a legal and fair election. The scope of this probe is also notable for its geography, with investigators asking about possible schemes for fake electors and false claims in Georgia and Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin and Nevada and Arizona and New Mexico, and all of this against the boiling background of the other cases the former president faces. That indictment in Manhattan accusing him of falsifying business records to disguise hush money payments to hide alleged affairs. The indictment in federal court over those classified documents seized at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club and a Georgia county prosecutor's own investigation into alleged attempts by Trump and his allies to steal the election there. For the record, the former president has insisted time and again that he did nothing wrong, and many of his team have said they just want to make sure that the election was above board. Alisyn.",

You see them, you know, looking to talk to Eastman. So, they're trying to lock down everybody's story.The Giuliani one is particularly interesting because their focus was really the period from election day, November 3rd to January 20th. What happened on what dates during that thing, during that time period? What was the purpose of the alternate electors? What was the legal precedent for that? Did they actually have the evidence of the fraud?

So, you pull that all together, and they're looking at some --perhaps some conspiracy to overturn the outcome of a valid election, perhaps defrauding the United States government. They're looking at all these issues to try to build a case and build eventually towards an indictment. And I think as they're getting to the -- to the end here when you're hearing when you're seeing folks like Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows and others going in and testifying, I think that's where you know we see this coming to a conclusion. I do think that this case, in particular, and I don't think you'll see an incitement type case here because the First Amendment issues associated with it.

John, this is one of the most remarkable things about this video we're about to show is what the officer was doing seconds before the shots ring out. He is doing community service, basically. He's teaching little kids about seatbelt safety. And so, let me just play what happens next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's running towards that danger. He's trying to clear people away,update the department on the radio, and then, you know, as he stops hearing the gunfire and it goes quiet, every corner he comes around he's saying, am I running into an ambush? So, I think that's just such a remarkable video and we saw that. We saw it in Nashville at the school. We saw it at Louisville in the bank, and we've seen the flip side. I mean, if you take this week, Alisyn, what are we going through? You've got three officers in Texas who opened fire far too quickly on a woman who was charging at them with a hammer. They're charged with murder now. You have Scott Peterson in Florida, in Parkland, on trial, literally for not doing what we saw here.

So, it could start out any place. You know, you could get a scrape on the skin. You could have a purposeful cut, like if someone has surgery and then it becomes infected like a wound. Sometimes at that age, it could be a urinary tract infection, for example, or let's say even an elective procedure like a colonoscopy. But the main thing is usually that it has to spread to the blood because in order to end up in the ICU, it has to be something that's interfering with your ability to get oxygen and nutrients to the brain and to the organs because they have to be in danger of failing. So, your heart has to be having problems actually getting those things to the brain and the organs.",

If she has sepsis, it can always be a source of bacterial infection in the future.So, sometimes what people will do is they'll remove the hardware and then the person has to go back after a course of antibiotics for weeks and then have a new hip put where that hip replacement was.

Back in late 2019, early 2020, she had to postpone or cancel certain shows of her Madame X tour because she said she was going through more pain than she had ever gone through in her life. And then a year later she reveals she had hip replacement surgery because of overwhelming pain. And so, she said at the time that not only has she said she's a bionic woman, but also that she says she doesn't believe in limitations, which I think will give us some insight to maybe how she mentally is trying to handle this latest episode, but obviously this bacterial infection, very different from what from the pain that she would have experienced in the past.",

On the other hand, you know, it depends what actually landed her in the ICU, if it's a bacterial infection or if it's something else that complicated the bacterial infection. And that's what kept her in the ICU, so it may depend.But just to follow up on what you said, her positive attitude and her work ethic might be a real like a good prognostic factor here because usually if you have a serious infection it's where you start, that predicts how you're gonna end up afterwards, too. It's not just the infection. So, if somebody is really in bad shape before they get this bacterial infection, it's hard for them to bounce back from that. But for somebody who's starting at such a high level, that actually is a really good sign for her in the future. On the other hand, the stress of the tour might've been maybe what predisposed her also to being maybe immunocompromised, maybe her diet was off.

AVLONfound that a majority of Americans believe that racial and ethnic discrimination is a major cause of our political divisions. But a \"Washington Post\" poll last year also shows broad majorities of Americans say they favor leaving race out of college admissions. That was reaffirmed by a Pew Research Center survey earlier this month, which found that not even a majority of Black Americans support affirmative action at 47 percent, followed by 39 percent of Hispanic respondents, 37 percent of Asian respondents, and 29 percent of white folks. Now, perhaps most surprising is that 35 percent of black Americans and 20 percent of Hispanics say they've actually been disadvantaged by efforts to increase diversity, with 28 percent of black Americans surveyed saying that people assume they might have benefited unfairly. In fact, get this, the biggest divisions on affirmative action are partisan, and white Democrats support affirmative action at a higher rate than black Democrats, 59 to 50 percent, they're about equal on disapproval. Look, a poll is just a snapshot in time, while race has always been a fundamental fault line in American politics. Thanks to the legacy of America's original sin of slavery. We've got a long way to go before we achieve a genuine multiracial democracy. Now, if the Supreme Court does overturn considering race and emissions, we can't know exactly what the impact will be, but an analysis of medical school enrollment trends found that the number of students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups fell by around a third, just five years after some states banned affirmative action programs. Now, if the Supreme Court chooses a mended, non-ended path by moving from racial distinctions to class, giving students from lower income families a boost in college admissions, it might have some of the same net effect benefiting economically disadvantaged kids across the demographic spectrum, poor whites, as well as, poor black Americans. That might be a way to constructively depolarize this debate, making more progress towards quality of opportunity and social mobility as we continue our constant work to form a more perfect union.

We saw that you know the next year at UCLA, the most competitive school in California, enrollment for African Americans and Hispanics went down about 40 percent. There was a professor from Princeton University who actually trackedthe long- term impact of that decision and we found that over a 15 to 20-year period long term economic impact down about five percent. So, we know in a vacuum getting rid of affirmative action does have a negative impact.
