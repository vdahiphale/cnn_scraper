They continue with the advisories and warnings across those west facing shorelines of Hanshu northward towards Hokkaido. And anywhere you see that shading of red, there's the epicenter of the earthquake, just off of the Ishikawa prefecture. This is the tsunami warning with wave heights potentially reaching up to 10 feet.And just looking at the simple geography of this area, remember, we've got the Korean peninsula and Russia just to our west. So, with such a powerful earthquake, magnitude 7.5, it propagated a wave across this area and it won't take much for that sloshing effect to take place. So, that's why this tsunami warning continues. Remember, a tsunami is not one wave. It is a series of waves. So, the threat continues well after the initial earthquake, well after your first water -- body of water reaches the coastline. And here it is, some of the first visuals of the tsunami wave that really fits the narrative of some of the observed wave heights that we have seen so far across western shorelines of Japan, reaching roughly 4 feet depending on where you're located. So, with this powerful of an earthquake, remember, we've got the shifting of tectonic plates. That displaces water at the surface. And as that water traverses towards the coastline, where you and I live, or the population of Japan, that water is forced upwards. And that's why we see a larger wave once it reaches the coastline. It's called bathymetry. You can Google that term and you'll get an idea of what that is all about. But this is a powerful earthquake where we anticipate, John, the aftershocks to continue here for the next hours, if not days, to come.",

But you can imagine, with a wave that's being displaced in this particular region, you're getting this sloshing effect just in a localized sense, but in a more broader regional sense, a sloshing of the water because the water is going to traverse across the ocean here, across the sea, all the way to the Korean peninsula and all the way to Russia and bounce backwards.But just in terms of localized effects, there it is. You can see exactly why that would happen. Just think about dropping a stone into the bathtub and watching the water ripple back and forth, right? Similar idea.",

You can see right here, collapsed roads, fires burning there. Tsunami warnings have been issued for parts of Japan's west coast.At this point, Japan's meteorological agency downgraded the major tsunami warning. It had been a major tsunami warning. Now it is a tsunami warning, which means they are fearing waves of up to 10 feet in that region. Officials in the coastal city of Iwo Jima (ph) are still assessing the situation. They have confirmed the earthquake caused fire and roads damage. At least 33 households have been effected by power outages across the country at this point. We were speaking to someone in Tokyo just minute ago. That's about 185 miles away. They felt the quake strongly as it hit. So, tens of millions of people felt it. At this point, the area where greatest concern, on the west coast, where you can see on your map there, an area with about a million residents or so. We are still getting reports of the damage there. In the meantime, the race for the White House, Republican presidential candidates, they are hitting the ground in Iowa. Just two weeks to go until the first in the nation caucuses. Donald Trump remains the frontrunner despite all kinds of legal troubles. His Republican rivals, they are scrambling to start the new year and gain some ground. CNN's Eva McKend is with us now. Eva, what are they trying to do? It's always fun to cover campaigns right around New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, where the candidates, they know no one wants to see them. They want to celebrate New Year, but they still don't have the guts to leave the campaign trail. They feel like they have to do something. So, what are they doing?",

He's also traveled to all of the states' 99 counties.But Governor DeSantis and the rest of the field, they still trail far behind frontrunner, former President Donald Trump.

So, like you mentioned, we're expecting to see 10-feet waves on the western coast of Japan. We also know that around 33,000 homes have lost power. We're also hearing reports that there are at least six cases of people being trapped underneath their homes. We also know that bullet trains have been suspended, roads have had cracks, and making it very difficult for emergency personnel to just get into Ishikawa prefecture, which is very close to the epicenter. Now, the Japanese government has announced that they've dispatched a thousand self-defense force personnel. And the fire department has also separately dispatched 1,700 people. So together you have 2,700 people in the area trying to get people out of just their homes, any dangerous places. We also know that 20 aircraft from the self-defense force have also been dispatched to try to assess the damage within the region, Mike (ph).",

At least 12 rockets intercepted. Sirens heard across the southern and central part of the country as the military wing of Hamas claimed it hit Tel Aviv with rockets at midnight.

But I suppose this rocket barrage from Hamas and the IDF in the last few minutes has told us there were 31 rockets fired towards Israel in that midnight barrage towards central and southern Israel. But this just underlines that Israel is still a country at war. And as part of that war, it also announced that some 20,000 soldiers, who have been fighting in the Gaza Strip, are going to be allowed to go back to their families, to go back to their work, to their communities, as part of a means of allowing them to recover, refresh, and retrain.But this shouldn't be seen as an indication that the war is winding down. We heard from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just the other day talking about this war going to take several months. And he said that it will continue until Israel's objectives of destroying Hamas militarily and getting those 100-plus living hostages back inside Israel. If there is a note of optimism, and let's not forget the situation in the Gaza Strip, of course, is dire, with more than 20,000 killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, if there is any sign of optimism, it is that there seems to be an inching towards the possibility of talks that could lead to another truce and another swap of hostages being held by Hamas and others inside the Gaza Strip in exchange for Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails. But those talks haven't started. And so it seems that we are still some way off for that coming to fruition. So, for now, I suppose as 2024 dawns, John, it is simply war as usual.",
