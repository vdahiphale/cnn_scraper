We have heard from this committee investigating the Afghan withdrawal during the Biden administration is that those descriptions of what was in the dissent memo just weren't enough. Now the State Department is saying they will allow the top Republican and top Democrat on the committee to come to the State Department and in camera review that dissent cable without the names who signed that cable actually attached to the cable itself. So they'll be able to see the content. The question here is if the committee is actually going to accept that. Are they going to want staffers who are actually leading this investigation to be able to see it? Are they also going to want to see the secretary's response to that dissent cable?
