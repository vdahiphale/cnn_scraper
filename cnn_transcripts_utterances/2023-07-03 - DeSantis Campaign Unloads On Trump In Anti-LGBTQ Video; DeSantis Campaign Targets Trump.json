One Republican group says the Florida Governor is dabbling in outright homophobia. Plus, Mike Pence pleads innocent in the court of public opinion. The former Vice President denies he was part of a newly revealed Trump pressure campaign to get Arizona's Governor to overturn the 2020 election. And repairs required, the Treasury Secretary heads to China this week at a tense moment between Washington and Beijing. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines and Inside Politics.Up first, is this the conversation the DeSantis campaign really wanted to have? Today, they're stuck trying to explain what his campaign's intent really was when its war room tweeted out a video, a one minute plus collage of headlines, movie clips, and DeSantis glamour shots that begins by slamming Donald Trump for his past support of LGBTQ rights.

But, they do describe what they expect to be constructive and frank conversations between Yellen and other officials in China.She is not slated to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to an official here, but she is going to meet with other economic leaders in China. Now, this also comes at a very fraught and tenuous time in the relations between the U.S. and the Chinese government. Just recently, President Biden likened Chinese President Xi Jinping to a dictator, a comment that really drew a strong rebuke from China, and one that the White House administration have not really walked back from. The President has still said he hopes to meet with Xi in the coming months, and visits by officials like Yellen and Blinken are largely viewed as an opportunity to potentially lay the groundwork for a possible meeting.
