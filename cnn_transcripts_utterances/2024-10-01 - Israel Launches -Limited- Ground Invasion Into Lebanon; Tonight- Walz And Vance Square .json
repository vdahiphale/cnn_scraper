So if you look at their operation in Gaza, which was tunnels and sandstone, that has taken almost a year. They're doing the same thing here. They've got a first raid to find the openings of these things. And then they're going to have to bring in I believe tanks, engineers, those infrastructure to protect the engineers while they do the work of mapping out, and blowing up those tunnels and digging out anything that's inside. Because those ballistic missiles can go 340 miles, it can reach much of Israel's populated area and the Israeli military wants to take them out.",

Since all of the stepped-up operations against Hezbollah, and especially after the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader.

How do you even comprehend that? How do you compartmentalize all the damage that is on the ground? Well, it's even amazing to me that we're talking about kind of the remnant energy of what was Hurricane Helene. This is indirectly related to it, but there are still a tropical showers that are inundating, kind of like the spot the rock, our spine of the Appalachian Mountains here. So anywhere from the nations capital into portions of western North Carolina. And now, they're light, but I don't want to reiterate that this isn't a another round of heavy rainfall, but the point being is that the ground is so saturated, and any additional rainfall according to the national weather service coming not of the western North Carolina region, talking about landslides, because the ground is unstable. So, additional rainfall could cause some of that loose dirt and rock to slide quite easily. So isolated showers here through the course of the day today, some of the hardest hit areas, western North Carolina, into Virginia. We're still talking about over for 1 million-and-a-half customers without power. I mean, it could basically see and track the exact path of where the storm made its way inland. And this is just concurrent with our warming world, Kasie, we talk about this so often, but when we have a warming planet, that allows the atmosphere to hold more moisture and that brings the potential for more frequent and more heavy rain events like we saw unfold in western North Carolina -- Kasie.",
