And it's going to be one that changes quickly, especially if the Iranians are successful in resupplying them with missile parts, with actual missiles, and with the warheads that they need in order to accomplish this mission. And then the other thing, of course, to keep in mind is that they have certain capabilities on the intelligence side that the Iranians have given them.

So this very complex situation that everybody is tripped into is one in which, yes, the Yemeni duties and the Yemeni state that is finding them are at loggerheads.

If you allow Putin to win in Ukraine, he'd be back for more. And we know from our history that, when that happens, America ends up paying a bigger price in treasure and also in lives lost. I mean, right now, the Americans for the use of 10 percent of their defense budget, have destroyed about 50 percent of Russia's military capacity without the loss of a single American life.

You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.Two suspects have been arrested in Ecuador for their alleged involvement in the assassination of prosecutor Cesar Suarez. According to a source of the attorney general's office, Suarez was gunned down Wednesday while driving to a drug-related hearing in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city. At the time of his murder, Suarez was overseeing the investigation into an attack by armed men on a television station, all of it broadcast live at the time, just one of a slew of violent incidents which prompted a 60- day declaration of a state of emergency. Well, this week, Israel Defense Forces exhumed graves and removed bodies from a cemetery in Khan Yunis in Southern Gaza, officials telling CNN, all part of an effort to find the bodies of Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas on October 7. But it's not the only cemetery in Gaza damaged during the conflict. And CNN's Jeremy Diamond has more on this story. But first a warning. Viewers may find some of the following images disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In Gaza, even the dead cannot escape the indignities of war. More than a dozen cemeteries like this one in Jabalia, desecrated by the Israeli military. Gravestones destroyed, soil upturned, tread marks leaving little left for the living to honor their dead. This is that same graveyard before the war. One month later, a series of tread marks can be seen on the Northwestern edge. It is no exception. A CNN analysis of videos and satellite imagery found that 16 cemeteries have been damaged or destroyed by the Israeli military since it launched its ground offensive. As Israeli forces pushed deeper into Gaza, they crushed the graves of thousands of Palestinians between November and January. Janina Dill, co-director of Oxford University's Institute for Ethics Law and Armed Conflict, says destroying graveyards violates international law, except under very limited circumstances.",
