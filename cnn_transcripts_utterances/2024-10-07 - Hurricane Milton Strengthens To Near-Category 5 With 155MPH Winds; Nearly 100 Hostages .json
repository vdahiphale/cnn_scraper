Hurricane Milton is becoming a monster storm churning toward Florida's Gulf coast and rapidly getting stronger.The hurricane is now a category four and likely to intensify into a cat five. And it's already the third fastest rapidly intensifying storm on record in the Atlantic. Those in its path have only just begun recovering from Helene's devastation. Elisa Raffa joins us now.

When I went to sleep last night, which was pretty late, it was a category one hurricane with some 80 miles per hour wind. You're waking up this morning, it is a monster category four storm with 155 miles per hour winds. Gusts are nearing 200 miles per hour.That eye is just so symmetrical and, you know, becoming classic textbook look on satellite. It is really scary how much this intensifies so quickly, what that does to people at home and gives you less time to prepare. We have increased the winds at the center of this hurricane 50 miles per hour in 24 hours yesterday, again, from yesterday at 5:00 a.m. to this morning. And then just from this morning, it's increased another 55 miles per hour. So again, just increasing in strength so rapidly because of these incredibly warm ocean temperatures. So because of that, the National Hurricane Center keeps up ticking the intensity on this forecast. Now in the latest track that just came in at 11:00, getting it up to a category five hurricane as it brushes past the Yucatan Peninsula with 165 miles per hour winds. It is expected to become that category five storm later on today as it continues to rapidly intensify. As it heads towards Florida, where we have these hurricane watches in effect, it runs into some dry air and some wind shear upstairs in the atmosphere, some of that wind energy that hurricanes hate. So some of that intensity will waver, some will start to decline a little bit. But as it does that, the hurricane will get fatter. So that means that those damaging winds will impact more people across the peninsula. Regardless, you're still looking at a major hurricane, you know, a category three or even possibly, you know, a low end category four storm that heads towards that west coast of Florida. We're looking at winds that will be incredibly dangerous. And storm surge could really be unprecedented for parts of the Tampa Bay area. Pamela?",

SIEGEL: We haven't felt encouraged that Prime Minister Netanyahu has placed bringing the hostages home as his number one priority, let alone a ceasefire. But to really focus on the American citizens, the Israeli citizens who remained -- who remain captive and many have already died. And each day that goes by, there's that risk that more will perish. So we -- we need him to be more focused on that as his top of the list task as leader of Israel.",

      "sentences": "You say you haven't been encouraged. What is your message to him today?H. SIEGEL: You know, I think candidly, we don't believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu's priority is to bring home the hostages. And so a year later, as a larger deal has proven elusive, we do believe that President Biden and the Biden administration could find a way to bring at least the Americans home, the four Americans who are presumed alive, including Keith, and the three Americans who are deceased. We ask the administration to shift their focus for now towards bringing the American citizens home. That's their number one responsibility. And while every day we hope for a ceasefire deal and for everyone to come home. We do believe there's an opportunity for the Biden administration to bring the Americans home. And -- and we hope that they'll focus their efforts there, especially as we have, you know, a very consequential election in the United States and fears of a regional war. BROWN: And right here on your screen as -- are pictures that there -- was up there of the -- the seven American hostages in Gaza. And, you know, our hearts just go out to their families, to you all. If -- if Keith could hear you right now, what would you want to tell him? H. SIEGEL: I think we'd tell him to be strong and survive and -- and that we'll see him soon. D. SIEGEL: And that we're thinking about him every minute and working as hard as we can to bring about change.",
