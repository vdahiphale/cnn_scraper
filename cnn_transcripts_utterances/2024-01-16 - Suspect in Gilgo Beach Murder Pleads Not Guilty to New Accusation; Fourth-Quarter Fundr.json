The Biden campaign just announced it raised more than $97 million for his reelection bid in the last quarter of 2023.Joining us now is Michael Tyler. He is the communications director for the Biden 2024 reelection campaign. Michael, great to see you. Do you think that Donald Trump is the likely Republican nominee or now are you behaving as such? MICHAEL TYLER, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, BIDEN 2024 CAMPAIGN:  Well, thanks so much for having me this morning. Donald Trump has clearly cemented himself as the front runner in this race, and that's what this campaign has been prepared for since day one, when the president launched this reelection effort in April of last year. I think we saw the president's layout at the beginning of this year, a very clear vision for what this campaign is going to be about, and that's whether the sacred cause of America is going to remain democracy. That's what we've been focused on on this campaign. And what we saw in Iowa last night was the embodiment of that threat to our democracy, consolidate his power. This is a person who is when he's not talking about banning abortion across the country or ripping away health care from folks who need it. He is talking about ruling as a dictator on day one. And so, those are the stakes for this election. And we're confident as we head into this race, we're going to have the resources necessary, as you mentioned. We're going to have the message necessary to defeat Donald Trump. And we're going to do our jobs from now through Election Day.",

He has made no bones about exactly what he wants to do if he's able to regain power. And so, the stakes are going to be incredibly clear for the American people. And the thing about this election in this race is that every time MAGA extremism has been on the ballot box in 2020, in 2022, just last year, it has failed because the American people continue to reject the extremism they have seen from Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans across the country.",

The question is, is Donald Trump fit for the presidency if convicted of a crime? And among the Republican caucus goers in Iowa, 65 percent said yes. 31 percent said no.

The vast majority of Americans understand the truth about what happened in 2020. They understand the truth about what happened on January 6th.And it's why MAGA extremism continues to fail when it -- when it's presented at the ballot box. It happened in '22. It happened last fall, and it's going to happen in 2024 because the American people continue to side with Joe Biden and his vision of America that has more freedom, that stands up for our democracy, and they continue to reject this MAGA extremism that wants to tear down the fabric of our democratic institutions.",

But what really matters is the fact that the Senate is going to be showing up tonight to vote at 5Here's what we are waiting to see, however. Even if the Senate can begin processing this tonight, which is the expectation, any one senator can slow this process down. And because some conservatives are frustrated with where these negotiations are headed, it still remains to be seen if anyone tries to slow walk the process. So, that means that if the Senate can't move expeditiously, they could put themselves in a position where they may not be able to fund the government finally until Sunday or Monday. Obviously, that would be a very, very short partial government shutdown. And usually because the federal government doesn't work on the weekends, the impact wouldn't really be felt. But that is sort of the timing issue and the timing element that is very real right now in the United States Senate. Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, they can move more quickly. But Mike Johnson, the House Speaker, is facing a lot of fire from hardliners within his ranks who are frustrated at a few things. One, that he is sticking with a top line spending deal to negotiate full year spending appropriations bills into March with Chuck Schumer. He's not backing away from that deal. They're also frustrated that he's moving yet again on this short-term spending bill after saying that he did not want to process any more short-term spending bills in order to keep the government funded. So, there's really a one-two punch here. You have to pass the short- term bill in order to give negotiators more time. But even when they have more time, the top line levels have been set that deal between Chuck Schumer and the speaker remains. John.",
