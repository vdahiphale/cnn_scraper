So, Elliot, when we look at this, Fry says that this bill was needed because, in his words, presidents and vice presidents are the most visible politicians in the U.S. government. And that makes them, he believes, a target for, quote, \"rogue prosecutors.\" But he says the benefit here would be that if you could move any sort of civil or criminal case to a federal court, that those judges, who are confirmed in the Senate, they're not elected -- he's implying they're free from politics -- that's a safer space.

Congress does have the power to decide what, when and where federal courts will have jurisdiction. And that could include maybe crafting a manner to put only cases involving presidents or vice presidents or former presidents into the federal courts. The problem is that that creates a bunch of legal issues down the road. For instance, what if a president -- just take a hypothetical. What if a president sues somebody in state court over some minor state law matter, but that -- but that isn't illegal at the federal level. Like what, which law governs? And how would it be handled? And it would just create any number of possible conflicts in law down the road that I think courts would have to sort out.",

There simply is no advantage here.And we have a long tradition in this country, going back, frankly, to the 10th Amendment, which lays out the fact that states oversee state law and matters of state jurisdiction. And even taking the former President Trump former President Trump's matter, it is distinct -- regardless of what you think of the merits of the lawsuit or of the prosecution, it is a distinct state law matter, happening in state court by a former resident of New York, who chose to do business there. That's very straightforward. Nothing really is changed by moving things into federal court.

They like his deeply conservative voting record.And the fact that he speaks with an optimistic tone, calling for more unity than divisiveness. That rings true to many Republicans who are looking for a change, to turn the page from the former president. But it's far from certain whether this is the majority or the base of the party. And we've seen the base of this party react again and again to Donald Trump. And he has consolidated the base of the party. So in some respects, they liked Senator Scott, but they're not yet seen him as a presidential candidate. So the big question here, is the Senator really going to draw a distinction with the front runner, who is unquestionably Donald Trump? So, yes, there's respect and admiration but, quite frankly, they don't know all that much about him yet. That's why he's here, beginning to campaign against the rest of the Republican field. And ironically,, Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor, who appointed Senator Scott to the Senate, first of all, before he was elected in his own right, she's also running for president.

So his biography, his roots tells an American story that he really leans into.And we could see that in the video that he released this morning. And he's doing it today for a reason. This is the day, April 12th, that the first shots were fired of the Civil War in his native South Carolina in Charleston Harbor. So he uses that as a metaphor to tell the story of all the opportunities he has been given and afforded in this country. And he really also uses it to speak out against Democrats. He believes the Democratic party has been more divisive. So the short answer is he's different than every other Republican candidate in the race. He has deep respect. He also, though, has some more than $20 million in his federal campaign accounts from his Senate races. No other candidates had that. So it certainly gives him a leg up. So biographically, he's very different.
