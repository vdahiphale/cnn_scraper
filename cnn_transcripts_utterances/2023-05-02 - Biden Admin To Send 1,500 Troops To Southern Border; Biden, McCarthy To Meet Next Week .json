SCIUTTO: Well, right now a manhunt is underway after a third stabbing near the University of California Davis campus, all this in just a week. This was the crime scene overnight there. Authorities now say a female is in critical condition after being stabbed multiple times. Last week, two other people were stabbed to death. A 50-year-old man at a nearby Central Park on Thursday and a UC Davis student at Sycamore Park on Saturday night. Police say the suspect is male with long curly hair, around 5'6\" to five 5'9\" inches tall. At the time he was last seen wearing a black or blue sweatshirt carrying a brown backpack. Police also say, though, it's too early in the investigation to tell if all of these crimes are necessarily connected. Sadly, that's not the only manhunt we're following. Several are underway across the country as we speak. Two escapees from a Mississippi jail, they are still on the run. There were originally four of them, you remember, one was caught in Texas. Another dead in a burning building after an altercation with police. And in Texas, U.S. border control is on the lookout for the man accused of murdering five people in Cleveland, Texas. Three manhunts we're talking about here. CNN Security Correspondent, Josh Campbell. He's been following this story. So Josh, just to help people keep track, let's talk about the manhunt for the man who believes - is believed to have fled possibly back to Mexico after shooting these people, his neighbors in effect. How are authorities responding to that possibility, right? I mean, we already know he entered the country, I believe, four times illegally prior, shows some ability to go back and forth across that border. Do they think that's what's happened here?",

      "sentences": "Yes, you're spot on, Jim? And that is the main concern here. I'm told by a law enforcement source that border control officers on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border are on alert. They've been briefed on this case. They have the suspect, Francisco Oropeza's photograph and they are on the lookout.And just as you mentioned, we're learning from a law enforcement source with Immigration and Customs Enforcement that there were those four separate instances in the past where the suspect had made his way to the United States, was deported and then came back. That was in March of 2009, six months later in September. He's, again, deported from the United States. Then in January of 2012, he's once again deported. In that same year, he's convicted of a DWI and served some amount of jail time. But just some four years later, he's again back in the U.S. and then deported again. And so it gets to what you just said, Jim, that authorities are concerned that because he's so adept at making that crossing between Mexico and the United States and the fact that he is a Mexican national who could have a support network there, that he may have tried to flee after allegedly committing this heinous act. So again, border officials certainly on high alert. I'm also told that the U.S. government is actively messaging to media in Mexico about this $80,000 reward for information leading to his apprehension. They're concerned that if there are people in Mexico who knows - know where he is, they want you to pick up the phone. You could be the collector of an $80,000 reward if you provide that information. Finally, back here in the United States, just northeast of Houston in Cleveland, where these murders took place. Authorities there are still fanning out some 250 law enforcement officers conducting what's called the grid searches. They're basically trying to go, leave no stone unturned for any area where he might have fled to. They're also going, Jim, door to door, knocking on doors asking residents have you seen this person asking if they had doorbell camera footage that authorities can review just to see if they get some glimpse of him. Authorities say they're receiving a lot of tips from the public, particularly after that reward was announced. But as of this point that we know of, no credible lead, so authorities are certainly concerned that this very armed and dangerous suspect is still on the loose, Jim?",

Let's pick up where Josh Campbell just left off, the search for Francisco Oropeza, 38 years old, believed to have massacred his neighbors, including a nine-year-old child.

So what does that actually look like?Well, it's hard to say for sure, but it's very easy to see why there would be mayhem on markets in Wall Street, because for the longest time, U.S. debt had been treated as the safest stuff on the planet. So we could see stocks plunge, interest rates spike. By how much? I don't think anyone actually knows. The U.S. credit rating would likely get downgraded severely. And Moody's Analytics says that even just a brief breach of the debt limit would cause a mild recession and nearly a million jobs would get wiped out. Plus, there's the fact that if the government doesn't have any money, they can't pay the benefits that so many people rely on. You think about Social Security, Medicare, paychecks for military, for federal employees, all of this, I think explains why Sen. Elizabeth Warren, she told me today that Congress can't play political games with the debt ceiling. It's just too dangerous. Listen to what she have to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): We cannot be seen around the world to be a government that maybe will pay our debts and then again maybe we won't. No. People around the world count on the United States word as its bond. So we need the Republicans to just raise the debt ceiling. And look, if they want to negotiate over spending, bring it on.

Seditious conspiracy is the most serious.But there are other obstruction charges, conspiracy charges, charges about assaulting police officers, all that the Proud Boys, the five leaders of the Proud Boys are accused of doing on January 6th or around that day. Today in court, the jury was very diligent. They asked a question this morning. They asked actually a couple of questions. But the main one that consumed much of the court's time today was what to do if the jury can't reach a verdict. Their notes specifically ask: \"We did not receive instructions on what to do if the jury does not reach unanimity on a charge. How should we proceed in this scenario?\" So they're asking that question about what to do. And it took the court hours to figure out exactly what to say. This is a court that has been treading very carefully. This trial has gone on for several months, four months or so. It's really sucked up a lot of resources. The jury has been very diligent in asking questions. They've asked other questions about the law, about riot shields. They've wanted to see evidence and now they're suggesting that maybe they can't come to some sort of unanimity. But the judge in this case, he talked to the lawyers for some time about what to do, got a little bit frustrated, and then ultimately arrived at a decision telling them, keep at it, try to get to a verdict and we are still going to be waiting.
