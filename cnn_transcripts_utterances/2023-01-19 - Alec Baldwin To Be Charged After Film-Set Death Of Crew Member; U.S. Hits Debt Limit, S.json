These are very serious charges in voluntary manslaughter against both Baldwin and the set's armorer. And she says that looking at various pieces of evidence, including Alec Baldwin, in her view, pulling the trigger on that weapon. There's been debate about that.Alec Baldwin has previously said that he never pulled the trigger on that gun, but law enforcement here actually sent that firearm to Quantico at the FBI Laboratory, they conducted a forensic exam and determined that with the gun cocked, this revolver, there's no way it could have fired without pulling the trigger. So the prosecutor noted that to me in the interview. She also talked about just this pattern of unsafe practices in her view on this set. And there's been this question about, well, what role does an actor have in actually assuring the safety of the set and that the gun that they're handed is actually free and clear. We've heard Alec Baldwin, we've heard for that matter other actors saying that that is the role of the armorer, someone else that when an actor is handed a weapon, they trust that that is actually a cold gun. But what we learned in my interview with the district attorney is something we didn't know before and that is they actually consulted other actors, other outside experts who had a very different view. Take a listen to that part of the interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARMACK-ALTWIES: This is really about justice for Halyna Hutchins. We've talked to many actors, a-list and otherwise that have said that they always check their guns, that - or they have someone check it in front of them.

She has been emotional about the tragedy, but has committed no crime. Now finally, what happens next, the DA told me that she expects these charges would be - will be filed against those two individuals by the end of this month and then they will go through the process either coming here to New Mexico or perhaps by video conference actually appearing and we assume that they will enter not guilty pleas and then the wheels of justice will start. We'll see where this prosecution goes. And just as importantly, these are allegations, these are not, obviously, statements of fact yet. They haven't been tested by the judicial system.

Josh Campbell asked the DA this question. She said I don't know how those live rounds got onto the set. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean the prosecution's case is over, but that's a major factual issue. The defense lawyer is going to stand in front of a jury someday and say they want you to convict my client, they can't even tell you how those live rounds got there. And then the other thing that's really important is this happened on a movie set. Most normal people do not know what the norms are on a movie set, I certainly don't. So you end up in a scenario where you're going to hear from experts like Scott. And if you look at even just on our air today on CNN, we've had multiple experts, armorers, prop masters who said very different things about what the obligation of an actor is or the obligation of other professionals on a set are. And remember, this is a criminal case, you need all 12 jurors to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

I think with an actor, Scott just explained, if a jury hears Scott's testimony, Alec Baldwin is not going to be guilty as an actor because it's not his responsibility independently to look at the gun.Now, the question about producer that gets into questions of what exactly was Alec Baldwin's job, what were his responsibilities as it relates to the many other directors, producers professionals on that set. And look, sometimes people are producers in name, sometimes big names like Alec Baldwin are called producers or executive producer producers, but they're not actually in charge of things in a hands-on way. All of these are complex, factual issues and, again, people need to keep in mind this is not a civil proceeding, this is a criminal proceeding. There is the highest burden in our legal system on prosecutors. They have to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt and unanimously to the jury, it's never easy, and I think it's going to be particularly difficult here.",

It's up to Congress to compromise on the debt crisis.CNN Business Correspondent Rahel Solomon is here. So explains what happens now that we've hit the debt ceiling. RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Okay. So extraordinary measures essentially means the government is shifting funds, moving money around so that we can pay our bills. So that buys us about four months, gets us into the early summer. But what would actually happen if we defaulted on our debt? Well, one, the rates for government debt would go up, which would mean rates for all of our consumer borrowing would also likely go up. Think about small business loans, think about student loans, auto loans, also housing, mortgage rates would likely go up. One estimate from third wave putting it at potentially an additional $130,000 to an average new 30 year mortgage and then we would also guys see a pretty significant impact to the markets. Third Way also saying the typical worker nearing retirement could lose $20,000 in their 401K. So the impacts here could be really significant. Also important to stress, this has never happened before and many people do not expect it to happen now, but the threat of getting dangerously close is certainly there. So I spoke to Greg Valliere, a market strategist who tries to explain Washington policies and how Washington policies impact Wall Street. And what he told me is that \"this will end up being the most serious debt crisis in the nation's history. There will be a credible risk of default and it may not be resolved until the very last minute.\" So until we get to that last minute, well, the government will have its hands full. But what about us, guys? Should we do anything differently? I talked to Professor Jeremy Siegel. He's a prominent professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. And when I asked him - and I should say, by the way, he also does not expect us to default on our loans, on our on our debt - he said he would not change investments. He would not make any major money moves on this. But also guys, the likelihood that the next few months becomes tense and potentially volatile for the markets is high.",

It's why in his tenure, we have reduced the deficit by historic $1.7 trillion that - the highest on record. So he understands that we have to be paying our bills. It's why he's proposed in - making our tax code, fairer, ensuring that the Treasury Department and the IRS have the resources they need to crack down on tax sheets. This is a different thing. This is about Congress making good on paying for the legislation, and the bills and the obligations that has already passed. Since 1960, Congress has raised the debt ceiling 78 times, 49 times with Republican presidents, 29 times with Democratic presidents, this should not be up to negotiation. The closer we get to what Janet - Secretary Yellen outlined as the X date, that's when these extraordinary measures no longer work, we have no more, the more costly it'll become for the U.S. taxpayer, for the federal government. In 2011, when the Obama administration and Congress got close, they were very close, we saw that the credit rating for the United States government was downgraded, and that increased borrowing costs. So it's irresponsible to even contemplate not paying the bills, Congress should just raise the debt ceiling and we can have further conversations about the right spending packages to put forward, how to address the deficit, how to address the debt, but this is not that conversation.",

[15:20:01] ROUSE:         Well, honestly - well, we've been to the 11th hour and we know that that can cause some, perturbations in the financial markets. Again, when the credit rating for the U.S. government is downgraded, that means our borrowing costs are higher. As you - as your - as you discussed in the opening, that can cause increases in interest rates, make borrowing costs higher for the federal government, it can make borrowing costs higher for others. And so it will cause financial - it can generate some financial instability both here and around the globe. But we have - we don't like to get there. Really Congress should just act now, let's get past this. Why even cause in this period where we've had tremendous success in our recovery from the pandemic-induced recession, where we have inflation that is too high, but which is easing. Our economy is on the right path. Inflation is easing. We see the unemployment is at the lowest it's been in 50 years. The Federal Reserve appears to be on track to achieve a soft-dish landing, but we know there were threats: Russia's unprovoked war on Ukraine, China's reopening, so why introduce another level of uncertainty?

At this point today, though, the Supreme Court is acknowledging that this leak investigation has, in fact, hit this dead end.They've done 126 formal interviews with 97 employees. But at this point, they say they are still unable to identify the person responsible for that leak that really did rock the Supreme Court and stung the country about eight weeks before Roe v. Wade was officially overturned. And you mentioned it, part of the reason it may be so difficult to pinpoint the person or people responsible is that this investigation specifically uncovered that it was 80 people who received digital copies of the draft. That was between February and March of last year. When they interviewed employees, 34 of those employees who got the draft, they admitted printing out copies. Many of those people printed out more than one copy and yes, several did say that they shared the results with their spouses presumably in confidentiality. So this draft was really widely distributed and yet despite months of forensic analysis here, interviews, they have not been able to determine who did it. Despite that, though, the marshal of the court, Gail Curley, she did say this, she said that \"In time, continued investigation and analysis may produce additional leads that could identify the source of the disclosure. Whether or not any individual is ever identified as the source of the disclosure, the Court should take action to create and implement better policies to govern the handling of court-sensitive information and determine the best IT systems for security and collaboration.\" And to that end, guys, the court even brought in former homeland security secretary and former federal judge and U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff and what he did, he assessed the Marshalls' investigation here. He agreed it was thorough, but that many changes still need to be made, even though they really haven't found the leaker here. That includes several changes like restricting who gets those hard copies of those drafts since we saw that it was about 80 people, restricting who's on the email distribution list for digital copies. And crucially here, limiting access of sensitive documents on mobile devices, because this leak, of course, happened in the midst of the pandemic. So the court marshal is acknowledging here that there were in fact some gaps in security protocols that did emerge when people worked from home. So Alisyn and Victor, this leak really has drastically changed the way that this Court operates and will continue to change the way it operates. But the takeaway today is that almost nine months after this leak, the person responsible still has not been identified. They may continue to investigate if more pops up, but it's possible we may never know the identity of this leaker, guys.",
