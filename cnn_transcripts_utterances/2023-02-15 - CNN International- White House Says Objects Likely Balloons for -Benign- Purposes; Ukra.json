Given the limited information that they have, officials believe that their balloons serving commercial or otherwise benign purpose. CNN's Oren Liebermann has more from the Pentagon. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After days of uncertainty about the flying objects in North American airspace, the White House puts forward its leading theory: balloons for benign purposes. Following a classified briefing on Capitol Hill, senators from both parties feel at ease, but blasted the Biden administration for not being transparent about the objects. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): The briefing was helpful today. Again, I'm not unnerved by anything. I'm confident this wasn't, you know, an attack on the country. I think it probably served the country well to have the president explain what's going on. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-(CT): There is a lot of information presented to us this morning that could be told to the American people without any harm to sources or methods or our national security. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): The spate of shootdowns revealing new complications like what happens if a fighter jet misses its target. Top U.S. general confirming the first missile, AIM-9 Sidewinder, missed the object over Lake Huron. GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN, U.S. JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: The missile landed harmlessly in the water of Lake Huron. We only tracked it all the way down, and we made sure that the airspace was clear of any commercial or civilian or recreational traffic.",

They have gathered using data, things like social media, satellite imagery and in some cases direct contact with sources, parents even. So, they have a lot of evidence and they say that the problem could be a lot bigger than even this report details.What they say that they've identified more than 6,000 children who at some point in the last year were in Russian custody in one of these so-called camps. They say that they found 43 facilities, 41 of which are actually camps, two more they say facilities associated with the deportation as reported. Orphans even more disturbing. The primary focus of the camps they say is the political reeducation of these children, so exposing them to sort of Russian centric material pictures and cultural. And in two cases actual military education including the use of firearms. Take a listen to what Ned Price, the State Department spokesman had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: The network of facilities which the children are sent is vast, spanning from Russia occupied Crimea, across Russia itself, from the Black Sea region to its far east. Putin seeks to rob Ukraine of its future by taking its children. Russia's system of force relocations, reeducation, and adoption of Ukraine's children is a key element of the Kremlin's systematic efforts to deny and suppress Ukraine's identity, its history, and its culture.

We do our best to keep minors and families and in case of absence or death of parents and relatives -- to transfer orphans under guardianship. We ensure the protection of their lives and well-being. Now the report does note that in some cases these children were taken to camps with the consent of their parents, but also questions the ability of parents to give that kind of consent in the context of war and it notes other cases where children were kept -- whose status was unknown and whose stays were sort of extended by even several weeks.",
