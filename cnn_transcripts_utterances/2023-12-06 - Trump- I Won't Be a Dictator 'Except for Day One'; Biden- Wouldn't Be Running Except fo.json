He completely deflected and kind of made a joke out of it. I want to be very clear here, Donald Trump, we've done a lot of reporting on this as have many other outlets, does have a lot of plans for the Justice Department. But these aren't just reports. He said this publicly, repeatedly, that if he were re-elected, he would want to bring the Justice Department underneath the presidential control, try to give the executive branch far more power with that, and that he would use the Justice Department to go after his enemies. So I think that's very important, to be clear. And you mentioned that, you know, there's an intensifying scrutiny on a lot of these second-term plans. I don't think it's his record -- his rhetoric, excuse me, that is intensifying. This is the same type of language that Donald Trump has really been using since he announced that he was running for election last November. [06:05:18] But it's getting a lot more attention now, because Donald Trump is dominating in the polls. He's not just doing well in the early states. He's doing well in polls nationwide. And that's leading a lot of people to realize, OK, what could a second term look like? What are we actually -- you know, what could the country be facing if he is back in office? And that's where I think a lot of this is coming from.",

And why he said, If Trump wasn't running, I'm not sure I'd be running. One top campaign adviser said to CNN after that, Yikes. KATE BEDINGFIELD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I'm not sure why. That's exactly what Joe Biden said in 2019 when he was contemplating getting into the race, and then when he got into the race. He said that he felt that Trump was such an existential threat to the country that he felt an obligation to run to try to defeat him. I was there as we were putting together the building blocks of the campaign in 2019 and as he was making the decision to run. And that was very much his mindset. And if you go back and look, you'll see that he said it then. So this comment wasn't a reflection of his view of his own fitness to run.

This is not an argument that appeals to moderate voters, to swing voters, because it isn't about their lives. So this is my second point. If you look at the headlines coming out of this town hall we did last night, there's really nothing about what he would do about people's health care. By the way, take it away is what he said. Nothing about what he would do about health care. Nothing about what he would do about prices. No vision for what the country would do for middle class families under Donald Trump. It's all, you know -- it's all these soundbites about Al Capone and, you know, being a dictator on day one, which is red meat for his base but is not appealing to independent suburban voters -- GARCIA-NAVARRO: But I don't think that's true.",

I'm going to fight for you, but also, he seems like someone who is going to actually make change. And many people in this country at the moment want change.",

That's the other dynamic in this race that doesn't, I think, get appreciate as much as it should, as much as will it actually have an impact on the ultimate outcome here.He is also an incumbent. He doesn't get to stride in and make challenger promises in the way he did in 2016. He has four years that he's going to be held accountable for. And so when he has an opportunity like last night and his message is entirely about him and what he would do with his power and how it impacts him, that isn't an appealing message. I'm not saying he doesn't have an argument on the economy. But I think that for him to actually get to a place where he can grow his vote total, it can't be solely about his own grievance politics, and that's kind of what you saw from him last night.",
