I'll tell you what we've learned about the questions that will decide who gets to sit in the jury box for Trump's hush money trial.Plus, Donald Trump throws some of his fervent supporters under the bus. Why his statement on abortion could cost him Republican votes come November. And women's basketball celebrating record viewership for last night's NCAA championship game. And while South Carolina established itself as a true dynasty, now there's a warning for Caitlin Clark and her future. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" All right, now raise your hand if you want jury duty. Okay, we'll keep them up if you want to be on the jury for the first criminal trial against a former president. Now I see some hands. Well, today might be your lucky day because I've got the questions that potential jurors are going to have to answer to possibly be selected for jury duty in that hush money trial. Now the trial is actually set for one week from tonight, on April 15th, for jury selection. Now mind you, Trump is trying again to get that trial date push back, claiming that he would not get an impartial jury. Well, no dice. The appeals court judge said no. What's going on in April 15th? This is the trial, just to keep everything straight for you, the one in New York where the former president is accused of falsifying business records to cover up an alleged affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels. And make no mistake about it. Who is ultimately on that jury is arguably the most important part of the trial. You're going to hear some of those questions in just a moment. I want you to ask yourself why you're hearing them. Would I make it on to the jury or would I not? Do you even want to be on this jury? And we've got some more legal news out tonight on the former president. Special Counsel Jack Smith urging the Supreme Court to throw out his claims of sweeping immunity, claims that they say have no grounding in the Constitution or in our understanding that no one, not even a president, is above the law. He wrote, \"The severity, range. and democracy-damaging nature of the alleged crimes are unique in American history.\" That doesn't and hasn't stopped Trump from demanding immunity. I mean, over and over and over. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And what I saw in the pleadings is Jack Smith is worried not about losing on the absolute immunity question, but the possibility that they'll say there is some zone where he does have immunity.

And it was clear to me that he was a little bit wishy-washy on the line he was willing to draw.But he was still saying he would vote for or rather he would defend life. And I think this is a true step backward. And I'm sure the strategy is to moderate on what he considers to be a more divisive issue. But it's not as though Donald Trump has ever had an issue taking a bold and divisive stand when he believed that it was either right to do or right politically.

There are still too many questions outstanding. There are a lot of things he hasn't taken a stance on, such as he did not say if there is some kind of federal legislation and he's president, would he sign or veto it?

How is he going to vote on that choice between the current six-week ban and a more liberal standard that goes up to the point of viability? What about the medication abortion ban that the Supreme Court is considering right now?

They've actually been doing that for a while. But now, this leaves people no excuse because we saw the women set three ratings record in one week. It started with LSU and Iowa. There was the rematch game in the elite eight. That at the time, most- watched women's basketball game ever. Then four days later, that record stood for four days. And when Iowa faced UConn, a premier program in women's college basketball and has been for decades now, that set another records rating. And so, for Sunday to be the culmination of everything we've seen from this season, the last few years, and frankly, since the beginning of this game in many respects, because there were a lot of players, a lot of pioneers who suffered through indignity after indignity to get to this point and to see women's basketball putting up an NFL-like rating. Just for context, you mentioned some great numbers. This average -- this game averaged more viewers than all of last year's NBA finals.
