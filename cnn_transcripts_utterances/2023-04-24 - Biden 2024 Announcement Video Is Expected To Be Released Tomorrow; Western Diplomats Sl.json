He announced on April 25th of 2019 that he was going to run for president. And we are expecting that a similar announcement is going to be made tomorrow.But this time, it will be his reelection bid. And he -- but he said that he is going to do so in a video. Again, very similar to how he did this before. And so, everyone is on pins and needles, really waiting for this announcement to come. Is it a surprise? Not really. He has been saying that he plans and intends to run. What we're missing is the announcement. So, advisors have been working on this around the clock. They were doing so over the weekend while the president was in Camp David. And so, now, we're nearing the state when this is supposed to come down. The key now, the difference now, of course, is that when he announces this, it's not just looking at his predecessor, it's also looking at his own agenda. And so, we're anticipating how he starts -- starts to discern himself not only from his predecessor but what he has already done and how he plans to move forward.",

Remember, he is the oldest American president in U.S. history.And so, when you look at all of that together, it obviously raises some concerns for people in terms of how old he would be at the end of a second term, and that's what the NBC News poll really showed us. Advisers know this. His allies know this. But at the end of the day, they still see him as a steady hand. That's what Senator Amy Klobuchar said to our Dana Bash at state of the union, saying, you know, they don't -- voters don't want the -- what she said, chaos of the Trump administration.

We are at the prospect of another Biden-Trump presidential race, particularly at the prospect of Trump becoming victorious in that because, you know, Trump, he reflects so much Kremlin talking points, whether it's about multinational organizations like NATO or anything like that or about solving the war in Ukraine, and that's music to the years of the Kremlin.

Remember, a few years ago, Bob Iger, the CEO, while the successful CEO stepped down, retired, Bob then stepped up, became CEO. He was then fired very quickly. Then, Bob Iger came back. So, part of this is also Bob Iger's plan to transform the company, try to right the ship. He said that he is trying to save $5.5 billion in cost. This is part of that. So, this latest round of layoffs is the largest so far. It brings total layoffs of about 4000. But we know this is not the end. We expect another round of layoffs, which will ultimately bring us to about 7,000. I should say it should impact ESPN. It will not, however, and some of its other entertainment divisions, it will not, however, affect its frontline employees at the theme parks, et cetera.",

The -- he has his allies and his allies rallied on this issue, but when you look at the Republicans in a broader way, they are not so pleased with this. I mean, this is not necessarily where the Republican Party veers, right, by getting involved in private businesses. And big corporations, especially ones that are massive employers despite the layoffs in the state of Florida. So, you know, we are seeing pushback from Republicans. Donald Trump has gone after him for this. Chris Christie has mentioned it. So, is it an issue that he's going to cling on to going forward, assuming that he does announce his candidacy for 2024?

Frontline workers.We haven't seen it because there is still -- there still is a lot of demand for those type of workers. And there still, according to the latest government data, a lot of demand for those type of workers. But I think you make a very fascinating and valid point that as these layoffs start to mount, will -- will there still be as much demand for those people? And those are the people who you could argue, when you look at the data, their savings have already been depleted, they're already not necessarily making a lot of money, and they're buckling under the weight of higher inflation, higher borrowing costs. So, they are already among the most vulnerable, and we're starting to see layoffs mount in those areas.

The reason why is because in a -- in the coming days, on May 11th, a COVID Arab border restriction known as Title 42 is going to expire. That has allowed authorities to turn away certain migrants at the U.S. southern border.And in a moment of unprecedented mass migration in the western hemisphere, there is concern about what it looks like when we go back to our traditional protocols. And inevitably, that may mean a surge of migrants at the border. So, I have been talking to sources over the last few days. Even today, many sources, who already spoke to White House officials and DHS officials who are getting out in front of it, were noticing a shift in strategy as they try to tell members of Congress and their staff what those preparations look like because they have already faced criticism before when they didn't share enough, and everybody was surprised by the numbers and the policies. So, that's what I'm keeping an eye out. What are those preparations look like? What are they going to say this week when they're only days away from a really critical moment and on an issue that is a political vulnerability for President Biden.",

And more broadly, the military situation in Ukraine. I know we've sort of like -- it's all faded into the background a little bit. But there's about to be a massive military push in Ukraine with the Ukrainians, with all the American weapons.
