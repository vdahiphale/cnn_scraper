Also, at least eight of Donald Trump's Cabinet picks and appointees have been targeted with bomb threats or swatting. What the FBI is saying tonight. And there's been a lot of concern and urgency over RFK Jr.'s controversial stances, from vaccines to milk to taking fluoride out of America's drinking water. Our source, tonight, takes us behind the science, and says there's a better way to have those conversations. I'm Boris Sanchez, in for Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Workers in the federal government might have been nervous, when President-elect Donald Trump announced the creation of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency. But now there's a new fear. Becoming the target of one of its founders, who also happens to be the billionaire owner of SpaceX, Tesla and X. Last week, in between a litany of other messages, Elon Musk reposted a pair of posts that called out, by name, people holding for relatively obscure government positions. The information is available through public online databases. But targeting people in front of his more than 200 million followers on X is now terrifying federal workers. Some current federal employees, are telling CNN, the threat of being in Musk's crosshairs might even drive them from their jobs entirely. They're afraid of being physically threatened. Musk has gained more power than he had already, since Election Day, becoming a fixture at the side of the President-elect, with input on transition decisions, and even sitting in on Trump's call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. It's a relationship and an influence that some have questioned. But former Trump aide, Steve Bannon says, quote, \"Elon and I disagree on some things. But Elon deserves his place at the table. Look, he stroked a $150 million check for the ground game, which is not sexy, at the exact moment we needed it. He came in with the money and the professionals. To be brutally frank, it's the reason we won.\" And Trump's rewarded Musk since, by naming him Co-chair of DOGE, along with Vivek Ramaswamy, both of them getting big shout-outs at Mar-a- Lago.

There will be drastic impacts, right, not only on the workers, but on the services that the American people rely upon. For example, we're talking about cutting 75 percent of the workers at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Those aren't Washington bureaucrats. We're talking about cutting doctors and nurses, and those who schedule appointments and administer benefits for the American veterans. Where Mr. Musk need to focus, is about $759 billion that the government had paid for service contracts, right? Just service contracts. Now, that's compared to $270 billion that goes out to federal employees, and paying benefit each year. Not contracts for materials and equipment and planes, you know? And I'm asking every American to convey this, to their elected official, and ask them to really look at what the federal employees are doing, to provide the services for the American people versus government contract.

And Professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law, Kim Wehle. Thank you all for being with us. Erin, first to you. There's obviously an argument to be made for making the government more efficient. I do wonder if targeting individual federal workers is the most efficient way to do that. Is it even appropriate? ERIN PERRINE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, AXIOM STRATEGIES, FORMER DIRECTOR OF PRESS COMMUNICATIONS, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: I think that we all know the answer to that is no, it's not appropriate. Doxxing people, we're seeing it on both sides, right now, right? You're seeing numbers of the Trump cabinet that are being targeted, that are swatted, that they're having bomb threats called to their house. And then we're putting out the names of federal employees. True, all of that is publicly available. But even in the small world that I've worked in, it's sometimes not that small, I've received online threats. It's not fun. It's not OK. It makes you uncomfortable. It makes you nervous. It makes you wonder if that person in the crowd is somebody who might know who you are, and who hates you. It gets you second-guessing a lot of things. So, people in power really do need to be careful about sharing that kind of information, when you have a large platform. Yes, there is a major case for government efficiency. And yes, I am sure there are plenty of programs and employees that can be cut, to make sure that we are spending taxpayer dollars more appropriately.

And that the Supreme Court has given Donald Trump carte blanche, effectively, to abuse the criminal justice system, under this immunity ruling. But it's really, I think, ironic, we're having a conversation about what Elon Musk is going to do to the federal government. He was not elected. He's not even being nominated for an actual position. As was indicated, DOGE could not be created without an Act of Congress. So, what we're seeing is not only massive pay-to-play, Steve Bannon saying, Listen, he got us elected, so we owe him something, a private individual. But also blurring the lines around the transition, national security, the communications between the Trump transition and the Biden administration. All of these, there are many sort of holes in the system that Donald Trump is pushing and exploiting.

It makes people have these palpitations and fear. The fact is, I mean, you have people who say now, when they get on an airplane, that those pilots must be DEI-hire, simply because of the color of their skin. I believe that individuals who can build rockets are geniuses. I believe people who can take individuals to Mars are geniuses. It doesn't mean that you can't be stupid or ignorant, when it comes to issues of race or issues of making sure that people feel safe or comfortable in their own skin, in this country. There's nothing about Elon Musk, in what he says, regardless of how much money he has, which represents what Abraham Lincoln calls, The Better Angels of Our Nature. And so, his thumbprint is going to be on this government, for the next four years. I read a Semafor article today, about the reason that Chinese state media is fearing people leaving X, because of their investment in going to other social media networks, because of the influence they have over Elon Musk. History books are going to write about the fact that Elon Musk took this country backwards, that my father nearly died in this country, in 1968, being shot by law enforcement, fighting for rights of people who look like me, to be sitting in front of you today. And Elon Musk is working damn hard to take us backwards. The elections have consequences. So God bless you and your state. Down at Mar-a-Lago, you get four years of influence.

So, there -- they are absolutely creating a danger here. We should also note that the burden of this activity is really falling disproportionately on the shoulders of local law enforcement. This is something that police -- police agencies and sheriff's offices deal with, every day, trying to protect the people that are within their jurisdiction. It is so common that they might be pretty sure that a call or an email or a communication along -- that engages in swatting is likely a hoax, but they can't -- they can't just ignore it. They have to conduct some sort of activity to make sure that citizen is not in danger. So, many law enforcement agencies have developed procedures, where they first respond very subtly. They may call the residents, and engage in a conversation. They may send out a small patrol force, to just look at the block and the residents, to understand, to try to develop any intelligence, to see if there's any actual activity going on at that place. And then, of course, bring out the big guns and the SWAT team if that's necessary.

And ultimately, we tracked that activity down to an individual who was actually located in Israel.So, this is -- this is oftentimes, when we are fortunate enough, and work hard enough, and are able to figure out who's behind this activity, we very frequently find it's foreign actors.

Could still happen under the Biden administration, potentially. But if it does happen, and there's a lot of diplomatic work that would have to happen before that, if it does happen, that does not mean that the war has actually ended. What we have to keep in mind is that the Russians, Boris, will probably look at this as being something, where they can take a pause, regroup their forces, and then start the offensive once again. They did it in 2014. They took a piece of Ukraine, Crimea, and part of the Donbas in 2014, and they resumed their operations in 2022. They could do a similar kind of thing, a few years down the road.

But when we look at the kinds of doses that we have in municipal water supplies, in the U.S., there is a lot of evidence of safety. We don't see those kind of effects. And so, that is actually a hard, nuanced thing to explain, that the dose is what's relevant. But we could explain it. I don't think it's impossible for people to understand.
