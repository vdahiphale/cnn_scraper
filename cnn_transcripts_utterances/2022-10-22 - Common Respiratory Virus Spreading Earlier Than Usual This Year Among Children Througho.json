Some researchers are working on a vaccine for infants as well as for pregnant women, so that's something to look forward to in the future. For premature babies, there are monoclonal antibodies that can be given preventively, monthly during RSV season. So there are some options, but really there's no good preventive at this time except for handwashing and avoiding sick people. Use common sense.

And it's really hard for the Democratic Party to go forward with this. It is also important to understand that not only his fate but this ideological struggle, I think, is really fascinating. Nury Martinez who stepped out as the city council president probably is closer to Rick Caruso, the white former Republican running for mayor, on issues of order and public safety than she is to Karen Bass. And the conflict that was coming in the city council was between the forces who believed, like Caruso, that the city is losing control of its public spaces, and more liberals that have won a bunch of primaries, including beating Gil Cedillo. So that fissure seemed to be emerging. Now it's been sort of pushed back by this new controversy.

The Democratic Party is much more of a coalition than the Republican Party, 85 percent of Donald Trump's votes came from whites. White Christians are still two-thirds of the Republican Party. The Democratic Party now is essentially one-third white Christians, one-third nonwhite Christians, and one-third people who are religiously secular.And so managing the needs and desires and even just the raw quests for power of all these different constituency parts is always challenging. I still think that -- and there is some evidence of anti-black prejudice among Latino voters that has become more relevant in the last few years, and partially as you see more conservative Latinos voting for Trump despite open appeals to white racial resentment. But I still think that in the long run, the bigger divide, the one that is going to influence municipal politics and urban politics in more cities around the country is the one that is being somewhat overshadowed by this, and that is the kind of London Breed, Adams in New York, Caruso here, the belief that cities have to do more to restore order in the communities, deal with homelessness, deal with crime. And I think that is where the council is likely to fissure more over the next few years.
