And not just because the war of Ukraine but also because we are facing other challenges like the climate crisis. The growing artificial intelligence which is going to change a lot in our societies, et cetera. So I think these values, it's very important that we are going to have this summit, the fourth summit in the history of Council of Europe to really reaffirm and recommit to those values (ph). But also setting a future mission for the council. Now when it comes to the bilateral relations, as I said, they are good. And we talked about opportunities, for example, when it comes to carbon capture, sharing research, knowledge and innovation when it comes to harnessing geothermal and hydro. And I think we can say that we look forward to working more closely together in these issues. I think there are a lot of opportunities, not least when it comes to research and innovation in that sector. And when it comes to the climate crisis, we really need to do our very best to share all the knowledge we have to really stand up to that challenge. Now I also want to mention that we have -- also had great examples of cooperation within multilateral organizations. I want to especially mention the case in the Human Rights Council recently, when our foreign ministers took leadership in the defense of protesters in Iran. And there might be other areas and avenues where our countries could work together. So I'm happy to take questions and happy to be here and looking forward to our continued cooperation. QUESTION (through translator):  The decision today, could you tell us what this package means? The 14 values (ph) and the package and materials, what does it mean, who is going to pay for it? Do you expect that it will be a second phase of it further tanks and do you -- are you worried that there will be an escalation from the Russian side? OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator):  I cannot tell you anything about the cost but are going to carry that ourselves. I mean, that's how it works so far as well. And we undertook that we will have a very effective, efficient, that we are going to provide official materiel. In this case, it is the tanks and also matters like training and ammunition and repairs, maintenance. We are going to take responsibility for that as well. We are in agreement with our close partners. But this is not a press conference (INAUDIBLE).",

And I think that has been important for all of us, not just those within the E.U. because the war is really an aggression, which puts everything out of order when it comes to human rights, democracy, because peace is, of course, a precondition for all of that. And I think this is what has created solidarity within Europe. Now Iceland is not planning to enter the E.U., at least not in the next years and it is not on the agenda for my government. However, we emphasize our relation with Europe and with the E.U. And they have proven to be very good. And we think of Europe as our closest friends and allies, the European countries within the outside of the E.U. And we, of course, enjoy a great cooperation within the E.U. agreement.

They are talking about unity, solidarity between the two countries but also importantly what Iceland is doing with regards to working with the European Union in the fight and the war with Russia and Ukraine. It's important to note that the chancellor spoke about the deployment of Leopard 2 tanks, that Germany will carry the cost. Not speaking too much about this. Just a few hours ago, Germany made the official announcement that they will be sending Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and also opening the door for other countries to do the same. We have Nic Robertson tracking developments for us from London. We also have Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon for us. Good to see you, Nic. I want to start with you, not many words on the Leopard 2s but we have heard quite a bit about of those over the past couple of hours. It is also important to know that we are waiting for the United States to make an official announcement. We've heard from two officials that the U.S. will be sending Abrams tanks.

The timing, as you pointed out, the question of logistics, maintenance, all of this goes into that. While we expect Leopards may arrive faster on the battlefield because they are ready to go, the question of Abrams is one we expect will take much longer. That is because of the question of training, not only on the operation but also on the maintenance and logistics side. On top of, that is the training for Ukrainian forces on all of the other systems they already need to learn. Remember, they are already learning Patriot missile systems; they need to learn how to use the U.K.'s Challenger 2 tanks. They need to learn the new Paladin howitzers the U.S. has provided. They are also learning how to fight in a different, a bigger way, the combined arms training that started in Germany. On top of all of that has now been added the Leopards, as well as the question of, when training on M1 Abrams tanks will happen. It's our understanding and it's unlikely that we will see the Abrams come directly from U.S. stocks, which means you either have to procure them under the Ukraine security assistance initiative, meaning you need to buy new Abrams tanks, or pull them from a third country. That will take time, that gives the U.S. the time and the space needed to provide the training on how to operate them, how to maintain them and how to create a logistics tale for these, essentially how to make sure you have what you need to run these. That question gives them the time available, months, perhaps, to teach Ukrainian forces how to operate the Abrams before they enter the battlefield, much more likely to see the Leopards, from not only Germany but other countries as well appear in Ukraine first.

We had the U.S. Defense Secretary on the ground in Germany. There was not much word from Olaf Scholz either with regard to this. It seems to be that very big sticking point. You had said it was the wrong decision. You tweeted today that finally this decision has come through. But you also said the chancellor's non-communicating has weakened our reputation in Europe.

A signal of unity, an often clear decision. But we should look forward. The key question is, what is the war aim (ph)? And Chancellor Scholz's pursuing the aim, Ukraine must not lose.

There were no budget or any other political (ph) support or budget support for this for our industries. So they waited 10 months and when (ph). And this decision of today will take another three months before the delivery of the first package. So our neighbors could start with the training of the teams and could start a little earlier than Germany. But this is a clear signal and message. But the key is that the United States are ready, not only to show that they stand to Germany. The Americans could also have said, well, you have the heavy tanks in Europe and we provide you for the combined warfare, with infantry (ph) fighting vehicles. Imagine, now the Americans are ready to deliver 70-ton heavy tanks over 8,000 kilometers. But here are 2,000 Leopard tanks in Europe available, several hundreds will go to Ukraine. So we should much more appreciate the American contribution in other areas, also in infantry fighting vehicles but also in artillery and reconnaissance, in also special advice and certain questions. So I believe we should now look forward. And Germany should learn its lesson, that it is better to have a strategic foresight and early decision- making processes instead of giving the impression to being pressed.

The U.K. is calling it the right decision, while Poland hailed it as, quote, \"a big step toward stopping Russia.\" The Russian ambassador to Germany, however, warns it takes the war to a new level. The Pentagon is also working on plans to send about 30 tanks to Ukraine. That's according to two U.S. officials, talking with CNN. The chief of staff for Ukraine's president called Germany's decision a first step but reminded world leaders, Ukraine needs a lot of tanks. And that's not all Kyiv wants. As it says, Russia is gearing up for a spring offensive. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Even as fighting rages in Eastern Ukraine, Russian forces are making little headway. Vladimir Putin recently appointed his military chief, Valery Gerasimov, to lead the war in Ukraine, yet another reshuffle in the hierarchy. The deputy head of Ukraine's defense intelligence tells me he believes Putin realizes his entire command structure is in disarray. VADYM SKIBITSKIY, UKRAINIAN DEPUTY HEAD OF DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE (through translator):  He really does have problems with the command both at the top level, the generals and at the bottom level of platoon or company commander. That issue is generally very problematic. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Another problem:  those marginal gains Russia is making come mostly from mercenaries of the Wagner private military company around Bakhmut, where Wagner has been gaining ground while suffering severe losses themselves. Wagner's boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has been highly critical of Russia's military leadership, calling them all but incompetent. The Ukrainians say he's made plenty of enemies among the elites. SKIBITSKIY (through translator):  The leadership of the Russian armed forces are going to try to belittle Prigozhin's role and place however they can, so he cannot strengthen his positions in the Kremlin hierarchy.

SKIBITSKIY (through translator):  Right now, they have moved their logistics and control but mainly logistic systems, further away from the front line and that's 80 to 100 to 120 kilometers away. And to strike them, you need longer-range strike systems. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  That would include targets on Russian territory to choke off any future offensive by Moscow forces.
