The concerning piece, as you have very well framed with pictures, is that he was driving around in a car equipped to do so. Not only the weapons, but a collapsible baton with the words carved into it in Arabic, God forgive me, a social media page that displays and this isn't secret information. I went to his social media page and looked. It has a flag that has been used before by al-Qaeda in one of the images. So they have to figure out what's going on with him.

Garland now joins Obama Attorney General Eric Holder and Trump Attorney General William Barr in the history books. In this case, it's for refusing to turn over audio recordings of interviews that President Biden did with the Special Counsel who later declined to prosecute him. The vote was both politically driven and somewhat rich in that one of those pushing hardest for this, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, defied a subpoena to appear before the House January 6th Committee.

But Speaker Mike Johnson said, regardless of what ends up happening or not happening, this was an important step for the House to take. Just listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

It is -- we've spent so much time sitting behind desks, bloviating about what people are thinking out there. And he's going on I'm talking to him and I think it is really, really valuable. This trend is not new. I mean, the fact is that this has been going on for some time, the sort of deterioration of the Democratic support among union workers, even though Democrats have advocated for the interests of union workers more readily than Donald Trump or other Republicans.But this has been going on and it is cultural, as John mentioned, in many ways. Listen, there are 44 new factories in construction. I was just up in Michigan, 44 new factories in construction -- under construction in Michigan. Ask anyone up there if their hours have improved from 2019 to 2024, and the answer is yes because there is more going on, there is a manufacturing renaissance, so Biden has a good case to make. What he can't be doing is trying to jawbone people into thinking that this is the greatest economy we've ever had, and he tends to do that. This country is doing better than others in terms of recovering from the pandemic. But that's cold comfort to people who, as that one gentleman said, go to the store and find that groceries are 20 percent more than they were a few years ago. And Biden needs to recognize that, make common cause with that, talk about the things he's fighting for to reduce costs, many of which Donald Trump opposes, and set up a contrast. By the way, the support of Shawn Fain there is not inconsequential. He is a very, very popular figure among his members, and I think his advocacy in this fight down the stretch could be meaningful for Biden.",
