Thanks for having me. First, I think it's just important to say again, I can't state how unprecedented it is to have both of these leaders on stage together. You know, I spent a lot of time in the intelligence community, and I think as they indicated, certainly this is the first time we've seen this. Look, you know, as these two leaders sit down together, I think the context is important. When we look at the threat environment facing the United States and our partners and allies right now, what we've seen over the past year is that it's been heating up quite consistently. And then, we look at the past 90 days and it's been unusually active across the United States and across Europe with regard to threats from a number of different sources. Look, you know, we look here in the United States in the last couple of months we've seen everything from an Iranian plot to assassinate a former president to unprecedented sabotage efforts on the part of Russia to interfere in our elections. And then, you know, when we look beyond our borders, we see indications that Russia might be planning to sabotage critical communication infrastructure with undersea cables. We look at what happened in Europe over the past couple of weeks with a knife attack that ISIS has claimed credit for, an arson attack on synagogues. So, just when we look at the totality of the threat environment, and that's not even to mention what these gentlemen are going to talk about as it relates to other threats from Russia and China and North Korea. So, it's just a very active threat environment. And so, I think that that makes this the right time to sit down and to have this conversation on the international stage to help both Americans and our partners and allies understand the importance of being vigilant right now. And I think we'll hear that message from both of these leaders.",

But I think that it started several years ago where the thinking is that we need to be more public and more direct and we need to talk about these things more so that people understand that there are active efforts to maintain a strong and civil world order. So, I think that yes, you'll hear some specifics on some of the threats that we're facing. But the big picture here will be that we are joint, and that we're working together, and that we're going to make sure that there's a strong rule of order going forward.",

And just generally, for Democrats, going into November, an issue where they feel they have the advantage over Republicans.And I think part of the challenge for Republicans is that they have been very clear in their intention to limit abortion access across the country, and as we know, this year, engaged in a highly controversial debate even over whether or not women should have access to IVF treatment. So, although you've seen former President Trump try and change his stance, at least on the issue of abortion, it's pretty ingrained, I think, in the psyche of American voters, how Republicans feel about this issue. So, and then, there are Republicans, of course, who have aggressively campaigned as being pro-life and anti-abortion. So, it's a little late in the game to try and convince voters otherwise. You know, what we have seen in our polling at the Wall Street Journal is reflected in polling elsewhere, is that, yes, the economy and inflation do rank as top issues for voters across the country. But abortion also often shows up as a top priority for a significant faction of the public, and oftentimes it's actually abortion that ends up being more of a deal breaker issue. That's why you see the Harris campaign really honing in on the subject and hoping that just like the 2022 midterms, it will factor heavily into how voters turn out at the polls.",

Well, I think we have seen in polling is that, you know, Trump is carrying support from roughly 90 percent of the Republican base, but some polls suggest that there are as many as 10 percent of Republican voters who are looking for an alternative. So, does a Cheney endorsement move that percentage of Republicans to potentially support Harris? Or is that percentage, or is that group of Republicans simply going to vote third party or stay home? I think either of those scenarios is obviously challenging for President Trump in an election that could come down to tens of thousands of votes across a handful of key battleground states. And you've seen Harris directly make an appeal to Republicans and Republican leaning independents. So, I think you know, it's not that it's \"a game changer\" necessarily, to have the endorsement of Dick Cheney, but there is that faction of Republicans that still is opposed to former President Trump. And I think now the choices between Trump and Harris, not Trump and Biden, maybe some more of those voters who are frustrated with their choices up until two months ago, could be compelled to vote for Harris this time around.",

And they organized right outside the main defense headquarters here in Tel Aviv, and today now in other parts of the country, in Jerusalem and in other -- and other major cities around the country.So, I think the expectation is that this sort of weekly Saturday protests will attract more protesters, maybe not as many as Sunday last week, but they are expecting to hear from some family members, wives, relatives of some of the hostages being held. These are very emotive protests because they want the prime minister to change, and he is digging into his position of not making an agreement to bring all the hostages back, which is the core of the protest.",

I mean, several games this year in Europe, now, the first game in South America. American football being introduced, being branded to audiences around the world. And Brazil is a great host. 40,000 plus filling S.C. Corinthian Stadium to watch the Philadelphia Eagles and the Green Bay Packers. They also got to see why Philly made Saquon Barkley one of the highest paid running backs in the league. The long-time New York Giants star stellar in his Eagles debut, scoring two rushing touchdowns and catching another. Green Bay did have a chance late in the game. They were down by five in the final seconds. Packers' fans, avert your eyes. Quarterback Jordan Love going down awkwardly as he was being tackled, had to be helped off the field with what looked like a leg injury. We won't speculate. No word yet on how serious it might be. The Eagles do hold on to win their season opener, 34-29. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NICK SIRIANNI, HEAD COACH, PHILADELPHIA EAGLES: Man, did Brazil get a great game tonight or what?

This one was a classic. Tiafoe taking two of the first three sets, but that's when he started to run out of gas a little bit, and Fritz was just getting started, winning the fourth set, then, really turning on the afterburners in the fifth, taking it 6-1.
