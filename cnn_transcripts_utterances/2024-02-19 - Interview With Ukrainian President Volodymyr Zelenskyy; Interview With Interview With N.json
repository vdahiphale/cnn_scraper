Welcome to the program everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour live in Kyiv, where days away from the second anniversary of this war, there are feelings of urgency and of frustration as American support dries up just as Ukraine needs it most. Probing NATO's staying power, Russia delivered a withering blow to the front line of defeat and its flags are now flying over Avdiivka in the east. Still, Ukraine battles on with fewer weapons, less ammunition, and troops staggering from two years of war. Amid this gloom, the death of the preeminent Putin critic, Alexei Navalny, hit Europe and Ukraine like a bolt of lightning. Speaking on her husband's social media channels, Navalny's widow, Yulia, fired a shot across Washington's bow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YULIA NAVALNAYA, WIDOW OF RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER ALEXEI NAVALNY (through translator): I ask you to share your rage, rage, anger, and hatred with me towards those who are daring enough to kill our future. And I address you with Alexei's words, which I believe it is not a shame to do. It's not a shame to do little, but it's a shame not to do anything. It's a shame to make yourself intimidated.

Your commander said that one of the reasons that they pulled back was in just the last 24 hours, there was some 20 airstrikes, 150 different shells. He said they're trying to erase Avdiivka from the face of the -- from the earth. Do you think this will lead to a snowball of other towns and cities on the front lines collapsing, or what do you expect for the next months and year? ZELENSKYY (through translator): What we expect, we expect to see what has been promised, what we have agreed upon, that we will be able to unblock the skies where the Russians have an advantage. As soon as we can do that, when they no longer control the sky. I think this is what I started at the Munich Conference two years ago, when I said that we need to work a little bit faster and to pay attention to the messages of Ukraine that has a lot of practice in this war. And that's why it is very important. I've been emphasizing this since the very first days of the war to unblock the sky. We have started receiving -- we're grateful to our partners. We've started to receive the air defense systems. Patriot, NASAMS and others, and we have too few of them. I'm not criticizing now, but we have too few of them in order to quickly move ahead. But the decision is very simple, where we had our air defense systems, where we -- at that time, people would come back, they would bring back the economy of a certain town or city, but where we had such systems of air defense, immediately Russia would move back because it would lose its aircraft. So, you ask me what we are expecting if we have those systems and long- range weapons? Because it's only an unfair war. It's unfair in general, but it's unfair in terms of the advantages. If you have artillery with a range of up to 20 kilometers and Russian artillery has the range of up to 40 kilometers, that's the answer. A human being is fighting artillery. That's unfair and it's not modern war ideology. We have to develop technology. We've started doing that. We have to develop to start building drones. I'm sure that what is positive for us and negative for Russia, we will be able to surprise them this year with our drone systems, with our radio electronic warfare systems. That's our domestic technologies. But that's just a parallel road that we're taking while we're expecting for assistance from our partners.",

ZELENSKYY (through translator): It's a comprehensive and complicated question. It's a question about how fair recruitment should be. The most important issue is rotation of the people who are very tired at the front line physically. Any person, not only Ukraine is -- it doesn't really matter what nation you belong to, if you are tired, you have to go back, you have to be restored, and somebody else would replace you. Another professional soldier who has been trained during a certain period of time and mobilization recruitment depends on that also. How many people have on the front, how many reserves you have and why you need that for defending operation some number of brigades for -- they began to translate me. Yes, it's difficult. So, for counteroffensive, you need another number of brigades. So, the question on mobilization, it's a complicated thing. Yes. And I can't share with you the number of victims and casualties. But for example, if you will, when we speak that they have too much people, and you have to know, for example, in Avdiivka, I just comparing the number, one to seven. It's a pity that I'm -- but for one death of Ukrainians, seven deaths of Russians, one to seven.

There's no doubt that the Baltic states are going to be at risk, or Poland, if we don't stop him in Ukraine. And the other thing we should also remember is, the geography is not going to change. When he loses in Ukraine, he's still going to be a threat and a danger. And that's why we are going to have to continue to bolster our eastern flank, and NATO is doing that right now. So, I think that's part of what we have to do is make sure that we stop him here in Ukraine. And part of also what we need to do, not just in the United States, but in all of our countries, is make sure we're reminding our publics, because we've seen decreasing support in the United States for Ukraine, reminding them how important it is that we stop Putin here.

That's a significant increase. And NATO has implemented the biggest reinforcements of collective defense in generations, with battlegroups, combative troops in the eastern part of the Alliance for the first time in our history, with high readiness, more forces.

But at the same time, I think the war in Ukraine has demonstrated that there are some serious gaps. For instance, when it comes to sustainment, one of the thing is to have all the advanced weapons systems, but they need spare parts, they need maintenance, and at least they need ammunition. And in the beginning of the war in Ukraine, we depleted our stocks. But now, they are running quite low. So, now, we are focusing extremely -- also very much on how to ramp up production. We have some good news. There are new factories being set up. Production has increased. But there's urgent need to do more. So, yes, I think we all have learned some serious lessons about the warfare also for NATO, from the war in Ukraine. Then, of course, I was speaking about burden sharing. European allies have more to do when it comes to total defense spending. But actually, when you look at support for Ukraine, European allies and Canada have provided more support to Ukraine in total than United States. And of course, the United States have done a lot, particularly when it comes to military support to Ukraine. But the problem now is, of course, the lack of decision in the U.S Congress means that the flow from the U.S. has gone down and that has a direct impact on the frontline in Ukraine. So, of course, this is not only about making the right decision, but it's about making the right decision early as quickly as possible because it's urgent. Every week we wait means that there will be more people killed on the frontline in Ukraine. So, it's not for me to give advice on how to pass legislation through the U.S. Congress, but what I can say is the vital and urgent need for the U.S. to decide on a package for Ukraine, because we need that support and we have a burden sharing between Europe and Canada and United States.

Now, as we mentioned earlier, Alexei Navalny's death dominated many of the discussions in Munich over the weekend. But despite it being the lead story in news outlets around the world, inside Russia, it's barely mentioned. This as at least 366 people were detained across the country while attending vigils and rallies to express their grief for the late opposition leader. A reminder that an act as simple as laying flowers can land people in jail in Putin's Russia today. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Navalny says that his mother and lawyers were denied access to the morgue where his body is allegedly being held. They accuse Russian authorities of \"stalling for time\" and claimed on Twitter X that the body will not be returned to them, not be returned to the family for at least another 14 days. The Kremlin says an investigation into the circumstances around Navalny's death is underway. Despite the urgency felt around Navalny's death, House Speaker Mike Johnson in Washington has signaled that he won't be bringing the bill to help Ukraine to the House floor. Instead, the House has gone on a two-week winter break, a decision that President Biden called bizarre. What House Republicans apparently did have time for these past few weeks was the impeachment of the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The first cabinet secretary to be impeached since 1876. And I spoke with Mayorkas in Munich. It was his first interview since that vote.
