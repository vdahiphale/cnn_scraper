And it's worth noting that many across the Middle East actually support the Houthis in this effort to disrupt ships heading to Israel, that by and large they see the Houthis as doing what many Arab regimes are not doing, which is doing something concrete to influence the course of events in Gaza. We also heard from Nasser Kanaani, who's the spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Minister, who accused the U.K. and U.S. fueling chaos, disorder, insecurity and instability, contradicting the American and British claims that they are trying to minimize the possibility of regional war. Certainly, in light of the American strikes on Syria and Iraq over the weekend and the continued strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, it does seem that whereas before we were talking about a low-intensity conflict, the intensity of the war between the indirect war between the United States and Iran is increasing.

And when you speak to black voters across the state, the reviews are mixed. Some are really excited about Biden. They still give him a lot of credibility for being Barack Obama's vice president. Others have economic anxieties. And feel as though routinely voting for Democrats, they have very little to show for that. And then you have pragmatic voters, people who are so concerned about former President Donald Trump returning to the White House. They think voting for Biden is a safe bet. Listen, Democrats here, they say that they are excited about the black turnout, that they were able to get to rural parts of the state like never before via bus tours and other mechanisms. And they say the enthusiasm here from black voters will be mirrored across the country. Eva McKend, CNN, Columbia, South Carolina.

This time the coalition airstrikes targeted 36 targets across 13 different locations in Yemen as the U.S. and the U.K., backed by a coalition of Australia, Bahrain, Denmark, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, tried to disrupt the ability of the Iran-backed rebel group to target international shipping lanes in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.It was U.S. F/A-18 fighter jets taking off from the deck of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as two destroyers. The USS Gravely and the USS Kearny launching Tomahawk Land Attack cruise missiles that took part in these strikes. The U.S. went after underground storage facilities, command and control, missile systems, drone storage and operation sites, radars, and helicopters of the Houthis. So, in that target list, you see the effort of the U.S. to try to disrupt the abilities of the Houthis to continue to attack commercial vessels as well as U.S. warships. In the statement from the joint coalition, they also specifically mention a January 27th attack when the Houthis successfully hit the Marshall Islands flagged oil tanker, the Marlin Luanda. This is worth pointing out because the ship had to issue a distress call because it was burning, forcing a U.S. destroyer to respond, as well as others. And that's the grave nature of what the U.S. sees here, and what the U.S., the U.K., and others see it as so important to respond to the Houthis and let them know that if the attacks continue on international shipping, so too will the U.S. and the U.K. strikes on Houthi targets. Again, that attempt to throw off or disrupt their ability to continue these attacks. Despite these latest U.S. strikes, the Houthis promise the attacks will continue.

So, perhaps when he's in the rest of the Arab world, outside of Israel and the West Bank, he will, of course, be discussing the situation involving the hostages, particularly with the Egyptians and the Qataris, who are the main mediators there. And I think perhaps in Saudi Arabia, you may also have more discussions about his longer-term vision, or the U.S. administration's longer-term vision, for the region, i.e. an independent Palestinian State alongside Israel in exchange for Saudi recognition and other issues relating to aid and reconstruction and all of those things as well.

One was very much focused on keeping up the pressure on the Israeli government to do whatever it takes to bring those hostages home.The other was more focused on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the government itself, trying to call for his, or calling for him to step down so that there can be fresh elections. But the two protests kind of bleed into one another, not just because of their geographical proximity. They take place, at least in Tel Aviv on adjacent streets, but also because of their ultimate objectives, which are to get the hostages home as well. And some of those protesters feel that Netanyahu is actually an obstacle to doing that. They feel that he wants to put off a deal and thereby remain in power longer, because as soon as the deal is done and there's a pause in fighting, that would lead not just to an inquiry into what happened on October 7th under Netanyahu's watch, but also that it would lead to elections, which all opinion polls suggest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would lose. And they would point to things such as a leaked recording of a conversation between families of the hostages and Prime Minister Netanyahu, in which he was very critical of the Qataris. They will point to statements by Netanyahu, saying that Israel won't be releasing, in his words, thousands of terrorists in order to get a deal done for the hostages, and also comments by his right-wing national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gir, saying that if there is, in his words, a reckless deal with Hamas, the government, he would bring down the government. And of course, the backdrop here is this kind of framework agreement that Israel and Hamas appear to have agreed to, which would see a phased release of hostages in exchange for a larger number of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for something like a six-week pause to begin with in the fighting. And then that could lead to a longer pause in the fighting as well. But Hamas is insisting Israel withdraw from the Gaza Strip and stop fighting. Israel doesn't want to release thousands of prisoners. And as a result, the two sides still seem quite far apart. Kim.",

And it's also fueled by really warm ocean temperatures. Those ocean temperatures are one to three degrees above average right now and that can really pump that sponge even more. So, dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is really on the table. And we're talking about flooding at rivers and urban in the streets as well. Mud and debris flow could cause some landslides as well, especially over previous burn scars. Down trees and power lines can also be an issue, especially where you're saturated from all the rain that you've got the last couple of days. And then having insult to injury, this storm is not just about water, it's also about wind. We have high wind warnings in effect where we can see gusts 65, 70, even 80 mph possible, could see some lighter gust in that lighter tan shade there, 45 miles per hour gusts. But something to really watch out for, especially as that ground is so saturated. You can see some of those colors pop up, some of those wind gusts over 40 to 50 mph. Here's that storm kind of hitting land by Sunday morning. The heaviest rain goes north first, then slings into Southern California as we go into the afternoon and evening hours. L.A. kind of getting the brunt as the Grammys will be going on. We'll find some of that heavy rain continuing to pile in Monday and Tuesday as that fire hose just continues to sit there. So again, all the yellow widespread, three to six inches of rain, some of the oranges and reds showing where we could see some of those locally higher amounts. And then don't forget where it's colder in the mountains, we're looking at several feet of snow. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Another superstar left fans wanting a lot more after he shut up in Hong Kong for a preseason soccer match.Lionel Messi didn't play when his Inter Miami squad took on a team of local Hong Kong standouts. The game drew some 40,000 fans and many of them say they want a refund. CNN Sports Correspondent Carolyn Manno is standing by in New York. But first go to Kristie Lu Stout who is outside the Hong Kong Stadium. So, Kristie, I mean I remember when Inter Miami came here to Atlanta, Messi didn't suit up. It was a huge disappointment, but for folks in Hong Kong there, I mean it must have been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that they -- they may have missed here.",
