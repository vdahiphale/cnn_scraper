I'm Danny Freeman.We begin this morning with former President Donald Trump set to surrender this Thursday for his fourth arrest of the year. Trump and some of his 18 co-defendants agree Monday to the terms of their bond agreements in the sweeping Georgia racketeering case related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. But unlike the other defendants, the terms of Trump's release comes with a lot more strings attached. CNN's Paula Reid has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "In Fulton County, the way this works is that, first, you negotiate your bond agreement and then you surrender and then a judge schedules an initial appearance for you, an arraignment. That's your first time going before the judge.Now, in this case, even though this is his fourth indictment, this is the first time that he has had to post cash bond. He is also subject to a lot of other restrictions that are unique clearly tailored to him, including being barred from threatening anyone else involved in the case especially on social media. Because we've seen him attack judges, prosecutors, witnesses in this case. And this appears tailored to him because we've seen four other defendants today negotiate their bond agreements anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000. And while they are also barred from talking to co- defendants, none have the social media provision. So that's five defendants of the 19 in this case, 14 more to go with these bond agreements. (END VIDEOTAPE) FREEMAN:  And one of former President Trump's 18 co-defendants in the Fulton County case is conservative attorney John Eastman. Now, he is planning to surrender to the authorities on Wednesday. Eastman reached an agreement Monday with the District Attorney Fani Willis for a bond order of $100,000.

In Huwara, on Saturday a father and son were killed in a shooting attack at a car wash. And Israeli forces have been on a massive manhunt since then looking for the shooters. They were in Beita, looking for suspects, and that's when clashes broke out.But what we have now from eyewitness testimony, as well as actually video from the moment this man was shot appears to show that the man was unarmed and shot from behind. I do want to show this video where you see a man in white jogging towards another group of men who appear to be trying to help a man on a stretcher. He is shot from behind and he falls forward. An eyewitness that CNN spoke to said that the man was not involved in the clashes. They say that he was unarmed. And in that video, we don't see him carrying any sort of gun or anything like that. And the eyewitnesses say that it was Israeli forces on the scene who shot that person from behind. Now, we've asked the Israeli defense forces and border police for a comment on this. Border police say the details of the incident are under review. They say the security forces were in the town to apprehend what they called a wanted suspect, during which a violent riot was instigated, that endangers the lives of the secret forces present. They say that rioters hurled blocks and rocks at the forces who responded with riot dispersal means including live fire. This is all coming during an increased wave of violence across the occupied West Bank. On Saturday, as I mentioned, that father and son were killed in Huwara. We also have CCTV video of that incident where it shows they were at a car wash and the one they were seemingly ambushed by a shooter. Israeli forces are still looking for that suspected shooter, and that's why you see so many Israeli forces in and around this flash point town of Huwara. But on top of all this, yesterday morning, another Israeli woman was shot and killed while she was driving south of Hebron, another Israeli man was with her also injured. Israeli forces saying overnight that they have arrested two suspects in that case. Danny, this is turning out to be one of the most violent and deadly years for both Israelis and Palestinians across the occupied West Bank and Israel in decades -- Danny.",

But he will be watched very closely and if there are violations of this order at this level, he is going to have to adjudicate that. So that is how I see it at this point.

And if he does, he is a favorable -- he's already tweeted welcome back and congratulating Thaksin on returning to Thailand. So clear where his allegiances lie.But what we know at this point is that this is a controversial move, the fact that Pheu Thai who did not win, they got the second most amount of votes, could potentially be running this coalition. Move Forward, which is the progressive party, they won the election, but they were blocked from forming a government by the conservative, anti- progressive, and military-backed parties. What Pheu Thai has done is affiliate themselves with two of those military-backed parties despite campaigning on a pledge of keeping the military out of politics. Now, Pheu Thai has said that it is necessary to that, to try to break the stalemate that has been going on for about three months now since the election. But certainly, there are many who are not happy with this. The votes of millions have effectively they say not counted because the person that they voted for and the party they voted for is not going to be a part of this coalition and will not form part of the government. So, going forward, it will be interesting to see what happens with the former Prime Minister Thaksin who has been sentenced to eight years in prison, but already the correctional facility he is, the doctor says he has underlying health issues and he will be kept in a separate room from the other inmates and under 24 hour supervision. The speculation now is that he may apply for a royal pardon. So he may be released sooner. He is 74 and there is very few that expect that he will serve the whole eight of his eight-year prison term -- Danny.",
