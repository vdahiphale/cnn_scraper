Now, federal officials also telling CNN that there is no evidence that he was attempting to assassinate the former president. But here is what we know. Vem Miller, a 49-year-old old man from Las Vegas, he was arrested near the rally on Saturday. And he was arrested for illegally possessing a shotgun and a loaded handgun. Now, keep in mind, these are state charges. So, we also know he had multiple boxes of ammunition for both of these guns. And the Riverside County Sheriff saying that he had multiple passports and drivers licenses with different names. He was driving an unregistered car with a fake license plate. And he told authorities that he was a journalist, that he had VIP passes for the rally. And authorities said they were not able to verify that. Now, the sheriff's department says he was allowed to go through an outside perimeter, but was then stopped at the inside perimeter, which was a lot more thorough. And that's where the deputies found the fake license plate, the guns, the multiple IDs. And this was still a distance away from the entrance where the U.S. Secret Service does their checks. And it was also before the president even arrived. He was arrested and he was later released on a $5,000 bail. And he's since posted a video online defending himself. Here's part of that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VEM MILLER, ARRESTED ON GUN CHARGES AT TRUMP'S COACHELLA RALLY: That I decided to come to Coachella after receiving a special invitation from members of the Nevada Republican Party. I will fully transparently let them know that in the trunk of my car I carry two firearms. One is a Glock. One is a shotgun. And these two firearms that I carry with me are simply for protection.

Not even the people that have come in and destroying our country. And, by the way, totally destroying our country. The towns, the villages, they're being inundated. But I don't think they're the problem in terms of Election Day. I think the bigger problem will be people from within. We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics.

Donald Trump using rancid language against fellow Americans, calling them sick, calling them lunatics, saying they're bad people. He's not talking about politicians necessarily, he's just saying this sort of in general. And how does the campaign defend the rhetoric that has been long used by autocrats? PETE SEAT, FORMER WHITE HOUSE SPOKESPERSON, GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION: Both campaigns are running on effectively the same message, Sara, and that is fear. Donald Trump is stoking fear of illegal immigration and what he calls the far left to motivate those low propensity voters to come out and vote for him. And Kamala Harris is trying to stoke fear of Donald Trump. Just look at the rhetoric that Democrats use when they talk about Donald Trump. It's the same thing, trying to get those low propensity voters out. So, we've got to recognize both sides are doing this, both sides are playing the game of fear, because that's how they think they're going to win this election.",

So, he is doing that, whether or not it's, you know, going to be effective in the way he's saying it and the fear tactic that he's using and the sort of dark cloud that comes about when he talks. Whether that works with independent voters and, you know, in the battleground states is yet to be seen and it - you know, it is really terrible that this is where our political system is.But, you know, it does resonate with his base and it is resonating with people.

I would not underestimate how important character is going to be in this election. And the - the contrast that the vice president and the campaign are drawing is crucially important. And you'll see her cris-crossing into these battleground states to sort of get a hold and to - but this is going to be razor-thin and, you know, I was there in 2020 when we didn't decide the election until Saturday.
