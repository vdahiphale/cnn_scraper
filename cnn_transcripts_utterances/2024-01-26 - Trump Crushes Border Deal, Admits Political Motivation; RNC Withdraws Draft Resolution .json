Yesterday, you had a number of Republicans who have worked on this issue or have been on Capitol Hill for a very long time, who were arguing that Donald Trump is not helping. In fact, one Republican senator put it to me very bluntly, without Donald Trump, this deal likely would have passed with near unanimous Republican support.That is how conservative so many Republicans who've worked on this issue for a long time believe that this legislation ultimately will be. And they're arguing that this is so many gains that Republicans have been fighting for, for years, and that this looks so different than past immigration proposals. This isn't even about DACA. This isn't about legalization. This is simply a border deal, and yet they're arguing that Donald Trump is out there attacking it for political reasons. Senator Thom Tillis, who has been close to these negotiations, he's been talking very closely with Senator James Lankford, he told me yesterday, this moment is going to require a lot of Republicans to have courage to stand up against the former president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC):  I think this is when members of the Senate have to show some courage and do something that at the end of the day will be very helpful to President Trump. I hope that we have these tools available so that he can do what he demonstrated in 2017 he couldn't when he was expressing frustration over the lack of the very provisions that we're trying to get into law.

By the way that's a great courtroom sketch right there. It's Donald Trump being looked at by his own deposition that's what that one means. Good work by Christine Cornell there. The other thing Donald Trump testified to is that he only made his statements about E. Jean Carroll after she accused him of this sexual assault. That was not disputed anyway. The most important thing Donald Trump testified to is that he intended not to harm E. Jean Carroll with his statements but to protect himself, his family and he claimed the presidency.

The jury in the first trial took about three hours.And the question they will have is, again, how much damages. Think of it in two different categories, compensatory damages. Think of it in terms of E. Jean Carroll, how much is she owed for her economic damage, for her mental and psychological suffering and then, separately, punitive damages, how much of a message does the jury want to send to punish Donald Trump. We don't know where they're going to come out E. Jean Carroll has asked for $7 to $12 million dollars. It could be less than that. It could be in that range. It could be more. Up to the jury.",

Trump himself now says he wants to win the nomination, quote, the old fashioned way. Joining us now with some perspective from the RNC side of things, at least, former RNC Chair, former Virginia Governor, Jim Gilmore. Governor, I appreciate your time this morning. Can you explain to people -- I was stunned when I saw this idea start to percolate. I was trying to think back to what would have happened had Hillary Clinton done this to Bernie Sanders back in 2016. As somebody who's worked on the committee, who's worked within the kind of Republican infrastructure, were you surprised? FMR. GOV. JIM GILMORE (R-VA):  Well, the RNC is a great group of people, and it's not insular. There are people from all the 50 states that are elected by their respective states. So, it's a good voice for the Republican Party. But it's perfectly clear at this point that Donald Trump is winning, is probably almost certainly going to be our nominee. And I think that the committee wants to move on and begin to run directly against President Biden as soon as possible. And I think that was what was motivating Dave Bossy. But Donald Trump, I think, was wise. I don't think he wants to look like he's manipulating this. Let the people vote in the primaries. I think that Nikki Haley ought to be very thoughtful about how long she's going to stick with this. She's -- her next stop after Nevada, which she will lose, is going to be South Carolina, her home state. And if she loses big there, which the governor and the senators all against her there, then I think she looks bad. So, I think she should be thoughtful about this, but I think President Trump made the right decision.",

Israel had asked this be thrown out entirely, that South Africa's case was essentially a subversion of the idea of the 1948 Genocide Act. What she has just announced is that the court does believe it has jurisdiction. This is a legitimate dispute between two nations and that there is evidence that some acts of genocide may have been committed, implying therefore that the broader case, the substantive case in South Africa's brought before the court can be considered by it. Now, that substantive case will take years too long. What she's announcing, and we will hear from in a moment, from her about, is whether or not it will grant as a result of the fact that the court believes there is a case to answer and to investigate those emergency orders that South Africa's requested essentially that Israel suspend its operations in Gaza while this case can be considered here at the ICJ. We don't know whether they'll go the entire way towards South Africa's calling that Israel be ordered to stop, that access be allowed, that aid be allowed in, that it cease to destroy any evidence, for instance, that may be considered by this court, as it considers the substantive genocide allegations or whether the court's president is going to go on to stop just short of that announcing, for instance, that the court would like to see more aid getting into Gaza. Then, of course, will come the question of what Israel does with the ruling. Still, Phil and Poppy, so far, the fact that the court has accepted that it has jurisdiction, that there could be evidence of genocide that is worthy of consideration is significant and does not go in Israel's sense.",

That was the substance of the arguments we heard here on the 11th of January when Israel presented its case for three hours.What we will hear shortly, once we get an idea of these provisional measures, is what Israel is going to do about it. For instance, if the court orders, stops, just sort of a suspension, orders for instance that Israel take certain actions, allowing more aid in, how seriously, how quickly is Israel going to hear those, will it disregard them entirely? So far, what analysts watching this court have been telling me, Poppy, is that the fact that Israel has come to the court, has chosen to defend itself, does suggest that it takes very seriously not just the jurisdiction of this particular court, but also likely what its rulings are going to mean for global public opinion and what further weight that might bring on it as it continues with its offensive in Gaza.",
