New video out today showing the bloody aftermath after desperate looters raided one town there.And then there is this. A Turkish evacuation plane shot at while trying to land in Sudan. You can actually see bullet holes there in the aircraft. And we're also learning new details about American evacuations. Officials say the Marines at the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum destroyed classified materials during that evacuation. We have CNN's Larry Madowo who is monitoring the very latest on this violent in Sudan. Larry, the two factions have extended a ceasefire. How are things going so far?",

And each side is blaming the other for firing first. So, that's the situation that this 72-hour ceasefire has fallen through.And that is also why you see this mass exodus out of Sudan. So many foreigners tried to leave. And one of the main landing forces here in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The Saudis say they have evacuated 3,000 out of Port Sudan on the Red Sea into here in Saudi Arabia. Many of them were from other countries other than Saudi Arabia. Only about 100 of them were Saudis. They came from 80 nationalities including the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, Kenya and countries all around the world. The Saudis are a big diplomatic player in Sudan. They've been a big diplomatic player helping people escape the violence and find their way to the rest of the world. The U.K. now says it will be ending its operation evacuating citizens out of Sudan. The U.K. has called it the largest and longest evacuation effort of any Western nation. Which obviously raises questions about what has America done to private citizens in Sudan? The State Department says it's received about 5,000 people who registered asking for assistance, and it is still committed to finding a way for them out of Sudan. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VEDANT PATE, STATE DEPARTMENT PRINCIPAL DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON: We're not going to get into operational specifics, given security considerations. But I will reiterate that this is a very fluid and dynamic situation. We cannot guarantee traveler safety, nor can we guarantee how long these departure options will be available. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Wade last year. We should note, as he said that, he also said that that is different from the level of proof that is needed to name someone -- so admitting he doesn't have prosecutable proof I suppose here.

He talks about how the leak itself really created this atmosphere of suspicion and distrust that he said the court is just now getting over. I want to read a brief part of this, because like you said, he's really pouring water on the idea that this was leaked by someone affiliated with the conservative justices to lock in that 5-4 vote. He's kind of pointing the fingers that maybe this was done by somebody trying to make the vote change. So, he says it this way. He said that idea is infuriating to me. Look, this made us targets of assassination. Would I do that to myself? Would the five of us have done that to ourselves? It's quite implausible.

That's a pretty extraordinary step for a sitting justice to say, especially when the actual conclusion was that they could not say who this leaker was.You know, Jim, in addition, I mean, this interview is really incredible. It also talks about his criticisms of the court. He really says that he's never seen anything like it. He says this concerted attack on the court and on individual justices is new during my lifetime. You know, all the stories that have come out in recent days about gifts Justice Clarence Thomas has accepted or questionable property sales from Justice Gorsuch.

What is the job of the king? What is the job of the royal family? And what does a monarchy, what does a royal family really do in 2023? And how much of that work, if you will, is going to be informed by the history and what led to the British empire? Which at one point was the largest, most powerful in the world. But when you're talking about an empire that involves more than 70 countries and territories and hundreds of millions of people referred to as subjects, there's also a lot of painful history there. And that is really important, especially for the younger generation in the U.K. They want that addressed. And so, they want to talk more about it.
