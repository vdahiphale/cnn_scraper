Attorneys for President Biden find several classified documents from his time as vice president at one of his private offices, that according to a source familiar with the story.

I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. And we begin our coverage tonight with the breaking news that we're following, classified government documents found inside one of President Biden's private offices, the records dating from Biden's time as vice president, during Obama administration.

They say it's fewer than a dozen documents, classified documents, that were discovered in an office that the president had when he was setting up an office with the University of Pennsylvania. The Penn Biden Center here in Washington, D.C. They were cleaning out this office, trying close it out and that's when they discovered these documents.Again, according to the White House, there are fewer than a dozen documents. They've now turned those documents over to the National Archives, which has, in turn, asked the Justice Department to investigate it. Now we're told that the U.S. attorney in Chicago, John Lausch, who is an appointee of former President Donald Trump, is now handling a review of these documents to determine what next to do. Of course, the FBI is also involved in reviewing this. And, Wolf, it's important for us to understand also that the -- according to the White House, they say that this was obviously something that they turned over to the National Archives. I'll read you just a part of what they say. According to their statement, they say the White House is cooperating with the National Archives and the Justice Department regarding the discovery of what appear to be Obama-Biden administration records, including a small number of documents with classified markings. These are documents from the previous Obama-Biden administration that it appears then-Vice President Biden took with him when he was setting up this think tank with the University of Pennsylvania.",

The idea that you have these documents, there are requirements of how you handle them, where you put them, in locked compartments, certainly to make sure that sources and methods are not exposed.

And so there will be a full investigation to talk to who was handling it. The chain of custody is really important. And also to both Jamie and Evan's point, if we're talking about a potential criminal charge, and, of course, the of course the intent is very important, I mean, there's certainly a difference between mistakes and intentional violation.

I'll tell you, the U.S. attorney in Chicago is a very fair man, Mr. Lausch. And so I think we can trust his word.Politically, there's not going to be seen as much of a difference because the only thing in this kind of era where there's all this information that hits you from different sides, and we kind of get information overload, the only thing that's needed right now by the former president is to be able to throw doubt and say, look, this happened, too, over here. So, from a political perspective, this is actually probably pretty bad not just for the president but really for the idea of getting the justice through the political system. Now, there will be a lot more details to come out. The question is who is interested in the nuances or who is interested in just simply saying, see, it happened over here, too. And let me just say real quick, too, as a guy that's wrapping up, I had wrapped up my office in Congress. I never once saw anything that we had archived. We have to archive our stuff. That was 100 percent staff work. So, in terms of the details of this, I think that will be important to figure out. BLITZER:  Yes. The chain of custody is really going to be critical in this investigation that has now begun. David Chalian, from the political perspective, whatever happens, this is very awkward for President Biden and his team given the investigation, the criminal investigation that's been going on involving the classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago.",

I mean, I think our control room has found a tweet from the House Judiciary GOP, that's the AP version of the story. You can see the number of sirens that they have put atop this particular headline. And to the congressman's point, I mean, there is nothing nuance about that tweet. That is the political version of the tweet and these are the people that ultimately are going to take this information, going to have subpoena power and the gavel in the Republican held House to do what they will with this.And I think that's really the challenge for the Biden folks. I mean, I have yet to start to reach out to my political sources on this, as this was just breaking here as we came on the air. But I can already hear the Democrat strategists groaning about the fact that now, every time they want to try to bring up what happened with former President Donald Trump, which is incredibly problematic for all the reasons we have laid out, they're not going to have to answer questions about this. And from a political perspective, it almost makes it like a neutral issue despite the fact there are very significant differences between finding this information, handling it appropriately, doing the right thing when you find out you've screwed up versus dragging out the process for who knows why, refusing those subpoenas, eventually having to force federal investigators to demand you give those. I mean, obviously both of these camps handled these sets of documents very differently and there are plenty of people that are going to be making those points but the reality is this is the win that, you know, David Chalian was talking about for the Trump team at a time when they haven't had many.",

They've been criticizing that investigation for some time.And, undoubtedly, this will be part of the oversight that the new Judiciary Committee Chairman, Jim Jordan, will have going forward. He wants to bring in Merrick Garland, the attorney general. He wants to look into all the decisions that are being made. And if the Justice Department determines that perhaps Joe Biden did nothing wrong here but perhaps charges Donald Trump, that could be -- that will undoubtedly face a lot of pushback and scrutiny from this new Republican majority, which is trying to provide some defense of Donald Trump of sorts by pushing forward this new panel to investigate everything the Justice Department has going forward. So, Wolf, we have not yet heard from the Republican leadership about this news. Of course, it just broke.

So, according to the Justice Department, according the FBI, that's the reason for that extraordinary search.Paula Reid just got a reaction from a member of former President Trump's legal team, and this person says to Paula that this whole issue that we're now talking about is indicative of the larger problem of trying to keep track of classified documents. It's an overclassification problem. Now, we've heard this from Trump's legal team. That's one of the many things that they have brought up as part of the reason to explain why the former president, you know, was found with 300 or so documents that were marked as classified. The issue being that there's too many things that are classified that should not be classified. Again, that's an argument for another time, but it is something that I think you're going to hear a lot more about.

And in this particular case, the vice president obviously had some documents that were taken inappropriately from the administration into this private office here in Washington, less than a dozen, not 300, but still highly classified documents.So what's your reaction to this? Because the new Republican leadership, the new leadership in the House, is clearly going to go after the current president of the United States.",

And what you heard from Representative Donalds, he made I think a compelling case for the facts that he has to go on, but, first of, it's ludicrous to say a vice president can't have access to classified material or can. We have access to classified materials as members of Congress. And so, you know, those are those kinds of things.Of course, the issue with Donald Trump wasn't that he had in his possession. It's that he wasn't cooperating with the Archives to return it, but, again, the problem is nuance doesn't really matter. Thankfully, on the justice side, it does. But, look, yes, you're going to have moments where probably information -- if you're a vice president or a president and you live particularly in the president's case in a White House and everything is in essence secured, you have a little more flexibility to move stuff around than I do, for instance, when I'm in the Capitol and I have to stay specifically at a SCIF. But, again, all you have to do is throw enough doubt at the wall and that's kind of that moment we're at now, and Representative Byron did that pretty well.",
