Footage geo-located by CNN shows them occupying a road between the border and Daraa city. It comes as the rebels are also making further gains in the north, after capturing the key cities of Aleppo and Hama. Firefighters are now advancing, or fighters, I should say, are now advancing towards Homs, Syria's third largest city. Now, if captured, they would effectively separate Damascus from the northwestern coast controlled by President Bashar al-Assad. And you are looking now at live pictures where Syria's Foreign Minister is discussing the crisis with his counterparts from Iran and Iraq.And a week after the rebels captured Aleppo, formerly displaced Syrians are now returning to their hometown for the first time in years. And some spoke with our Jomana Karadsheh about their experience. She is the first Western journalist to report from the city since the rebel takeover. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We are in Aleppo's old city here by its historic, iconic Citadel, and it's really surreal being in Syria's second city, just days after that lightning offensive by rebel forces where they managed to capture the city in a matter of days. And you look around here, and it seems like business as usual. Mohammed never left Aleppo, and she says their homes were destroyed. Her children are in Turkey, and she hasn't seen them in years. And she is hoping, now that the city has changed hands, that this means that she could see her children again.",

This is the Basel roundabout named after the deceased brother of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. And one of the first things that people did when rebel forces took over the city of Aleppo was topple the statue of Basel, a symbol of the Assad regime. This is an area where there were fierce battles with regime forces, and since then, in the past few days, there has been an airstrike that killed many people. You can still see the aftermath of that, the blood on the floor here. And speaking to people in the city, this is what they fear.

That's after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed in a brazen and targeted attack in New York. The manhunt for the gunman now in its third day. Police have released more images of a person of interest. Here he is smiling with his mask down, as he spoke with a hostel employee. We've also learned from multiple law enforcement sources that the suspect had traveled to New York from Atlanta by bus. Let's bring in our Omar Jimenez, who is in New York with the latest, and joins me now. Omar, it's been this sort of drip, drip of information from police and sources. What are you hearing?

But, what officials are trying to figure out is where exactly in that route this suspect actually got on the bus, since it stopped, of course, multiple times between there and here.And then, of course, sort of moving forward, I guess you can split this investigation into two different categories. One is trying to find out who this person is. Now, law enforcement believes this person arrived in New York about 10 days before the actual shooting. You see the timeline there, November 24th, checked into a hostel on the Upper West Side of New York. Law enforcement believes that check-in was with a fake New Jersey ID, stayed for a few days, checked out, did, well, we don't really know, then checked back in about a few days before the actual shooting, and that's where it is believed he stayed leading up to the actual shooting. Now, that picture that you see next to the time minor right there, that is a person law enforcement is describing as a person of interest, wanted for questioning. They didn't go so far as to call this a suspect outright, at least until they can rule out whether he is a suspect or not. What's interesting about this is that this picture was captured at the hostel, and law enforcement, of course, are interviewing people in the area. According to sources, law enforcement interviewed the female clerk that was working at this hostel, and says that this moment happened because she asked him to lower his mask and that they were flirting back and forth. That might be why you see that big smile on that person's face. But, regardless of that personal moment, it might end up actually being the biggest clue we have so far, if not the biggest clue at the end of the day. So, that's one category of the investigation. Who this person is? The second category, where is this person? And when you retrace, sort of when this shooting happened. It happened in midtown Manhattan, and then from there, law enforcement traced the path of how this person fled via e-bike, you see it on your screen there, north toward Central Park. And then new video emerged of a person with a hood, dressed similarly to the shooter, who law enforcement believe is the shooter leaving the park on bike about 30 blocks north of the shooting. That's this video that you see here. Again, law enforcement has seen this. They believe this is the gunman. This is back on the Upper West Side in the same neighborhood where the hostel is, where he was initially staying. But then, at this point, that is the latest public clue that we have. So, from here, where did this person go? We do not know. But also, police are looking through a water bottle that was left behind with some DNA evidence attached to it, a cell phone that was left behind, trying to get into it, all of these pieces, trying to get to some sort of substantial break in the case, to try and answer those two questions, who this person is and where this person is.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So, as far as we know, at this point, they do seem to be random people. Now, look, I don't have full purview into what law enforcement may have learned in this. But, as far as the hostel itself, this wasn't just a tiny place of residence with a few rooms here and there. I mean, there are up to 200 rooms in this particular building. So, it's a huge, huge set of rooms, and people that could be coming in and out at various points. This person also used cash to check into the hostel as well.And so, when you look at how you could potentially trace this person, there aren't a lot of great clues there. And when you talk about people he may have been staying with, I think that's part of why law enforcement is being careful to not quite say this is a suspect just yet based on the masked photo, even if they might have a suspicion of it being so. But, at the very least, this is a person of interest, wanted for questioning, because what he is wearing, some could argue, is a common thing that you might see on a cold New York street, with the hood, potentially having a mask up as well, even though that attire was similar to what the gunman was wearing the morning of the actual shooting, Rahel.",

So, manslaughter, Misty, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that could carry up to 15 years if he was convicted. Negligent -- criminally negligent homicide could come up to four years if convicted. So, these are pretty significant differences in terms of the severity of the crime. Can you help us understand the standard that would have had to be met for, let's say, manslaughter, and then we'll go do criminally negligent homicide.",

      "speaker": "MARRIS",
      "sentences": "Absolutely. And to your point, absolutely right. The penalty is significantly different between the two.So, let's start with manslaughter. Manslaughter is a reckless disregard for human life that caused the death of an individual. It doesn't require someone to act with intent to kill, but -- so, the mental state required to convict is that there was a risk that was so obvious and known and the individual basically just ignored it. So, you laid out what the prosecution's argument was. Prosecution's argument was that the initial restraint of Jordan Neely justified, but holding him down for that six minutes, at some point, it became criminal, and the way that it applies to the statute is that Daniel Penny is a Marine, trained in martial arts, and that he knew a chokehold could cause asphyxiation, and he just continued to hold Neely for that long period of time, that almost six-minute period of time, causing death, and he just ignored that risk. That's the narrative for manslaughter. Now, this is pretty nuanced, and interestingly enough, the jury asked for clarification on these two instructions and a re-read yesterday. Criminally negligent homicide, a different standard. It means that there was a risk, a substantial risk that somebody would -- someone's actions would cause death, and the individual failed to recognize it, but that a reasonable person would have recognized that risk. So, think about the jurors in that room kind of parsing this language. On one hand, reckless disregard. And manslaughter means you knew there was a risk and you ignored it simply, and criminally negligent homicide, a criminally negligent standard, which means there was a risk and you should have seen it. So, think about it, though, Rahel. Think about sitting in that jury room and parsing that language, which is similar to a certain degree, but has vastly different consequences when it comes to conviction. SOLOMON: Yeah. And it sounds like the jury has really been taking their time trying to understand these two things. As I understand it, they been deliberating for more than 16 hours. Misty stand by, if you might.

These sects have co-existed in this region for hundreds of years, and no one has the right to eliminate them. There must be a legal framework that protects and ensures the rights of all, not a system that serves only one sect, as Assad's regime has done. KARADSHEH: Listening to you speaking, you've gone through quite the transformation. Once an al-Qaeda leader, your group has had affiliations with al-Qaeda, with ISIS, and now you are projecting this image of a moderate leader and a moderate group. What is HTS right now? AL-JOLANI (Interpreted): Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is one of the factions in the region, just like all the others. Now we're talking about a larger project. We're talking about building Syria. Hayat Tahrir al- Sham is merely one detail of this dialog, and it may dissolve at any time. It's not an end in itself, but a means to perform a task confronting this regime. Once that task is complete, it will transition to a state of governance, institutions and so on. I believe that everyone in life goes through phases and experiences, and these experiences naturally increase a person's awareness. A person in their 20s will have a different personality than someone in their 30s or 40s, and certainly someone in their 50s.",

The situation must be understood in its historical context. There was a massive war in Iraq that deeply stirred people's emotions, prompting many to go there. The circumstances of that war led people to various places, and my path led me to one of those locations. Given my level of awareness and my young age at the time, my actions evolved to where I am today. I didn't go to Iraq with those intentions. I went to defend the Iraqi people. When I returned to Syria, I didn't want to bring what happened in Iraq into Syria. That's why there were disagreements between us and ISIS.",

This event has positive repercussions globally, because under the regime's rule, Syria became a source of concern and trouble for everyone. Stabilizing Syria will bring many people back. Today, in the liberated areas, about one third of the population lives in camps, approximately 1.5 million people. I believe we can soon reach a point where there are no camps. With the rehabilitation of the liberated areas, people will return to their homes. Many refugees in Turkey will likely return, as will a significant number of refugees in Lebanon and Jordan. Even refugees in Europe may return to rebuild their country. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We knew going in that this report would overstate the health of the labor market. It doesn't show a rebound in new hiring. It simply shows workers coming back following strikes and storms.If you average over the last two months, which I think is the more informative thing to do, you'll see that the pace of job gains is just 132,000 a month, which is down from 159,000 a month in the third quarter. And those job gains are still very, very narrowly concentrated in only about half of the labor market, and healthcare, government, leisure and hospitality and construction.",

The other thing is that those sectors that have seen unusually rapid job gains may not sustain that pace going forward, and job openings and online job postings in those categories are now declining, and that would suggest that the whole labor market could slow down even more.",

And so, even as they sort of ease their foot off the pedal, they haven't done so sufficiently to stabilize the labor market or stimulate it. That said, there are lots of tailwinds building behind this labor market. The stock market is doing well. Workers are getting real wage gains. And yes, those rate cuts should, at some point, boost affordability enough when it comes to vehicles and houses to stimulate activity in those markets, which will boost hiring yet again.",

POLLAKmarket would encourage the Fed to cut rates yet again. Of course, the last few inflation reports have been a little hotter than hoped for, and they've made it a little less clear that that will happen. I still think it's more likely or not that we'll see a cut at the next meeting, but how many we get in the rest -- in 2025, that is still uncertain. At one point, markets for pricing in a cut at every meeting, six cuts in the next few meetings. That seems unlikely now.",
