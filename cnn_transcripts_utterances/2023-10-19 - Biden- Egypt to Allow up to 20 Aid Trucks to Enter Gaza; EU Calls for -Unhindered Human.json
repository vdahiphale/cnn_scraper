And in just an hour, the House could emphasis on could open proceedings for a third vote to try and elect Jim Jordan Speaker. We're going to watch that and we will bring you any breaking news as we get it. But meantime, we are hours away from a major foreign policy speech by the U.S. President Joe Biden. Officials say the President will make the case for aid to Israel and Ukraine after wrapping up his Middle East trip. Here's a little preview from the White House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JONATHAN FINER, U.S. DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: You can expect a few things from the President tonight, one to lay out his view of this extraordinary moment that we are in when it comes to our national security and international stability with a highlight and a focus, obviously on the conflict in Israel and his visit there yesterday, as well as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine after Russia's brutal invasion there. Second, he will connect those events and this broader moment to the lives of Americans back here and explain why this should matter to us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This was the scene in Khan Younis earlier today, officials in Gaza say that there were casualties and we can't independently confirm that and we're waiting to hear details about the explosion from the Israeli Military. Meanwhile, the U.S. is under pressure to try and get the aid deal in place for Gaza to get those trucks moving.

And we do know, again, you know, and this speaks to this -- this real demand for a pause in the fighting and or a temporary ceasefire language, which, you know, frankly, the Israelis don't like. But Hamas has said it will release the hostages if Israel agrees to a ceasefire. Israel sources say are absolutely no adamant. No ceasefires before those hostages are released. So temporary pause in fighting is what you know, quite frankly, this region and many people are advocating for this want at present to ensure this humanitarian aid can push through, but there are obviously other reasons why a pause in the fighting or temporary ceasefire is being promoted, you know, like I say, around this region and at the UN Security Council, quite frankly, yesterday Kasie.",

Because they believe that President Biden and the White House has not made a clear enough case to the American people why we are in this? So I expect to hear a lot from the President tonight in terms of why it is important for us to help allies to help, you know, help kind of contain what could be an even bigger conflict in Eastern Europe if Putin kind of is allowed to get his way. But I am not quite sure if Republicans would be persuaded by just kind of that argument. They haven't been so far. But there are still enough Republicans on Capitol Hill who may be hearing from constituents about like, oh, how much you know, we are continuing to spend too much money on Ukraine. But if they get a clear enough, compelling enough case, especially from the Commander in Chief, they can perhaps go home and explain to their constituents this is why we're important -- why it's important that the U.S. continue to be involved. But you're right, there is a growing hard right faction and almost an isolationist faction among Congressional Republicans who are really resisting Ukraine, which is why you have this big kind of lump it all together strategy that we're going to see at the end of the week.",

But today this morning, a complete one AD which caught many of us who've been following this case very closely throughout, it caught us all by surprise here. So Sidney Powell entered her guilty plea. She was initially facing seven counts, including racketeering and that initial indictment. Instead, she pleaded guilty today to six misdemeanor counts, and as a result, will have to pay a $6,000 fine. Write a letter of apology but perhaps most importantly, she is going to be used as a witness to testify against co-defendants, which includes her former boss, the Former President of the United States, Donald Trump. This is a bombshell and a stunning blow to the Former President's case because unlike the other co-defendant who pleaded guilty and took a deal, Scott Hall that Georgia Bail Bondsman Former Georgia Bails Bondsman. Sidney Powell was inextricably linked with the Former President. She's an Election Attorney. She filed meritless lawsuits on his behalf and continues to spread these conspiracies of widespread voter fraud in the country when there was in fact, no voter fraud in the country. So Sidney Powell making this deal down to the wire jury selection is -- was expected or is expected to begin tomorrow, and I have been in touch with her former co-defendant in this Ken Chesbro.

She knows things that Donald Trump said and so for her to come out and give testimony at some point, potentially against Donald Trump. That would be incredible. Now, the question is going to be the timing of it all, with all these cases, right? Where are we in the political cycle when this happens? Because if it's in a Republican primary, that's one thing. And maybe there's an opportunity then for Republicans to realize he's got too much baggage, and they need to find somebody else, although I give that a very small chance -- at this point, but if you're in a general election, to me, those are good things for swing voters to know and so, yes, huge news.",

And let's, you know, let's vote on these aid packages. And I think, again, if you had the American electorate vote on these things, I think these are things that would have broad consensus. The issue here is the math, right? There are about eight Republicans that are just totally, you know, in another universe, they are nihilists. They don't care.

We're obviously still waiting to figure out once these members start coming out of this conference meeting exactly what they're going to do next. What's the mood like up there? What are you hearing in the hallways about not just what Republicans are going to do, but as Robby was just talking about what Democrats are going to do? EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Kasie. You know, things remain fluid. But you know, at this hour at this minute, Congressman Jordan sees that continuing to go to the House floor continuing to vote is just a futile effort. That's why he's expected to throw his support behind this plan that essentially ends the stalemate that gives Congressman McHenry temporary powers. There are lots of constitutional questions ahead. And then also questions about if Republicans who are firmly against Jordan will go for this plan. So we're already hearing from Congressman Bacon and Congressman Jimenez, who wants Jordan to drop his bid altogether. They don't want to give him the next several weeks and months to continue to try to whip jerk -- whip votes into January. They want entirely a new set of candidates. And then there are also questions about what Democrats are going to do? It seems like Democrats have lost their appetite to have a Speaker-less House and want to band together some of them with Republicans to end this stalemate, but they're going to want us something in exchange for that, but it's not clear what they're demanding is yet Kasie.",

Guys, look, I just want to let our audience into a little bit of the conversation we were just having in the break, which I think honestly, sometimes when we could put those on television, people would learn more than we can even normally say about what goes on. But we're talking a little bit about Jim Jordan, the person and why it is that he is finding himself in the position that he is. So just to bring everyone up to speed CNN reporting out of this Republican Conference meeting is that Jordan is not stepping aside from the Speaker's race. But he acknowledges he doesn't want to have a third vote because his opposition is growing. They're talking about empowering Patrick McHenry temporarily through January. And at that point, perhaps we'd get you know, this gives Jordan some more time to try to get people on board.
