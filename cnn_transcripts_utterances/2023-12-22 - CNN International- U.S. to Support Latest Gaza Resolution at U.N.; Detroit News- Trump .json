      "sentences": "Now part of the reason why the U.S. says it was delaying is because they were worried that the procedures that were written into this resolution as it was drafted would actually slow down the delivery of aid to the people who desperately needed in Gaza.But of course, U.S., Israel strong allies and the United States wanted language in there to firmly condemn Hamas for instigating this with the horrific terror attacks of October 7th. Something that Israel feels has gotten lost in all of the noise and of course the horrific developments in Gaza and the skyrocketing death toll when you have the Hamas controlled health ministry in Gaza and the Ramallah Palestinian Health Ministry both claiming that the death toll has now surpassed 20,000 people. Israel saying that more than 2,000 Hamas militants have been killed since the last ceasefire ended. That ceasefire, of course, was a phased transfer of hostages. But there are still women, there are still elderly Israeli hostages, and there are still Israeli hostages that are in urgent need of medical care. But Hamas has flat-out rejected the offer that Israel put on the table. Delivered through intermediaries in Qatar to Hamas, that offer for a week-long pause in the fighting so that 40 -- 35 or 40 of these hostages who really desperately need to get out of there urgently -- of course probably all of them do. But these are the most urgent cases. Hamas said they're not willing to talk about any sort of hostage exchange until there's a full ceasefire, a full stop in the military activity in Gaza. Something that Israel says isn't going to happen They've been intensifying their street fighting. They blew up a huge underground tunnel complex yesterday. [04:05:00] You're talking about offices and apartments, living quarters, command bunkers for the senior leaders of Hamas including Yahya Sinwar -- according to information that CNN obtained overnight, Max. So clearly their military operations are continuing -- Israel's are but Hamas are too. They launched a barrage of around 30 rockets at Israel yesterday all of them intercepted by the Iron Dome. But clearly despite all of these deaths, all of these Israeli airstrikes leveling 80 or more percent of Gaza including nearly all of the hospitals, certainly all the hospitals in the north and just a handful still functioning in the south, yet Hamas can still fire dozens of rockets and, Max, their international credibility amongst other extremist groups has been rising according to U.S. intelligence who believe that Hamas is more credible now after the attack on October 7th and their ability to continue fighting against Israel. Which could mean, unfortunately for Israel, more dollars flowing in, more weapons flowing in for Hamas, more training and certainly no Immediate end to this extremist organization that Israel has vowed it will continue fighting until they disappear. I was in the West Bank yesterday talking to people who said Hamas is much more than just a couple of figureheads, Max. There's a lot of people, a lot of leadership pockets of Hamas spread out around not just Gaza, but other Palestinian areas and frankly people said it's just not going to go away.

And so, they need to find a way to continue to go after the leadership of Hamas while keeping the everyday people out of it.You cannot have a situation where two million people are living and nearly all of them are displaced from their homes. You have thousands of people that don't have clean water, don't have food. You have half of that population at the starvation level. You have not only famine, but you have disease, unsanitary conditions, children who haven't been in school. You know, imagine sharing one bathroom with 2,000 other people, sleeping outside in tents, not having a shower for seven, eight weeks. These are the conditions, not to mention a lack of medicine, almost no functional medical care. It is just the kind of situation that Israel knows they cannot -- it cannot continue. So, they're now talking about the possibility of going into northern Gaza, starting to build, you know, temporary housing for people so they can start to return back to their homes. But it is just a disastrous situation. And of course, there is so much hatred on both sides, so much distrust on both sides It's just a situation that you stand back, and you have a look and you think, you know how both sides got there.
