Let's bring in Michelle Price, \"Associated Press\" national political reporter. Michelle, good morning. Thank you so much for being here on what really is a big day here in electoral politics. Let's start with abortion rights because this obviously is something that Democrats have seen pay dividends for them after Dobbs overturned Roe versus Wade. And they really are counting on it here. It's obviously on the ballot directly in Ohio. But in Virginia, you know, I'm not sure if you live in this media market. Obviously, we see -- I see all the ads in northern Virginia. It is relentless and endless as, you know, both Republicans and Democrats have been campaigning on this issue. How do you see it playing out?",

And the argument that abortion rights supporters are making is basically, if you give -- we've got two chambers there, and that either of them -- one is controlled by Democrats, one is controlled by Republicans, and either of both can flip.The argument they're making is that if you give Republicans full control of the government, this will be a change for abortion rights in Virginia. This is one of the few Southern states that -- that has not passed abortion restrictions after Dobbs. So, it's kind of an island there. But we are seeing this as Democrats are using this as kind of a proxy for 2024 to see if this is messaging that they can continue into those races all across the country next year.",

But Youngkin has basically said, look, if we succeed, I'll think about perhaps running for president, or, he's, you know, put off people who've encouraged him to run for president in this cycle by saying let's see what happens in Virginia first. I want to focus on that. If things do go well for Republicans in Virginia, we -- I mean, I have no doubt that there's going to be a little bubble of talk about what is Glenn Youngkin going to do. Is he going to get into the primary race? But I'm not sure it's going to make a difference one way or the other in a Republican field that has seen Donald Trump dominant basically throughout.

I don't think we can look at it that simply, because to occupy, it would also be responsible for governance, which possibly suggests boots on the ground as well.I'm not sure anything that we've heard from him recently, that's what he wants. So perhaps some sort of international peacekeeping force operating in Gaza, governing Gaza while Israel over oversees security.
