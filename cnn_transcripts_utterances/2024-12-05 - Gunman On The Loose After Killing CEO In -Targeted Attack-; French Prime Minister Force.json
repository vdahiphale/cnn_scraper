And he refused to negotiate who he was going to appoint as prime minister. He forced Barnier into that job, and the left and the right, bizarrely, have come together to oust the prime minister. This is really not so much a story about Barnier, who you see there. It's really about Macron and what he did with this snap election, forcing a prime minister on the country. He's now been ousted.

It came in fast, and we're feeling it this morning. And that means conditions are going to be treacherous, especially for some of those northern New England interior regions. So here's a look at the latest winter weather alerts. And I want to point out what's just been issued by the national weather service. This is a blizzard warning for Erie, Pennsylvania, just off of Lake Erie. The winds there whipping. Of course, we're getting that lake enhancement with the snowfall. But also in combination with this clipper that's moving through, it's going to be near whiteout conditions for that area, and along the I-90 -- Interstate 90 corridor right here that had such travel troubles last week from the lake effect snow event. So this is the storm system moving through. The majority of this is rain right near the coastline. But you work your way just a couple of miles inland. It is cool enough and high enough elevation where this is wet snowflakes that are falling from the sky. Even along the Boston area, the Massachusetts turnpike into the I-90 corridor. This is an area that could see some slick spots this morning, but it's not really accumulating too quickly. Another quick 1 to 2in of snowfall on the on the ground, but higher elevations could see certainly more than that now. Temperatures here really warm enough for rainfall. You can see New York to Washington. So, with this system moving through, but Boston flirting with that freezing mark. That's why we have that light snow mixing in at times. But, of course, behind it, the big story, the wind that is dropping our wind chill values into the single digits and lower teens. It is very, very cold. So, bundle up as you head outside this morning. Again, the additional snowfall for this area, 1 to 3 inches in general. There is a windy day ahead of us across the Northeast. It is cold. It is chilly. Be prepared, windy as conditions settle in by this evening for New York -- Kasie.",
