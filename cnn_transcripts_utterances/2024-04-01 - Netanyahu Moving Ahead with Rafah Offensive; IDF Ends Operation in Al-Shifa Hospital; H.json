Just ahead, Benjamin Netanyahu says he will not bend to U.S. pressure when it comes to moving Israel's military into Rafah. This as officials say high-level talks between the U.S. and Israel over the operation could take place in the hours ahead.Donald Trump marks the Easter holiday by lashing out at his political opponents. What he had to say and how such rhetoric is likely to be received by his base. And Britain's King Charles back in the public eye, making his first major public appearance since his cancer diagnosis. Good to have you with us. So, we begin in Israel where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says pressure from the U.S. will not stop his forces from going ahead with a planned military ground offensive in Rafah. Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, he said any delay so far has nothing to do with Washington's opposition to the plan nor the holy month of Ramadan, adding that such an operation takes time to plan. He also again claimed the operation was necessary to defeat Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL (through translation): We will go into Rafah and eliminate Hamas battalions there for one simple reason. There is no victory without entering Rafah and there is no victory without eliminating Hamas' battalions there. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH:  U.S. officials tell CNN high-level talks between U.S. and Israeli officials over Rafah could take place as soon as Monday. Those talks, originally scheduled for last week, were abruptly called off by Netanyahu after Washington refused to block a U.N. resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages. All this as Netanyahu is recovering from surgery for a hernia. The hospital says he is in quote \"excellent health, is awake and talking to his family.\" Meantime, mass anti-government protests rocked Jerusalem for a second straight day on Sunday. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets demanding the release of all remaining Israeli hostages and calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign and hold early elections.

The protesters intend to keep their pressure up over the coming days.

But that tonight is not what we've heard from these protesters. A good deal of anger, great calls now that his time in office should end.

He says more than 30 injured people had to be transported to another hospital east of Gaza City.

Thousands of displaced people are sheltering on the hospital grounds, along with several news teams working from tents in the area as well. It's still a struggle to get humanitarian aid into Gaza.

There is nothing subtle here about what he is doing.

Like Clinton and Obama, Biden has made expanding access to health care a centerpiece of his domestic policy agenda. Unlike them, he may actually benefit from them.The backlash against Bill Clinton's Clinton Care program, a proposal devised largely by Hillary Clinton, the backlash against that swept the Republicans to their landslide in 1994, his failure to pass it. The backlash against Barack Obama actually passing the ACA in a very polarized legislative debate helped Republicans win more seats in 2010 in the House than any party out of the White House since 1938. But when Republicans and Donald Trump tried to repeal the ACA in 2017, the politics flipped. Democrats shifted the focus from the parts of the law that are focused on expanding coverage for those without insurance to the parts of the law that protect people with pre- existing conditions who do have insurance. And since then, the law has been more popular than not. More Americans have said they want to keep it in place than want to repeal it. And you have the Republicans continuing to push down the road of repeal, as well as House Republicans talking about an idea like converting Medicaid into a block grant and Medicare into a voucher. They are providing Biden a lot of targets to try to win back some of those working-class voters who are disenchanted with him largely because of inflation and high prices.",

It does not seem like the Supreme Court is inclined, based on the oral arguments, to go along with the claims from the opponents that they should roll back the efforts that were taken under both Obama and Biden to make it easier to access Mifepristone. Trump left all of those rules, the Obama rules, in place while he waspresident. He didn't act against them. This time he faces much more pressure within his coalition to use tools at the FDA and even a 19th century law called the Comstock Act, through an opinion of the Justice Department, to restrict the distribution, maybe not only of Mifepristone, but any medical device that is used in abortion. And so, yeah, this issue is very much going to be on the ballot, not only regardless of what policy Trump pursues in terms of legislation around a nationwide ban on abortion, the administrative executive branch levers that he largely left untouched as president, again, he is going to face much more pressure within the party to deal with them, and I think Democrats are going to make voters very much aware of that.",
