This happened near the Texas border in Eagle Pass.Meantime, Texas officials have begun arresting migrants for the first time in the Shelby Park section of Eagle Pass after the state blocked federal border agents from access to the public park (INAUDIBLE) week. CNN's Rosa Flores has been following all of this, joins us live now from Eagle Pass. Rosa, you've gotten access inside the zone that Texas is controlling. What are you seeing?",

And you can see here that migrants use clothes and other items to try to protect themselves as they cross in.And as you mentioned, overnight we obtained videos and pictures from Mexican authorities showing that despite all this migrants are still trying to cross. Mexican authorities rescuing several of them. But I want to show you, because the international boundary between the U.S. and Mexico is the middle of this river. And once migrants cross the middle of the river, they are on U.S. territory and under U.S. law and policy. They should be processed under federal immigration laws. But, Phil, that is not happening right now because this area has been taken over by the state of Texas. So, instead of being processed under federal immigration law, they are being arrested and charged with criminal trespassing. That is a state charge. Phil.",

Do they feel like there's anything they can do in the near term to try and stem some of the tide here? FLORESis an extension of the talks that happened in mid-December in Mexico City between both countries. Now, look, the number of migrant apprehensions have plummeted since mid-December when migrants were -- excuse me, border patrol agents were apprehending about 10,000 migrants per day. Right now that number has dropped to about 4,000 migrants per day. And DHS attributes that drop to actions by Mexico, up to law enforcement and also deportation. And so these talks are a continuation of the talks in mid-December. They are going to continue working together and maintaining that relationship. As for what we can expect out of these talks, we're not expecting any big announcement. But yet again, this maintains the relationship between these two countries. And, Phil, you know as much as I do, what Mexico does or doesn't do when it comes to immigration impacts the number of migrants that end up on the U.S. southern border. Phil.",

Now, Willis was subpoenaed to appear in court next week as part of Wade's divorce case. But in a new filing, Fani Willis' attorney claims that Wade's estranged wife, quote, \"conspired with interested parties in the criminal election interference case to use the civil discovery process to annoy, embarrass, and oppress Willis.\" Willis' attorney did not directly acknowledge the allegation but said, quote, \"because the parties agree their marriage is irretrievably broken, there is no information that Willis could provide that would be relevant.\"These allegations against Willis and Wade came in a court filing earlier this month by someone named Mike Roman. He is a former Trump 2020 campaign official who was indicted over his role in the fake electors plot. Roman alleges that Wade is having an affair with Willis and used money he billed the D.A.'s office for his work on the case to take her on fancy vacations. It's complicated, but could be crucial. Roman's attorney has not yet provided direct evidence of any affair. The judge overseeing the Trump case did, though, set a hearing on all of this to consider the motion that Willis has put forward to quash the subpoena. Here to discuss all of this, legal analyst, former U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael Moore. It is super complicated, but I just wonder, Michael --",

But to see in a case like this where the -- she makes the allegations that he's being questioned because he may be an African American male, I think it misses the mark. I don't think you can use race as a sword to attack somebody clearly, but nor do I think that you can use it as a shield to hide behind to say that simply because the -- you know, you may be African American, that your activities are beyond any inquiry, especially when these allegations are made. And I think that's the line she's crossed.It strikes me that these are very similar tactics to what we even see with Trump, and that is that, you know, instead of facing the allegations head on and simply giving an answer of yes or no, this is true or no it's not true or yes I did this and it was a mistake and I'm sorry and, you know, what can I do to make it right, instead we seen now it's an attack on the people who are questioning or raising the issue for further investigation.

That's two decades after he was convicted of murdering his pregnant wife. Laci Peterson was 27-years- old and eight months pregnant when she disappeared on Christmas Eve in 2002. Her body was found in the San Francisco Bay in April of 2003. Peterson was convicted in 2004 of murdering his wife and their unborn son. He was sentenced to death in 2005. That was overturned in 2020 and a court ordered his conviction re-examined. But in 2021 he was resentenced to life in prison without parole.Now, however, the L.A. Innocence Project wants to exonerate Peterson by contending the key evidence was withheld from his first trial. Peterson has maintained his innocence throughout his sentence and claims he received an unfair trial based on possible juror misconduct. CNN's Jean Casarez joins us now. Jean, you were in the courthouse back in 2004 when he was sentenced to death. For those who don't remember it, this case was enormous.",
