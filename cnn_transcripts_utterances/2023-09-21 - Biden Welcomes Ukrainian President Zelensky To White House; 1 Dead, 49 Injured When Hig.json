      "sentences": "And of course, you know, we speak to soldiers on the ground here on the frontlines and also your average everyday Ukrainians that we meet on the streets here as well, and that we deal with as we're on the ground here. Of course it's something that's of grave concern to them.There are a lot of people who are quite concerned about the next presidential election and what could happen after that presidential election. At the same time, they also say that for them, this is an existential fight, and it is a fight that is going to continue. They say -- and I spoke to a soldier actually today about this. They say look, they basically have no other choice than to go on the battlefield. He said I don't want to go to war. I don't want to be at war. In fact, there's nothing I want to do less. But they say that right now for them, there simply is no other choice for their own future, for the future of their children. A lot of them say as well. So they understand that they need to figure out a way to keep weapons flowing into this country and to keep countries -- to supply them with weapons going forward. The U.S., of course by far is their most important ally in doing that, and I think that's why you're seeing the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy makes such a big effort. But yes, they do understand that there could be a point where they're going to have to either depend on others or depend on themselves. And I think you are seeing them also in the long-term trying to build up some of those capabilities. There are some Western arms companies that are already talking about moving manufacturing or at least moving some of the repair of weapons here onto Ukrainian territory. Of course, with all the risks that that encompasses as well. There are also some European companies who are also talking about longer term aid for Ukraine. But the Ukrainians certainly do understand that in the end they are very dependent on the goodwill of countries like the United States. And certainly the United States also seeing themselves in this fight and seeing themselves -- or seeing this as a very important issue to the United States, a fundamental issue to the United States. And that's what we can see. Not just President Zelenskyy making that point, but an array of other Ukrainian politicians, and certainly Ukrainian military leaders. If you look at, for instance, at the head of the Ukrainian General Staff making that point again and again, that they are very thankful for the weapons they are getting. They certainly are going to need a lot more of them. And they certainly are going to need it, most probably for a long period of time. I think one of the things, you know, that we've also seen over the past couple of weeks, the past couple of months, is that the Ukrainians are saying with the counteroffensive, the way it's going right now, is something that could take a long period of time, certainly for larger territorial gains to take hold. They do have a bit of momentum going on right now on the battlefield, but they are still pretty far away from, for instance, cutting off Crimea. The land route to Crimea from the Russians, for instance, making a major breakthrough in the east of the country as well. So for them they know it's going to be tough. The people here, quite frankly, are extremely motivated. They are saying, look, they don't want to give up any of their territory. They certainly don't want to have some sort of negotiated solution with the Russians, where they give up territory like for instance Crimea. That some is something that right now in public opinion here in this country, simply is not in the cards. But of course they also know that all of that -- making all of that happen or trying to make all of that happen is very much also in the hands of countries like the U.S. and their will to continue to supply Ukraine with the weapons that, of course, are extremely sophisticated. On the other hand, also extremely expensive.",

So he now has as of mid-November the title of chairman of the Fox Corporation and News Corp and all of the influence which goes with that.And you can imagine what influence that is, given how Rupert Murdoch has certainly shaped the discourse, I would say, of politics in the United States also actually here in the U.K. So will there be any major changes to the editorial stance, for instance, of Fox News? Well, we believe Lachlan very much has the same political views of his father. CNN has been told by sources that he doesn't much like former President Donald Trump. But judging as his CEO of Fox, the decisions that have been made under him would suggest there isn't any major change. This brings me to the more interesting point about who controls this empire. It's still Rupert Murdoch. In the future though, you could see Lachlan needing the support of his siblings.",

And the overall theme of that we've heard from them as to why all of the sudden they're crossing and these kinds of numbers in between ports of entry, which is essentially hits them as an illegal entry, can cause problems for them as they move through the immigration process in the U.S.But many of them say they're just simply desperate. That they're coming from countries, dictatorships like Venezuela, and it is just unsafe for them and that they've been traveling for months to reach the U.S. Mexico border. Many of them, Brianna, also tell us they've been waiting to travel and enter into the U.S. through this program that was set up, called the CBP One app, where essentially you request a meeting, you wait your turn and then you cross when you get that appointment. But many people say they're just simply tired of waiting. That they've been waiting for months to get those appointments. And that's perhaps one of the reasons why we're seeing this massive influx of immigrants -- migrants crossing into the U.S. illegally. Here in Eagle Pass, we've seen hundreds and hundreds throughout the day. Might be a little bit hard to make out because many of them are now held in -- are in custody now underneath this bridge. But in the shadow, you have hundreds of migrants who are waiting to be processed. We're told some will be processed and charged with trespassing from the state -- from state authorities and others will be processed by Border Patrol -- Brianna.",

But that is what they discover in this trap that was built into the floor.So certainly they've already recovered one kilo after the kids were sick and after that one child died. And now looking into this more and doing this further investigation and search warrant, they have found additional drugs. And this is going to obviously raise all kinds of questions. We're also told that this is part of a larger investigation now that's going global, overseas into other parts of the world. Because they're trying to figure out exactly how these drugs are being brought in. The DEA is involved. The Department of Homeland Security, HSI. There's all sorts of agencies still investigating. While these two are now indicted in the state court on the murder charges but they're also facing federal charges related to the distribution of narcotics.
