One of the silos that hit at that poor facility was a grain storage warehouse and another silo storing other agricultural project -- product was also hit. But I think, significantly, think about the Danube in this way. The Danube River has been one of the principle ways that Ukraine has been using to get its grain out of the country when Russia has been blocking the Black Sea. It's increased its amount of grain that's pushed out of Ukraine along that route to international markets. Now, Russia is targeting that, having just stopped the Black Sea route as well, this is why the prices are up. This is why there's concern.",

Putin is placing nuclear missile sites and systems inside Belarusia, and Belarusia itself is now taken in the Wagner mercenary fighters that Putin wanted them to do. So, Belarusia is helping Russia.Now, what are they actually discussing? Well, Putin has used this opportunity to say, look, Ukraine's counteroffensive has failed. So, that's been part of the narrative to emerge from here. And Lukashenko has said, hey, these Wagner fighters, some of them want to go and attack in the west, meaning Poland. So, you know, threatening escalatory language there, if you will, from both of the leaders. But you have to remember that this is the propaganda that they want to push.

This morning, there's some intriguing new reporting from \"The Washington Post\" as a new indictment against Donald Trump could come any day, one dealing with the events surrounding January 6th. \"The Post\" reports, \"Mark Meadows -- \", who was serving at Trump's chief of the staff at the time, \" -- wrote to a White House lawyer that his son, Atlanta-area Attorney Blake Meadows had been probing possible fraud and had found only a handful of possible votes cast in dead voters' names, far short of Trump was alleging. The lawyer teasingly responded that perhaps Meadows' son could locate the thousands of votes Trump would need to win the election.\" CNN Legal Analyst Elliot Williams is with us now. And Elliot, why would Mark Meadows, involve in a joking conversation about the lack of widespread voter fraud before January 6th? Why would that be important?",

I'm not saying it's necessarily the smoking gun that leads to the president's conviction, but it's the president's voice talking about the subject of the investigation that the Justice Department's looking into.

They've broken their record consecutive streak. 10 consecutive days with temperatures of 110 degrees Fahrenheit or greater. I should say, that's a tie in these previous record streak set back in 1961. That should come to an end today because their temperature has dropped to only a high of 108 for the forecast temperature.
