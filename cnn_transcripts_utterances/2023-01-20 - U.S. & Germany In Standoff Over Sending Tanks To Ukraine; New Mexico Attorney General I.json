But the group failed to come to an agreement on one of Ukraine's most pressing requests, whether Germany will send some of its leopard two tanks to Ukrainian forces. These tanks are seen as a crucial modern weapon. There are nearly 2000 of them spread across Europe right now, 2000. Allies such as Poland have them and are willing to send some of them to Ukraine, but export laws require Poland to get permission from Germany where the tanks were made, permission that has not yet come from the German government. Now, Germany did announce today an aid package for Ukraine worth more than a billion dollars, But as CNN's Alex Marquardt reports for us right now, despite that generous offer, thanks but no tanks.

Its forces are forging ahead, fighting Putin's army within the battle capabilities they have right now. CNN's Fred Pleitgen was north of Kyiv today. He witnessed Ukrainian troops preparing for a possible large-scale Russian invasion. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Preparing to defend against a second gigantic attack even as they are already under assault by Russia, Ukrainian units held large- scale drills to prepare for bigger battles to come. The head of Ukraine's joint forces command tells me, we need to know what exactly to prepare the forces for and how they should be prepared, he says. That's why this is so important. We are in the Chernobyl exclusion's own, the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history. Ukraine Special Forces are practicing urban combat in the abandoned buildings. The U.S. and its allies believe the Russians could mount a massive offensive when the spring comes. That is why Ukrainians are getting their forces ready even as they are already fighting the Russians on several fronts in this country. The Ukrainians say that to win, they need more modern Western weapons, especially main battle tanks. In terms of quality, there is a big difference, the general says, because of the fire control systems of Western equipment are far superior to Russian weapons. As the battles in places like Bakhmut and eastern Ukraine remain brutal and casualties mount, Ukraine's leadership says it is grateful for the massive military aid announced at the Ramstein meeting. But Kyiv is disappointed Germany still has not signed off on sending Leopard 2 tanks, which would be key to help them turn the tide, a top presidential adviser tells me. Our guys will not leave in the battlefield even if they are not provided with equipment, he says, a more of them will die. This must stop. We want our people to have a better chance of saving their own lives. The Ukrainians say the new aid announced Friday is going to go a long way to help them beat Russia back. Mykhailo Podolyak says he hopes the U.S. and its allies will keep weapons flowing in the long run. I think our allies have the perfect understanding of the price we are paying, he says. It's very important for Russia to lose. They understand the nature of this war, the nature of Russia, and why it is impossible to negotiate with them. The Ukrainians say they need to grasp the initiative before the Russians can recover from their losses and they are gearing up for what could be a brutal spring. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera):  But, Jake, the Ukrainians say there's a whole another facet to this as well. They say they are having increasing problems getting spare parts for Soviet-era tanks and ammunition as well. On the other hand, those modern Western tanks would have better capabilities, but it's also about staying in the fight, especially as the Russian offensive looms -- Jake.",

The notion that the Russians are saying -- well, if we lose on the ground on a conventional basis, we might give them weapons. They've said that before. That is something we have to be concerned about, but you can't have Russia wrapped itself in a nuclear jackets and threatened to blow itself up and the rest of the world.

Wade. Her investigation could not figure out who did actually link it. CNN Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic is here with more. So, she says she talked to that, but where these formal interviews, or these just talking? JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SUPREME COURT ANALYST:  She suggests they weren't as formal as with the justices. Let me read what she said, at least part of, it Jake. This is Gail Curley, who is the marshal of the Supreme Court, who had conducted the investigation. During the course of the investigation, I spoke with each of the justices, several on multiple occasions. The justices actively cooperated, she says that they asked questions about their own and they answered hers. She said she followed with all credible leads, none of which implicated the justices or their spouses. On this basis she said, I don't believe it was necessary to ask the justices decide sworn affidavits. Now, I should tell you that for the longest law clerks, who were interviewed by marshal Gail Curley, they were asked to sign affidavits, other employees some -- 80-some employees actually closer to 90 some employees were interviewed more formally as far as yesterday's report suggested. I do have to say that this statement which is the first we've gotten about any kind of interactions that the marshal had with the individual justices followed a lot of questions that were raised yesterday when the Supreme Court put out its report, and showed frankly many shortcomings and its security and its protocols for confidentiality.",
