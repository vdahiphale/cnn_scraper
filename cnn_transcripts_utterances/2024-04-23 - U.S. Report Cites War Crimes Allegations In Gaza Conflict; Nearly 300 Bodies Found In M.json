It's important not to rush that work, but the State Department will be making its own determination.

A warning now CNN's Nada Bashir report has some graphic and disturbing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): For the last 10 days, this mother has returned to Gaza's Nasser Hospital, searching desperately for the body of her 24-year-old daughter called Kulfa (ph). She had been buried at this makeshift gravesite in January. Now, her body is missing. The Israelis turn the hospital upside down, she says. They dug up all the dead bodies and move them around. These other shrouded corpses of those retrieved from a newly discovered mass grave in Khan Younis. Nearly 300 bodies have so far been recovered, according to Gaza civil defense, but the search is still ongoing. This is a crime against humanity, Dr. Almaraya (ph) says. How could the Israeli occupation forces dig up these graves and mishandled the bodies of our martyrs. In some cases, they even opened and removed the bodies from their bags, even though their names been marked on them. Many of the bodies recovered here were buried by relatives or medics on hospitals grounds in January as a temporary measure. Israel's relentless bombardment of the southern city making it too difficult to carry out a traditional burial. Following the IDF's withdrawal in Khan Younis, families returned in the hope of finally laying their loved ones to rest, only to find that their bodies had been exhumed by the Israeli military, according to Civil Defense officials, and discarded in this nearby mass grave. I still haven't found my son and his body, this father says. We'd buried him over there, but we can't find him anymore. We just want to give him a dignified burial. According to Gaza Civil Defense chief somebody's have been discovered with their hands tied together. An indication he says that these may be the victims of alleged failed executions. Though CNN is unable to verify such claims and cannot confirm the causes of death among the bodies being unearth. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment without response, but this would not be the first time graves have been disturbed by the Israeli military. The IDF previously acknowledging that its forces have exhumed graves in Gaza in order to carry out DNA tests to identify potential hostages. This man points to the palm tree beside which his brother Allah (ph) had been buried. Two weeks on and his body has still not been found. Under international humanitarian law, graves must in times of war, be respected, properly maintained and marked, so they may always be found. But in Gaza, the Palestinian people have been robbed of their dignity, even in death. Nada Bashir, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
