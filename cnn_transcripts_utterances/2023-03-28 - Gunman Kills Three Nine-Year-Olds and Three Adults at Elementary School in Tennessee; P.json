In Nashville the response took just 14 minutes from when the first 911 call was placed to the shooter being killed. And police say five officers responded after the 911 call came in at 10In both Uvalde and in Nashville the shooter entered through a side door, and Uvalde police say that the door was unlocked. CNN has identified the side entrance that the shooter in Nashville used. It's on the westside of the building. It is unknown if the door was locked or not, but as you'll see here in this surveillance video, it didn't matter, right? Didn't matter. The shooter just fired their way right through two glass doors. CNN's senior crime and justice correspondent is Shimon Prokupecz. Shimon joins us now. He won the Polk Award, as a matter of fact, for his reporting in Uvalde. Shimon, good morning to you.

After 911, there was all this security that went into infrastructure and buildings to prevent against terrorism. Schools now are a target, a big target for shooters, for killers, and they studied. This shooter here, we have evidence, did surveillance, knew where to go, knew where they could possibly get in with these, and they found that door.The other thing I think with this is that we need to learn more about the shooter, right. There are certainly indications as there are this trail of warning signs with this shooter. So hopefully today the police can release more information, more about the timeline. The 14 minutes, yes, it sounds fast. But it's really not that fast. A lot of times these things are over in three, four, five, six minutes. so I think we need to know more from the police on the timeline and go back and look more on what was going on in the shooter's life at the time.",

Pecker was the Chief Executive of the National Enquirer's parent company known as AMI until 2020.He played a key role in connecting Stormy Daniels as attorney with then Trump Attorney Michael Cohen. Daniels wanted to sell her story of an affair she says she had with Trump to the paper. Trump has denied the affair, he continued to do so, even as of last night, but Cohen did ultimately pay Daniels $130,000 in exchange for her silence. The Grand Jury is next scheduled to meet tomorrow.
