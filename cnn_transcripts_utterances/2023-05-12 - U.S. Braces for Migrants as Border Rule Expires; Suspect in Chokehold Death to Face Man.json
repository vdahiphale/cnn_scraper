Border Patrol is bracing for tens of thousands of migrants who have been waiting to cross into the United States. This is what we've been seeing from the West Coast to the Gulf of Mexico. New overnight, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas issued a warning that the border is not open. But that is not deterring some 60,000 migrants from staging along the border as the clock ran out on Title 42, according to the Border Patrol chief. And a new wrinkle this morning. A judge is now blocking the Biden administration from quickly releasing migrants without court notices. The feds say that change will lead to dangerous overcrowding at border facilities that are already under immense strain. The Biden administration has been surging troops, federal agents and government workers toured the Southern border as this clock ticked down. So we begin there with Nick Valencia live on the border in a town named Brownsville, Texas. Nick, they're really -- them and El Paso feeling the brunt of this.

And that's why they need more time. You know, a lot of aids that I have been talking to say it was probably always a heavy lift to have two big meetings with congressional leaders and the president at the White House within one week. That's not to say they aren't going to get together next week. They feel like they can continue to make some progress. They met yesterday, staffers did, for more than two hours on Capitol Hill. They are trying to hammer out specifically what they are negotiating. And I know that sounds like it's premature, but it is so important to nail down the parameters of the negotiation. A couple of things that the White House and Democrats want to take off the table is any conversation about repealing parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. That, of course, a signature piece of legislation the president signed last fall. Meanwhile, the White House is signaling a lot more openness to discussing a potential budget caps deal. That is, of course, setting top line numbers and how much the country is going to spend over the next couple of years and how it relates to raising the debt ceiling.

He says she will be starting in six week and that his role will transition to being executive chair and chief technology officer, overseeing product software.Now, \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that Twitter is in talks to hire NBCUniversal's head of advertising, Linda Yaccarino. Now, Musk conducted a poll last December, asking -- a Twitter poll, asking if he should step down as CEO. The majority agreed, yes, he probably should. Well, joining us now is CNN media analyst and Axios media reporter Sara Fischer. Sara, I think what I was so fascinated by is advertising, more specifically, advertising revenue has always been kind of the elephant in the room during Elon Musk's tenure. This would seem to be a pretty good person to address that as an issue. Is that kind of the dynamic of what might be driving this? SARA FISCHER, CNN MEDIA ANALYST: Absolutely. Linda is considered one of the biggest industry leaders in advertising and has been for many years. She oversees a very large budget across so many different platforms, mediums and events. And so she's definitely the person that you're going to want to have leading your ads business. The question that I have, though, is that, for platforms like Twitter, where they've long struggled to catch up to Meta and Google, is that they don't have a lot of small and medium-size business advertisers. They rely too heavily on the big brands. That's Linda's bread and butter, the big brands. And so I'm curious to see, because we, Axios, also reported that Linda is in talks about that role. I'm curious to see if and when she comes in, what her plan is for some of those smaller advertisers. Not just the big ones on Madison Avenue that she's used to working with.",

I mean, she is considered, like I said, the foremost authority on Madison Avenue for the person who they should be and want to be working with in terms of advertising.I actually think the bigger risk is whether or not Linda can convince Elon not to be erratic enough to just, like, fire her in a few weeks. That's the bigger risk. She's got a huge job at NBCU. She's the chairman of all advertising and partnerships. She oversees everything from big sports events to the Olympics. So now you're going to go into this pretty risky situation where you just have to hope that Elon Musk doesn't change his mind. But you're right. For advertisers, that erraticness is a little bit of a cause for concern. There's only so much that Linda can do. One thing I'll tell you, though, Poppy, that my sources have told me. Elon Musk hates meeting with brands. He hates doing the advertising circuit. He hates going to these conferences. So if there's one silver lining here, it's that he hates doing it so much, maybe he's incentivized to keep Linda onboard just so he doesn't have to go back to doing it.",

And what is changing today is that now, the guidelines for who can donate blood are becoming the same for everybody. It's based on individual risk. So it has nothing to do with sexual orientation, sex or gender. And this is really putting the U.S. in line with countries like the U.K. and Canada, which have already done this.",

During the pandemic, they shortened that to three months, because there was a shortage of blood. So sort of a step-wise change over time. And finally now, they are just changing it.
