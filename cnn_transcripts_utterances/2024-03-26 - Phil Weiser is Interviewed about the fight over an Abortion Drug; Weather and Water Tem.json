It's the FDA's job to make expert judgments about the safety of drugs, like Mifepristone. That's what they did here. Coloradans rely on this. And to force Coloradans to go either to a medical abortion or to a drug that's less reliable or effective, it's just wrong. And it goes against what the court said in Dobbs, which is, this will be up to the states. That's why we're fighting so hard for this reproductive freedom. We know that the battle joined in Dobbs is not over. This is one other example of fighting for reproductive freedom. Coloradans care deeply about it. That's why I'm fighting in this case.",

So, for example, the pharmaceutical industry has also gotten involved filing what I hope to be an influential amicus briefs saying that this destabilizes the whole pharmaceutical industry to have courts making these judgments.I'm working with a coalition of states that believe in reproductive freedom, making the point that you can't just take this drug off the market because it's a medication assisted abortion drug. That's actually taking choice away from states that want abortion to be legal. So we're committed to protecting the people of our states, protecting our rights as states to push for reproductive freedom. And if this decision is allowed to stand, it's going to be a huge setback for reproductive freedom.",

A decision reversing the safety of Mifepristone could seriously undermine the FDA's approval process and invite conservative judges to second guess the agency's guidelines.What are your worries among some of those things that you have been seeing, that there is an increased use in this?",

      "sentences": "My worries are several fold. We need to be very clear about why reproductive freedom matters. When a woman says to a doctor, I'm worried about my pregnancy for any number of reasons, the ability to manage your pregnancy with one's life and one's mental health, the potential that maybe the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, health concerns, whatever those conversations are, that's between a woman and a doctor. You remove the most reliable, effective way to provide abortion care. You're making life harder on people. That has a real impact. It makes it harder for someone who might then have to go for a medical procedure.So, we're really concerned about a huge step back for reproductive freedom. We're also really concerned because the drug industry in the United States of America is one of the most innovative in the world. We've got a system to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of drugs. This would append that whole system by giving judges the ability to make, for whatever reasons they might think, determinations, no, we don't want this drug on the market, that could have applications in a range of areas. So, this case is a really big deal. It's important for reproductive freedom. It's important for our pharmaceutical industry. And it's important for the rule of law.",

It's around 48 degrees right now across the Patapsco River, near the Baltimore Harbor, and near where the bridge collapsed at 1The other thing that we have to consider in this very fluid and dynamic situation is what's happening above the water. So - and also right at the surface of the water as well. So, we have these search and rescue boats that are navigating these waters, which, by the way, are very choppy, made more choppy by increasing winds. But we have just gone through a high tide cycle, which is now changing into low tide. And because we have a full moon right now, we have exaggerated tidal cycles. So, whether or not that's impacting currents or perhaps that choppiness of the waves across the Chesapeake and more particularly into the Patapsco River, that still needs to be figured out exactly. However, with this change in the high to low tide, we anticipate those currents to be difficult to navigate and challenging for these search and rescue operations. On top of that, we have an approaching cold front that will come through. That's going to increase the winds and also bring in precipitation to the area in the next 24 hours. Right now it's dry. Visibility is clear. Not a problem. But the winds will pick up out of this system as it approaches from the west. John.",

This is the Chesapeake Bay. Here's the Delmarva Peninsula. The East Coast of the U.S. And more particularly, we've got the Patapsco River that is flowing out from Baltimore. So, both of these working together. As the tide starts to go towards low tide, do we start to change the currents from not only the ocean, but also the river? Does that impact what's happening near where the collapse of the bridge occurred last night at 1So, a lot of questions still need to be answered. One things for sure though, we do have these special marine statements in place from the National Weather Service in terms of the winds on the open water throughout this area. We also have our coastal flood advisory because of these exaggerated floods I mentioned with the ongoing high tides that we have right now. Spring tides, actually.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:48:42] SIDNER: All right, an urgent search still underway for survivors of that terrible bridge collapse in Baltimore this morning. The White House says it is closely monitoring the situation involving that bridge collapse. A White House official telling CNN, \"the president has been briefed on the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and the ongoing search and rescue efforts. He will continue to receive updates from his team throughout the day.\" Biden is scheduled to leave D.C. in just a few hours for North Carolina. CNN's Kevin Liptak is with us at the White House.

I want to just give you guys a look, quickly, at the area where we areexpecting there to be a press conference very shortly now from authorities about an update as to what is happening with the search and rescue, for example, in that Baltimore bridge collapse. Joining me now is Representative Kweisi Mfume. The Francis Scott Key Bridge is in his district. Thank you, sir, so much for - for ringing us and giving us some of your time this morning. When you look at what has happened here, especially since we've been watching this for - for several hours now, just give me your thoughts on what happened here and what your biggest concerns are at this hour. REP. KWEISI MFUME (D-MD): Well, my first thought is, like everyone else, that this is indeed an unthinkable kind of horror. There's nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist act in any way at all, but everything points to some sort of error. I - we don't know if it was in the navigation system or with the people who were guiding the ship in, but the pilots who guide these ships and who are on the phone all the time directly with whoever the captain of the ship is, is a very trained individual. So, something must have really gone wrong here to cause this. I've spoken directly with Secretary Buttigieg this morning, spoken with the White House. They are responding with all of the assets at their disposal. Our prayers right now are obviously for the missing individuals and the victims of this tragedy. And we are very appreciative and thank God for the effective service of our first responders. Above and beyond this becomes what happens next. And it's kind of hard to think about that right now until we have able - are able to secure this situation, particularly to determine any loss of human life. But it's going to have a huge, economic impact on the area. The Port of Baltimore is one of the busiest ports in the nation. The on/off docks down at the Dundalk Terminal bring in and take out more cargo than most people could ever imagine. This particular ship was on a 27- day journey to Sri Lanka. I'm not exactly sure whether or not its cargo was diversified or it's just a single product. But in any event, it cuts off that portion of the port. It's right at the foot of the Chesapeake Bay. And so this is going to require a great deal of effort from city, state and, obviously, our federal government. And I'm - I'm pleased, at least, that the White House has expressed every interest in trying to get this done. It's a - it's an unfolding situation and so I think the better thing right now is to listen in to the press conference. The governor wanted to, after declaring a state of emergency, bring people up to date with the very latest.",
