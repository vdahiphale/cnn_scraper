And let's begin with this latest information fighting in Israel and Gaza continues following yesterday's terror attack carried out by Hamas. We're seeing pictures from earlier in the day in Gaza where explosions lit up the darkness there. We're also learning that Hamas is holding as many as 30 people captive in Gaza. That's according to the Islamic Jihad Secretary General and residents in more than 20 Israeli communities near Gaza are being told to evacuate as hotspots of fighting continue to flare up. A video showing Israeli Border Police rescuing civilians after an exchange of gunfire with Hamas fighters on Saturday. And then officials say at least 600 Israelis were killed in yesterday's terror attacks, more than 2,000 people wounded. And this disturbing video showing dozens of body bags stacked at the site of a musical festival where Hamas fighters attacked concertgoers. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the US is trying to confirm reports that Americans are among those killed. Israel is striking back at targets in Gaza, and there you can see a mosque that was destroyed by Israeli airstrikes. More than 300 Palestinians have been killed and 1,900 wounded in the fighting.

Clarissa Ward is along the Gaza border very close to Ashkelon, CNN's Nic Robertson is in Sderot in Israel, two places which are used to incoming rockets, but have never seen anything like this, the ground incursions that both those communities have experienced. Clarissa, I want to start off with you. We have seen just sickening videos of women, young men, elderly people being taken, kidnapped -- taken, dragged across the border brutally into Gaza where they will be held hostage and used to suit the purposes of Islamic Jihad and Hamas. Talk a little bit about -- there was a music festival that we've heard about that was going on. A lot of people had gathered, a lot of young people, and that is where we've seen some of the hostages were taken from. Talk about what you've learned about what happened there.",

We were in Sderot earlier on today. They announced pretty quickly when they're taken back control of the police station there last night, in the early hours of this morning after a heavy firefight. So, yes, those areas that were in contention a couple of hours ago, still appear in contention with similar experience to what Clarissa is experiencing. When you come across groups of soldiers, they will be on high alert. Checkpoints were found. Soldiers who have the safety on their weapons, because that's the posture they need to be in because they are concerned that the next person that comes up to them could be from Hamas, because those infiltrations are still existing. We haven't heard about any new infiltrations this evening, but we were yesterday evening, we were early this morning. We heard about one this afternoon, as well. We heard a burst of gunfire close to us. That again was a suspected infiltration and that's what the Israeli forces are up against around here. And I think what we're witnessing this field medical post that earlier on when we were talking just a couple of hours ago, Anderson, there were ambulances swarming around here, it's really buzzing with medics and doctors. Now, a lot of those ambulances have taken off. They've dispersed around the area, because they're moving into places where the Army feels that they will be better ready to be used. And I think the understanding that we would have is that they will be close to those areas of contention, because they're not just helping civilians here, they are helping injured soldiers as well. It is all about trying to take back control, and making sure that any wounded, any casualties can get speedy help -- Anderson.",

We also, as Nic had described, had to turn around at one stage because there was an active firefight going on with the Israeli military and what we would presume, were Hamas militants. As Nic said, they continue to lurk or hide in plain sight in these areas. And so for now, the focus is very much to try to root out any militants who may have infiltrated, but also to build up a huge presence along that border and to try to repair the damage to the border. One of the things that I hadn't necessarily expected to see was huge flatbed trucks carrying building materials to try to repair the damage at some of these places where the border was transgressed, and I'm just warning you now, Anderson, because I have just lost communications on my phone here, so I will not be able to hear you for a minute.

The power is off in a lot of parts of the town, so it's dark.So a lot of people there will have that uneasy feeling about the explosions, and some of the explosions we were hearing and the gunfire was very close. And that seemed to indicate that -- and certainly the troops on patrol, weapons ready, looking for a suspected Hamas militant on the streets there late this afternoon, indicate that there is that potential. It's so difficult, in a way it's proving a negative, how do you know when you have them all rounded up? It's very hard to know. One can pop up and start shooting, just because the area has been quiet for a few hours, doesn't mean it's fully secure. It's when the fence is re-secured. It's when you've got the troops in place, and perhaps, it is going to take realistically, several days for know for sure that all the militants have been rounded up.   It is just -- it's a very big logistical task, and at night here, you can hide out pretty easily and that's despite the high-tech equipment the Israeli Forces have, but re-establishing the border is obviously critical. If you don't have it sealed, and you don't have eyes on it, again, re- establish that level of control, you're still open -- you're still open to infiltration -- Anderson.",

You do want to inform the Israeli population about how you're going to secure them, but you're not going to announce publicly we're moving X number of forces and X equipment down to Gaza, because you also may need to put some of that, keep it in reserve close to Jerusalem, close to areas in the West Bank where violence could be triggered there.So that will be an Israeli military concern as well as the north, the border with Lebanon. We saw a sort of a testing of that, if you will, overnight. It's not clear what the other players in this multiple threat matrix, bet it Syria, as you were discussing with Clarissa earlier, be it Hezbollah in Lebanon, be it other actors in the West Bank, and it is not just Hamas, Islamic Jihad. You know, ISIS is believed to have a foothold in some of those areas inside the West Bank. So there are multiple actors presenting multiple threats, and if you announce you're going to secure the border with Gaza with a big swarm of force, you potentially leave yourself vulnerable, you potentially signal that you're going to be vulnerable.

You know, for us, this is very reminiscent of what we heard on 9/11, and the feeling is just absolute, distraught and devastation. For my organization, the Women's International Zionist Organization, this is so personal. We have four daycare centers in this in the town of Sderot. We have a facility that helps with PTSD. We have been reaching out to our workers frantically to make sure that they're all okay, that they are all accounted for. The Merhavia kibbutz of Afula is also a community we know so well. This is a community we helped evacuate in 2014. Just shortly after that, they gave us a tremendous thrust to say thank you. We now know that at least 15 of those kibbutznik are dead, including families. This is a kibbutz that has a project called the Wall of Peace where all they want is peace with their neighbors, where you can place a tile on the wall between Gaza and Israel.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced it will now be heading to the Eastern Med. So from European waters into the waters of the Middle East off the coast of Israel there.Now let's be clear about what the goal of this Carrier Strike Group is there. It is not to take part in Israel's operation. It is instead to offer a message of support and deterrence. It was President Joe Biden, who said yesterday that other parties, referencing even if you're not naming Hezbollah in Lebanon and other militant groups in Syria, warning them not to get involved here, and that now is what the US is showing with this Carrier Strike Group that also consists of a guided missile cruiser and a number of guided missile destroyers. The Commander of US Central Command, General Eric Kurilla underscored that in a statement about the deployment saying: US CENTCOM stands firmly with our Israeli and regional partners to address the risks of any party seeking to expand the conflict. It's also worth pointing out that it's not just the Navy stepping in here. The Air Force is as well. There are several fighter squadrons, not in Israel, but in the Middle East, in countries like Qatar and other areas, those will be augmented, according to Austin. So there, you'll see squadrons of F-35s, F-15s, F-16s, A-10s essentially bolstered here. Now it's important to note that some of those squadrons were sent to the region specifically as a response to increased Iranian aggression both in Syria and in the Gulf of Oman against commercial shipping there. And the purpose of these deployments was to deter that sort of behavior. Now with what we're seeing from Hamas, a terrorist organization that gets part of its funding, part of its guidance from Iran, that message expanded with the augmentation, the bolstering of these fighter squadrons in the region -- Anderson.",

Having been there six years, I honestly don't know the number off the top of my head, how many there are there, but it is a significant number. I would expect and this is partially just speculation, a number well over a hundred thousand American citizens who are dual American-Israeli citizens in the country who have moved there and take part and live in Israeli society. It is worth noting that we have seen statements from for example, Mexico and Brazil saying they believe some of their citizens were taken hostage. And the only reason I point that out is this isn't simply an issue for America and Israel to deal with.

And again, one of them talked about using things like RPG, so it appears it wasn't just potential rifle fire.We've also heard from parents of some of these people who are attending the festival because as you'd expect, at a sort of all-night rave, a lot of them were young, a lot of them were in their 20s. And we heard from one father who just gave a press conference a few hours ago, saying that he was on the phone with two of his daughters who attended the festival together, they called him when the militants first started coming in. He told them to lay on the ground facedown to hold each other. He said that he could hear men speaking Arabic around them. And he said he was on the phone with him for about 30 minutes before the last thing he heard was a few deep breaths. He says he has no idea where his daughters are, whether they're among the killed, whether they are among the captives, because we know that quite a few captives were taken from this event. Again, this is one of the darkest -- this alone, this alone -- this attack on a festival by itself, Anderson, would be one of the darkest days for Israel in its entire history.

But in the longer term, Prime Minister Netanyahu has vowed to essentially break the back of Hamas, make sure that they can never carry out anything like this again, but actually doing that, that's really complicated. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ABDELAZIZ (voice over): These are the first moments of what Prime Minister Netanyahu warned will be a long and difficult war. Airstrikes in the densely populated Gaza strip that the Palestinian Health Ministry says left hundreds dead and thousands more wounded. Israel's military says it is targeting headquarters belonging to Hamas and Islamic Jihad and released this video. Netanyahu vowing to avenge the hundreds of Israeli lives lost with more ferocious firepower to come. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAEL PRIME MINISTER (through translator): all the places which Hamas is deployed, hiding and operating it that we can see, we will turn it into an island of ruins I am telling Gaza's people to leave those places now, because we will take action everywhere. ABDELAZIZ (voice over): But destroying or severely deterring Hamas will prove extremely challenging for Israel's Army. A significant and unprecedented number of Israeli citizens were captured by the group according to the Israeli Military. This disturbing Social Media Video geolocated by CNN shows a victim, hands appear to be bound in captivity, and Hamas claims the hostages are distributed across the strip, Israel believes to be used as human shields. Israel's military is pressing on. With air assaults already underway, the IDF said it is preparing for a potential ground invasion, and that all options are on the table. Thousands of Israeli reservists have been called up for the task. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) ABDELAZIZ (voice over): Israel's Army is telling Gazans to clear the way for their operations, ordering families to leave their homes and providing locations for evacuation. But with the conflict sure to engulf the whole of the strip, for most, there is no way out. Gaza is largely isolated from the world by an Israeli air, land, and sea blockade and Egypt's southern border closure. Electricity which is mostly provided by Israel was cut off and internet disrupted, unclear how long services will be severed. And with Hamas leadership reportedly going underground, the two million people living in the 140 square mile territory have nowhere to turn. Fear is growing that an unprecedented attack on Israel could yield unprecedented bloodshed in Gaza. (END VIDEOTAPE) ABDELAZIZ (on camera): You can only imagine that with each one of those airstrikes, those air assaults being carried out by the Israeli military on Gaza right now, with each one of them, families of those hostages, Anderson, they could be holding their breath worried that they, their families, their loved ones could be caught in the crosshairs.

The families, the civilians, the children, those who are going to suffer, they have nowhere to turn because you have that Israeli blockade, of course, Egypt on the other side.
