Agency for Palestinian refugees says the Enclave is enduring a total communication blackout that is adding to the panic and anxiety.He says civilians are also without power, fuel, functioning hospitals and even water and the head of the World Food Program says people face the immediate risk of starvation as food systems collapse. But the Israeli government has refused to slow its incursion. The Minister for Economy and ministry and industry telling CNN Hamas must be wiped close off the face of the earth, adding Israel quoting again, didn't start the war, but we'll finish it in a way that in his words minimizes the harm to innocent women and children. This coming as Israel faces loud and increasing condemnation over its raid on Gaza's largest hospital. The Israel Defense Forces have insisted Hamas was hiding a command and control center, a tunnel network and possibly hostages at the Al-Shifa complex. And on Thursday, the IDF released this video that it claims shows one of those tunnels as well as some Hamas weapons. But the militant group accused Israel of giving false scenarios and quote, a failed attempt to escape future accountability. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has a closer look at what the Israeli military says it uncovered at the hospital. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Hamas tunnel below Gaza is largest hospital. That's what the Israeli military says this video shows. Nearly 48 hours after Israeli forces raided Al-Shifa Hospital, these are the first images of what the Israeli military says is an operational tunnel shaft on the grounds of the hospital complex. CNN cannot independently verify those claims, but using this frame, CNN has geo located this video to the Al-Shifa complex, about 30 meters away from one of the hospitals main buildings. REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: It is here in chief hospital with Hamas operate some of its command and control cells. DIAMOND (voice-over): For weeks Israeli officials have laid the groundwork for an operation targeting Shifa Hospital, claiming Hamas operates a massive underground complex below it. And in recent days, the U.S. has also backed up those allegations. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: One thing has been established is that Hamas does have headquarters weapons material below this hospital. DIAMOND (voice-over): As Israeli Special Forces continue searching the hospital complex, they are also uncovering weapons and ammunition. LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: There is a an AK-47 There are cartridges ammo, there are grenades in here. DIAMOND (voice-over): Which the Israeli military calls concrete evidence that Hamas use Gaza's largest hospital to wage war. Near the hospital, Israeli officials also say they found the body of 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss, who was among those abducted on October seventh. Israel's decision to send troops into a hospital has drawn fierce criticism with UN's aid chief saying he is appalled by the raid. President Biden standing by Israel's actions.",

And in his keynote address, really one of the longest addresses we've heard from Xi Jinping during the summit was to point out that the China was open for business. Xi Jinping is really fighting against a very difficult economic situation. At this point, he has a struggling economy that the housing market is in crisis and unemployment in the country is at record highs. So that has really been one of the main focuses for Xi Jinping to try and encourage more investment into his country. Although with recent moves towards a more totalitarian crackdown on some foreign businesses within China, it certainly spooked many foreign investors. There was also from Xi Jinping a meeting with Japan's Prime Minister, Ksihida -- Fumio Kishida on Thursday, the two have had their differences, historical issues between the two countries certainly. And from the Japanese side, we heard that that the Prime Minister had expressed serious concerns about increasing military activities near Japan, and also pointing out that they wanted to ensure a free and fair Taiwan Strait and to make sure that the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait is kept viable, saying that many in the region, follow that idea and share those ideals.

And with no end in sight to the devastation, it's hard to grasp what it will take to rebuild.A report from the U.N. Development Program says nearly half of the homes in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged, and an estimated 1.5 million people are now displaced from their homes. The majority of Gaza's hospitals and clinics have been forced to shut down, and it is believed nearly 400,000 people have lost their jobs since the war began in an area where unemployment was around 46 percent before this conflict. All right, I want to bring in Richard Kozul-Wright from Geneva. He's the director of Globalization and Development Strategies at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. It's good to see you, sir. The human cost in Gaza is astounding, but when it comes to the non- human damage, the massive amount of damage, how big of a job is rebuilding Gaza going to be? RICHARD KOZUL-WRIGHT, DIRECTOR, GLOBALIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES, U.N. CONFERENCE ON TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT: Thanks Michael. Yes, a very big job. You can't put a price on the lives lost. But you can try and at least estimate the damage to commercial and residential real estate to infrastructure, to capital equipment. You can look at the lost output that you talked about from people losing their jobs. You can put a price on the cost of the recovery. When we look at the cost after the 2014 invasion, which was far less intense than the ones today, we estimated that the cost then was around $4 billion. Others put the figure higher, but we put a $4 million estimate on that, on that earlier invasion.",

I mean is temporary housing for some of these people even feasible, let alone rebuilding their homes? KOZUL-WRIGHT: I mean, you have immediate humanitarian cost of just dealing with that situation. The recovery cost, of course, there is an order of magnitude much greater -- I mean the recovery. And the Gazan economy never really recovered from the 2014 invasion.",

I mean we're still in the fighting and it's unclear what the political outcome from this will be. And it involves multiple actors. The international community will have to play a critical role. The Gazan economy can't generate the resources to deal with the problem, nor can the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah. So the international community has to play a critical role.

I've been going there since 1988, and the reality of it is looking a little forlorn.I mean before this conflict, as you know, life was dire for Gazans. And you touched on that. 80 percent relied on aid of some sort. 65 percent of households, food insecure. 46 percent unemployment, one of the highest rates in the world. Given how bad life was before, how much worse is it going to be as this -- once the war is over, once the process begins to rebuild? KOZUL-WRIGHT: I think, you know, as we said, the previous military incursions into Gaza were not on the same scale, as we've seen this time around. So the damage and the difficulties in terms of lost employment, lost opportunities for unemployment, et cetera, are far greater. So it's on a different scale, I think. It's the real challenge that the international community will have to face, once the fighting stops and there's some kind of agreement on the political way forward. I mean one thing that we've emphasized, Michael, that I think is worth thinking about, of course, is the financial opportunity that comes from the discovery of oil and gas off the Israeli coast, including off Gaza. That is a potential source of revenue that I think we will have to explore as at least a possibility of beginning to fund the kind of massive recovery and rebuilding exercise that we're talking about.",

Research shows that loneliness is linked to poor mental and physical health. Joining me now is Dr. Karen DeSalvo. Dr. DeSalvo is a commissioner for the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Connections. She's also the chief health officer at Google, the day job, if you like. Dr. DeSalvo, thanks so much. Why is loneliness as the WHO says, a quote, \"pressing health threat\"? One study compared it to smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day in a health sense. What are the biggest impacts? DR. KAREN DESALVO, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: Michael, I'm glad that you're raising up this issue because some people think that loneliness is just a feeling. But actually, it has health risks. And it's kind of smoking about half a pack of cigarettes a day, and it's a risk factor for things like heart disease or memory loss, and in fact, people who are lonely have an increased risk of death. So it's important to understand that there's also physical health risks and it's one of the reasons this commission is going to help bring it into the light so that we can talk about what are the causes and what are the things that we can do to help people around the world.",

I'm an internal medicine physician.And I would see them in the clinic or in the hospital and they come in with their medical conditions. I would provide the right care for them and then discharge them home. It wasn't until I was a little further in my career and started doing things like home visits or experienced a situation in something like Hurricane Katrina when we didn't have hospitals and clinics. And we had to go visit people in communities. It became really clear to me that my understanding of the kind of social connection, the kind of relationships, the kind of support that they had at home may be quite different than what my impression might have been when they're in the clinic. So for me as a doctor, I pretty early on, began to understand that great medical care matters, but it's only a portion of the great health outcomes that you want for your patients. You have to care for people in context. You have to understand what the social determinants of health are that are affecting their health, including things like social connectedness and the relationships that they may have and the onset of things like loneliness. So I saw it all the time in my patients, and it was important for me to know that, so I can think of that as part of their care plan. So in addition to the medications, right, one of the ways that I also need to make sure they're connected to the community or have some social connection to help them in their every day.",

That there are actions that can be taken.Sometimes Michael, it can be an individual. It's the thing that we can do for our neighbors, for our family, for ourselves to maintain or develop relationships. Sometimes, it's interventions that the health care system can take to build extensions of the care plan to have individuals going into the home and supporting people outside of that clinical environment. And sometimes, it's a community action. There are places like Singapore that have developed community-oriented services that are part of the neighborhood watch to see that no one's left behind. So it's going to take a series of actions at different levels of society. But at the end of the day, it's what we're all going to do together to not only address loneliness, but to create the conditions in which everybody can be healthy.

It was that that they were appealing. And that is now on hold for now that Trump is able to speak freely in this case.
