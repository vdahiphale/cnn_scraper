Today marking the first of six days of tributes and observances across the nation. The public will have an opportunity to pay their respects in Atlanta before Carter's casket is taken to Washington on Tuesday as the world honors the life and legacy of America's 39th president. We're joined now by Jeff Zeleny CNN's chief national affairs correspondent. Jeff, I know you've been there at the Carter Center in Atlanta all day. Help set the scene from today's somber and emotional tributes to President Carter. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Well, Jessica through scripture and song there was a very somber tribute the beginning of what is going to be several days of paying respects and honor to the 39th president the United States, Jimmy Carter whose body is lying in repose right now. You can see that picture here at the Carter Center. At 7:00 p.m. tonight, it will open to the public. So, people for the next 36 hours or so can gather here and pay their tributes to Jimmy Carter. But this was a long day really sort of tracing the improbable and remarkable journey of Jimmy Carter from Plains about two and a half hours Southwest of Atlanta all the way through really the arc of his life. He -- his motorcade passed by the State Capitol. Of course, he served as a state senator. He ran for governor once he lost, he ran again. He won, of course served one term and then of course was elected improbably as the nation's 39th president. But today was not a day about talking about his time in the White House that will come next week. It was about really the work here at the Carter Center in his post-presidency. People were gathered really from around the world who have done the work of democracy, humanitarian work, clean water, really restoring hope for so many. So that is what today was about the mission that Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter had. So, as you can see there, those are live pictures people paying their respects here for the next some 40 hours or so before he will move on to Washington for a state funeral Wednesday at the Washington National Cathedral.

And as you note going to focus on the different parts of his life.ZELENY (on-camera): In so many different chapters of his life, I mean, of course he really, you know was a son of Georgia, a son of Plains, Georgia was in a naval a graduate, went to the Annapolis Naval Academy, was a submarine engineer, but then came back to Georgia. And this is really where he began his work on a peanut farm. So, it was an improbable a journey that history will never likely see the likes of again from a peanut farm indeed to the presidency. And the Carter Center and the library behind me here really tracks all of that, but we are seeing it in living of a memoriam today play out. And what I mean, it was a motorcade going from, you know, spanning a couple hundred miles. And his son Chip Carter said on every overpass, there were people there were Georgians turning out today to pay their respects and we do expect that to continue throughout the evening into tomorrow as -- as people from all walks of life pay their respects to former president Jimmy Carter.

Elisa Raffa, thank you so much for walking us through that.Meantime, officials have now confirmed the identity of the driver who caused a Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas as active-duty Army Green Beret, Matthew Alan Livelsberger. They say he drove the truck to the Trump Hotel, where he parked outside and shot himself before explosives he had set in the vehicle detonated. Investigators are now revealing some insight into his possible motive. And CNN national correspondent Natasha Chen is joining us more. Natasha, what are investigators learning about a possible motive here? NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Well, Jessica, they've been going through his devices, and late yesterday, they sent us full transcripts of two letters they believe were written by Livelsberger. One of them was actually calling to action for removing Democrats from the federal government, from the military, and including the possibility of occupying roads and federal buildings, not ruling out the use of force. That was one of two letters that were shared with the media. Another one talked about political grievances, issues that he found with society, with American culture, stated his support for President Trump and Elon Musk. I'm going to read you a few excerpts that investigators actually read to the media during a press briefing in hopes that it would provide some context for his state of mind. Here's one excerpt that says, time to wake up, we are being led by weak and feckless leadership who only serve to enrich themselves. Another excerpt says, why did I personally do it now? I needed to cleanse my mind of the brothers I've lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took. And another excerpt, we are the United States of America, the best country people to ever exist, but right now we are terminally ill and headed toward collapse. The day before the explosion, he had sent an e-mail to some online media outlets saying that he was armed and in possession of a vehicle- borne improvised explosive device. He had been diagnosed last year with depression. U.S. officials told CNN that he had visited a behavioral health program in the military multiple times in recent months, but was never flagged for being a risk to harm himself or other people. So, we're still trying to figure out exactly what kinds of conversations he had with people prior to this explosion. And investigators are looking at a log as well on his phone of activity in the 10 days leading up to it, Jessica. [17:10:30]",

The FBI also says the killer intended to use a transmitter found in his truck to set off two improvised explosive devices that he had previously placed on Bourbon Street. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Billy Nungesser accused New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell of failing to secure Bourbon Street, despite requests made years ago.

That's going to hurt the job market, our taxable income. We have a spending problem. We've had this spending problem for a very long time. Reagan talked about it. Years and years ago, 40 years ago, he was talking about this. It's only accelerated since 2004. That's when Republicans were in control. That's when George W. Bush ran and we saw this massive acceleration in Spain. So, I'm not saying it's a partisan, but it is a bipartisan problem that we have to address. We have a spending problem. We need to make sure we address the waste, fraud and abuse of government, the size and scope of government, the regulations that burden all of society, including businesses that provide our jobs, and the competitive market that's going to help everybody going forward.",

You look at the last year, though, it's just 11 percent. This has been one of the biggest changes in society. You know, you look back at these old wedding photos -- I was looking at wedding photos, my Uncle Neal, my Aunt Leigh back in the early 60s, like half the people in the wedding were smoking a cigarette. Now, if you took a picture from a wedding, outside of a few, I really don't think you'd see many folks who would be lighting up. I don't think any of my friends actually smoke cigarettes at all.",

You look at 2020 for the summer, look at that, $740 million of sales. If people are smoking less and drinking less booze, they're going to non-alcoholic beverages a lot more.
