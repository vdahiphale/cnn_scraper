In fact, we have a statement from Mohammad Abdulsalam, who's a Houthi spokesman, who said that \"The continuation of the American British aggression against our country will not achieve any goal for the aggressors but rather increase their issues and problems at the regional level. Yemen's decision to support Gaza is firm and principled and will not be affected by any attack.\"It's important to keep in mind that the Houthis have decades of experience fighting militarily superior foes. And I was reading in \"The New York Times\" this morning a quote from an analyst who said that taking on the Houthis is like fighting against the fog. Now, as far as Iran is concerned, we've heard from Nasser Kanaani, who's a spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry, at their daily press conference they described the U.S. strikes as a clear violation of the United Nations Charter and an attempt by the United States to divert attention away from the central crisis in the region, which he said is Gaza.
