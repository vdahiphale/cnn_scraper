Prosecutors are claiming that Trump and two Mar-a- Lago employees tried to destroy this video after the grand jury investigating Trump's handling of classified documents said that they wanted it and they wanted to review it as part of that case.The third charge deals with another count of willful retention of national defense information. You'll remember in the first indictment, Trump faced 31 counts. And now this brings the total to 32 counts. And the document in question here relates to one that was referenced during an audio recording that CNN previously reported. It was in 2021, Trump was in Bedminster along with several individuals in his office. Take a listen to what he said at that time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And they described him as hardworking, as somebody who rose through the ranks at Mar-a-Lago to reach that -- went from a valet all the way to property management. But now prosecutors are alleging that he was an active participant in what they essentially describe as a cover-up in Trump's attempt to destroy these surveillance videos, or alleged attempt to destroy these surveillance videos.

      "sentences": "I think it's not going to change his legal defense or posturing, but from a standpoint of the strength of the prosecution's case, this does help it a lot. First of all, it adds a substantiative count about retaining that document, the attack plan document. But the obstruction part is particularly helpful for the government because jurors like to hear what the state of mind might be for the defendant, and they rarely hear from the defendant talking about it. So here when they hear he was telling people to delete or destroy the evidence, common sense will tell them that you only try to get rid of evidence that's bad for you, not evidence that tends to exculpate your or is helpful to you. So that really adds to the consciousness of guilt aspect, which is a very powerful tool for the jury.In addition to that, on that substantiative count, for me looking at it, the really great thing about it for the prosecution is that audio tape we heard that was recorded in Bedminster, jurors love audio tapes. And before they charged this new count about that document, there could have been a fight about whether that tape could come into evidence or not. But prosecutors call this charging the bad conduct, so there could have been an argument it was just bad conduct, they just slimed him up and it shouldn't come in, your honor. Now that they have charged it, it's pretty much a no-brainer for it to come in. I think even Judge Aileen Cannon might have a hard time keeping that evidence out. WALKER: So evidence-wise, this will be helpful to prosecutors, but you also say that with the new allegations, the new charges that it's a no brainer, your words, that this trial will be delayed well into the election. Why do you say that?",

But it legitimately took a while, maybe it was deliberate delay on the part of the Trump team, but it will take a while. Then there's going to be an argument over whether that lawyer needs to get security clearance. They will a argue he does. The prosecution might say he doesn't. That takes time. If he does have to get clearance, that takes time. So every day of potential delay is helpful to the Trump team. And there are legitimate reason for delay here. Because of the classified information issue, that could really be complicated in terms of how you handle that and what comes into evidence. So I think it's quite easy to delay this case.",

Now, part of the problem for him there of course, is that it's not just the retention. It's also the sharing of it. And on the tape, if they can match those together, he sounds like he's sharing that information. So he has still got a problem there.The real defense that I see for them primarily is just this notion that he really thought he could handle this stuff. He really mistakenly, perhaps, believed that it was his. That's the only kind of defense I see them mounting in court. The real defense strategy going on, of course, is his campaign. For him at this point, his legal defense and political strategy are one in the same right now as well as is the financing for his criminal defense. It's really greatly enhanced but his campaign fundraising efforts right now. That puts him in a very unusual situation. Most defendants don't have the benefits of that, and they don't have this unique conglomeration of legal and political. So it's a very unusual case.",

And I think you can expect him to rail against these newest charges during his rally later today. And I will add that Donald Trump is very frustrated by this. He was very caught off guard when they learned of these additional charges on Thursday. And since then, he's been railing against them in public interviews. We heard him give an interview with \"Breitbart News\" Thursday even. Shortly after learning of these charges.And he used the same playbook that he's used time and time again when talking about his mounting legal Trump troubles. He railed against the special counsel Jack Smith directly. He called these charges election interference. But he also pointed to how politically they are giving him a boost in the polls. And so I think that's part of why you're going to see him talk about that later today at his rally, because he knows that these charges, his base rallies around them. They get fired up and energized by this even though personally, behind closed doors, Donald Trump is very frustrated and concerned about it. Now, Donald Trump was also in Iowa last night at the Lincoln Dinner standing alongside many of his other 2024 Republican rivals. And it was interesting. He did not talk about the newest charges during that appearance. And most of his campaign rivals and 2024 did not either. But one did, Will Hurd. He is the Republican who has directly been attacking Donald Trump on the trail. And he did bring it up last night. We have some sound. Let's listen to what they had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILL HURD (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If we elect Donald Trump, we are willingly giving Joe Biden four more years in the White House. And America can't handle that. ASA HUTCHINSON (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Iowa has an opportunity to say we as a party, we need a new direction for America and for the GOP. MIKE PENCE (R), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We must resist the politics of personality and the siren song of populism unmoored to conservative values, because different times calls for different leadership.

But Will Hurd, as you heard, is not following that same lead. He is leaning in directly and attacking Donald Trump.

Also as well is a recent surge in gas prices, something that a White House official told CNN that the White House is watching very, very closely.But I think one really precise way to sum up this moment that the White House is in was actually given to us by Congressman Steny Hoyer, a Democrat in Maryland.

Eventually that cold front is going to slide down through the Ohio Valley and into the southeast cooling us down, too.But for now, Atlanta, 95, same for us in D.C., 95 degrees. And when we factor in the dew points, Athena was talking about the humidity, when we get 70 plus, that measurement of moisture near the surface, the dew point factored in with 95 degrees, D.C., it feels like 103.

And while at least one of Trump's rivals took direct aim at him, others mostly ignored the new superseding indictment. Joining us now is Geoff Duncan, CNN political commentator, former lieutenant governor of Georgia. Geoff, good to see you. I want to start with former congressman, current candidate for the GOP nomination, Will Hurd and the framework he placed around the Trump candidacy for president that garnered some boos. Let's play it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILL HURD (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump is not running for president to make America great again. Donald Trump is not running for president to represent the people that voted for him in 2016 and 2020. Donald Trump is running to stay out of prison. And if we elect -- (BOOS)",

He's confused Republicans all over the country to think chaos, loud, angry voices is actually conservatism. And it's not. And these legal perils give him the fodder to walk through his daily talking points to make it look like he's being mistreated and misaligned and all these accusations. But what Hurd is saying is, quite honestly, true. He's literally probably fighting for his freedom at this point, in his mind.",

The candidates, in my upon opinion, the early candidates like Ron DeSantis and others try to be Donald Trump light. That was a mistake. Our party has the opportunity to really step up. Statistically speaking, we have the best opportunity to win the White House maybe ever in our party's history because of how poorly Joe Biden is polling right now. But we're missing the opportunity. We continue to talk about the wrong things.And I think Americans are going to wake up and start to really be concerned about the economy. They're going to be worried about the border and the negative effects. They're going to be worried about international chaos. These are real situations where I think is we need once in a generation leader to step up to almost take the charge for a GOP 2.0 that I often talked about, where we lead with our policies. We use empathy not to pick on the other side, but to understand the other side, and use a tone that encourages. I call it my pet project.",

But we need somebody that has got the whole package, and hopefully one of those are able to step up. They should be unanimous in rebuking anything Donald Trump has to do and say. He's hijacked our Republican Party. And this may be funny to say, but I was making this analogy last night. Nominating Donald Trump for the Republican Party is a lot like peeing in your pants. It's going to feel good for a couple seconds, but then you wake up and realize the realities of what you just did. We're going to get beat in the general because we picked the wrong candidate.

So shade is really effective because it protects the body from the main factor that determines how hot a person is feeling, and that's the sun's shortwave radiation. So it's an essential preventive measure for heat risk, and it's not really an emergency planning one. So we all know that cities are cooler when we have shade, but we're not really planning for it. So in the future, that's something that cities are going to need to do is intentionally think about what does shade infrastructure look like. And without doing that, we get what we have today, which is most of the city is in what we would call a shade desert. So that means that people don't have enough shade to keep them safe where they live, work, and play.",

But one thing to keep in mind is that heat governance is really in its infancy. And there's a lot of work to do. So the other day when President Biden announced this suite of heat measures that the federal government is trying to take, those are just a start of the conversation. And we need to keep having the conversation. So there's a lot of great legislation at the federal level right now that could help communities better prepare and coordinate. For instance, right now, the Extreme Heat Emergency Act, which would allow heat to be included as a national, be declared as a disaster, but also things like the Living Schoolyards Act, which would enable communities and support communities in efforts to bring schoolyards to keep children safe when it's hot at school.",
