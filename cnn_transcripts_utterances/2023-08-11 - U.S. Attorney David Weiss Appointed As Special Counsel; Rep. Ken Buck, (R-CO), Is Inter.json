So he was someone that the Biden administration decided to keep on because he was already independent, not someone that Biden had put into place. Now with the special counsel powers, it means that Weiss will have additional resources, he'll have a budget so he could bring in additional staff if he wants. It will also remove him from the day to day oversight of the Justice Department. But otherwise, he will be able to continue to investigate this as they've been.He will also be allowed to look into charging any potential crimes and other jurisdictions, so he doesn't have to stick in Delaware where this case is kind of gummed up before this one judge. He could pursue charges in other jurisdictions. So that really gives him some of these additional authorities and he will write a report that's required, and Garland today saying that that's something he will make public.",

And today, in that press conference or a statement, Garland had said that the investigation had reached a stage where special counsel status was necessary. He did not elaborate on what that means. And we have not gotten any response on that so far.But you know, also, in the court filings, the prosecutors told a judge today that today was the deadline for Biden's team to get back to them. So it's unclear how Tuesday fits with this deadline today. The judge is giving Biden's team until Monday to weigh in on this.

Bush, Tom Dupree and here with me in studio, CNN Political Correspondent Sara Murray. Tom, let me start with you. So, Special Counsel Weiss, as a U.S. attorney, he worked on this plea deal that blew up last month, the same plea deal that a Delaware judge said she was not ready to approve because it was, quote, \"confusing, not straightforward, atypical, unprecedented,\" why would the Justice Department appoint someone to be special counsel who wasn't able to get this case wrapped up the first time? TOM DUPREE, PARTNER, GIBSON, DUNN &amp; CRUTCHER: Well, that's a great question. And the special counsel regulations actually contemplate that when you appoint a special counsel, you will choose someone who is outside the Justice Department, that way you can ensure that they're untainted, they are truly independent, and they come in with a fresh perspective. That didn't happen here. Look, I suspect what's going on is Merrick Garland was approached by Mr. Weiss, who said, look, this case is actually going to go to trial now. I may have to file charges in jurisdictions other than Delaware. I thought this investigation may have been reaching closure, it's not, there's still several chapters to be written. And because I've got to do these additional things I didn't contemplate doing, I want more authority. That's my guess as to how this all unfolded, Jake, but it is a great question as to why he wasn't made a special counsel years and years and years ago.",

I mean, in the order, appointing David Weiss, it notes that this was an investigation into Hunter Biden, among others. And then it goes on to say that now a special counsel, David Weiss, can investigate these ongoing investigations as well as any other matters that have arisen or may arise.And so, I do think that there's a great question here about what is this mean? Does this mean that we have a lot of investigative steps ahead of us that there is more that David Weiss wants to look into? Or is this just a question of, OK, look, if we're going to trial, I want to be able to do this in D.C. or I want to be able to do it in California, and I want to be able to do it as a special counsel without having to partner with a bunch of U.S. attorneys.",

He didn't have that authority as U.S. Attorney for Delaware, that's why he needed the special counsel designation. And that, according to the whistleblowers, is why the guy has been chasing behind the scenes for years saying I want to bring these prosecutions in other states, but I can't because Merrick Garland hasn't made me a special counsel.

You know, I spoke with one Republican today who argued that despite the fact they may not be ready to vote for impeachment, they have no concerns about opening an impeachment inquiry. And that is an important distinction that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has been trying to make that they are talking about opening an inquiry, but that they are not talking about a formal vote yet on impeachment.

Let's talk about this with Minnesota Democratic Congressman Dean Phillips. Congressman Phillips, good to see you. You have recently been talking publicly about considering challenging President Biden in the Democratic primaries. Do today's developments, special counsel investigating Hunter Biden, does that make that more or less likely? REP. DEAN PHILLIPS (D-MN): Well, Jake, let me start by changing the conversation from me. It's not about me, this is about a message in a wakeup call that I am trying my darndest to deliver to Democrats 55 percent of whom, before today's news, wanted an alternative to the three candidates in the primary right now. And I've said that from the very beginning, I've had concerns. The numbers are horrific, the polling numbers, 55 percent of Democrats wanting an alternative, Independents about 73 percent want an alternative. And let me just assume that 100 percent of moderate Republican never Trumpers, are saying we want an alternative, we will not vote for the sitting president. And I want to share with everybody, I love Joe Biden, I think he's a man of decency, of competency. His record, extraordinary. I voted for it, I felt marketed and distributed, I think the world of him. But I also believe my job is not duty bound to the president, to my party, but to the Constitution and country. And right now, I have grave concerns, based on the fact that 55 percent of Democrats are saying we want alternatives. I am scared. I'm trying to raise that bell be the clarion call, if you will. And I've said from the get go as well, I am not best positioned to do this. There are ample well-prepared, competent, people of great character ready to go. And I think if the President would consider passing that torch now, just imagine, Jake, the energy behind the next generation on the Democratic primary stage, perhaps a woman at the top of the ticket in a year in which reproductive rights are going to be front and center other than the former president being under indictment, and now the son of the president we have right now being subjected to a special counsel. It's a sad day for America, I want to start with that. I do not think the President is corrupt, I want to make that really clear. But we are duty bound to investigate to ensure the facts come out. And the fact is, we don't know where this goes. And I think it's too much risk for Democrats to take this chance without a backup plan because what we have right now in reserve is awfully consequential and, frankly, frightening.",

But we all know what kind of an era we live in. It's not what's real, it's how people feel. And these numbers I shared earlier that are so horrendous and frightening were before the news of today.And if anybody believes this doesn't hurt, you must be living in a different world than I am. And I'm simply calling attention to the facts. And I'm concerned about the Democratic establishment working much too hard to prevent any new entrants, to prevent competition, instead, pursuing a coronation. And frankly, we did something similar in 2008. And thank goodness, a first term senator from the state of Illinois, raised his hand, stood up, met the moment and we had Barack Obama become United States president. I just think that we should be mindful of history, recognize the consequences of not having a backup plan, Jake, because one of the core elements of successful leadership is a succession plan, being sure that there's somebody able ready to go. And I'd like to see the President actually invite people to the primary stage. And again, not me, you know, I'm a third term congressman from Minnesota, I think I'm able and prepared for the job. But I'm a third term Congressman. I have 60,000 Twitter followers and $250,000 in my campaign account.

Yesterday the court blocked a settlement that would have protected the family behind Purdue Pharma from any opioid related civil claims. Until recently Purdue Pharma which manufactured OxyContin was controlled by the Sackler family. The Sacklers withdrew billions of dollars from the company before it filed for bankruptcy. The family had agreed to contribute up to $6 billion to produce reorganization fund on one condition that the Sacklers received a release from civil liability.But the Supreme Court order means the settlement payments to victims are now paused. And the court will take up the case and hear oral arguments in December. Timing, of course, is everything because it just so happens that basically hours ago, Netflix premiered a new six episode series called painkiller which takes a semi-fictionalized look at the opioid crisis and how Purdue Pharma cashed in on OxyContin at the expense of those who became hooked on the drug.

Are you hearing anything from them about the Supreme Court, putting the settlement on pause?PETER BERG, DIRECTOR, \"PAINKILLER\": Well, you know, Jake, first of all, hello, Jake, thank you for having me. I've been talking mainly to a very knowledgeable individual named Barry Meyer, who wrote the book painkiller that our show is used, intensive as source material. And you know, it's interesting, it's basically -- it really comes down to the Sacklers, who have always been very, very good with lawyers, and very, very good at sort of hiding the nest egg of money and making little payments that sound kind of big when you read about them. But that really are just basically interest payments on their fortune. Finally, the Supreme Court has stepped in and said, well, hold up. You the net -- the nest egg is in play. And you thought you were going to be able to sort of make one lump payment, not even a lump payment, but a $6 billion payment over the next two decades. And protect your nest egg. Not so fast. It's surprising that it happened that day our show came out. But I think it's the right thing to do.",

And the Sacklers felt like we're sort of letting them off the hook.So I thought it might be interesting if we could find parents whose children had actually died from opioids and OxyContin specifically, to read the disclaimer, and then basically say, OK, what isn't fiction, what is real, is it my 23-year-old daughter died of an oxycontin overdose. And this is real. We thought that that would kind of set the tone for what we were trying to do with the show. And what was particularly alarming was that we set out a call and just the L.A. area, just this southern and central L.A. area, to see if there were any parents who had lost children who would be willing to talk. And within one day, but 10 hours, we had 80 families, 80 from just this one little area of L.A., who all wanted to come forward and tell their stories.",
