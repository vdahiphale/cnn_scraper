You know, you think about some of these excessive use of force situations that we've seen in the past, there's usually one primary actor and then others who maybe participate to a lesser degree and some who do nothing, in this case, all facing the same charges, that the D.A. must have seen a commonality between their culpability and their actions towards Mr. Nichols.",

A charge as a kidnapping makes you believe that these officers participated in an arrest that did not have any probable cause.And something that jumps out at me, Wolf, is the quickness whereby this district attorney made these charges. The only time comparable I've seen in a case of this magnitude was Walter Scott in Charleston, South Carolina where we saw that on tape and it helped tape -- tamp down some of the violence and uprising you may see in respective communities. That was the only time I've seen anything happen as quickly as this in terms of charging the officers.

And my response is simply this, for many of us, we haven't been critical of necessarily the race of the officer, whether or not they're white, black, Hispanic, or otherwise, but it's the system. And what you're seeing again and again and over and over is a system that perpetuates violence against people of color. And until we do something about this system, whether or not in this particular case, it looks like we need to have a conversation about the Jump Out Boys, I think that's what some of us call them. In Atlanta, they were called the Red Dogs. But it's this group of kind of unmarked officers who go out in these communities, these gang task force, and you see incidents like this happen and occur. And so, regardless of the color of the officer, Wolf, I want people to know that it's a system that we want to have a full, thorough conversation about and how to reform that system so that interactions between officers and people of color are safer for both parties.",

And in 2021, with 346 murders in a city that size, they broke their own record.So they knew something needed to be done about crime and about guns, they formed the Scorpion unit. It was a handpicked unit officers that had a record of being able to make arrests, work in high crime areas, get guns off the street, and they got off to a raucous start with 338 arrests in their first three weeks. Think about that. That's a high level of activity, 90 -- 195 of those were felony arrests, 95 weapons were seized. So they were out there getting the job done. What this incident raised is what Bakari had raised about the nature of these units, which require great experience among the officers. And yet none of these officers had more than six years on the job. Some of them only had three years on the job. Very tight supervision, a supervisor with every squad. You've got 50 officers in the squad, four teams, but there's no indication of a sergeant being on the scene for any of the event that led to these arrests. So, it came with a lot of the ideas about a crime reduction team without some of the safeguards.

Law enforcement cannot, should not, in this country, take any action to suppress people's peaceful express first amendment right. So they're in a tough spot here.

They see that the decision to do a special counsel is not exactly clear, it's not exactly the same issue. And part of it is because Mike Pence is not a declared candidate for President. Obviously, a lot of people think that Mike Pence is going to run for President, but he has not yet declared that. And for the Justice Department, they viewed the appointment of special counsels in the Trump case and the Biden case as a matter of an appearance of conflict of interest for Merrick Garland, the Attorney General and the Department. In the case of Trump, obviously, he's declared that he is running for President against Merrick Garland's boss. And of course, the fact that Joe Biden appointed Merrick Garland to this job meant that there was disappearance of conflict and that's the reason why they felt that it was necessary to appoint special counsels. Now, in the case of Pence, so far as what we know is, you know, these limited number of documents that have been turned over to the Justice Department, this is being handled by the National Security Division and by the FBI and they'll determine whether -- this will determine whether what next steps they'll take.",

Garland is always asserting his confidence in the department's ability to be independent, and I completely agree with that.I think it's important to notice here that we're not at the stage of an indictment or even much a public predicate for criminal charge here. It's really more in the line of a preliminary investigation, trying to understand what documents there are, how they got there. And at this stage, I don't think you normally would need to have a special counsel. You don't have that type of issue going on. But Garland really has painted himself into a corner by using this candidacy declaration as the trigger. And if that's the case, to be consistent, he'll have to appoint one.",

I think you have to treat like cases alike.And the Pence case is very similar to the Biden one. You have the low single digit number of documents that are found. You have all the indicators in both cases of inadvertence. Of course, strong contrast with Donald Trump's apparently intentional conduct here. So they'll be weighing and balancing. We may not get a fast answer. Remember, it took them from November to January for Chicago U.S. attorney Trump appointee Mr. Lausch to recommend a special counsel.

Yes, we were around that embattled city of Bakhmut, which right now is most probably the most dangerous place in all of Ukraine, and we saw some immensely dangerous and tough fighting going on there.The Ukrainians believe the Russians are trying to encircle that town right now. And certainly, we were on the ground, there was no let-up in the fighting at all. There were heavy weapons that could be heard and seen in use the entire time that were on the ground there. The Ukrainians say they don't want to allow that to happen. And what we saw, Wolf, was that they certainly do seem to be putting up some pretty stiff resistance to the Russians and really trying to hold ground as good as they can. You mentioned those missile barrages that took place today really throughout the entire country once again, and the Ukrainians say, by and large, they actually did quite well. They say of 55 missiles that were shot by the Russians. They were able to take down 47. However, in the ones that did hit, 11 people were killed, and a lot of other people were wounded and angry Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, he came out later and said, look, Ukraine needs more advanced air defense systems to try and take down even more of these Russian missiles. The Ukrainians, of course, want a lot of advanced weapons from the U.S. and its allies. And we did get an update, Wolf, on those Abrams main battle tanks. The U.S. now saying that it's the more advanced version of those tanks, the A1, A2 version that the Ukrainians are going to be getting. Also got an update from the Germans and the Brits as well, both those countries saying that the main battle tanks that they've pledged, the Leopard 2 and the Challenger 2 are probably going to arrive here in Ukraine by the end of March. So certainly, a lot more firepower coming from the Ukrainian or for the Ukrainians then. Once again, the Russians talking about this, they've obviously been threatening to destroy these tanks before they even get on the battlefield. Spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, he came out and he said the Russians view all of this as direct involvement by the nations that are delivering these weapons in the conflict in Ukraine. Obviously, these countries say that is absolutely not the case, Wolf.",

W. Bush to see part of the largest ever American and Israeli joint military exercise covering all aspects of warfare from the air, on land, to the sea, online and even in space. The timing is no accident meant to send a clear signal to Iran and other adversaries in the region, that despite the attention on Ukraine and U.S. concerns over the new right wing Israeli government, the Americans remain deeply aligned and committed to a military partnership with Israel. (on-camera): For the Americans and the Israelis, these types of exercises are a show of force, a show of partnership, and a way for the both of them to show the world that they can walk and chew gum at the same time. GEN. MICHAEL \"ERIK\" KURILLA, COMMANDER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND: Only through a firm commitment to this partnership are we able to plan and organize such an incredibly complex, high-end operation, with so many elements across such a large geographic area against all aspects of war fighting, some of which are seen, some of which are not. GOLD (voice-over): For the Israelis, the exercise is crucial. They've long opposed a return to the Iranian nuclear deal and have argued that a credible military threat needs to be on the table to deter Iran from fully developing a nuclear weapon. LT. GEN. HERZI HALEVI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF: Israel and the US share the same values. The IDF and the U.S. CENTCOM see eye to eye the threats on this area. (on-camera): More than 6,400 American personnel joined 1,100 Israelis as part of this exercises that utilize more than 142 aircraft, including these FA teams. (voice-over): And while the Israelis and Americans regularly carry out joint exercises, this one shifted the focus more on the offensive rather than just defensive capabilities. It also came together in just two months, incredibly quickly, especially for something of this scale compared to the typical year or so of planning. While officials shy away from drawing a direct connection between the speed and recent events in Iran and the breakdown last year of negotiations over the nuclear deal, it is hard to ignore the context. COL. JOE BUCCINO, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND SPOKESMAN: I think it's fairly clear that we can very quickly move assets in the region to respond to crisis, and we can do so alongside our partners, and we can fight and conduct offensive operations in every domain alongside our partners. GOLD (voice-over): The military option, which President Biden called the last resort to deal with Iran, seems to be on loud display. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
