The suspension came hours after West tweeted an antisemitic picture, a picture of a Star of David altered with a swastika, and also after a hate-filled exchange with Infowars host Alex Jones. And while his words -- West's words are just as disgusting, and they are, it is important to hear Kanye West in his own words. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, it's hard to see how Kanye West can really sink any lower than this. Yesterday, he went, obviously, as he played effectively full Nazi on the conspiratorial channel, Infowars, and he actually managed really the impossible, which is to make Alex Jones look like the same one in the room. And then later that night, he decided to go on an antisemitic rant on Twitter posting an antisemitic tweet showing a Nazi swastika inside the Star of David, which resulted in the pro maximum free speech, Elon Musk, who now owns Twitter, booting him from the platform and saying that that crossed the line even for him. It's really a stunning fall from West who is once you know, considered to be a musical genius, and known for his music, and now he's known for these vile antisemitic rants and saying he loves Adolf Hitler. And it's also a stunning indictment for the Republican Party. You'll remember that last week he dined with former President Donald Trump. And people like Tucker Carlson who cleaned up his antisemitic remarks earlier when he did an interview with him, they vouched for him in the Republican Party, they hyped him up to the conservative base.It's also something -- you know, these rants from him come as we're seeing a sharp rise in hate speech on Twitter. And the ADL has said it's a troubling trend that really mimics the broader growth in antisemitism across the country. And, Kate, since we mentioned him, I should also say that Alex Jones, who now owes about $1.5 billion, that's the B, for his lies about Sandy Hook, a totally different topic, but via lies about Sandy Hook. He has now declared personal bankruptcy as of this morning, Kate.",

And instead of giving it a platform or political leaders -- our political leaders should be calling out and rejecting antisemitism wherever it hides.

Now, I think it's true. It's not a great idea to give additional oxygen to someone like Kanye West, to give to someone like Nick Fuentes, right? To some of the horrible people, we're seeing now flooding Twitter, by the way, coming back on the platform. But we keep -- we ignore this at our own peril.Like I think we need to understand, Kate, antisemitism isn't just a Jewish problem. It's an American problem. It's a sign of broader social decay, if you will, like termites, you know, eating the foundation of a house, antisemitism corrodes the foundation of our society. So, it endangers all of us.

Because when you violate the terms of service again and again, and again, when you spew like -- freedom of speech isn't the freedom to slander people, Kate, and freedom have to talk about your ideas isn't the freedom to threaten Jews or anyone else. That's not protected speech. So, yes, Kanye should have come down. I'm glad it happened.But ADL and the Center for countering digital hate have just been doing some research. We have found a surge of antisemitic activity on Twitter in recent weeks since the new management took over. And we found a decrease in the moderation of this kind of content. I can tell you, we report regularly problematic, hateful, antisemitic tweets, and we're not seeing them go down nearly at the rate that they were just a few months ago. Now, maybe that's because the resources are being applied, maybe because the people aren't there. I don't know. But what I do know is that all of us win, Kate, if Twitter is a safer space for all users. It should be a public square, not a firing squad where Jews or anyone else feels endangered.",

And you can see some lights of cars, perhaps people have been pulling up throughout the night just to try to get a glimpse of what is just a striking scene, the glow of the lava, of course, keeping several miles away.And to give you a better look at it, we'll step out of the way, we'll turn off the lights here, and that's what people have been doing out of respect, shutting off even their car lights and allowing others to just take it in. Some people with their families in the middle of the night taking photos, of course, but also just standing in silence and allowing the majesty of it all to seep in. Officials are concerned and they're keeping the urgency up and particularly warning of the lava flow and its potential impact on what is the main thoroughfare here. It's called saddle road. And it is considered an extremely important artery on this island, and one that could be cut off if the lava continues to flow another few miles in the direction that it's currently heading. The other big concern for officials is what you see coming out of this fissure right here. And that is not smoke, but acid gas. And so, they're warning people who might have respiratory issues that this could be a problem for them. As of now, though, they're saying that the threat remains low. They're still monitoring it. And they're warning that this is something that could change rather quickly. All of this, it's so unpredictable as they say. So, they're trying to keep on tabs with where it's going to go, what impact it could have. And they say the good thing is, as of now, the movement pace of the lava is so slow that if it were to impact, say the main thoroughfare, they'd have enough time to give people a heads-up at least a day or two at its current pacing. All in all, though, there's this balance between the urgency between the uncertainty, and the concern. And the beauty of it and the appreciation and the respect for what created more than half of this the Big Island and that is Mauna Loa. It is striking. David Culver, CNN, Hawaii. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
