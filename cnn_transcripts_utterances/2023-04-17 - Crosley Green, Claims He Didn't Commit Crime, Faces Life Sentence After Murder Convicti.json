That judge overturned that life sentence and essentially told the State of Florida, look, you can either retry Green or you've got to let him go.The state of Florida decided to appeal that decision to a federal court of appeals. And while that process played out, Green was allowed to go home. That federal court of appeals came back and said, look, Green has to finish out his life sentence, which is why he is going to turn himself in later today. That really only leaves the 65-year-old with two options at freedom, we're talking about going before a parole board here in the state of Florida or clemency. Now, we spent a part of Green's final weekend as a free man. Here's what he told us about his mindset going into today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, when it comes to clemency, that discretion is really up to Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis, as well as two of the three cabinet members and one of those cabinet members that would also have to sign off on clemency is Florida's attorney general. Guys.JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  All right. Carlos Suarez for us in Orlando. What a process. What a remarkable story, Carlos. Thank you very much. Kate. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Technical troubles are forcing SpaceX to call off today's much anticipated launch of the largest and most powerful rocket ever built. The Starship rocket was supposed to take off last hour but it -- for its first fully assembled test flight. But instead, it remains grounded on itself at south padre island launch pad. Let's get over to CNN's Ed Lavandera. He's back with us this hour from right near that launch site. Ed, what more have you picked up since we last spoke about what went wrong.",

There were thousands of people gathered here on the southern edge of South Padre Island, as you can see the rocket on -- still on the pad behind us. We're about five miles away.So, a little bit of a let down here as this happens just moments before the scheduled takeoff. SpaceX officials are saying that it will take at least 48 hours to schedule the next launch. So, we don't have information yet on when exactly it will be rescheduled. But those SpaceX officials will have to figure out this pressurization in -- issue within the rocket system before they can launch. But, you know, this is a vitally important rocket system for Elon Musk and for SpaceX. For those of you who haven't been following, this has a lot to do with -- this is the rocket system that it will eventually be part of the Artemis program ferrying NASA astronauts to and back from the moon. Also, carrying large amounts of cargo that will be needed to not only just go to the moon but also to propel space travel to Mars. That is the grand goal that is in play here. But right now, SpaceX officials dealing with this setback of having to scrub the launch this morning just moments before it was scheduled to take off. Kate.",

So, those charges, they had asked for a maximum of 25 years. The maximum is what they got.The lawyer for Vladimir Kara-Murza pointing out outside court that if they had been following the letter of the law, they couldn't have got the maximum because there are mitigating circumstances like the fact that he's the father of three children, all of them minors. Now, as for Vladimir Kara-Murza himself, he appeared fairly calm in court today. And by way of explanation for that, Kate, I want to read you part of his final statement to the court a week ago. He said, I stand by every word I have spoken and every accusation that has been leveled against me. And I only blame myself for one thing, that over the years of my political activities, I have not been able to convince enough of my fellow countrymen and politicians in democratic countries of the danger that the current regime in the Kremlin poses to Russia and the world. He has remained outspoken to the very end to this very sentencing -- his sentencing. Certainly. if you look at the reactions from around the world, emblematic of this real intense uptick in repression and the crackdown on dissent that we've seen in Russia, particularly since the start of the war in Ukraine.",

JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER:  Well, John, I can tell you sometimes after mass shooting events, mental health crisis lines tend to see an increase in calls or text messages related to gun violence. And one example of this is one study looked at the number of text messages sent to a crisis lifeline that involved mentions of gun violence the day after the Uvalde, Texas shooting. And in this study, the researchers said that they typically would forecast maybe a number of 77 text messages in that category. The day after Uvalde, they saw 159 text messages. So, there was an increase. And we also know that many Americans across the country experienced gun violence firsthand. The Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that nearly one in five adults say a family member was killed by a gun. That same survey also found that about one in six adults have witnessed someone being shot. So, we can only imagine, John, the mental health toll that that has had on those many people across the country, John.",

They may be avoiding crowded areas or public transit. Places where they typically would go.
