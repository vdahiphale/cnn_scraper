We're going to show you the exclusive video first here on The Lead.And leading this hour, one week after the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, New York police are revealing new details about the evidence that they have uncovered and how they say it traces back to the suspect now under arrest, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione. Let's bring in CNN's Brynn Gingras who is live for us from New York.

There's a lot of people that are using this channel and this event to really express grievance. Grievance about the system, grievance about the way they've been treated in the system. And that grievance is born from the fact that each of us puts 15,000 bucks a year into the system. We spend $5 trillion on system collectively and people go bankrupt. They're met with wrong doors, they're met with indecision. People are angry, they're fed up with the system. And they're alone. People feel alone in this.

And political violence happens in moments when people lose faith in institutions.

      "sentences": "OK, Lauren Fox, thanks so much.Sticking with the criminal justice system also in our politics lead, while the final days of a presidency are typically reserved for political pardons, President Biden's pardon of his son Hunter ignited a debate over what the President is exactly doing with his pardon power. As of now, Biden has granted fewer pardons than Trump or Obama. Many civil rights activists and faith leaders, and now even those within his own party, feel Biden has fallen way short on his 2020 campaign promise to reform the criminal justice system. And they urge the President to use his clemency power during these final days in office. Sources tell me that a group of Democratic House Senate and House -- Democratic House and Senate members are pushing the President to step away from only looking to pardon people he knows or people he's related to. Some of those members include Senator Dick Durbin, Senator Cory Booker, Senator Raphael Warnock, Congressman Jim Clyburn, and Congressman Steven Horsford, who's chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. They're asking Biden to consider granting clemency to those who received stacked sentences before the First Step Act went into effect during the Trump administration. The First Step Act eliminated the practice of stacking sentences to give the harshest penalties possible if somebody has a firearm. One example of someone who fell into stack sentences is Weldon Angelos. He was sentenced to 55 years in prison for three small marijuana sales as a first time nonviolent offender. Fifty-five years because he possessed a gun, so his sentences were stacked. Weldon Angelos is out of prison now. He was pardoned by Trump. Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah was the one who brought a lot of attention to Mr. Angelos and the practice of stacking. Another category of individuals Democratic lawmakers want -- considered pardoned are those who are serving out the remainder of their sentences in home confinement under the CARES Act. The CARES Act moved low in minimum security, low risk reoffenders to home confinement during COVID to finish their sentences. And finally, lawmakers are urging Biden to grant clemency to those who would have benefited from the passage of the Equal Act that would eliminate the sentencing disparities for crack cocaine and powder cocaine. Those sentences have for a long time been viewed as entirely discriminatory because the sentences for crack cocaine possession were 18 times longer than those for powder cocaine and disproportionately harmed black and brown communities. Now, the Justice Department changed its charging policy in 2022, but those convicted before that change continue to serve longer sentences. There is also a push to take all 40 individuals off of federal death row, giving them instead life in prison. So far a number of Democrats involved in this process feel, however, that the White House is not listening to any of these requests. Deaf ears. The White House says Biden will have more to announce on pardons and commutations before he leaves office. But these Democratic lawmakers, as I understand it, are rather frustrated, as are some individuals at the Justice Department, Mr. Biden's own Justice Department. And just imagine, by the way, if the President had announced he was pardoning all of these people and also Hunter. Something to think about. Let's jump in with our panel. Maria Cardona, so you aggressively nodding during that entire tell. I assume you agree that some clemency, some mercy, some forgiveness from the President for some of these nonviolent offenders is in order.",

Kennedy, Jr. The controversial pick ofPresident-elect Trump to head the Department of Health and Human Services, is using his influence to push a different agenda, placing his daughter in law for a top job at the CIA.

Yesterday we asked for your questions on the bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle and how it could affect the U.S. milk supply. So let's get some answers and let's bring back Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, let's start with a question from Vinod in Houston, Texas. Who asks, is there a vaccine for bird flu?DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So the -- the short answer is -- is yes, but there's a limited number of doses. It's not commercially available for people. There was some discussion earlier on about potentially making those doses available to farmworkers. They're the people most at risk that we know of. And they actually did this in Finland, Jake, where they -- they offered those to farm workers in Finland. They haven't done that in the United States. So I still think that's under consideration. There are some vaccine makers who are talking about making a larger supply of the vaccine, possibly even using mRNA technology, something we talked a lot about during the COVID pandemic. And, you know, still there is a flu shot which might offer some protection in terms of symptoms against the H5N1, but it's not specifically directed for that. So, yes, there is a vaccine. Not enough doses at this time.",

It is heavily regulated in the United States, though. And what that specifically means is that if it's made with unpasteurized milk, that has to sit for 60 days before it can be sold. And the idea is that if you wait 60 days, that should really reduce or eliminate the chance that those pathogens such as E. coli or salmonella or listeria would still be present in the cheese.They also add various acids and salts, which can also sort of reduce the amount of pathogens in the cheese as well. I'll tell you, in other countries, it's different. I was in Italy, Jake. They have a raw cheese festival there. Something that they actually eat quite a bit of, not the case here in the United States.",
