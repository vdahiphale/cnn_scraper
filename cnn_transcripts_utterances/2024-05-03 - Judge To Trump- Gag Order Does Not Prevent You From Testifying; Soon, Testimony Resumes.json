And that it's not, quote, \"for testifying.\"Then moments later, in court, Judge Merchan told Trump directly this: Quote, \"The order restricting extra-judicial statements does not prevent you from testifying in any way. It does not prohibit you from taking the stand and it does not limit or minimize what you can say.\" Joining me now is George Grasso, who was a New York criminal court judge for more than a dozen years. You're in court this morning, Judge. I want to start from where Judge Merchan came from this morning. Why do you think he felt the need to make that clarification.",

I mean, my -- my sense, when I heard it, is that -- and this is just my sense of it -- is maybe the judge picked up on and maybe it was brought to his attention somehow. That either Mr. Trump or his legal team were asserting that, because of the gag order and the consequences that Trump found himself in with the nine citations of violating it.That somehow, they might have -- the judge might have thought they were trying to extrapolate it to applying, when and if, Donald Trump, defendant Trump decided to testify. So the judge just came right out of the box. He couldn't have made a clearer or more direct record that the gag order has absolutely nothing to do with the testimony of this defendant. Should the defendant decide to testify, he can speak to Michael Cohen. He can speak to Stormy Daniels. He can pretty -- he can say whatever he thinks is in his interest to testify to. So for whatever reason, the judge thought it was appropriate to make that record. He made a strong record. And I think he took it as a way of a possible appeal issue down the road should the jury, ultimately a jury of 12 convict Donald Trump.",

He's right now a leading candidate to get the Republican nomination. In that context, he puts out a social media post and he brags about this. Tens of millions of people become aware overnight. Furthermore -- or less than overnight, within moments. And we have seen incidents where people have been doxed, people have been harassed, people have been threatened based upon negative postings from this defendant. So how that applies in this specific courtroom with this jury and these witnesses that the judge cannot sit back and not use the tools of New York State law that's given him to maintain a fair and balanced trial. So in that context, I think the judge would have been remiss if he hadn't taken the steps he's taken. But none that, absolutely none of that would apply should Donald Trump take the oath and take the stand in his own defense. And I think the judge -- the judge, Judge Merchan, was right on target on making that point unambiguously clear on the record today.",

Before the break, Hicks testified that Trump was concerned that reports of sexual misconduct in 2016 would hurt his standing with voters ahead of the election.Now, eight years later, some of those sexual allegations are at the center of Donald Trump's criminal trial. Does he have the same concerns? And if not, should he? Let's talk now with Republican pollster and communication strategist, Frank Luntz. Frank, I wonder, does this help or hurt Donald Trump when you are re- litigating some of the most difficult moments, most challenging moments of his 2016 campaign during his third run for the presidency? FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER &amp; COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGIST: That's exactly what people are asking. And it's not really clear at this moment. It's going to depend on how the questions are answered, how it's picked up by the press, and what the president says at the end of each of these sessions. Because, in the end, he's the most important commentator. I've said this repeatedly. That Donald Trump, every time he is attacked, every time he faces one of these trials, something that would destroy any other candidate, for Trump, his numbers go up. People approve of him because they see him as being a victim. Now, that said, he's also the most self-destructive candidate that I've ever seen in presidential politics. He could have a fantastic day in court and then destroy it by a couple of poorly placed sentences as he does his own commentary. I'm not ducking the question. We just don't know at this moment. What we do know is that Trump has a lead, a very narrow one, and in the key swing states, so far, this trial has done nothing to damage his at least being tied with Joe Biden, if not being a percent or two ahead.",

If he's going to raise such a fuss about not being allowed to speak, then when given the right to speak and he chooses not to, if that's the case, then I think it does hurt his credibility. In the end, the only thing that will truly have a marked impact on his support, on his vote, is if he is found guilty. And then, quite frankly, we really don't know what the impact of that will be.

We already heard from the lawyer, Keith Davidson, who represented both Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. We heard about it from the AMI, \"National Enquirer\" perspective, from David Pecker. We will hear about it from Michael Cohen's perspective. The reason you might want to call Stormy Daniels or Karen McDougal, one or both of them, is, I believe, based on having seen them in public and seeing their interviews with Anderson Cooper and others. I think they're likable and personable, and a better face to put on this story than, for example, Keith Davidsonm, who I think went quite poorly for prosecutors.
