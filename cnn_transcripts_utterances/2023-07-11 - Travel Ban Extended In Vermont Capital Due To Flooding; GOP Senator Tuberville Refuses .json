This, as dangerous flooding reaching critical levels in the city's main dam.About an hour and a half ago, officials said there was only one foot of storage capacity behind the dam left. Right now, the water levels are inching toward the spillway. More than 100 rescues have taken place across six counties. And the New Hampshire governor just deployed some Blackhawk helicopters to assist those still trying to reach higher ground. CNN's Miguel Marquez, he's seeing it all firsthand from Vermont. And I know these warnings are going out. You have this no-travel rule going into effect until 3:00 p.m. I wonder, as you're there, people listen.",

This is our unofficial indicator of how high the water is. That car, two hours ago, the water was completely over the top of it. It's been coming down rapidly. The river that runs through town here has come down. So if that water -- if the reservoir north of here overspills that spillway, there's somewhat less concern because they have a little bit more breathing room now that the water in general is coming down everywhere. But it is just still just a massive, massive amount of water that came up from the south and then moved north. So there's still concern about how much water is in the system and raising the level of those reservoirs and then moving into towns and cities like Montpelier. I can tell you that most people that we talked to are OK. They have -- either on higher ground or moved to higher ground. A lot of those rescues, though, are people who cannot get out of where they are. They need medical attention. And they have lots of water rescue craft and personnel moving to those areas to help those people get to an ambulance or get to loved ones on the other side of streets like this -- Jim?",

So if you listen to the full interview, for somebody that claims to be very clear spoken, I'm just going to tell you how I feel, he is twisting his words around to please everybody. So he's trying to pretend like, well, white nationalists are Americans. If they're racist, I'm against racism but, you know, that's only your opinion that white nationalism is racism. So that way, he's trying to create a situation where everybody can hear what they want to hear. Because honestly, there is a constituency of white nationalists that you don't want to tick off evidently in some of the Republican primaries. Because they're allowed on the Internet or they have the ear of certain people. And so I think he is trying to twist his words. And he does not want to alienate -- it's a lot of what you saw, frankly, with Donald Trump where he did not want to alienate the Proud Boys and stuff like that. So it's a really, really concerning thing. Let's be very clear. White nationalism is not just racism, it's deep racism and it has no place, in my opinion, in any political party.

So, yes, we have to weed that out. Just like when I joined the military, I had to say I am not a member of the Communist Party or any party or any group that seeks to overturn the United States government. And so what it does for historical Republican support, they can pretend like, continue to pretend like they are the pro-military party. As they oppose U.S. support to Ukraine, which actually is preventing the United States military from having to get involved directly against Russia, as they hold up nominations because of the difference on abortion opinion. And have these members of the military that are reliant on their promotions for better pay and better leadership, the military that needs them to fill these positions, holding them up for politics. So, look, there's plenty of criticism that can go around in terms of politicizing the military.

But that stopped. The tide had been stemmed. And people like Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods said no, no matter how much money, no way, no how. American fans, in general, have been very anti-LIV. And frankly, the LIV Golf TV ratings are terrible. The attendance was terrible. The exhibition was terrible. There is no cut. It is three rounds. It's basically a joke.

So the idea that they're telling us this now, how do we even believe them? How do we know they're telling the truth?
