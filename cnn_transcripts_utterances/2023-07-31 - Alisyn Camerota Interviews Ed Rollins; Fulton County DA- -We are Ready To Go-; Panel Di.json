In Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who's investigating Trump's efforts to overturn Joe Biden's victory, says she is ready to make a charging decision. And in Florida, the Mar-a-Lago property manager making his first appearance in a Miami courtroom today. This is connected to efforts to conceal hundreds of classified documents. He is charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to the FBI. As for the rest of the GOP field, tonight, I'll talk to a Republican strategist who says Ron DeSantis's campaign is in trouble because DeSantis is a -- quote -- \"very flawed candidate.\" And then the latest Biden family news, President Biden acknowledging his seventh grandchild for the first time.

The latest \"New York Times\" Sienna poll of likely Republican voters has Trump at 54%. His closest challenger, Ron DeSantis, is a distant 17%.So why is Governor DeSantis struggling to make a dent in Trump's lead? In a moment, I'll ask a Republican strategist who was heading up DeSantis's political action committee, but who now blames the governor for the campaign's missteps. This might have something to do with it. It seems many Republican voters are not fans of Ron DeSantis's so- called war on woke. Only 38% of GOP voters would support a candidate who fights private corporations that promote so-called woke ideology. Fifty-two percent want a candidate to stay out of what businesses do or do not support. DeSantis, as you know, has gone to battle with multiple companies, including Disney, Bud Light, Norwegian Cruise, U.S. Sugar, and Big Tic (ph). Joining me now, former Reagan chief political adviser, Ed Rollins, who stepped down from a pro-DeSantis pack after coming to the conclusion that Governor DeSantis is a -- quote -- \"very flawed candidate.\" Ed, great to have you here.",

Equally as important, his campaign is better than it was four years ago, two years ago. They understand the delegate process. And what most people don't understand is the delegates are not picked. They picked most of the states in the Republican side as winner take all. So, like if he gets 50% of the vote in California, he gets all the California delegates. That's more than all these delegates in the -- that we're talking about now in New Hampshire, what have you. So, my sense is they're running a smarter campaign.

They don't want Joe Biden to be their president anymore. And if you're going to make a case to Republican primary voters, you should be talking about the deficiencies of that presidency, the economy. You should be talking about the schools that are not teaching our children. You should be talking about the fact that every single day, we have a migrant crisis that has gone unchecked by this Biden administration. We should be talking about, is there an actual doctrine from the Biden administration as it relates to Ukraine? And what would your doctrine be, particularly in light of the billions of dollars that are not being spent here at home?
