The full list includes key interviews with Donald Trump Jr., the former FOX News anchor Kimberly Guilfoyle, former Trump attorney Christina Bobb and people involved in the state level effort to overturn the 2020 election, including defeated Pennsylvania candidate Doug Mastriano. The list includes the D.C. mayor, Muriel Bowser, and numerous others. CNN will bring you more information as we get it. All right, turning now to the sound and the fury of Russian rockets echoing across Ukraine today. Smoke hanging in the Kyiv air. Evidence of a massive missile barrage that triggered sirens throughout the country. The aerial assault mixed cruise missiles and drones pointed at energy infrastructure, nearly 70 projectiles in the sky, fresh signs that Ukraine's defenses held, an intercept of a Russian missile caught on camera. The military claims it shut down the bulk of the Russian barrage. And yet what eluded Ukraine air defenses shattered ordinary life again, mangling cars and pulverizing buildings. Let's get straight to Kyiv and Ben Wedeman. Moscow wants to keep Ukraine in the dark, especially during this holiday season. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  (OFF MIKE COMMENTS)",

So the new year in that entire area, Russia and Ukraine, all parts of the former Soviet Union, New Year was a big, big celebration. It was huge. And not to mention, of course, Christmas. So I think the -- in addition to the absolute destruction that the Russian missiles are trying to carry out, you also have this psychological effect of bringing as much devastation to Ukrainians at this particular point in the calendar. And then also look at the question of, you know, peace. The Russians right now, the foreign minister Lavrov saying, this is delusional, the ideas that Zelenskyy is bringing forth.

And half of their house was utterly destroyed. They escaped with scratches but their car exploded and burned. At another location where we believe debris fell, there was widespread destruction in one home. A 14-year-old girl was wounded as well as her mother and a man nearby. But by  and large the capital did escape what could have been a far more serious attack because of the success of the air defenses, which did not unfortunately work everywhere. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, two people were killed. And in the western city of Lviv, which is far away normally from the danger of this war, 90 percent of the power has been knocked out. Amara.",

President Zelenskyy did bring forth a plan with 10 points in it and some of them are Russians pulling out their troops and reparations to Ukraine for the destruction that has been carried out by Russia, et cetera. And now, today -- and you could see the organized answer, the spokesperson for the foreign minister, was saying this is an illusion that this is going to happen. Russia will never go for it.

And he also said that he represented Goldman Sachs at a financial conference, saying there he spoke out against the company for investing in renewables. That is also false as we've previously covered. He did not work at Goldman Sachs. But there is not only  no record of him appearing on the panel but no record of him even attending the conference. There is additional false claims about his family history. Santos claims that his mother emigrated from Europe to Brazil but CNN's review found that she was born in Brazil. And Santos also said that his mother had a historically Jewish name but genealogists found no evidence of that name, no evidence of Jewish or Ukrainian heritage at all in their family tree. Now this all comes, as you noted off the top, that federal prosecutors in New York are investigating specifically his finances. And the Nassau County district attorney's office is looking into it, saying \"the numerous fabrications and inconsistencies associated with Congress man-elect Santos are nothing short of stunning.\" So certainly the scrutiny is intensifying around him.
