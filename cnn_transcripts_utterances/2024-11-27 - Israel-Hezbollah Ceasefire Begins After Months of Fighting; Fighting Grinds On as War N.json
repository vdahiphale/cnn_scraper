      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN Newsroom. I'm Christina Macfarlane.If you're just joining us, here are some of the top stories we're following today. We're just a few hours into the new Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire agreement. And already roads and highways are packed with displaced residents heading home despite warnings not to return just yet. One of the FBI's most wanted fugitives has been arrested in the UK after 20 years on the run. Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected animal rights extremist, was wanted for multiple bombings in California in 2003. The 46-year-old was arrested Monday in Wales and now faces extradition. And the traffic citations against Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill have been dropped because one of the police officers who pulled him over in September failed to appear in court. This video shows officers pulling the NFL star out of his car and placing him face down in the road after he did not immediately comply with their commands. More now on our top story this hour. Right now, the 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah is in effect. But already the Israeli military says its soldiers opened fire in Lebanon to prevent vehicles from reaching a restricted area. Although they didn't say where the incident took place. This was the scene in central Lebanon earlier as an unending line of cars heading south as displaced residents rushed to go home. This despite Israel and Lebanon's army urging them to delay their return. The new ceasefire deal calls for Israeli ground forces to withdraw from Lebanese territory and Lebanese government forces to regain control of the Hezbollah-held area. And U.S. and France will work to ensure the agreement is enforced. And President Joe Biden has been praising the deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: I applaud the crazy decision made by the leaders of Lebanon and Israel to end the violence. It reminds us that peace is possible. Say that again, peace is possible. As long as that is the case, I will not for a single moment stop working to achieve it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Many of them, as we saw, they're so isolated. But the question is, how bad is the situation now reflected across the entire Eastern Front? And is there a danger, in fact, of that front collapsing, given what we're seeing?",

      "sentences": "Just to go back to Nick's excellent reporting, because you have that soldier, yes, laced with profanities is his statement, but he really lays out what's happening on the battleground. He says, I'm alone. That's because there are simply not enough men on the ground fighting for Ukraine. They are desperate for more soldiers. He's run out of resources. He's relying on drones.That's despite billions of dollars being poured into the country, they are on the back foot. Russia simply has the larger arsenal, the larger number of weapons, the bigger number of troops on the ground. And they are also on the back foot in places that they believed there were going to be gains. And I'm speaking here of Kursk. Russia, on the other hand, is absolutely gaining momentum. President Putin has accused Ukraine of using those ATACMS in Kursk. That is something that President Biden has approved. These U.S.-made long- range drones. But the consequence of using those from President Putin has been high. He's lowered the nuclear threshold, the nuclear doctrine in the country. He used those experimental ballistic missiles a few days ago on Dnipro, and he is pushing perhaps harder than ever to regain areas where Nick Paton Walsh was, of course, in the east of Ukraine, but also to regain Kursk. All of this happened as the G7 was meeting, these last 24 hours, meeting alongside Ukraine's Foreign Minister, trying to reassure him that they have his back. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We're determined that Ukraine has the money, the munitions, and mobilized forces to fight effectively in 2025 or to negotiate but from a position of strength.

You have two parallel realities almost that were taking place yesterday. The G7 Foreign Minister is meeting in Italy, promising to do what it takes for however long it takes, but on the ground, soldiers that Nick is speaking to, preparing for that very real possibility that they could be dragged into a negotiating room.",

As you say, Ukraine seems to be readying themselves for the eventuality of a peace deal. What that is going to be remains to be seen. Trump is so unpredictable. But the Trump administration, as far as we know, they are involved at this stage, are they not, in having some communication?",

He met with foreign ministers of G7 countries earlier this week amid the escalating conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, as we just mentioned. These international concerns will likely be up for discussion during Blinken's meeting with Pope Francis in the Vatican City. CNN Vatican Correspondent Christopher Lamb is joining us. I guess this meeting with Blinken is as much about bookending the Biden presidency as it is looking ahead to the next.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Christina. We are seeing the first images of the Pope's meeting with Secretary Blinken this morning. He also met with Vatican officials.Top of the agenda will be global conflicts. Of course, the Pope and the Biden administration having some quite significant differences over the war in Ukraine and in Gaza, the Pope calling for Ukraine to negotiate a peace, even to, as he said in an interview, the courage to raise the white flag, which was controversial. The Pope also saying that allegations of genocide should be investigated in Gaza. So quite significant differences with the Biden administration. But broadly speaking, President Biden and the Pope have worked well together. The President, of course, the second Catholic president, has had a warm relationship with Pope Francis. Of course, this is, as you say, the back end of the Biden administration. It's a chance for Secretary Blinken to say goodbye to the Pope. And, of course, now a more uncertain period opens for the Vatican with the second Trump term about to commence.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, Pope Francis' vision of the world is really very different from President Trump's. He mentioned migration. The Pope has made welcoming migrants an absolutely key theme of his pontificate. He says the exclusion of migrants is totally wrong. And, of course, President Trump is planning to deport migrants. So there's a major tension there.Also on climate change. Pope Francis made protection of the environment a key topic of his pontificate. So I do envisage potential for major disagreements. It's also complicated by the fact that a lot of Catholics in the United States voted for President Trump, and some Catholic leaders are supportive of Trump. Different, in a way, to Pope Francis' position. However, the Vatican will try and work with President Trump's administration. And perhaps on Ukraine, the war in -- Russia's war in Ukraine, which President Trump has pledged to end and which Pope Francis wants to see end, there may be room for some kind of collaboration. We'll have to see. Christina.",

      "sentences": "Now, we're less than two months away from Donald Trump swearing in, and his team has finally signed the paperwork to begin the most important parts of the transition. An agreement with the White House, signed nearly two months after it was initially due, gives Trump's team access to key federal agencies and the security clearances needed to receive classified information. Trump's team, however, has declined to sign another transition document, which would give them access to office space and secure communications, among other things.One of the likely reasons Trump signed at least one transition agreement is his proposed crackdown on immigration. Both Trump's camp and immigration officials have lacked information on what's needed to carry out his plans for additional detention facilities and mass deportation. But the President-elect could have himself a key ally in Texas. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It's called the Sky Ladder and it stretches between two cliffs 5,000 feet in the air. For comparison, Dubai's Burj Khalifa is only about half as tall.And in terms of protection, you get handrails, a harness, and two carabiners to attach you to the ladder. I think a CNN person has to try this out. I nominate Max Foster. And for the first time in more than 50 years, a painting by British artist George Stubbs is up for auction. It's expected to sell for up to $2.5 million. The Spanish pointer is considered one of the artist's most famous works and has been in a private collection. The painting is now on display to the public at Sotheby's in London until early December. And an art installation on the southern coast of England is drawing attention, raising eyebrows, for its resemblance to an unsavoury emoji. Take a look for yourself. The artist says this wicker shelter is meant to be the shape of a sea snail's shell. However, the design has been widely compared, of course, to the iconic poop emoji. To flush away any confusion, one of the sculptors leapt to defend the creation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
