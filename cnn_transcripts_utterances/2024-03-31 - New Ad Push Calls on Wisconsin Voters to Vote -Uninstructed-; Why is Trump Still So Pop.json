I'm Manu Raju. Now, as Donald Trump prepares to make history in about two weeks as the first ex-president to stand trial in a criminal case, this weekend, he's keeping up his attacks on the New York judge overseeing the proceedings. Now remember, he's accused of allegedly falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to keep an alleged extramarital affair with adult filmmaker Stormy Daniels silent in the run-up to the 2016 election. And even as he's facing a gag order limiting what he can say about witnesses in the case, and despite new warnings from one federal judge that such attacks are deeply damaging to the system of justice. He is still going after Judge Juan Marshawn and his daughter as he did again on his social media platform just yesterday and to FOX News last night, claiming that he is the victim.

And as Trump's legal woes are hurting his ability to keep pace with Biden in fundraising two days from now, Trump is holding a rally in Michigan, and that is his first visit to a swing-state since he'd locked up the nomination nearly three weeks ago. He's billing that Michigan speech as, quote, remarks on Biden's border bloodbath. Now, that's after he drew criticism for using that same word, during a different rally a couple of weeks back. Now, the Michigan event is planned for just days after 25-year-old woman was killed there, allegedly by a man she had been dating in what immigration authorities say was in the illegally U.S., and that's according to our grand rapids affiliate, FOX 17.

But in particular on this close election, which we expect five points, he's beating Joe Biden by nationally, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pulling at 12 percent of the vote nationally. Immigration is a top issue among republic independent voters, Republican voters, we've seen, but independent voters, that is tied with the economy 23 percent, 23 percent according to the Quinnipiac poll.

And five years ago, the overall argument is yes, there are mean tweets. They were attacks on judges specifically, there are all sorts of things that the media, people like us, were obsessed with, but didn't you feel better and the Biden campaign, anything -- anything that's successful for them, if you look at the rhetoric from their fundraiser in New York on this week -- anything -- that the successful then bring it back to how bad the economy actually was four years ago, not five. Anything else that Trump does that seems like a distraction that burns up the news cycle, it doesn't really hurt Trump because people have processed when he was president, certain things it felt like I didn't have to pay attention to some things he said that sounded crazy, but I wasn't as worried about the border. I wasn't as worried about inflation. That's the entire Trump message.

And that is actually consistent with the Quinnipiac poll says naturally, Biden is also down three points with Hispanic voters is very similar in those two polls on that question, Black and Latino voters. But the exit polls from 2020 just shows you how much ground Trump -- Biden has lost with those two key voting blocs, Black voters where he won by at 87 to 12 back in 2020, Latino voters 65 percent.

But I would actually like to look a little bit more under the hood on those numbers with Black voters and Hispanic voters specifically women black women often out vote black men as well as most women across race usually outvote male voters. So you have to wonder, especially with the abortion issue becoming such a salient issue with most voters. If that's going to play into the Black support and the Black vote and Hispanic vote as well.

Its moved away from that, and that is the source of Americas problems.This is something he tapped into even with his, with his, his phrase, his motto, make America great again in many ways. Trump also has been a vehicle for evangelical policies. And you know, I heard covering the 2016 campaign from a lot of people, including many evangelicals, that they faced a binary choice. They had to choose between two people that they didn't like very much. But as we saw with the exit polls from 2024, even when given other options, many white evangelicals strongly support Trump.

Without Trump Roe would very likely still be the law of the land and evangelicals know that.You know, evangelicals are one of the groups that express the strongest opposition to abortion. And I think they see Trump as having delivered on that goal. They see him as someone who will continue to deliver on their policy goals. At the same time as we've seen more and more abortion restrictions take effect. This is a political problem for Republicans. We saw that in some of the results from the 2022 midterms.
