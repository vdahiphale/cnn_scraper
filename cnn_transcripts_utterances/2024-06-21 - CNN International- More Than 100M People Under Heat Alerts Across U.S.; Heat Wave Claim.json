The first day of summer, bringing deadly heat waves across four continents, dozens of cities in Mexico alone have already broken heat records. Beijing recording temperatures of 99 degrees Fahrenheit or 37 degrees Celsius. In India, where they've been battling a months-long heat wave, the death toll now over 100 and Delhi, the country's capital, recording its highest ever for temperature, 121 degrees, just shy of 50 degrees Celsius. These are new highs that could see 2024 easily surpassed last year as the hottest year on record. Here in the U.S., nearly a third of the country is under extreme heat advisories for the fifth straight day and there's a little relief in the forecast. This weekend, more than 100 million Americans will be impacted by this extreme weather. My colleague Athena Jones is out on the streets of New York City for us. So, Athena, you haven't melted yet, which is, is good because we know it is not exactly cool out there. How is the city responding to the excessive heat?",

This isn't terrible.Now I have to fans because that's how hot it is. The dial says about 93 degrees with a real field with the humidity, 97. And that's what were dealing with a heated the index that is forecast to reach or exceed 100 degrees today. And this whole area, all of New York City, mostly -- most of New York City, not Long Island and not parts of the city right along the water, but most of the city is under heat advisory because of these extremely high temperatures. And we're on the lookout to see if New York City brief breaks a June heat record, seven consecutive days with the temperatures at 90 and above, we are on day two right now as I just mentioned, 93. And so if -- if we do top -- we do meet that record, that's seven days, it will tie the longest stretch this kind of heat in a decade and the longest period of heat ever in June. We know that in Central Park, the forecast today to reach 94 degrees, that's the highest temperature in two years. And so this is something that's very dangerous, there's this kind of heat and that is why officials here at across the city of open hundreds of cooling centers. The governor has implemented emergency operations. So it should that up. We know that they're going to be handing out whether calling cool kits to people who work outside -- delivery workers, construction laborers, and that sort of thing, kits that include electrolytes, a towel, that's sort of thing, all to try to help people beat the heat because this is, of course, very, very, very warm. And if you don't have air conditioning, if you're older, if you're a senior, maybe someone with chronic health conditions, those are the folks who are going to be most vulnerable in this current environment. And the problem here, Erica, is, this could last for several well more days. This sort of heat, not, not dropping down to low at night, and that is when the heat accumulates and it becomes a cumulative effect. And that is something that folks, I have to be ready to watch out for and making sure they understand and can recognize the symptoms of heat stroke and heat exhaustion, and most of all making sure they're checking on their neighbors and the older folks they know and the people they know may not have air conditioning.",

Only Justice Clarence Thomas dissented. President Biden praised the ruling's protection for domestic violence victims, while his campaign attacked the gun lobby, saying the case should never have been brought. For more on this decision, CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider joins me now. So, Jessica, this is a court that we have seen really expand gun rights over the years.

      "sentences": "It was basically asking whether someone who was prone to violence could own a gun. And the federal law said no. And the Supreme Court said, well, it's pretty common sense that even the founders didn't want violent people owning guns and so that's why they upheld this law.But it is somewhat of a surprise, definitely a welcome one for gun control advocates because it was just two years ago that the Supreme Court issued that big Bruen decision and it gave individuals broad power to own guns and the test there that was in order for gun laws to stand, they had to have some sort of historical precedent, meaning a very similar law that existed at the nation's founding in the late 1700s. [15:15:03] And what we've seen throughout the two years since that ruling is considerable confusion for lower courts. Many judges, including in this case at the lower courts, they've been striking down gun laws in scenarios where they just can't find any historical backing. But, Erica, it was in this case that the chief justice stressed that while the Second Amendment right is broad, it's not unlimited. And as I referenced at the top, it makes sense that guns should be prohibited for anyone prone to violence. And, of course, that's exactly what this federal law does that's now been upheld. It keeps guns out of the hands of people that courts have deemed this credible threat when it comes to domestic violence. So a bit straightforward for this court, hence, the 8-to-1 decision, it will likely though, leave some questions still as to other gun laws that may or may not be upheld under this historical tradition, test that the courts still upheld today. But basically interpreted it as, of course, the founders allowed laws that took the hands out of guns or took it -- sorry, took the guns out of hands of violent people.",

The Fifth Circuit actually recently struck down that law, saying that it's unconstitutional because the founders never intended for nonviolent drug users to not be able to own guns.Hunter Biden's lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to hear that case. The Supreme Court hasn't definitively said, whether they'll take it up yet, but that's just one example of a law that has been challenged that the Supreme Court will have to address because this case really only addresses a somewhat narrow subset of gun laws in that this law habits people prone to violence from possessing guns.

You know, if we pick up actually where we just left off with Jessica the chief justice saying, really it was it was no trouble if everybody gets to this decision, but there was a little bit of back and forth, actually, even though we did ultimately see opinion of eight to one. And I was struck by something that Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote, suggesting it was largely the Supreme Courts fault for this ambiguity and for the lower courts having a hard time following their rulings, writing: when this court adopts a new legal standard, as we did in Bruen, we do not do so in a vacuum. The test we establish which bind a lower court judge, judges who then apply those legal standards to the cases before them.

So we can interpret this as saying, well, under those very narrow circumstances, the Second Amendment prohibits the holding of a gun because that was there is some historical precedent for it. But if we're thinking more broadly that this case stands for the proposition that anyone who has a violent propensity can't buy a gun, I'm not sure that I read it that way.And remember the thing about these cases, yeah, it's 8-to-1 in the decision, but there are multiple concurring opinions saying, well, I don't get there exactly this way, but I get there in the end. So I think it's anything but settled. And I think Ketanji Brown is directly on point when she says we've just created more confusion. Justice Thomas's historical parallel test is just unworkable.",

And I think the court said, yes, of course, that makes sense. And there's a historic precedent, I suppose somewhere out there that suggests that. Thomas doesn't seem to find historical precedent for anything.

He can't be so locked in. But it's tough to know when it does and doesn't apply. It seems that there's a lot of cherry picking going on at the court, Gloria. BROWNE-MARSHALL:  I think there is massive cherry-picking and is super majority has made so much confusion because it appears they seem to be gerrymandering the law for certain constituency groups. If you think about historically, Clarence Thomas as an African American in some jurisdictions this would have been outlawed from having a weapon. This is during the time period of slavery. So, enslaved people could not have a weapon. There were so many different historical perspectives that one can take in this particular situation. And I'll give this last perspective. That's a very practical one. I have a very close person in my life who is looking at a restraining order right now because her estranged husband has weapons in his home. She fears for her life. And so, this is real. This has to be something that although they say that the justices only really can put their teeth into something that is practical to them, this is practical to many, many women across the country and some men and some young people. We need to understand that the Supreme Court should not be on his Mount Olympus creating decisions no one can apply. This is not a philosophical exercise.

Judge Aileen Cannon hearing arguments that Special Counsel Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland. That's what Trumps attorneys are arguing.

That's why other courts have upheld the use of special counsels in bringing cases because they have it on the books of how it's supposed to work.And if there is something that happens where the attorney general is at odds with the special counsel, they have to go tell Congress which then would likely make it public. That is not something that we have seen happened with any of the recent special counsels including Smith, but Cannon seems to be picking more at trying to just get more information about how it worked between the Justice Department and this special counsel.

They don't -- the other side doesn't even accept that its happening.But here we are in the U.S. and Canada and Mexico with this heat dome. It's very stable hot air that's very hot and not going anywhere. And there's no clouds and so it gets hotter and hotter, no reflection of sunlight into space then this is going to be a La Nina year, where the cooling, this may surprise many of us, but cooling water in the Pacific will enable more hurricanes to form. And so this will have an economic effect as these hurricanes come ashore and everybody's got up in some cases literally bail people out. So this is a worldwide problem and the problem is we say all the time, it's happening in slow motion but working together, we can address this we've got to work the problem from both ends, reduce fossil fuels, create new forms of reliable renewable electricity.",
