Thirty-nine percent say they're not relevant to his fitness for office. And again, look at that by party, and you'll see here, 82 percent of Democrats in Georgia say he'll be disqualified if the charges are true. Forty-eight percent of independents.

Donald Trump pushing to take the stand, saying that he's going to testify in various legal cases, and then at 11th hour, his attorneys convincing him that it is a bad idea. And when you look at it, it really comes down to risk and reward. Remember, he already did testify in this case. He had a very contentious day in court where he went back and forth with the judge. There wasn't much left to say, because he had answered so many of those questions.

They're putting real people on television, telling their story about how the Biden/Harris administration has helped out each one of those real groups. I think that's incredibly important, because you know why? A lot of these voters are really cynical, and they don't really want to listen to any politician tell the story. So hearing real people tell the story is going to be incredibly important. Inflation is a huge problem. But now we're starting to see is wages are outpacing inflation for the first time in a couple of years. It takes time for people to feel that. Gas prices are going down. I've been feeling that, right? Most people do. Gas prices are going down. As that kind of washes its way through the system, I think that will help. Lastly, the Gaza war is a real challenge for Democrats. Keep in mind, Bernie Sanders is still the heart of the Democratic Party in terms of his ideology. If you go all the way back to, like, Jesse Jackson, who won the Michigan primary back in 1984 and '88, like, this is a -- this is an incredibly liberal party in many ways.
