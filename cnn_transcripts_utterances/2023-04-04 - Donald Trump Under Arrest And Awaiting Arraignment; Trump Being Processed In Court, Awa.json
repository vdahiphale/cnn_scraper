Still photographers dropped behind the barricade in a part of the play on the 15th floor. This is the door that Trump is going to come to next whenever he goes into the actual room, when he is before the judge, when he issues that plea of not guilty. We are expecting him, based on what his attorney said earlier, to come to the cameras and make a brief statement. He has not done so. Obviously, we're still -- he just got here. We're just waiting on him to come up here. I will say, as we're talking about what the processing here looks like, I was told before this that, as they were discussing the logistics of the actual choreography and visit, Trump had expressed some interest in actually having his mug shot taken. Obviously they have been chewing a lot of this through the lens of what it would look like when it comes to the 2024 campaign. How to use it to their advantage when it comes to fundraising. And they believe having that mug shot taken could actually be beneficial to them. So we don't know that that's happening, obviously, but that is part of the mindset into how they're looking, not just from a legal perspective, but also from a campaign and political perspective. We'll see what it is he says before cameras.

Joining us now, our Jeff Zeleny, who's outside Trump Tower. And, Jeff, Donald Trump just posted on Truth Social. Tell us about his message. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jake, as he was traveling down from Trump Tower here to lower Manhattan, he did post a message, or aides posted it on his behalf, certainly expressing this sentiment that we've heard that he's feeling. And let's take a look at this. He says, \"Heading to lower Manhattan, the courthouse seems so surreal\" -- in all caps. \"Wow, they're going to arrest me.\" The former president writes, \"Can't believe this is happening in America. MAGA.\" Of course, MAGA is his \"Make America Great Again\" movement, really the anthem, the rallying cry for his candidacy. But as we know from covering him for all these many years, these social message postings often offer the best insight into what he is actually thinking. And there is, you know, for all the bravado, for all the trumpeting how much money they've raised, there was a real sense of apprehension for him, sort of leaving the comforts and security of Trump Tower to walking in to be arrested and alone. And we're getting a first glimpse of this. This could be the message he also delivered when he is at least expected to speak very, very briefly at the courthouse before, again, delivering a full-throated response, a defense of these charges tonight in Mar-a-Lago -- Jake?",

Thanks so much for joining us, Adam. Appreciate it. I would think that District Attorney Alvin Bragg knows that this better be a clear-cut case given the unprecedented nature of such an arrest and arraignment. What's your take on the case that he will likely present? ADAM KAUFMANN, FORMER PROSECUTOR, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE: I agree with you, Jake. And thanks for having me on today. You know, this is an unprecedented exercise of prosecutorial authority over a former president. And you really have to hope that it's a case with some substance to it, some heft to it. And I think we're all waiting for the arrangement so we can see the indictment and analyze what it says and what the charges are. I think back to the incident that you just mentioned of Rudy Giuliani on stage leading chants of \"lock her up\" about Hillary Clinton. And I remember arguing with friends and saying, you know, you don't you don't lock up -- she may have broken the law, but you don't you don't lock up a presidential candidate for a sort of technical violation, for something where there's not really a criminal intent or a direct harm. And so I'm very eager to see what this indictment says, and whether it speaks to some sort of substantial fraud, substantial attempt to subvert an election process, or something that is, I hope, more than some entries in the books and records of the Trump Organization.",

And it's something where I've been on both sides. I've been the prosecutor waiting for a case to be arraigned and I've walked in clients to be arraigned. And you know the clients, all of them have that feeling of this is surreal. There's a process that they're going into that they do not control. And the process sort of takes over. For those who know the criminal justice system, it all makes sense. For someone who's coming, who's never been involved in it, which is most criminal defendants, it is -- it's just surreal.

The processing, though, which probably started when he -- not long after he arrived, and some of which might have been done in advance is going to take a bit.

Conspiracy is nothing more than an agreement between two people to commit a crime.And you can describe what the agreement was and what the conspiracy hope to accomplish. And so that really gives the prosecution a strong ability to craft this sort of narrative. Much more common in federal practice than in state practice. But it's a great opportunity for the prosecution to make a public statement within the four corners of the indictment.",

It's a federal offense. So they couldn't articulate that as a conspiracy to commit that crime because it's not a state crime. And so it makes you wonder, is there another financial crime? For example, they could do this through a scheme to defraud. That would be a typical sort of state-level fraudulent scheme that would allow them to describe the type of crime and the type of narrative that I'm referencing.",

It doesn't necessarily only have to be conspiracy with Michael Cohen.And it's going to be for a period of time. So from on or about a period of time to on or about a period of time. And it allows much more evidence to come in that a judge might otherwise hold out, because it's saying it's not related to these -- did you make this business record entry? And conspiracies also require that you plead the overt acts that are in further into this conspiracy. So what were the actions that were taken that are in furtherance of this conspiracy? And I think that, again, you could have so much more in there that are overt acts that aren't necessarily crimes in and of themselves, like did they pay other people off? Did they get together to agree to pay hush money payments? Did they -- how are they going to influence the election? Things that aren't necessarily elements of a crime or a crime --",
