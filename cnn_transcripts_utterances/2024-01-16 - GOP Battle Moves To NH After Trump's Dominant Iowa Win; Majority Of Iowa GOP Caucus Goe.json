And Governor, what you've seen -- you're both governor -- Governor Sununu, what you've seen is that these court cases have in the short term, at least benefited him with Republican caucus goers, with Republican primary voters, at least in polls. So that's part of the reason why he plays it up, and he goes to this hearing today that he doesn't have to be at.GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R), NEW HAMPSHIRE: Look, obviously he plays the victim every time. I'll say this, on the court cases, the average American voter, it's massively confusing, they're not following him. And they're not going to the ballot box saying, but I'm going to vote because of that case and that potential outcome. That's not really part of the equation. People want to know how you're going to save their social security. They want to know how they -- you're going to get inflation down. They want to know, my goodness, I could have an accountant in the White House that actually has fiscal responsibility and treats my hard working dollar with the respect that it deserves. Trump never did that. Trump borrowed $7 trillion. That's inflation, everybody. Inflation comes from one thing, overspending and overprinting money in Washington. He has to be held accountable. Biden's made it 10 times worse, there's no question. But as a Republican, he didn't fulfill on the mission that a lot of us sent him to Washington --",

This is a race and she's committed to working at, you know, over the last, you know, seven days here. So that energy, I think, is what is going to be the takeaway for New Hampshire voters. BASH: And of course, we can't lose sight of the fact that Donald Trump didn't just win in Iowa. He crushed everyone else. It was a historic win in 98 of the 99 counties, doing well in almost -- not just doing well -- winning in almost every demographic, including those that he almost never does well in.

He was going to win and win handily and he did.New Hampshire is an open primary, the undeclareds or independents, as you call them, have a chance to participate here. That's a different demographic. The issue set is different here as well. And so, I think that, you know, Iowa was an important race for Donald Trump. He did very well here. Give him credit to there. Give him credit where it's due. But in New Hampshire, Nikki Haley has laid the groundwork to succeed. She's in striking distance. I saw a new survey today that had it tied up at 40. You know, we'll see.

As we know, AFP has been supporting her here. And they've got a really impressive ground game in place now for Nikki Haley.

You know, he took a frontal assault on Donald Trump every day here, got him 12 percent in a retirement, effectively.

The trial that's happening now has to do with the first set, why -- which happened while he was president. And the reason that one's been held up is that Donald Trump was arguing that he was immune from civil lawsuit because it happened while he was president and he argued it was within the scope of the presidency.
