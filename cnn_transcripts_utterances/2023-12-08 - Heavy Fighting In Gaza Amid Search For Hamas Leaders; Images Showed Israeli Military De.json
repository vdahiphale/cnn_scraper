But first, a new barrage of Russian missiles launched overnight against Ukraine after a nearly three-month pause. Ukraine says missiles that were fired at Kyiv were all intercepted and destroyed. And new report on the health of the American economy has just been released. More jobs created and the U.S. stock market not overjoyed with the news as inflation remains a threat. And new federal charges alleging tax fraud are filed against Hunter Biden, the son of U.S. president Joe Biden. He's accused of evading taxes and filing false returns. Welcome to our second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. The United Nations Security Council is voting today on a resolution that seeks for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in the fighting in Gaza. All eyes will be on how the United States will vote on the Arab-backed resolution, tabled by the United Arab Emirates and seconded by Ireland. Meanwhile, the Israeli military says it has hit more than 250 targets over the past day, the highest number since the truce with Hamas ended, causing more chaos and destruction for Gazans who are already struggling with a humanitarian crisis. So, tonight, we ask. How will this vote impact the war? Alex Marquardt is back with us this hour from Tel Aviv. Great to see you, Alex. What is the situation like right now from a military perspective on the ground in Gaza?",

Israel has said that it is operating in the heart of Khan Younis. It is attempting to encircle the city because they say that some of Hamas's most senior leadership are believed to be there. So that has really become the focus but we are now two months into this conflict. Israel's stated goal is eradicating Hamas. So far they say that Israel says that several thousand Hamas fighters have been killed. That's just a fraction of the overall force.

Mohamed Deif, the shadowy head of Hamas's military wing, is also believed to still be alive. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims Israeli forces surrounded Sinwar's Khan Younis home, though the IDF admits they believe he's hiding out underground. Two months after Hamas carried out the deadliest attack in Israel's history, the response has led to a colossal humanitarian catastrophe.

But in terms of a timeline, Israeli and American officials have told my colleagues and me that they expect this high intensity phase, as they've called it, to continue for another few weeks, potentially until the end of the month before there is a transition to a lower intensity phase, possibly in January. That phase will look like more localized strike counterterrorism operations by special forces unit, for example, to take out specific leaders. But the expectation is that could continue for quite some time. Israeli leaders have said that this conflict is going to go on for a while, and they're still very much the question that is being debated in the U.S., here in Israel, in Arab capitals and at the United Nations about the governance for the Gaza Strip and for the Palestinian people following this conflict -- Eleni.",

The U.N. says only 69 aid trucks into Gaza on Thursday. That is less than half the average number of deliveries that were getting through daily during the truce. The growing humanitarian crisis comes as the Palestinian Health Ministry reports that six Palestinians were shot and killed by the Israeli military at the Al Faraa refugee camp. CNN has reached out to IDF for comment. Meantime, images posted on social media show a mass detention of men in Gaza by the Israeli military. And you can see a large group here, stripped to their underwear, kneeling and sitting, while blindfolded. The exact dates and circumstances of the detention are not clear. The Israeli Defense Forces has not responded to CNN's request for comment on these images. For more on these developing stories, I want to bring in CNN's Ben Wedeman in Jerusalem, as well as Larry Madowo in Cairo. Great to see you both. Ben, I want to start off with you.

Now we have been in touch with people who recognized relatives who were among those detained and they said one guy is a shopkeeper. Others have said one is a journalist. It does appear that it's simply a question of round them all up and then try to sort out who they actually are. Now I have seen similar things back in 2002, when Israel invaded the West Bank. We saw that all the men and most of the teenager, teenage males, were rounded up in like town squares, village squares, handcuffed, in some cases blindfolded, taken away for interrogation. Now, as far as that Israeli raid on the refugee camp and the northern West Bank, yes, six people were killed. But that was only one of multiple Israeli incursions into Palestinian communities throughout the occupied West Bank.

What we're hearing from him, the head of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency that looks after Palestinian refugees, is that the humanitarian efforts in Gaza is collapsing. Collapsing because they can't get enough supplies in. They can't reach the people who desperately need it. As a result, Antonio Guterres is talking about the spread of disease throughout this, particularly the southern Gaza Strip. This is what we've been reporting on now for weeks. Just how bad the situation is. And as moving as his words were, I think they are falling on deaf ears. The United States has already made it clear that it is not going to support a humanitarian cease-fire. That it still supports Israel's military objectives in Gaza, and of course, they prefer to do the backdoor, quiet diplomacy, but we learned today that the death toll, I wrote it down, it's more than -- it's getting close to 18,000.

Some homes in the Ukrainian capital were damaged by falling missile debris. Friday's new barrage from Moscow comes after a nearly 80-day pause. Israel's military says it struck 450 targets in Gaza in what is the heaviest day of bombardment since the temporary pause in fighting ended a week ago. The IDF claiming it's killed, quote, \"numerous terrorists\" in precision strikes in Khan Younis. The Hamas-controlled Health Ministry reports hundreds more deaths in the past day and more than 17,000 Palestinians killed since the war started. A plane load of badly needed aid for Gaza is expected to arrive in Egypt today from the United States. Humanitarian deliveries have slowed significantly since the truce between Israel and Hamas ended. The U.N. says only 69 aid trucks into Gaza on Thursday. Israel says it will open a border crossing into Gaza in the coming days to facilitate relief efforts. The toll of the current war on Gaza's children is truly, truly heartbreaking. James Elder, a spokesperson for the U.N. children's agency, says a father of two critically injured children told him this. \"I want to do just one thing when this war is over. Cry.\" And James Elder joins me now. So really great to have you on. It's a difficult time.

And there's a child bleeding out. The screams of mothers ring with me right now.

A friend, a colleague who spoke, his mother had not had clean water for 24 hours. His 3-year-old had not had clean water for 24 hours.

They're being moved from those places, where they were forced to having hit their home bombed in the north to a street corner, to a dusty patch of lands. There's nothing, and I really mean nothing. Not a drop of water. Not a bathroom. 10,000 people wake up one day, there is not a toilet to be seen. So there is nowhere safe.

After the bombardments, which have not stopped over the past months, when much of the world's focus has been on the Middle East. They were mostly Shaheed drones, other missile attacks. These are the caliber cruise missiles likely, which many felt Russia might have a limited supply on, but Russia said it would be able to make an infinite number of. They are now back after 79 days of absence. 19 fires, Ukraine says they intercepted 15 of them. Before they got through one killed in Dnipropetrovsk, debris falling on Kyiv as you mentioned. Damage and eight injured in a town we just drove through, Pavlohrad, but also, too, separately in Kharkiv, in the east, S-300 missiles landing hitting residential buildings there, causing other injuries as well. And the fear, I think, being that as winter really takes a grip on the frontlines, but also civilian life here as well, this could be a repeat, an echoing of what we saw last winter, which was Russia's persistent attacks on the energy infrastructure, the basic fabric of daily life of Ukrainians here aimed at plunging them into darkness and cold. That may be back, but it comes, too, at a time in which Ukraine is now deeply concerned about its viability on the frontlines going forward. The U.S. has just released $175 million of aid. That is a paltry sum compared to the billions we were seeing over the past years. Sorry, year plus. Often a couple billion dollars, it seemed, every other week announced by the Pentagon. This is a reflection of log jam up on Congress. Aid for Ukraine and for Israel and for the migration problems on the southern U.S. border, all being part of a political jockeying there, causing concerns certainly in the White House and Pentagon, but more deeply in Kyiv as well. But that money may soon run out. We don't know exactly when the transparency on how much is left in the Pentagon's account isn't open. Obviously this is a war here. But it certainly seems to be close, and one of the last is how this recent tranche announcements was referred to. But for Ukrainians here this aid is essentially an existential matter.
