Wang Yi was actually in Cairo on a previously scheduled trip, but without missing a beat, he actually used that location to reinforce Beijing's claim over Taiwan, referring to the 1943 Cairo conference, which of course was about a post-World War II global order to -- to further stakeout this claim that Taiwan has always been part of China, and that has been a global consensus for decades now, that Cairo declaration obviously is not without controversies and has been open to different interpretations.But while these remarks, as the foreign minister, obviously not surprising than is warning that Taiwan independence is a dead end is also to be expected. But that, of course, stands in contrast to the reality on the ground in Taiwan in terms of that population's growing separate identity and their rejection of Beijing's threats and warnings as shown in this election result. But even though we have seen quite a bit of added urgency or growing the emphasis on, quote, unquote, \"reunification\" with Taiwan under Chinese leader Xi Jinping, we may not see too much drastic actions as of now for a variety of reasons. Practically, the weather is not ideal in the Taiwan Strait at this time of the year, so it's not really a good time to stage massive military drills. And also, Beijing may not want to give Lai Ching-te further ammunition to bolster his argument against Beijing's threats, especially at a time when he received a relatively -- weak mandate, not to mention, perhaps most importantly, Beijing and Xi Jinping himself has invested so much in recent months trying to tamp down tensions with the West, especially with a U.S. at a crucial election year in the U.S., with the campaign season obviously kicking off in earnest. So that's why we may now see too much, too drastic as of now, but still, they have options. Not just military drills, but also economic coercion and even perhaps flipping another of Taiwan's remaining diplomatic formal -- formal diplomatic, diplomatic allies, Michael.",
