As you can see, it's a mixed day, but the Dow is on the front, but only just a bit. Well, those are the markets and these are the main events. Apple is set to lose $200 billion in market value in two days after reports of an iPhone ban at government agencies in China. A dramatic rescue is underway to save a man trapped 1,000 meters underground in a Turkish cave. And new revelations from a biography about Elon Musk. The book says he disrupted a Ukrainian sneak attack on Russia by turning off the Starlink network. Live from Dubai, it is Thursday, September 7th. I'm Eleni Giokos, I'm in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very good evening and welcome to the show. Tonight, two tech giants are caught in the geopolitical crossfire between the US and China as the rival nations spar over cell phones and semiconductors. The latest flashpoint is Huawei's new Mate 60 Pro. It is apparently powered by an advanced chip that is believed to have been made by SMIC, a Chinese company cut off from US technology. The breakthrough surprised industry experts and US officials. US lawmaker, Mike Gallagher, chair of the House Committee on China is now calling for tighter restrictions against the chipmaker. SMIC shares closed sharply lower in Hong Kong. Now fears that China is cracking down on Apple devices is taking a toll on that company's stock. Its shares are down more as you can see, three percent, that's on the heels of the worst single day drop in a month on Wednesday. China is reportedly banning government workers from using iPhones. Now, the country is an important market for Apple and the company gets about a fifth of its revenue from sales in China. CEO, Tim Cook made a high profile visit there back in March. So much happening within the tech space, the chipmaker space. We've got Anna Stewart, with us to break it all down for us. Apple shares dropping significantly, losing so much market value. Look, it's no surprise in terms of what the government officials in China are doing in terms of banning iPhones, but take us through the intricacies of the story.",

      "sentences": "It's been an interesting week, and I feel like all the stories are beginning to sort of collide into one at this stage. But for Apple, four percent down yesterday, three percent down today, that is as you say $200 billion wiped off its valuation, and that is because China is such an important market to it.So we have the first report from \"The Wall Street Journal,\" suggesting that state officials would no longer be allowed to use iPhones making official what apparently was already a trend unofficially within the government. Then there was a follow up report from Bloomberg saying actually this ban was going to be extended for state backed firms as well. No response from China on why they would, but it's not hard to guess. Huawei phones and equipment of course are banned by the US and restricted by many Western nations. And then of course, you think about the timing next week. There's this event which is the Apple expected launch of the iPhone 15, and I did enjoy a note from Bank of America analysts saying the timing was interesting. This is a big blow for Apple. Of course China, as you say is a very important market for it. That said, last year, their sales in China were hit by all sorts of things, COVID-19 protests in factories so actually even with this, analysts still think for Apple compared to last year, they will do all right. But there is another iPhone maker and China -- not iPhone maker, phone maker in China, which is also looming large over sales.",

And he is likely to be called as a witness at the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, which is set to begin on October 2nd in New York.His guilty plea hearing is underway right now. We'll learn a bit more information about what specifically he's pleading guilty to. But in a criminal case, when prosecutors are looking to build a case and tell a story to a jury, where they're going to have to explain some complicated topics, particularly involving cryptocurrency, something that many people have a hard time getting their head around, they will have insiders to walk them through what happened at the company and to cut through the jargon and explain what they were doing. Because these people have pleaded guilty, they're going to admit what they did wrong and put blame on Sam Bankman-Fried. He's been accused of many different schemes in the case, including taking money from FTX to prop up a hedge fund which was a sister hedge fund called Alameda Research. And he was also accused of using straw donors to make political donation to both Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. to try to influence policy toward cryptocurrencies. And Salame is somebody that prosecutors pointed to, saying that they had evidence that he sent a private message to a family member, saying that he was the straw donor that Bankman-Fried used. So that's the sense of how he will fit into the case. But certainly having the cooperation of numerous top executives to explain the story is very powerful for prosecutors.",

They lived in a house together in the Bahamas, where they were running this business. They will shed so much insight into Bankman-Fried. There'll usually be a key cooperator to explain it to the jury. But this really seems so significant to have four top insiders, not just executives but really within his inner circle, to tell the story for prosecutors. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty and he's working on building a defense. Very interesting to see how he lays that out and how he counters what these cooperating witnesses will tell the jury.",
