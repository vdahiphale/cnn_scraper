But we do want to update you on a developing story that we're also following, and that is that Hamas has now responded to the latest ceasefire proposal for Gaza. This is according to a joint statement issued moments ago from Qatar and Egypt.",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris and Brianna, starting with Hamas, they have said that they have given a response to this proposal to both Qatar and Egypt. These are the mediators in this whole process. And they have made comments on the proposal, so not a definitive acceptance at this point.We've heard from Hamas saying that they have made these comments in the interest of the Palestinian people. The mediators themselves, Egypt and Qatar, say they will now take those comments into consideration, talk to the United States as well, also a key mediator, the other parties within this process, and move forward from there. Now, from the Israeli side, as you say, there has been a government statement today, and they effectively said that they would agree to a ceasefire, but there has to be certain conditions met, and that would be getting all the hostages back, also making sure that Gaza will not be a threat to Israel in the future and degrading the Hamas government and military capabilities. And so it's, again, not an acceptance of the proposal, which the Biden administration says is an Israeli proposal. And it does appear really at odds in some ways, at face value, to what the proposal suggests. This proposal says there would be a six-week ceasefire in phase one, and that would evolve in phase two to a permanent cessation of hostilities. So really, to sum up, I think what we have learned from today is that both sides have agreed in principle to something, but not to the proposal itself.",

CNN got news earlier in the day that the president would be leaving a speech he was giving on gun safety here in Washington, D.C. and heading directly to Wilmington where his son, Hunter, was convicted earlier in the day of three separate counts of breaking federal gun laws. A federal jury found the president's 54- year-old son violated several laws that were set up to prevent drug addicts from owning guns.Prosecutors also laid out many intimate details about Hunter Biden's struggles with crack cocaine, which intensified after his older brother, Beau, died of cancer.",

That's a political question, but I also think it's a question that is important for how a family approaches addiction. As families approach this, it's a fine line, right, between wanting to protect your loved one who is battling addiction and enabling that addiction, this idea of natural consequences following some behavior.Can you talk to us a little bit about that and how families sometimes approach that in different ways?",

Instead, we want to focus our efforts on using the love and concern among the family members and friends to help get the person into treatment, into recovery, and to join them on that recovery journey as well.And so there's a lot families can do, but just getting in the way of consequences, paying off somebody's fine or rent or something like that or trying to cover for them is not helpful.",

She describes how she was sent and dispatched on this apology tour to speak with these victims, and she was given talking points by the Coast Guard. The talking points told her to say that Congress was aware of this investigation, aware of what all these decades of abuse, misconduct, potentially hidden assaults, and during that time she informed these victims of that. We now know that that's not the truth, and that was only uncovered because of CNN investigations team great reporting. That, in part, led her to resign when it was revealed, and here's what she said just this week to CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
