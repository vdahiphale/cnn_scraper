Israel's war cabinet could see a shakeup in the hours ahead as we await the end of a deadline set by former defense minister Benny Gantz. What his threatened departure from the cabinet could mean for the conflict in Gaza. Plus the U.S. jobs report is showing a mixed bag when it comes to growth and inflation. Why families and small businesses may have a less rosy perspective than what the numbers would indicate. (MUSIC PLAYING)",

And undoubtedly one can imagine the possibility. I mean, this will be put I guess in the most diplomatic terms. But the real possibility in President Macron's mind, although President Biden will believe he's going to win the upcoming U.S. election. But in president Macron's mind, the concern that the next U.S. president that he may be greeting in France could be Donald Trump if he, if he wins the election. And that's a concern. And I think we heard those concerns overlaid in all the conversations and speeches that President Biden has given while he's been in France. About the importance of the United States not being isolated, the importance of the duty of unity, of the nations to support Ukraine in its fight against President Putin's Russia, which President Zelenskyy himself compared to Germany under the Nazis and Adolf Hitler. So this is the sort of backdrop to the conversations. But the real meat of the conversations for what they'd both like to do, really those lie in the sphere of peace in the Middle East and of course, how best to support Ukraine and endure that support going forward, whomever wins the U.S. presidency.",

And that is the demands of domestic politics and the way that that sort of contains and constrains what he wants to do. We've seen when he apologized to President Zelenskyy for taking so long to get that $60 billion aid package for Ukraine because they got stuck, he said because of some hardline Republicans. So he is constrained in what he can do. Macron, of course, will want to push Biden to get tougher on Israel. He supports President Biden's latest peace proposal for hostage release and a ceasefire in Gaza. But he wants Biden to do more. And when it comes to Ukraine, he wants Biden to do more there as well and be more forward leaning and support his own initiative, Macron's initiative, to have a coalition of international military trainers, who would be inside Ukraine. We don't have this, at least not publicly, knowledge at the moment that NATO nations have military members inside Ukraine supporting and training troops there. That's something Macron wants to, wants to do, is something President Biden is averse to doing. Because part of the American electorate is very leery about seeing a U.S. entanglement, a military engagement on the ground inside Ukraine, something President Biden said wouldn't happen even if and when Russia invaded Ukraine. So it's hard to see what wiggle room Biden has but that doesn't mean that President Macron isn't going to try to find that space to move things in his direction.",

And you see that Biden is in France right now. And though he and Macron don't agree on everything, they are showing a united effort here, that they do mostly agree on the issue of Russian aggression and in trying to strengthen the European Union. But with a Trump presidency, I think you're going to see quite a bit of disarray and chaos. If you look at the far right, this family group is probably one of the groups that is the least united. And Trump promotes disarray, whether it be this isolationist idea that doesn't really work for institutions, particularly intergovernmental institutions. And also the transatlantic partnership. There needs to be I guess something fighting against that rugged individualism that these far- right parties want to promote. So it would be very hard to predict what's going to happen. But what you've seen is just at least the voting of some of the far right in the European Parliament. They vote to basically support Russia, either refusing to vote against Putin or Russia.

Because he has threatened to abandon NATO; of course, he left the Paris agreement at a moment's notice; left the Iran nuclear agreement; has threatened to leave the World Health Organization. So U.S. commitment to these types of institutions appears to be wavering. And of course, France's president Emmanuel Macron has sounded the alarm on this, that Europe has to be more independent, both militarily, financially, in every single way and can't rely on the U.S. And he's been talking about modernizing Europe's nuclear forces because the big -- the big threat is, without a united U.S. and Europe, making it very clear to Putin what they're capable of, Russia under Putin was very risk acceptant, could take huge risks.

Unindicted Coconspirator 1 is, of course, Donald Trump and that broad fake elector scheme plays a significant part in the federal indictment filed against him over the January 6th capital insurrection. The Arizona election was tight. Biden won by just about 10,000 votes. Trump's supporters filed numerous lawsuits that all came to naught and later mounted an exhaustive audit of the Maricopa County vote that found no significant fraud. Then in 2023, a Democratic state attorney general took office in Arizona.",

Giuliani also called into his first court appearance about an hour late and called the case a complete embarrassment to the American legal system. The judge actually threatened to mute him. Now Giuliani has been given 30 days to actually appear in person in Arizona for processing and to post $10,000 bond.

That trend is already contributing to a shrinking population. And as CNN's Hanako Montgomery reports, it's prompting the government to take action.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Running toward her future, Tomomi Bitoh made the decision to freeze her eggs in an effort to achieve her goals. TOMOMI BITOH, JAPANESE MARATHON RUNNER (through translator): I have this big dream of becoming number one in the world and I want to achieve that first. I don't think that's something I can do 10 or 20 years from now after having a child. It's now or never. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): The 33-year-old Japanese marathon runner is working hard to be number one in the world's toughest marathon. Bitoh is one of a growing number of Japanese women choosing to freeze their eggs for future planning. Japan's birth rate hit an all-time low in 2023, according to the country's health ministry data released this week. In 2023, the average number of babies born fell for an eighth consecutive year and government officials warn Japan's youth population will rapidly shrink in the coming years. If the trend continues, this could lead to a shrinking workforce, with not enough young people to fill the gaps. FUMIO KISHIDA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator): If this trend continues, Japan's socio economy will contract and it will become difficult to maintain our Social Security System and our local communities. The six or seven years we have from now until we enter the 2030s will be our last chance. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Government officials have announced various programs to tackle this issue. Japan's parliament enacted a law to expand monthly child care allowances and parental leave policies. The Tokyo government offers to subsidize women aged 18 to 39 up to 200,000 yen to freeze their eggs for future pregnancies. City officials also plan to launch a dating app, encouraging singles who want to get married to find each other. Some contributing factors behind the low birth rates include the country's high cost of living, lack of childcare support and changing attitudes toward marriage and family. The country's number of marriages has declined in the past couple of years and the rate of divorce has increased. BITOH (through translator): It costs a lot of money to raise children and if there was more support for that, I think people would be more optimistic when considering raising children. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Bitoh shared her experience with egg freezing on social media, hoping more women will have access to this option. BITOH (through translator): It's reassuring to know that I have a choice and have the possibility to get pregnant when I want to. Hanako Montgomery, CNN, Tokyo. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

She said she doesn't expect an apology for the incident, which a lot of people thought was particularly malicious. And she understands that basketball is a competitive sport.
