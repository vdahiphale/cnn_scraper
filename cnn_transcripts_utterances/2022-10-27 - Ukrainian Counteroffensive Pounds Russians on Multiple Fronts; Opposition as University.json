And, obviously, the Ukrainians are saying that they want to try and take that city back as fast as possible. They think that they have the Russians essentially pinned down in that area.However, we were on the frontline just now speaking to both commanders and also sort of regular soldiers in the trenches. They told us they don't believe that the Russians are going to withdraw from that area any time soon. In fact, they believe that the Russians are bringing new forces in and fortifying their positions there. Here is what we saw. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice over):  Ukrainian forces trying to hit the Russians on all fronts. This mortar unit firing in the north of the country, while in the south, Kyiv is continuing a counteroffensive trying to capture the Russian occupied city of Kherson. We met up with an artillery unit on the battlefield. The soldiers tell us there is firing going on here pretty much every day, several times a day. The frontline is not very far from where we are at all. It is a couple of kilometers in that direction. And right now, there is not very much movement on that frontline, but, still, the situation is very dangerous. Ukraine's defense minister says, Kyiv's counteroffensive here is complicated by wet weather in the area. But the commander says he believes, in the end, they will oust the Russians.",

One of the memos I found from Bill Brennan said, it was just at the very end of negotiations that he says with exasperation, all hell broke loose. They resolved that within a couple of days of when the opinion was announced on June 28th, 1978.But to your broader question about what might be happening now behind the scenes, Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and our new first African-American justice, I'm sure, are trying to think about is there any way to save affirmative action when you have a very heavily dominated conservative court, many of whom, in many cases, the justices have already spoken out against any kind of race-based remedies, Erica.",

This meeting you talk of this afternoon, the emergency meeting established for a no confidence today by the faculty senate was called upon after the senator was in the middle of a Q&amp;A session here the last time he was on campus, and that was interrupted, essentially shut down by students who were protesting that.Now, as I've talked to students here this morning, what is clear is that at issue are a few things for them. One is the senator's stance on LGBTQ issues, as well as abortion. And they don't believe many of the students don't believe that that aligns with the communities inclusion efforts. Because take note, as you mentioned, Erica, this a senator who said that he was disappointed when the Supreme Court declared same-sex marriage legal across the country. But this is also a senator who says that he can put politics aside for this and also a senator that hasn't always towed the party line. He went against his party when he was critical of President Donald Trump. So, I want to introduce to you two takes here. We'll start with the head of the faculty senate. She is a self-declared progressive LGBTQ ally and here is how she described her interview with Senator Sasse. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think, as you said, Twitter employees are bracing for cuts because it seems like there are going to be cuts to the employee base, but they're also, I think, worried about him rolling back some of the content moderation rules that they put into place over the last few years. Twitter, like other platforms, limits the amount of hate speech that is spread on the platform, COVID misinformation, there are rules against that. And Elon has been a big critic of some of these rules.And so I think what they're worried about is people who have been banned from the platform, like the former president, might be reinstated and that he might just roll back some of these rules and it might be a haven for hate speech. Now, Elon has come out this morning actually and he's trying to reassure Twitter advertisers. I'll read to you what he said. The key line here is Twitter obviously cannot become a free for all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.
