So I wasn't able to see what was happening on the ground until I left my location at the end of all of it and saw the kind of devastation, and seeing the total destruction of property. So many houses without roofs. It was really something to behold. And then of course moving to 2004 with Hurricane Ivan, we saw asimilar picture, maybe not as much of the island was impacted then because it was mostly focused on the southern parishes, the southern side of the island, where Gilbert actually affected the entire country. But this one that we're watching, it seems to be following a kind of path that's in-between both, where it is the category, the strength of a Gilbert, but it seems as though it is going to take a path that is more along the southern side of the island as was Hurricane Ivan. So we're kind of watching it with some kind of trepidation, yes, and trying to see how much we can learn from it. But at the same time preparing our residents to recognize the various hazards that they are likely to face with the storm surge, with the heavy rain fall, with the very strong winds. And of course, the kind of landslides that likely will occur afterwards. You know, we really have to prepare ourselves for all these hazards.",

Trump was scheduled to be sentenced next week on his felony conviction for falsifying business records but it's now delayed until September 18th. It comes after Trump's legal team filed a letter seeking to challengethat conviction following the Supreme Court ruling that presidents have absolute immunity from prosecution for core official acts. The judge's announcement Tuesday underscores the far-reaching implications of the high court's ruling that could also impact other Trump indictments. Voters in the U.K. head to the polls Thursday for a momentous general election that will likely see the end of the Conservative Party's 14- year rule. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to lose. He took a major gamble by calling for early elections and has struggled to turn around dire polling. The Conservative defeat would likely usher in a center-left Labour government headed by Keir Starmer. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz reports from London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Two lackluster candidates in a race with a result that is all but certain. It may sound boring but this is a momentous election that could decimate the U.K.'s most powerful political party. In what is widely seen as a referendum on their 14 years of leadership, the Conservatives are bracing for a very damaging defeat. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called for the snap election that almost everyone believes he will lose.",

They're managed by the ex-Italy striker, Vincenzo Montella. They were crushed 6-1 by the Austrians in a friendly in March. Given the fact that Austria had stormed to their group, they finished ahead of France and the Netherlands to get to these knockout stages. Everybody believed that Turkey were there for the taking, but they struck early. They were defensively disciplined. They frustrated the Austrians throughout. And those goals, one of them were the fastest in Euros knockout history. I think that's what really did knock the stuffing out of the Austrians. And then you've got the other players in that Turkey side that worked so strongly without their captain, Calhanoglu, but they did have their playmaker, Arda Guler. He's only 19 years of age, but he is a potential star of the future, showed so much skill, promise and maturity tonight. And then you got right at the end, that world class save from the keeper, Mert Gudok, and that show of character that will have the Dutch needing to bring their A game on Saturday night. That save, you know, reminiscent of Gordon Banks in the 1970 World Cup, an absolutely outstanding piece of agility from the Austrian, Christoph Baumgartner, who was convinced he had scored. He'd grabbed an equalizer to take the game to extra time. Instead, as you can see on the other side of the screen, he was left with his head in his hands and the Turks were celebrating.
