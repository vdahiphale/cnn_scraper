So, Nigeria's main opposition parties are calling for a fresh election before the ballots are even counted. They're saying that Saturday's presidential vote was \"Irretrievably compromise.\" Now, these concerns come as Nigerian people complain of intimidation, violence, and voter suppression. Here's some of their reporting from our Larry Madowo who's on the ground in Nigeria. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  The Nigerian army rolled into a neighborhood in Lagos. Where voters at two polling units spent all of election day waiting to cast their ballots but poll officials did not show up. They returned the next day and waited several more hours. Growing impatient as the chance to vote slowly slipped away.",

Now, officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission say, they're tallying theresults of all of these polling stations and these areas, and they say that they've counted them including those missing polling units. They're saying, it is constitutional, and that there was violence of the polling stations. CNN, in fact, saw no signs of violence at the units where workers didn't show up. Now, so for, the official count says the ruling party candidate, Bola Tinubu, actually leads right now nationally. But a shocking result saw him lose in Lagos to outsider candidate Peter Obi. Now, this rollercoaster of an election is Africa's largest democracy member (ph). And, of course, its largest economy as well. It will, you can bet on it, have an impact beyond the country's borders. So, we want to get a feel for what's going on at this hour in Nigeria with Bolanle Olukanni. She is a popular television broadcaster and filmmaker and she joins us now from Lagos. Thank you so much for joining us on what we can see has been a tumultuous couple of days in Nigeria. You know, what were you hoping from this election? And what do you think Nigerians ended up with here? We saw a glimpse, really, there of the chaos, of the confusion, and the fact that things are still so tense.",

The numbers that they're telling us of people that came out to vote, it doesn't correlate with what really happened. A lot of people were disenfranchised. They were not able to vote because there were thugs that were sponsored to come and disrupt the polling units. We saw videos of people, thugs, coming to polling units and the police officers did absolutely nothing. They did nothing. So, to us we're kind of asking ourselves, like, why are we not being allowed to vote? What is the reason? What are people so afraid of that's going to come out if Nigerians choose to say, OK, this is who I want to cast my vote for. At the end of the day, Nigeria is at the breaking point. And I think for every single Nigerian, especially young people, the voting population of the people who are registered is about 59 percent are youth. And those people came out to vote, you know, they came out to vote. The numbers are not correlating with what they said. Not only that, this afternoon, we actually had PDP, which is one of the opposition parties, and they're not -- they didn't even win Lagos. They specifically said that the number that INEC presented does not correlated with what -- with the amount people that came. They have different numbers. Because what they -- what we -- what you guys need to understand is that at the end of the day, all the parties, they make sure that they were doing their own counts.

This election is clearly falling short so far and yet you know that the Nigeria's Electoral Commission has already said, no way. We're not doing a redo here.

In situations where there is a cancellation. If the amount of votes that were canceled there could possibly affect the final results there's supposed to be a rerun. A lot of the polling units, the amount of votes that were cancelled is going to affect a final result. So, what is really interesting is to see how we're supposed to in a democracy. They're the ones that pass the election. They're the ones that drafted the electoral act. But yet, they seem to not be a hearing to it. Just for the effect of the results have not been transmitted and up to now they're still choosing not to, that alone in itself questionable. And it shows that INEC is not only being -- they've been compromised. They're also not being transparent. And they have not conducted a free and fair election.

That's the issue -- is that can you -- INEC explain that. So, I -- we're finding that the chairman is not communicating with us. You know, I think a lot of times, when you think about the institutions of Nigeria, they're so used to just carrying on and doing whatever they want without accountability. But Nigerians have finally woken up now to the point where we're saying, no. You must be accountable to us. We're a democracy. If you ask us to come out and vote, we cast our vote, we expect a result to reflect who we voted for. Not who you've been paid to say it's going to win. So, there has to be accountability. If not, the INEC chairman needs to go ahead and step down and resign. If he's unable to do his duties based on what he's supposed to. It says independent -- it's Independent Electoral Commission.

It's not -- we're not going back no matter what happens. In terms of, you know, the potential of having Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the president, I think a lot of Nigerian youth are worried about his health. We're worried about his ability to be able to rule Nigeria. We've been ruled by so many people who are much older and they don't seem to be willing to accept or understand what it is that we need. But even more important, what we're looking for is a competent leader. Nigeria is at its breaking point. The amount of people that have exodus and left this country because it feels like it's unlivable. Everyone has said it. We don't have good rules, we don't have good light, we don't have health care, we don't have education. Last year, the average Nigeria youth spent eight months at home because our schools were on strike, and it didn't seem like a government was -- had any interest. So, when we're saying we need a mindset of someone that's young, someone that's agile, someone that is going to listen to the Nigerian people. That is what we need. We need people who are accountable. And a lot of times, when you look at the past leaders or the people that are running, they don't seem accountable. Which is why a lot of Nigerian youth, we have chosen and we're saying, you know what? This Peter Obi looks like someone that's listening to us, and we want to make sure that we are heard.",

The difference between China and Russia is that China has a major economy, and Russia has an economy, and pretty sophisticated economy. Russia has an economy based on raw materials and substitutes militarism for what it lacks on the economic side. China is a much more complex threat, I would say, Paula. And of course, China is watching closely what happens in Ukraine and how, to what degree, the west resists Putin. Because there's the question of Taiwan right there on the table. Xi Jinping has menaced Taiwan in various ways. And of course, believes, like every Chinese leader, that the island must be reunited with the Mainland. We've seen what China did in Hong Kong, crushing the independents, whatever independents, and whatever elements of democracy Hong Kong had. So, I do think that the threat from China is very present. And you know, we handed a lot of technology to China. We handed an awful lot to China without really -- now we're trying to wean ourselves from transferring production to places like India.

We sometimes --sometimes it can actually shake a hard one piece. Our case in point this time in Northern Ireland where the fate of its devolved government in storm out is tied to the success of the Good Friday Peace Agreement. And it's an accord that has held now, thankfully, for almost a quarter century. But Brexit has made a fragile situation even more delicate. Over the past year, Stormont, in fact has not been functioning. Now, the new trade deal between the U.K. and the E.U. is hoping to create at least some modicum of stability. And today, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in Belfast, right now, to sell that deal. And joining me on all of this is Anand Menon, he is a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King's College London and director of U.K. in a Changing Europe. And changing it is. We want to get this deal first and foremost, why was it necessary and could it be consequential for Rishi Sunak? It needs to be consequential for him in fact. ANAND MENON, PROFESSOR OF EUROPEAN AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS, KING'S COLLEGE LONDON AND DIRECTOR, UK IN A CHANGING EUROPE:  Well, it was necessary because the original deal that Boris Johnson negotiated in 2019 had failed to satisfy the U.K., who basically didn't implement it and therefore failed to satisfy the E.U. who were getting increasingly annoyed with the U.K. for failing to implement it. So, there was a standoff between the two sides. And this new deal, which is basically an amendment to the old deal, it's not a new treaty, has been a way of try to operationalize what was agreed to in 2019 to the satisfaction of both sides, and it seems to have done so. And yes, it can be very consequential, consequential for the people of Northern Ireland, first and foremost. They might get their executive back. We can talk about that further. It will be easier for consumers in Northern Ireland to buy goods from Great Britain. Easier for traders in Great Britain to trade with Northern Ireland. And I think this moment marks a reset moment in the U.K.'s relationship with its European partners as well. So, there's an awful lot going on tied up with this agreement.",

And I described him as exuberantly playful. He was the kind of guy who -- the story I tell is he was skipping around our little dining room there. He was a big guy, probably about six-three, six-four. And he is skipping around, you know, just being his joyous self, and he tries to slip through -- skip through a doorway and he slams his head on the top of the door frame and he lands flat on his back, and we all cracked up. He cracks up. And that to me is him. And as he aged, he got probably a little more serious. He did well in school. Became -- when he joined the navy, he became an eye surgeon. And he was -- my wife had a phrase about him that I put in the piece, which is, he was extraordinary and ordinary at the same time. And she meant that as a high compliment, which is to say he was masculine the way you are supposed to be masculine, just understated and gentle. A father the way you are supposed to be a father, filled with just playfulness and joy and pride in his sons. And he always said, he was the luckiest man in his marriage because he -- the person the whole world he wanted to talk to when he got home at night was going to be sitting there right across from him at the dining room table.

And I think -- just walk with them and be there at the other end. And I think that -- I've learned a lot from that, that you don't want to ask why. I'm not sure -- you know, Pete had theories, but I'm not sure there really is a why. And I think -- I just -- you know, in my own little way I learned a lot about the disease during those three years. And the first thing I've learned was that don't think you can understand it by extrapolating from your own periods of sadness if you have never suffered your own depression. It's not an extension of sadness. It's an altered state of consciousness. And I learned that, you know, don't try to fix the other person. Early on, in those three years, when we were talking by phone, mostly during COVID, I would say, you know, you used to love going to Vietnam and doing surgery and, you know, curing people. Do that. Go do that. And that was my suggestions. And I've since learned that if you try to give people suggestions on how to get out of it, really, you're just telling them you just don't get it. You just don't understand what they are going through. It's not the ideas about what to do, it's the motivational desire, it's the -- just the loss of all pleasure. Second thing I would do is like say, you got to create -- you know, just -- you know, we just said, you got it all. You're a successful and very accomplished surgeon. You've got wonderful kids, a wonderful marriage. Think how good your life is. And I've learned that's also not the right thing to say because if you tell people, they should be enjoying, they feel bad about not enjoying the things that are palpably enjoyable. And so, I learned that's just not how to do it. And now, just finally, the one thing I think I helped, the one nicest thing I did that Pete found some solace in, I sent him a video, which I recommend to viewers, which is -- was a sermon given by my news -- our colleague, Michael Gerson, who had suffered from depression. And he gave a sermon about it at the National Cathedral and some online, on YouTube. And he said, depression is a malfunction in the apparatus we used to perceive reality. And that is the person who is suffering depression isn't seeing reality, frankly, the way they should. And Mike said he had these obsessive-compulsive voices in his head lying to him, that you are not worth anything. No one will miss you. And I think when I sent Pete that video, that one thing Pete said, yes, that is what it's like. And so, I really got an appreciation for the magnitude of the disease.",

And I think Pete -- I don't think he ever told me this, but I think in his final days Pete persuaded himself that he was doing a favor for his family. He was relieving them of the burden. Maybe your friend had the same thoughts. And all I can tell you, if anybody has ever had that thought go through their mind, having lived through the wreckage of what happened, I can tell you that that thought is completely wrong. But, you know, we -- so, I think we have learned to try to overcome that thought, that you just made a big mistake because the machine with which they made the mistake was severely malfunctioning. And the other thing, I would say, two other quick things, Hari. The first thing is I've learned I feel I should've done other things differently. I should have sent him more postcards, just little text saying, you know, I'm thinking about you. You don't need to reply. I should have done that. And so, I feel regret about that. But I don't think there's anything any of us could have done to alter what happened.

First on the individual level, with my friend or your friend, there is no great trend that explains it. It was particular to that person. But I think society, on a societal level, I do think we can point to some trends. I mean, for the shocking numbers with teenage girls, the number one answer is social media. Their social participation is at its highest. And I do think it's -- and if you look at the trends in when it really turned and spiked, it's right around 2012 and 2013, and that's the smartphone. That is when the smartphone happened. And so, social media plays just a gigantic role. It doesn't, I don't think, play a role for -- a lot of the other people who are suffering from depression, suicide, or even the deaths of despair where, you know, older men presumably. And there, I would point to two things. One, the loss of community. The bowling alone. The idea that we people used to be ensconced and enshrouded in this web of thick relationships, an oaks (ph) club, a bowling league, at a church or a synagogue, or a mosque. And just a lot of people are not enshrouded in those webs or rich relationships the way they used to. And then, the second, and this would be a little more controversial, but it's my theory, which is that for many centuries in our different cultures and our different religions and our different civilizations, we taught each other how to be considerate to each other in the daily rituals of life. There was a great cause of what you would call moral formation, trying to teach us how to be kind, just like how to do hard social skills, how to have a hard conversation, how to disagree with respect, how to ask for forgiveness, how to sit through someone who is suffering and have a good conversation. And for some reason, in our culture, we don't teach those skills. And I feel we have just dropped the ball in teaching the elemental social skills of tending to each other.",

And so, those three losses were, for me, an introduction into grief of once friends. And it really is -- and when -- you know, I've learned that when you suffer a grief, it basically upsets all the mental models of reality that you have in you. What one expert called your assumptive world, the assumptions you make about reality. And those models are all destroyed and you have to go through a process to make a new set of models. You have a new set of assumptions about the world and what it's like. And that's just a process of grief that's unconscious, that goes, has its own pace, that's filled with repetitions and painful memories and happy memories and it's unpredictable.
