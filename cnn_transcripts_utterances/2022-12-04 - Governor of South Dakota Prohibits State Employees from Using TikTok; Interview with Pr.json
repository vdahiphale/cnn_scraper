That is the major issue that Congress is trying to tackle during this lame duck session, that period of time after the midterms and the next Congress.Right now, government funding is set to expire on December 16, but Republicans and Democrats can't seem to reach a deal on funding the government. Now, something that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told me last week is that there might be a continuing resolution or funding of the same levels for the government next year. But unless they can reach that deal, pass that bill, the government could shut down on December 16. So they're racing against the clock on that. Another thing, the National Defense Authorization Act, which is an annual must pass bill that sets the policy agenda and authorizes funding for the Department of Defense. They need to pass that as soon as possible before the next Congress, in January as well. Also, not clear when the nation is going to run up against the debt limit. They, of course, Democrats were hoping to address that, reach a bipartisan agreement with Republicans on the debt limit, raising that debt limit, but it doesn't seem they're going to tackle that this Congress. They might wait until there's, of course, a majority for Republicans in the House. Possible House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is going to become his issue. So we are seeing that. And I didn't even mention, we are going to see the House take up that bill, that same sex vote that would protect same sex marriage in the United States. The Senate already passed it last week. The House is expected to pass it on Tuesday, and then it will go to President Joe Biden's desk for signature. So still a lot of agenda items that they still have not been able to complete.

They had an early chance. But the difference between these two sides was that the Dutch were absolutely clinical. When they got their opportunities, they took them. That was Memphis. Then David Blynn (ph) made it two nil right on the stroke of half time. Americans actually had more of the ball. They had an equal amount of chances pretty much to the Netherlands, but they couldn't take them. Except for this moment when Haji Wright brought it back to 2-1 15 minutes from the end. Still don't know how he got the ball into the back of the net, by the way. But within five minutes, it was all over. Denzel Dumfries who'd made two of the goals for the Dutch, he then got one for himself. And this was the difference between the two sides. The USA had their chances. They couldn't take them. They knew coming into this tournament that they didn't have an out and out striker. They knew they would struggle for goals and so it transpired. But, you know, it's not done. They always regarded this tournament as kind of a stepping stone for 2026, when they're going to be co-hosting with Mexico and Canada. And, you know, this was one of the youngest teams in the tournament. 25 to 26 players had never even played in the World Cup tournament before. So the experience they got here was invaluable.

According to the study, U.S. coastlines could rise as much as a foot by the year 2050. That's 20-some years away only. Joining me now to discuss is one of the authors of the study, Ben Hamlington. He is the lead scientist of NASA's Sea Level Change Team.Ben, good morning to you. I know it's quite early there in California. Thank you so much for waking up. So, first off, tell us a little bit more about the kind of data that NASA gathered to be able to predict that sea levels will rise this much. BEN HAMLINGTON, LEAD SCIENTIST NASA/JPL SEA LEVEL CHANGE TEAM AND CO- AUTHOR, STUDY OF U.S. COASTLINE 2050 RISING SEA LEVEL CHANGE:  Yes. So, we were actually able to measure the height of the ocean from space. So, we have something called satellite altimeters and we can measure the height of the ocean from space really accurately down to about a one-inch level. It's pretty impressive. So, from this data we know that sea levels on the coastline of the U.S. have been -- has been rising. And I think, more importantly than that, it's been increasing. The speed has been increasing. So, it's kind of like we've had the foot on the accelerator. And then what this means is that we're really tracking some of those higher end model projections in the near term and we're likely to see, as you said, a foot of additional sea level rise along the U.S. coastlines between and, say, 2050. And potentially more than that in locations along, say, the southeast and Gulf Coast.",

So, think of it as you're holding a glass of water, we're filling that really close to the top. And as it starts to slosh around, that water spills over. And that means different things in different locations along the U.S. coastline.So, if we look at the east coast to the U.S. where you have high tides that kind of change throughout the year, the high tides are going to cause flooding more frequently and that flooding is going to be more severe. Along the Gulf Coast and, say, the coast of Florida, the storms that we see are going to travel over higher sea levels. So, storm surge, those impacts are going to be that much worse in the future. Here in California where coastal erosion is a big problem, so there's waves that sit on top of that sea level are going to go that much further into the land and cause that many more severe impacts and damage. So, it's really just a lot of these different impacts that are going to pile up along the coast.

And there's a lot of energy into learning how to live with these impacts. So, a lot of efforts to adapt.Planning in the United States along the coastlines is really significant and people are doing great work there. Building things like sea walls -- I'm talking about building things like sea walls, beach replenishment, trying to add sand to our beaches to maintain those coastlines. So, a lot of work is already under way. It will continue to ramp up. And there's just a lot of energy there.

We also have a lot of heavy rainfall across portions of Arizona and New Mexico, too. Especially between than Phoenix to Tucson area.But farther north where you've got that cold air in place, in the higher elevations, you've got winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings in place because of the sheer amount of snow.

So, especially in the sierras where it's got lots of time to dump that snow, now you're talking not just being measure in inches but feet. It is not out of the question for some of those areas especially around Mammoth Mountain up towards Mount Shasta to pick up two, even three feet of snow. A little bit more interior about the intermountain west, maybe even over towards the Rockies about one to two feet is likely. Now, here's the thing, we talked about this other system in the southwest.
