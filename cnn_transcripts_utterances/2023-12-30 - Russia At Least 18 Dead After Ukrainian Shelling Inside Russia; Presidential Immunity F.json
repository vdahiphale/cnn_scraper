This comes just a day after Russia's biggest air attack on Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, resulting in more than three dozen deaths. CNN's international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is tracking all the latest developments for us. He joins us now from London. Nic, we're now hearing Russian missile were launched from Belgorod into Ukraine. What more do you know?",

Putin dispatched his health minister and an emergency ministry team. Three months out from his upcoming election, the chaos dents his carefully-created image of a war going well. It's unclear if this was Ukrainian revenge, and Ukrainian officials don't routinely comment about this type of attack, but the up tempo does seem to speak to frustrations, fears even, and a determination in Ukraine that absent the financial support that they need from their allies, they can still land blows and thwart Putin's aggression. Russia's U.N. spokesperson called for an emergency U.N. Security Council session to censure Ukraine much as Russia was the previous night for their massive air assault. Russia's defense ministry says the attack will not go unpunished. By late Saturday, Russia attacked Ukraine in Kharkiv, with drones. More deaths can be expected.",

What Ukraine is worried about right now, and Ukrainian's foreign minister just gave an interview to \"The Kyiv Independent\" about this, is that western munitions factories haven't laid on new supply lines to churn out enough to keep Ukraine's war effort going, while Russia has stepped up its internal manufacturing and has also outsourced a number of those drones for instance that were used in the December 29th attack across Ukraine, were manufactured in Iran.",

But I think what we're also watching here is Putin being as and acting as insidiously and divisively as he always does. Just take one tiny element of today, the claim about using cluster munitions. They blame that on the Czechs for providing those cluster munitions. To me, this smacks of Putin trying to divide the European Union. We know that the Slovaks have just had an election, they just voted in a right-wing Nationalist government that tends to be more pro-Putin than their surrounding neighbors. We know that Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister is much more pro-Putin than most other leaders in Europe. Putin plays on these divisions, and it seems today he's trying to play on these divisions between the old, you know, former single country, Czechoslovakia, the Czechs and the Slovaks. And Putin does this. So, all the machinations, whether it's in the E.U. about giving Ukraine the money that they wanted to give them, whether it's the United States, the political machinations there, Putin takes advantage. Today is not just about sending missiles. It is about the time that everyone gets to argue about it, but dividing his enemy, which is, his enemy is Europe, European countries, and it's at it today, the little fewer every day, every time.",

They have seen him inside a courtroom before and it's not a pretty sight.But I think at the end of the day, even if he is not inside a courtroom, Paula, I think it is degrading and it does hurt Trump going into the 2024 election. Perhaps not the GOP primary, we have seen that almost nothing hurts him there, and that every single thing that goes against him helps him in the GOP primary. But in the general election, it's a completely different story. We already saw that the general public has rejected the MAGA agenda in 2018, they rejected Trump himself in 2020, they don't want the chaos, they don't want the indecency/ And he has since even become much more chaotic in terms of what he would do. And the reminder, every single time that something happens in the legal aspect of what he's going through reminds voters, independent voters, women voters, those decent voters that don't want to go through another four years of trauma to their emotional well-being and their mental well-being, understand that this is not somebody who is fit to have office anymore, especially the highest office in the land, especially when he has already been convicted and has been in trouble in court and, frankly, somebody who has tried to overturn a fair and free election and destroy our American democracy.",

Of course they do not show the qualifications that somebody should show to be eligible to run for that highest office in the land.So, I'm glad that he's being kicked off of the ballot in all of these states. Will it make a difference? Probably not because at the end of the day, those states where currently he has been kicked off and we'll see whether that sticks, whether it goes to the Supreme Court and what they do are states that normally have been won by the Democrats. So, I don't think at the end of the day it will make a difference in terms of the electoral votes. He will absolutely use it to underscore his martyrdom, but he will use anything, Paula, to underscore the martyrdom. And we cannot forget, regardless of whether we think that this could be a political issue that he uses to his advantage, no one is above the law, Paula. No one, even a former president of the United States. This goes to Jack Smith's claim about presidential immunity. It doesn't matter the political implications here. No one is above the law.

And that is one of the reasons that President Biden dispatched this high-level delegation, a cabinet-level delegation to Mexico City this week, to talk to the Mexican president, Lopez Obrador, about these issues. They did enter those talks with some pretty specific asks and goals. One of them is to convince the Mexican government to move some of these migrants, who are along the U.S. southern border, south in an effort to decongest some of the areas there. They would also like Mexico to get better control of the railways. These are the lines that migrants take from South and Central America up to the U.S. border. And then they are wanting to talk about some incentives, like visas that would help convince some of these migrants to stay in Mexico instead of coming to the United States. Now, emerging from these meetings, officials were relatively pleased. They did say they feel like they had a good partner in the Mexican president, Lopez Obrador. They did set this secondary meeting, a follow-up meeting to take place in Washington next month. And what American officials said is that Mexico agreed to continue ramping up its enforcement measures. And also to crack down on smugglers, which is part of what's fueling the crisis at the U.S. southern border. So you really do see the administration trying to pull every lever that it can to get a handle on this issue. And certainly, this is the diplomatic front. You see them working in Congress. And this is where the immigration issue intersects with all of President Biden's, at least many of President Biden's other priorities. You have these ongoing negotiations between Democrats and Republicans on toughening up some of the rules along the border. And that's in conjunction with approving new aid for Ukraine and new aid for Israel. And it is sort of the confluence of all of these crises that the president is dealing with. The president said he's willing to make significant concessions when it comes to things like toughening up asylum rules, when it comes to things like making deportations easier. But he is caught in a political bind here. Certainly, he's under pressure from Republicans and even some Democrats, mayors and governors, who want him to do more to confront this crisis. But on the other side, you have progresses, immigration advocates, who are concerned that some of the rules that are being talked about in Congress could amount to a reversion of some of the most restrictive policies we saw under President Trump.

So, we need to get some resources. We need to get some aid for them. And this is a global problem, not only a U.S. problem.",
