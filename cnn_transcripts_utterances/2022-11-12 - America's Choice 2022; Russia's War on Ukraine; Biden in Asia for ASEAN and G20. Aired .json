And one more win for Democrats either in Nevada or Georgia's runoff could give them control of the upper chamber.Democrats continue to pick up House seats but there the math is against them. Republicans only need seven more seats to control the House, which they are widely expected to do. CNN's Gary Tuchman is in Las Vegas with the latest on the Nevada race. But we begin with Kyung Lah in Phoenix. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR U.S. CORRESPONDENT:  The vote count here in Maricopa County is still continuing. But CNN is now projecting that senator Mark Kelly, the Democratic incumbent, will defeat a challenge from Republican Blake Masters. The vote count here is 82 percent complete, as workers, here you can see, are still going through the ballots. About 265,000 to 275,000 votes still remain to be counted. The Masters campaign had hoped that this latest vote result would be the turnaround, clearing a path, a possible path to victory, where he could catch up and overtake the Democratic senator. That simply did not materialize. Senator Kelly released a statement after multiple news organizations projected that he would indeed win, saying, quote, \"I'm humbled by the trust our state has placed in me to continue this work.\" And we're also getting reaction from Republicans here in the state of Arizona. The party here increasingly has seen a divide between the moderate McCain Republicans and the Trump wing. Republican analyst and operative Barrett Marson tweeted, quote, \"Arizona is a conservative state but not a Trump state and voters keep telling us that.\" -- Kyung Lah, CNN, Phoenix.

What that means is some people don't put their signature on the ballot. As long as they put their signature on the ballot, it then gets counted. So that's a total of 38,000 more ballots. So there's still a lot of counting to do in this race that's really tight -- this is Gary Tuchman, CNN, in Las Vegas. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And that will become the defining political race for the next two years. So I think between now and Tuesday there will be a lot of nervous people on both sides of the aisle. But if Democrats prevail, it means that Democrats will keep the Senate. Republicans are likely to take over the House.

And Donald Trump responded by potentially announcing his run as early as Tuesday. And when that happens, all Republicans will be forced to choose sides. And all the fence sitting will end. And already we have Elise Stefanik, the leadership member from New York, declaring she is in favor of Donald Trump even before he announced. And that puts a lot of Republicans in an uncomfortable position, especially Kevin McCarthy from California. And he has got two bad options and he has to choose one of them. He will have to pick a side, probably before he runs for speaker. So what we'll see is a civil war inside the Republican Party. And it seems inevitable now -- and both can't win.

There are many in the Republican Party who want to continue the military aid but cut the economic aid. And talking to Ukrainian officials, they tell me that that would be disastrous because if the Ukrainian economy collapses, the military won't be able to fight. So the internal dynamics inside the Republican Party could have an outside effect on the Ukrainians' ability to prevail in their struggle against the Russian invasion. There are many Republicans who are internally arguing that we must continue to support Ukraine, especially as winter comes and they gear up for another fighting season next spring and summer.

Hours earlier, Moscow announced it had pulled out from the west bank of the Dnipro River, conceding 40 percent of the Kherson region to Ukrainians, including the city itself. Ukrainian troops also swept through other towns in the area, holding up their flag to mark the end of Russia's occupation. And they displayed ammunition and other military gear that Russians left behind. That contradicts Russia's claim that they took all their equipment with them. And Ukraine also says Russian troops destroyed critical infrastructure on their way out, including bridges like this one on a dam northeast of Kherson. President Zelenskyy said Ukrainians persevered because they always knew the Russians would be driven out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The people of Kherson waited. They never repudiated Ukraine. They were right to pin their hopes on Ukraine.

I want to thank the prime minister for his leadership in the ASEAN chair and for hosting all of us. And also I want to recognize that we're going to be on all the work that Indonesia has done this year. Mr. President, thank you very much, as the country coordinator for the United States. And in fact, this is, as I said, my third trip, my third summit, second in person. And it is a testament to the importance the United States places on the relationship with ASEAN and our commitment to ASEAN's neutrality. ASEAN is the heart of my administration's Indo-Pacific strategy. And we continue to strengthen our commitment to work in lockstep with an empowered, unified ASEAN. Today, we take another critical step, beginning a new era in our cooperation with the launch of the U.S.- ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership. Together we'll tackle the biggest issues of our time, from climate to health security, defend against the significant threats of rule based order and to threats to the rule of law. And to build an Indo-Pacific that is free and open, stable and prosperous, resilient and secure. And we're putting real resources behind our approach, not just rhetoric. Over the last year, my administration has announced more than $250 million in new initiatives with ASEAN. And for 2023, I requested $850 million in assistance for Southeast Asia. We're continuing to build on that progress following through on our commitments and launching concrete, new initiatives that further strengthen ASEAN and increase connectivity across Southeast Asia. Through our new U.S.-ASEAN electric vehicle infrastructure initiative, we'll work together to develop an integrated electric vehicle ecosystem in Southeast Asia, enabling the region to pursue clean energy economic development and ambitious emissions reductions targets. Similarly, we're launching a U.S.-ASEAN platform for infrastructure and connectivity to bring the benefits of the partnership for global infrastructure and investment to the ASEAN countries. Through this platform, we'll develop projects together based on a need you identify to create sustainable, high standard infrastructure that supports the people of the region. We'll build a better future we all say we want to see -- and we're going to see -- for all 1 billion people in our countries. We'll also discuss Russia's brutal war against Ukraine and our efforts to address the war's global impacts, including in southeast Asia. So I look forward to continuing our work together with the ASEAN and with each one of you to deepen peace and prosperity throughout the region, to resolve challenges from the South China Sea to Myanmar and to find innovative new solutions to shared challenges.

If they can claim that contest, they would have 50 seats, enough to control the Senate, since the Democratic vice president holds the tie breaking vote. And meantime in the House, Democrats have also picked up a few more seats but Republicans only need seven more to control that chamber. And Kevin McCarthy is facing hurdles. If his party takes the House with a slim majority, he may not have enough votes to secure the job, because hardliners are withholding their support until some of their demands are met. Some say that he will need to adopt far right policies of former president Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "The chaos continues. Elon Musk has now owned Twitter for two weeks and the company's future has never seemed so in doubt. In recent days, Twitter has seen an exodus of top level executives, alienated powerful  advertisers, blown up key aspects of its product and it has launched and then unlaunched other features designed to compensate for those choices repeatedly.Also in the early days, Twitter has battled a wave of fake, verified accounts posing as Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, LeBron James, Nintendo and others. Impostors have even forced Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company, to apologize for misinformation spread under parody accounts it didn't create. In response, Twitter has temporarily stopped taking assignments for Twitter Blue, the new paid subscription service it launched just days ago, offering a verified blue check mark to anyone who pays $8 a month, no questions asked. According to multiple reports Musk has canceled the company's remote work policy and even warned the company could potentially face bankruptcy. That's not all. According to legal experts, Twitter's layoffs and resignations have jeopardized its ability to comply with government regulations that protect the security and privacy of user data. Violations could lead to hefty fines and even personal liability for Musk that would tie his hands at Twitter and wherever he may go next -- Brian Fung, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
