So, when they do and then they have one of these systems go bad, right now they're trying to tighten up that security, so they'll say, \"Well, we have this bad piece of information,\" so they shut down the entire system for it as opposed to what they used to do, which is when they have that bad information, they would just put him notice out, a NOTAM itself, it says \"We don't have information that the flight service,\" or \"We don't have information from these other areas.\" So, I think and honestly, I believe that it was an upgrade that they were trying to do, to make things better and saved her.

According to an estimate in July from the British think tank, RUSI, at the height of the fighting in that Donbas, Russia was burning through ammunition in two days than the British military has in stock.  The impact of that is clearly showing up in the Russian budget. Now, this was the official estimate for last year.  Defense spending was expected to have grown by about 30% compared to 2021.  National security spending, meanwhile, by about 20%.  But oil and gas revenues were expected to grow by about a third. They ended up coming in higher than expected according to the finance ministry, but so did spending. Tipping it into a higher deficit. Now this year, we are looking at more defense spending, a rise of about 6%, that's roughly in line with inflation but add to that a 58% planned increase in national security spending, and a complete reversal of last year's oil and gas windfall, and this means budget cuts. Roads, agriculture, even health care all getting hit. ELINA RIBAKOVA, DEPUTY CHIEF ECONOMIST, INSTITUTE OF INTL. FINANCE: The money is not infinite unlike what President Putin says.  And I think he understands this better than anybody else.  Because these authorities were in power already in the 90s when Russia went through severe crises before denomination, devaluation.  And I think they remember that.  If that were to happen, it will be even faster way for them out of the office. SEBASTIAN:  Keeping Putin in power and fighting a war is expensive.

Sources tell CNN Mr. Biden's lawyers were searching for additional documents after they found an initial set of 10 classified documents in his former private office in November. It's not clear where they found the second set, how many documents it contains or what is in them.  The documents were from Mr. Biden's time serving as Vice President to Barack Obama.  Republicans are pouncing on the issue, claiming there is a double standard for how the government treats politicians. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEVIN MCCARTHY, U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER:  This is a man that's been in office for more than 40 years.  This is a man who prides himself on knowing all than this.  Why does he treat people different?  This is the exact reason why we have to have a church committee.  This is why we moved it yesterday and this is why we will get to the bottom of it because they treat people differently based upon their philosophical or political party. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
