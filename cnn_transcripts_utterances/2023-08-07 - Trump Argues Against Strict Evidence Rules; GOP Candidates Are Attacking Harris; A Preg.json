We don't want you to give copies to your client. If you do, you're to redact specific information to protect witnesses.

What's my point? My point is that you can't just get away with plotting schemes about fake electors, about telling the vice president of the United States to halt this and reverse the process, about getting involved in making phone calls that tell people to find votes. It's not aspirational. Those are actions that lead to, right, significant crimes.And so, whether it is a crime will be a jury's determination.

Not from him, not from any of the attorneys, not from anybody in that courtroom.It will be an interesting thing to see because, of course, in a normal trial, the judge would not hesitate to impose a contempt order on somebody who didn't obey. It'll be interesting to see what happens here. But truly, I believe that if the judge maintains control in the courtroom, Donald Trump is going to have to learn that he simply cannot act like that. As you know, in the Chauvin trial, partly because of COVID, one of the ways that our presiding judge, Cahill, dealt with this was by having very strict restrictions on where people could physically be in the courtroom. They were behind plexiglass. They had to stand behind a podium. You know, posturing, running around wasn't permitted.

When you look now, she is the sitting vice president. One, vice presidents don't set the agenda. They are loyal to their boss, the president. And so, I commend her in doing that. But two, when you do actually look at the issues that she has worked on, whether it's reproductive health, whether it is most recently announcing lowering the cost of child care, whether it is the historic trip she took to Africa with billions of dollars and investment into that country, that is nothing to just roll your eyes out and say she's unprepared. They are taking that attack because she would be the first. They see it has worked before when you attack people's race and gender, and they hope that it feeds the base.

Things like a very high staff turnover in all her positions, that is a legitimate concern. Now, the Biden team is putting her front forward in this campaign, apparently, and really in issues that resonate with the base. The problem is moderate swing voters, independent voters, she's underwater compared to the president. And so, it's not a surprise to see Republicans going after her because it is a proxy.
