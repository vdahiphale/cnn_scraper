What a difference, a week makes from raging wildfires to torrential rain. Epic flooding now sweeping through large parts of Greece.Concerns that Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un could soon meet face to face to discuss a possible weapons deal. Plus, the video that ISIS did not know was being recorded in Syria. The horrors it reveals and why it will likely the prosecutions around the world. And we do begin in Greece which has been hit by yet another extreme weather events. This time, torrential rains and deadly flooding have swept the country over the past few days. The flooding has washed away cars, damaged buildings, and forced evacuations from homes and at least one hospital. The storm named Daniel is blamed for at least one death. A man who was crushed by a collapsing wall. All of this comes just as crews have finally managed to contain hundreds of raging wildfires, which have devastated parts of the country for weeks now. Daniel has led to red storm warnings across several provinces, especially along the eastern coast. One Greek official calls this the most extreme rainfall within 24 hours since record keeping began in that country. CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers shows us where the storm is headed next.",

It is very heavy here just now to the northeast of the low. This is in the Mediterranean, and then that's bringing up all of that very warm humidity, all that very warm water just to the south of Greece and pushing it right up into the same areas that have seen so much rainfall just over the past 24 to 48 hours.So here for me to alarm, level three of three for the rainfall possibilities here. And yes, we're still seeing the pictures coming out of here out of Greece. But I know that some of these pictures are old, and they will be updated. But they can't get them out of there right now because there's just very little communication coming out of this area, especially video. Some of them online are quite disturbing and the rainfall is actually continuing. (INAUDIBLE) 528 millimeters of rain since this rain has started. And it's in the same place that it's going to rain more tonight and into tomorrow. This could not even be a 24-to-48-hour event already. And we could still have another 24 hours to go as the continuous rotation of the low pressure pushes that rainfall over the same areas of Greece that I've seen so much rainfall already.",

You've been documenting this for us for years really now. But obviously it's been so pronounced in the last few months in the last few hours. I mean, Bill, just look at Greece, right? First, it just sums it up first. We had these ferocious fires that just whipped through neighborhoods and countryside and then split screen to the epic flooding just a few days later.

It's sort of those fuels are just entrenched in our lives deeply, right?And so, the question is, how long does that social license last? How bad does it have to get before the C suites of these influential, big polluters change their ways. But in the United States, for example, a Pew poll recently said just over half of Americans think that climate change is a threat to the country. But it's so partisan, it's -- 76 percent of Democrats -- 23 percent of Republicans. So, denial is still a plank in the major party's platform in the Western world.

It shows that some tensions that the West is imposed upon Russia are actually biting that they can't produce their own, you know, their own throne material that they need for the war. On the North Korean side though, I mean, this is an advantage for them, because, you know, every dictator wants to be taken seriously on the world stage.

I mean, the more weapons that North Korea gets, especially if it's weapons of mass destruction and the capability to deliver them, that's certainly a threat to geopolitical stability.But the problem is, is that Russia doesn't have that much that he can part with if it wants to be successful in Ukraine. Both sides are lacking. Both the North Koreans and the Russians are lacking high-tech stuff. Things that power missiles, that power rockets, to power submarines. And the Russians under sanctions don't have a whole lot of that either. So, they're not going to be able to -- I don't think provide too much that North Koreans. They can help them with things like food, which North Korea always needs because of the constant state of almost famine in that country. And they can provide them with some smarts, they can send, you know, scientists and experts over to help them out.
