All of this over this case that the Attorney General himself called a horrible tragedy, but that's not what those nine jurors on the grand jury were deciding. It was three men, six women, two of the jurors were Black. They need seven votes from those jurors to charge the eight officers in this instance. And they did not get charges on any of them. What has made this such a sensitive case here is the race and the age of Mr. Walker. But also, the fact that he was shot 46 times during the shooting, dozens and dozens of shots were fired. Some of them did not hit him. But he was hit 46 times. He was cuffed after he was shot, which his lawyer said just added to the to the frustration in the misery. The family now of Mr. Walker says that they still want justice for their son. They intend to file a civil lawsuit this summer. The city is bracing to see whatever comes. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The arrests are part of a sweeping set of charges against more than 40 people that federal prosecutors say we're part of a vast spy operation that targeted dissidents with physical threats and online harassment. Now the two men arrested appeared before a judge Monday in Brooklyn and were released on bond and ordered to stay away from any contact with Chinese consulates. Also, among those charged were a group of alleged Chinese security agents who ran an operation to disrupt Zoom calls held by dissidents. Among them was an employee of Zoom based in China, who the FBI alleges worked with other Chinese government agents to disrupt Zoom meetings where anyone said disparaging things about the Chinese government. And that includes any mention of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests. Now the police station in Chinatown was one of several that the Chinese operated in the U.S. and around the world. It has now been shut down. Chinese agents allegedly threatened dissidents to return to China. Charges were also filed against a group of Chinese agents who allegedly used social media accounts to promote the government's propaganda. In some cases, they posed as Americans.

Now we do have that, whether it's the presidential palace or the airport or the state television and radio authorities, so we just can't tell, and it's not safe enough for any of our reporters to be out on the streets to physically verify that. But a short while ago, we're now getting confirmation that both sidesin this conflict have agreed to a 24-hour ceasefire. This initially came out with in conversations with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, but also a short while ago the General Burhan who leads the military, telling our CNN's Nima Elbagir that he did agree in principle to a 24-hour ceasefire by the trio. The trio here refers to the U.N., the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. So, they seem to quite disagree on when exactly this should start and how it'll be implemented. Because in the last ceasefire at temporary three-hour ceasefire Sunday organized by the U.N., both sides accused the other of violating it by attacking the others when they had taken apart. This is the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, explaining how this came together. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: This morning I made calls to generals, Burhan and Hemedti. Urging them to agree to a 24-hour ceasefire. To allow Sudanese to safely reunite with their families. And to obtain desperately needed relief supplies. If implemented successfully, a ceasefire for 24 hours can create a foundation to build upon for a more sustained halt to fighting and a return to negotiations on a durable end to the hostilities. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He is better known as Hemedti, and he leaves the paramilitary rapid support forces that the other half of this conflict.He said in English: Following a conversation with the U.S. Secretary of State and outreach by other friendly nations similarly calling for a temporary ceasefire. The RSF reaffirms its approval of a 24-hour armistice to ensure the safe passage of civilians and the evacuation of the wounded. But then here is where the details are. Unfortunately, the Sudanese armed forces has failed to honor the ceasefire, bombing densely populated areas from the air and endangering civilian lives. These actions that are flagrant violations of the foundations and principles of international humanitarian law. And he says there are waiting discussions with U.S. Secretary of State about how exactly this would play out. So that's the problem that's going to come up even if they do agree to start at six p.m., like General Burhan is telling CNN, will both sides hold fire and will they hold fire across the nation so people can get their supplies.",
