And later with Russian forces on the move, a rare look at the Ukrainian drone warriors using some type of homemade technology to try to slow the Russians down. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. Plenty of new developments to bring you tonight in the many trials and growing tribulations of defendant, Donald Trump. Today, he and his adult sons appealed New York's massive civil fraud judgment against them. He did not, however, begin paying the $460 plus million he now owes, an amount New York Attorney General Letitia James has taken to tweeting out actually. The figure on the left of her tweet there, the equal sign of - the left of the equal sign, a hundred and fourteen some thousand dollars, that's how much interest piles up every single day on a bill that Trump has now got less than a month to either pay off himself or find someone else to. There's also a new court filing in the classified documents case setting one special counsel against another. But we begin tonight with another case against Trump, the New York hush money trial and district attorney Alvin Bragg's new request for a gag order on the former president, justified according to his filing by threats against him and his staff that went from nearly non-existent before the case to so many that the district attorney's security detail had to bring in help from the New York Police Department because they couldn't keep up. The filing also cited his conduct in other matters and keeping them honest, they are not hard to find. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We talked to so many today who were scared, Anderson. A lot of them left on Friday. This was their first day returning. And as far as the eye could see, you saw thousands and thousands of students lining up to pay their respects, holding hands, also talking about the little things like telling your friends you love them or calling home to your parents. Also, they want more security on this campus. There's been a lot of talk about how fast this investigation happened, but there's also been talk of bringing back the blue lights that we all know that used to be across campuses all across this country. Those were removed about 20 years ago from this campus. But the conversation is really extending. We saw so much pain here. People saying they're scared to walk by themselves.   Now groups are going out together. But you can understand this is going to be something that they're going to remember for the rest of their lives.
