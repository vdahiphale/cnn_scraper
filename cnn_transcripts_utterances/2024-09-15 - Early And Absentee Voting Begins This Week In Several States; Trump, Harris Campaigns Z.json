Vance trying to win over working-class voters -- working class voters and they're really trying to go after them. So, this is a big meeting and it could sway a lot of people.

We've seen him doing these press conferences -- he did in L.A. where he did try to talk about the issues and then kind of veered off track. So, it's like -- it just seems that he is kind of struggling to stay on message, struggling to talk about issues, and that's kind of -- especially to the point about Laura Loomer. I mean, me and my colleagues have reported that there's a significant number of people in the Republican Party especially Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lindsey Graham, Thom Tillis, have called on Trump to like stop working with Laura Loomer. Stop talking to her. Stop having her around. And -- because they do not think that she is good for Trump, good for the Republican Party, and will hurt them in this election and -- but, I mean, as you see, it just keeps happening and he -- has around and he does -- and he did release a statement saying that he didn't necessarily kind of -- it was like kind of a half-hearted, I don't really support what she said, after originally saying that he had never seen what she said.

I do think some advisers, allies have kind of taken note. It's like, this is going to happen. Trump is going to have some of these people around. We can try as hard as possible. I mean, if you remember, he tried to hire Laura Loomer and that's when -- back earlier -- late last year.

GUPTA (voice-over): So together with the Concussion Legacy Foundation, they proposed something pretty radical. Getting rid of the sport's most iconic play. No more kickoffs. No more returns. The beginning of their games now look like this. Play just starts at the 35-yard line. And so far, Pizzi says they've seen a 33 percent decrease in concussions across the league. And importantly, an 18 percent increase in participation. Parents certainly like the idea. And it turns out, so do the players. Like team captain Tristan Cornell.",

But I believe there are potentially other solutions.GUPTA (voice-over): So, this year in the NFL, you're going to see a very different sort of kickoff. What they're calling a dynamic kickoff. Now, again, previously, as soon as the ball was kicked, all 11 members of the kicking team would start sprinting down the field to try and tackle the receiving team. Lots of speed, lots of space. This season, only the kicker is back here, while the opposing teams are lined up all the way over here, separated by just five yards. And none of those players can move until the ball has been caught by the receiving team or it hits the ground. It reduces the speed and the space of the play.

So, what's left of it really is just kind of sitting over portions of Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee. But also notice we've got a lot of rain starting to creep into the coastal Carolinas. That's coming from an entirely separate system. Now, both of these have the potential for flooding because both of them are moving incredibly slowly. So, you've got flood watches in effect over here. You've also got a lot of flood watches right there along the coastal regions, but again, they are from two entirely separate systems. Now, another concern, especially along the coast is as that secondary system begins to edge closer, we're also looking at very high surf and the potential for rip currents pretty much up and down much of the southeastern coast here. It goes all the way as far north as portions of Virginia. So again, just to kind of show you the scope of this next storm. So, here's a look at that, again, it's still offshore for now, but once we get into Monday, we really start to see that surge of moisture really begin to push inland in this area. And especially the cases we go Tuesday and Wednesday. Now, as of right now, it has about a 50 percent chance of becoming the next named system on the tropical storm list, which is Helene by the way. The real question is whether or not it can do it in a short period of time because this is expected to move inland starting tomorrow. So, it doesn't have very much time before it can get its act together to determine whether or not this does become the next named tropical system. So, here's a look. Monday again, we start to see that moisture influx begin to spread inland, but then it also starts to slide up into the mid-Atlantic and eventually in towards the northeast. So this is actually going to bring a lot of rain to a lot of people over the next several days, even though right now it's just kind of hovering off of the coastal region there. Flooding potential because in the short term, it's not going to move all that fast, it will have the potential to dump about two to four inches of rain for some of these areas, could even have some isolated higher amounts than that. So, you're looking at this area, especially through here, Raleigh, Wilmington, down through Myrtle Beach and up through Richmond, where we have the potential for some excessive rainfall and flooding potential.",
