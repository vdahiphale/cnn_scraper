Israeli soldiers, dressed as civilians, carry out three killings. We'll have all the details for you. Plus, as families of U.S. hostages in Gaza prepare for meeting at the White House, Hamas says it is studying a proposal for a new truce. We're live in Tel Aviv with the latest. And from the farms to the streets. Why farmers in France and across Europe are voicing their anger. Dramatic undercover raid in the West Bank. Israeli Special Forces disguised as civilians and medical workers infiltrating a hospital in Jenin early on Tuesday, killing three Palestinian men. That's according to Israeli and Palestinian officials. The IDF says, the men were terrorists linked to Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Hamas' military ring claimed one of the men as a member. And earlier, Hamas said they were all Jenin Brigade's fighters, members of an umbrella group of armed factions in the city. Meanwhile, on the ground in Gaza, the Palestinian State News Agency reports that dozens of civilians were killed and wounded on Monday during Israeli strikes in Gaza City. CNN unable to confirm the exact casualty numbers or the claims. CNN's Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman live for us in Beirut. And Ben, you were in that Hospital in Jenin, just in November. Take us through that video and what we're seeing.",

Specialist Kennedy Sanders, Specialist Breonna Moffett and Sergeant William Rivers, all hail from the U.S. state of Georgia. They lost their lives when a drone attacked their military outpost near the Syrian border on Sunday. The U.S. blames Iran-backed regional militias. Breonna Moffett's family spoke with CNN about the last time they talked to her.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, Max, look, the obvious question in the aftermath of this is how did this happen? How did the air defenses not pick up this incoming drone? And officials have offered two potential explanations. One, that it was flying quite low. Perhaps it wasn't picked up on radar. Second, it was also following behind another U.S. drone that was returning to base.And so, perhaps there was some confusion about whether it was friendly and that may have led to some level of delay. But now the question, the more pressing question for the Biden administration is what to do about it. Because in the 160 or plus now, similar attacks on U.S. interests in Iraq and Syria and now this one in Jordan, the response has been relatively contained. The U.S. has kind of been able to brush them off as not that big of a deal because while service members are injured, no one had been killed up until this point. And so President Biden is under enormous pressure to do something about this. In fact, there are Republicans who are calling on him to strike inside Iran itself. And officials say that, look, nothing is off the table, including striking Iran, but they also say that that is the least likely option because they know that it is most likely to cause an all-out war or an expanded war beyond the one that we are already seeing. It's also worth noting that the Iranians themselves are trying to distance themselves from this, saying that resistance groups don't take orders from Tehran. That's what they call the Iran-backed militias operating in Syria and Iraq. It is also -- Seth Moulton, excuse me, he is a congressman, he is a member of the House Armed Services Committee, and his view is that, look, Iran does not want war, the United States does not want war, but some of these militant groups, they do. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SETH MOULTON, U.S. HOUSE DEMOCRAT: These militant groups are trying to start a war. That's what they want. They're not attacking U.S. troops to strike a trade deal here. They want a war. We don't want to play into their aims. We want to stop a war, not start one. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But it stresses the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza is still its highest priority. Meanwhile, America's top diplomat says there's a strong option on the table following Sunday's talks in Paris.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I believe the proposal is a strong one and a compelling one that again offers some hope that we can get back to this process. But Hamas will have to make its own decisions. I can just tell you that there is, again, strong I would say alignment among the countries involved that this is a good and strong proposal.

      "sentences": "Yes, there certainly does seem to be a sense by all the participants in this meeting on Sunday, including the Qataris as well, that significant progress was indeed made during this summit in Paris between the intelligence heads of Israel, Egypt, the United States, as well as the Qatari prime minister.It seems like this was really an effort for all of those sides to try and get on the same page to bring to Hamas a new proposal to see if the significant gaps that exist between Israel and Hamas over the future of a next truce deal can indeed be overcome. I want to tell you about some of the details of this broad framework that was apparently agreed to on Sunday. And that would see civilian hostages released over the first six weeks of an initial truce. Three Palestinian prisoners released for every one Israeli civilian hostage. And then there would be a second phase of this deal, potentially, that would see the release of Israeli soldiers being held hostage, as well as the bodies of some 28 Israeli civilian hostages being held by Hamas. There would be a higher ratio of Palestinian prisoners for those Israeli soldiers being held hostage. But, ultimately, the question is, will Hamas accept this broad framework, and what kinds of changes will they be demanding? We know that one of the significant gaps, as the Israeli Prime Minister's office put it yesterday, between Israel and Hamas to reach a deal, is the fact that Hamas is seeking an end to this war altogether, trying to salvage their position in the Gaza Strip as a -- the party in power there. Hamas, for its part, says that it is reviewing this latest proposal, but they also once again say that their priority in these talks is to, quote, \"stop the aggression, the brutal attacks on Gaza\" and to see the, quote, \"complete withdrawal of occupation forces from the strip\". Hamas's leader, Ismail Haniyeh, has been invited to Cairo in order to review this proposal. It's not clear whether or not he's on his way there now, but certainly it does appear like there is some kind of agreement at least between Israel, the United States, Egypt and Qatar on the next steps forward. The question now is whether Hamas is going to get on board. Max?",

Khan claimed the document was proof of a conspiracy to remove him from power. His party says it'll challenge the decision which comes ahead of next week's parliamentary elections.

And what you have is at once common grievances, for instance, those grievances about the subsidy system within the European Union, how the common agricultural policy works, the various requirements, the paperwork that means for individual farmers across the European Union.And then you have more local issues. For instance, in France, it's to do with negotiations over the price of food for the French government. In countries further to the east, it's about cheap, cheap imports of Ukrainian products because remember that all all taxes and levies and quotas were waived as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to an influx of products that European farmers say they simply can't compete against elsewhere. The Netherlands is to do much more with environmental rules. In Germany, they're protesting hike in diesel as well. So there are very local grievances that can be added to European ones. Now, what Gabriel Attal has said, the French government said, is that beyond the announcements that have been made today, they're going to take their grievances and this issue to the European Union on Thursday. As you mentioned a moment ago, European leaders will meet urgently now to discuss what they can do at European level to try and diffuse some of this anger and try and help European farmers to deal with what are complex procedures, growing environmental rules and a squeezing of their activity as a result of what they say is unfair competition from elsewhere. So a lot for European leaders to deal with, but very immediate concerns, for instance, here in Paris about what the disruption will mean over the coming days and just how serious this siege of Paris will become and what it will mean for day to day life, Max.",
