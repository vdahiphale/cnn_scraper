Hurricane Hilary currently has 145 mile per hour winds as it inches toward California. And while the storm will likely weaken just before it strikes the state, the rain and wind could stood be deadly.More than a year's worth of rain is possible in just one day for some areas, and that could trigger some dangerous flash flooding. Bulldozers have been moving sand on beaches with wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour possible. This could become the first tropical storm to hit the area in 84 years.

But just because you see a category 4 storm now, doesn't mean that that's what we will experience when it reaches the southwestern United States. Very important.But as the situation comes with tropical storms, we typically get a surge of moisture and it will really be the rainfall threat that I am mostly concerned about across the southwestern U.S. We'll break down the details here. Look at the projected path from the National Hurricane Center. A weakening hurricane as it approaches the Baja Peninsula. Let's take it further out in time from Sunday evening through Monday, tropical storm force conditions possible in extreme southern sections of California, including San Diego. And then look at this, the remnants moving into the western half of the U.S., the flood threat cannot be diminished here. We have a rare level four of four from Sunday to Monday morning for the interior of Southern California. Weather Prediction Center does not issue that lightly. We have a moderate risk, including an Diego Northward into Las Vegas. The potential for mudslides and landslides exists. So let's compare this to a previous event. Why do you need to care? This happened in Death Valley in 2022 with a less significant storm. It produced 1.46 inches of rain. On average, Death Valley receives a little over 2 inches of rain in the entire year. With this particular system, we're predicting anywhere from 3 to 4 inches of rain. So as John so aptly said in the opening statement of the show, we could receive over a year's worth of rain just in a couple of days. This storm will encounter cooler waters as it approaches the southwestern U.S. if it stays more offshore, more coastal concerns in terms of coastal erosion and large waves. If it stays inland, that brings the rain threat a little further inland as well. John, so much to cover with this storm.",

But that is not the approach here at all from Trump's team. They want this April 2026, three years from now because they say they have so much information to go through that they're going to need to prepare for trial. It doesn't exactly work in the way that they're saying where they -- are saying they want to read every single document as if it's a novel, like \"War and Peace\". That's not really how it works. But they are saying that they have a lot of material that they're going to have to go through. They also have to juggle this with other cases. We'll see exactly what the judge does. The Justice Department obviously wants this to be much earlier than that, in January of next year. And then, speaking of other cases related to Donald Trump, there is already one of his co-defendants in Georgia, Jeffrey Clark, the former Justice Department official. He's already pushing back as well to a proposed trial date there from prosecutors saying they've asked for March of next year for a trial and that that is a little bit too soon for them to even make the ask. He hasn't even been arrested yet. None of those defendants, including Trump, have been arrested yet. And so, there is a question there about what's going to happen with that trial date as well.
