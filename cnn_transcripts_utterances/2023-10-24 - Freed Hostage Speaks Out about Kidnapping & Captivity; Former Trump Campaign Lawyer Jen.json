It has been three weeks since the House had a Speaker and in those three weeks the House has accomplished exactly nothing. We're watching that story and we will bring you live to Capitol Hill with the latest but we are going to start our coverage today in the Middle East. Right now, new details from the harrowing ordeal have been an Israeli hostage released by Hamas went through. 85 year old Yocheved Lifshitz was one of two hostages freed on Monday.

CNN Political and National Security Analyst David Sanger, also National SecurityCorrespondent for The New York Times, Seth Jones, Senior Vice President and Director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and Susan Page, the Washington Bureau Chief for USA today. Thank you all for being here. And, you know, Seth, I want to start with you, because it obviously was a very dramatic news conference this morning. I watched it live actually in the 5 am, hour. And the reality was the she's 85 years old, right. And she was talking both about the security failures on the part of the Israelis. And I'll play in a second where she criticized the IDF. But she also talked about the terrifying moments when she was taken and then the way she was treated when she was in the hands of Hamas. And she did say that they were almost friendly at one point. And you know I spoke with some people in the immediate aftermath who suggested that this was something that was a remarkable, almost PR move by Hamas. You are somebody who I mean you've been to Gaza. You've been in all sorts of stressful situations in the region. What were your takeaways from watching this unfold this morning? SETH JONES, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT CENTER FOR STRATEGIC &amp; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: Well, there were a couple of things. First, is I mean, at the core of this, it's a terrible situation, just the killing of individuals and the taking of hostages. I don't think we can lose sight of the fact that Hamas did a terrible barbaric activity here. The second thing is, you know, this is not entirely unusual for hostage situations where individuals when they come into captivity are given medical attention. Those that are going to be released, I mean, in this case, are treated reasonably well. And there is an effort by groups like this. And we've seen others do this to treat this as a public relations stunt. So it might affect people's perception of them. But again, go back to my first point I think it's really important not to lose sight of just the terrible action that Hamas took to do this.",

This is drawn the United States andPresident Biden in alignment with Netanyahu in a way that he often has not been before. And you don't see daylight between them. Now, what Netanyahu thinks behind the scenes about the U.S. constantly giving us consistent advice to take it slow to think it through, to learn from our own lessons? You know, one way I think that the United States has tried to make this advice easier to take his right, casting it as mistakes we have made in the past. You know, I was struck in President Biden speech when he talked about the mistakes of 9/11 of going too far of blaming people who were not responsible for that terrible terrorist attack. And so this is a way for us to be pretty close. We're pretty close. American support continues to be pretty strong for Israel as well.",

I mean, we the CIA collects NSA collects on Gaza and the West Bank. So I think there's some big questions on a, how was this missed? What changes need to take place in how Israel the U.S. and others collect intelligence here? And you know what other steps I've heard, for example, that Iran provided some help to Hamas on cyber defense. So to what degree has Hamas learned on its operational security and other aspects as well? So I think there are some big lessons that need to come out. We have 9/11 report that came out after 9/11.

And a good part of that it's also going to be a political analysis of what Prime Minister Netanyahu missed during this time, he was focused intently on the judicial reform, which was viewed widely as an effort to try to set the judiciary aside and give him and his government more powers. They were focused on the settlements. They were thinking much more about the West Bank than they were thinking about Gaza. And the question will come up did they take their eye off the ball?

But still, for them to achieve anything close to that they have to put forces on the ground and do something inside of the tunnels, whether it's operatives or explosives in those areas.

She pledguilty earlier today to aiding and abetting false statements. That's a felony, and she acknowledged her actions were intentional. This comes on the heels of back to back guilty pleas from two other Trump associates charged in the election interference case. Let's bring in CNN, Nick Valencia in Atlanta who had a significant scoop here. Nick we're the only reporter in the courtroom is my understanding. Can you just read us into a little bit what it felt to be like there? What was the mood in the room? Yes, it was tense and it was also very quiet. Kasie, you mentioned we were the only reporting team in the courtroom. Myself and two other producers and that were because this was an impromptu unscheduled hearing. And you know Jenna Ellis was in the courtroom. I was seated right behind her. And it was interesting because initially, it appeared as though she was being very dismissive of the accusations being read against her as -- with the DHS office was standing in front of the court reading those off, and then in an unprecedented move, she got up and addressed open court. And it was clear before she even opened her mouth that it was going to be an emotional apology, a very tearful statement, whatever she was going to read to the court and that's exactly what happened. We don't know exactly the details of how this deal came together. We had heard rumors last week that her team or defense team was in discussions with the district attorney's office as other co-defendants have been since Sidney Powell and Ken Chesebro. And Scott Hall all took deals here. Those three co-defendants now, Jenna Ellis makes four and with every deal that is cut. It is a bombshell to the Defense of the Former President Donald Trump as it appears the walls of his defense appear to be crumbling with every deal cut with the DHS office, huge win for the District Attorney's office here Fani Willis. And as part of her plea deal, Jenna Ellis like others who have pleaded guilty here, she's going to avoid jail. First of all, she's going to do five years of probation. She's going to have to pay a $5,000 fine, $100 of community service. But most importantly here is that she is going to have to testify in any future proceedings or trials against any of the remaining co-defendants and that includes Former President Donald Trump, Kasie.",

We express our gratitude and our admiration. I'm here today because the United States believes that the United Nations and this council in particular has a crucial role to play in addressing this crisis. Indeed, we put forward a resolution that sets out practical steps that we can take together toward that end. The resolution builds on many elements of the text that Brazil put forward last week. It incorporates substantive feedback that we receive from fellow council members over recent days. It also draws heavily on the views that I heard firsthand, from partners across the region, after Hamas is appalling attack on October 7 views that the United States shares. First, we all recognize the right and indeed the imperative of states to defend themselves against terrorism. That's why we must unequivocally condemn Hamas's barbaric terrorist attack against Israel. Babies riddled with bullets. Young people hunted down and gunned down with glee. People, young people beheaded. Families burned alive in a final embrace. Parents executed in front of their children, children executed in front of their parents and so many taken hostage in Gaza. We have to ask indeed, it must be asked. Where's the outrage? Where's the revulsion? Where's the --",

And of course, as that is unfolding, Republicans are behind closed doors, trying to pick the next person who they are going to designate to try to become their Speaker of the House. Tom Emmer has cracked the 100 vote threshold. There are four members of congress for Republicans still in the running to potentially win that. So let's get back to our panel. David Urban and Kate Bedingfield are with us now. We're still hoping Susan Page will be able to rejoin us shortly.

You know, we saw Jim Jordan got a big number of votes that you get to the floor, and he couldn't close the deal. Let's see what happens with Tom Emmer. I think that, you know Republicans are hearing from constituents at home, that they are fed; their constituents are fed up with this.

In part because they've shown at least you know, over the course of this congress that, you know, they're not always able to govern and willing to be partners in government in good faith. So if you're a Democrat, what is the incentive for you to kind of to step in and throw a lifeline? But I think I will say even that is sort of all hypothetical, right. And you kind of just touched on why. Any candidate, any candidate who is seen as cutting a deal with Democrats or able to work with the Democrats is not palatable to the Republican caucus, they've made that very, very clear. It's why we've been essentially locked in this standstill for three weeks. I mean, don't forget, we're not, this is not like chaos for chaos sake. This is chaos, because a fraction of the Republican caucus doesn't believe the Republican leadership is hardline enough and is extreme enough. So you know I'm not sure that even you know, I think this is all a little bit hypothetical. And again, you know, I understand why speaker -- there you go. I understand why leader Jeffries is saying, you know, that he's open to some sort of power sharing agreement, of course. But I think deep down, I'm not sure there's a whole lot of incentive to be totally brutally honest here, for Democrats to throw a lifeline to Republicans who can't get there, get themselves in line.",

I mean, just would Kevin McCarthy would have done. And so interestingly, Republicans have not taken away that they've not changed the rules that a single member can call for, you know, a motion to vacate the chair, like happened in with Speaker McCarthy. So it'll be interesting. You may get a speaker Emmer who will get elected. And then on November 17, we'll cut a deal that some members find unpalatable. And one member could go back to the floor and put a motion to vacate the chair, we could be back and it's all again.
