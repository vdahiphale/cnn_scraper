The markets reacting already to two major economic headlines. Wall Street trying to gauge insights into for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments later today on the U.S. economic outlook and the central bank's thinking on future rate increases. What Powell says could set the tone for the markets for the rest of this year.We're also watching Capitol Hill. The U.S.'s House is expected to take up legislation to avert a looming nationwide freight rail strike. Then it will be the Senate's turn to get the bill to President Biden's desk. Businesses are scrambling to limit the damage if a rail strike were to happen. Retailers across the sectors are finding work around for shipping and warehouse usage. CNN's Matt Egan explains the headache this is causing for everyone, including President Biden. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Brian Moynihan tell CNN that the housing market is in for some pain but right now American shoppers are keeping the economy afloat. Meanwhile, the conference board reports that consumer confidence is at the lowest level since July. But people are spending money despite inflation, in part because the labor market does remain strong. The U.S. government is taking new action in the housing market amid the nationwide affordability crisis. Mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will raise the limits of government-backed loans to a record level of 2023. The Federal House Financing Agency announced that move on Tuesday. And this means the baseline performing loan limit for 2023 will be more than $726,000. And higher cost areas will have a new loan limit of more than $1 million. However, one trade group argues the higher loan limits will make the affordability crisis worse. In a landmark vote the U.S. Senate has said yes to codify same-sex marriage into federal law. The vote was 61 to 36 with 12 Republicans joining with Democrats to support it. The Respect for Marriage Act would ensure protection for gay and interracial couples by requiring states to recognize the marriages across state lines. However, it still needs to pass the House before heading to President Biden's desk for that signature. A tornado watch has been issued for parts of Alabama and Mississippi in the Southern U.S. Severe storms moving across the lower Mississippi Valley have produced at least 20 tornado reports so far. A woman in Alabama captured this video Tuesday of debris flying through the air. And in Monroe County, Mississippi, this bridge washed out a short time ago as heavy storms were moving through the area. So, let's bring in meteorologist Pedram Javaheri at the CNN Weather Center in Atlanta for this. This weather looks alarming, Pedram. What more can you tell us?",

The U.S. national team the celebrating didn't stop at the stadium after their victory over Iran. A group of fans brought the party to them as they arrived in their hotel lobby in Qatar.After the game the U.S. team took to Twitter to thank fans all over the world saying they felt all the love and unwavering support. The U.S. team's winning goal came from Christian Pulisic after hurting his pelvis after colliding with an Iranian. His condition is listed as day to day. Meanwhile, Americans aren't the only one celebrating the U.S. victory. Some people in Iran actually cheered on the American team. The match was overshadowed by antigovernment protests in Iran and the ruling theocracies deadly crackdown on them. And there are those, especially in Kurdish areas, rooting for the government back team to lose. So, let's get more now from our correspondence. CNN's Nada Bashir is here in London. But first let's go to Amanda Davies who's at the center of action in Doha. So, Amanda, take us through this huge win for the United States. How did it unfold?",

And if that video of the of them arriving back to the team hotel is anything to go by, they've certainly been enjoying their moment and deservedly so after booking their place into the round of 16 at the World Cup for the first time since Brazil 2014.The mood on the U.S. side at least in such sharp contrast to that tense political pre-match buildup that we saw framed with such a history, the stakes so high for both sides in terms of on and off the pitch. And you've got such a sense as both sides walked out of the Al Thumama Stadium into that cauldron of noise, just what it meant to them. The majority of Iranian fans roaring their side on desperately hoping they would create a moment of history in the midst of all the political unrest at home by booking their place in the knockout stage of the World Cup for the first time ever. From the U.S. perspective, there was a big question mark, really, about how this young, untested World Cup squad would deal with such a political pressurized moment, but they were calm, they were composed. They absolutely stepped up when they needed to. Ultimately with that goal from captain America, Christian Pulisic making the difference for Gregg Berhalter. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GREGG BERHALTER, U.S. MEN'S TEAM COACH: Great first half and, you know, and then the end of the game is really what I'm most proud of because it's the mark of determination and extreme amount of effort and resiliency to hang in there and get the win, not buckle. You know, that's the first time in 92 years that we've gotten two shutouts in a World Cup so the boys are doing something right. Really proud of the group.",
