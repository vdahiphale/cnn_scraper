Typically, they are arguing things -- we don't know exactly what Trump will argue, but typically they've argued things like they can't have a fair trial because of the political climate in Washington, D.C.Now, the judges have largely rejected, actually I think they rejected every time that request has been put before them because there are mechanisms that this court uses to make sure that the jury pool that they get is a fair one and that the jurors are talking their responsibility very seriously. We have seen that. We have seen acquittals of certain counts related to January 6th. And of course, a reminder of what is really important here is that if these cases are brought in D.C., they are very likely being tried here because the victims are here as well.

Often, but not always, CC one through six, people in that position do end up charged, but not always.Let's run through what we know. CC One, co-conspirator one, not surprisingly, Rudy Giuliani, the indictment makes clear, he was the point person. He spread the false claims of election fraud when other attorneys on Donald Trump's election team would not do so. So he is listed as the first co-conspirator. Number two, John Eastman. He is the constitutional scholar who came up with this whole legal strategy that we can pressure Mike Pence to throw out the electoral votes, a theory that has been roundly rejected throughout the legal community. He is number two.

Pence told Trump it was unconstitutional. Trump responded, you're too honest.According to the indictment a few days later, Trump asked Pence again to obstruct the certification of the election.

Well, if he has the evidence, then all these conspiracy charges would go away. But that's not the case that you hear his defense team presenting. Instead, what they are saying he has a First Amendment right, which is in essence saying all elected officials lie. Are you going to charge everybody? Which I think is a dramatic shift to say, look, it was stolen, I never had a chance to present my evidence, to now saying, look, yes, maybe Mike Pence was right and really I don't know that it was stolen, but I have a right to tell the American people misrepresentations, which I think is a dramatic change in what they have been saying publicly in the last 24 hours.",

Look, I do think that the Ukrainians are willing to do the fighting and dying, and they're asking us for the beans and bullets. That has been a worthwhile investment for the United States to stop Putin. But at the end of the day, as this counterattack flounders, and as it struggles, this does seem like we are inching towards a long-term protracted conflict.
