Then, the young Americans fighting climate change in court. I'm joined by one of the plaintiffs and the attorney in the groundbreaking Montana case. Plus, cries for help from around the world. We look at the increasing risks faced by LGBTQ people and those helping them to safety. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. You virtually stopped the civil war, the words of Vladimir Putin as he addressed his security forces in the wake of the Wagner Group's failed rebellion over the weekend. The Russian president has accused the West of fomenting the mutiny, and he's vowing to bring the organizers to justice. Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has confirmed that Prigozhin is in his country. Meanwhile, the United States is set to announce a new round of military aid for Ukraine. So, will this situation be a decisive moment for Ukraine's military? President Zelenskyy says they have advance in all directions on the southern and eastern fronts. But just last week he had admitted that progress in the counteroffensive was slower than hoped. Andriy Yermak runs Zelenskyy's office, and he's joining me now from Kyiv. Welcome back to our program. I don't know where to begin. I think to begin by asking you, have you and your team been able to make any sense of what happened in Russia and specifically, have you thought about how it could benefit you or vice versa?",

I think that it's a very strong signal that the war in Ukraine is terrible, barbaric, illegal invasion, which started in 24th of February last year. And the war, as you know, started many years ago in 2014. Of course, everything which happened in Russia, last days, is the result of this war. And this is the result of, how I said, practically 500 days of the brave fightings of Ukrainian nations.

And many of them are taking the fight against climate change to the courts. Like 16 young people in the U.S. State of Montana. They are arguing that the state's support for the fossil fuel industry undermines its own constitutional guarantee that the state shall maintain a clean and healthy environment for present and future generations. The trial lasted maybe two weeks. And now, everyone is awaiting the verdict. 18-year-old Lander Busse is one of the plaintiffs, and Julia Olson is the lead attorney representing them. She's on the nonprofit law firm, Our Children's Trust. Welcome to the program. Can I start by asking you, Lander Busse, you and -- well, just tell me how you grew up? What was it that motivated you as -- I think you were 15 when this all started -- to take on your state as a way of, you know, mitigating climate change? LANDER BUSSE, PLAINTIFF, HELD V. MONTANA: Absolutely, Christiane. And thank you so much for having me on today. One of the main things that we share in Montana, just together, not even as youth, but just as citizens, is our love for this state and the land, and everything it has to offer us. That's something that transcends party lines and partisan values, so much as that even in 1972 it was ratified into our constitution for the protection of these lands. And so, I've spent much of my life, just like many others in Montana, fishing and hunting and growing up using this land to the best of our ability as our constitution guarantees us. So --",

We started to see the effects of that much more directly in my life.

Our Children's Trust was formed in 2010, and we launched the global campaign to bring cases on behalf of young people to fight the conduct of governments in violating their fundamental human rights, often their constitutional rights.

So, we -- what we are looking for right now from the state is, at the very least, a recognition that our constitutional rights have been and continue to be infringed upon by a state that turns a blind eye and, in fact, systematically tries to make sure that fossil fuels will be continued to be engrained in our state's culture, unless we something about it. So, it's really up to the courts at this point, and we've done everything we can to get this to where it needs to be, and we put on quite the case just in this last week.

And, you know, going back to what the Montana attorney general's office has said, that Montana's emissions don't matter, I mean, literally every ton of carbon that is emitted into the atmosphere matters today, and we're seeing the consequences of it. And so, we put experts on the stand, and we put these amazing youth on the stand, 12 of them testified. And they told heartbreaking stories of what they're experiencing at the hands of governments around the world, including their own. And so, it's now really up to the judge to decide, does the evidence show a violation of the constitutional rights of these youth? And what's the remedy? What can be done about it?",

And at the end of the day, after seeing the experts on our side testify, I think they realized that they just couldn't put their people on the stand. And it's the importance of having climate cases go to court, and go to trial, because you can't lie in a court of law, right? There's perjury. And so, putting the evidence forward in such a methodical way really tells a clear story of harm to this youngest generation, and it also tells a story of government culpability, and that it is governments permitting all of these activities. The pattern and practice of locking in fossil fuels to our energy system and preventing the transition that is really the cause of the climate crisis today.",

Montana is in a really unique position just because of how special our constitution is in explicitly guaranteeing all of its citizens to a clean and healthful environment, but there are definitely -- I'm not one to talk about this, Julia is much more well-versed, but other states that have similar protections as well that could definitely be able to add on to that precedent of climate case law. We've started -- we've seen, just recently, just an outpour of support from people internationally and people who are letting us know that they're there with us. And we've really never seen any -- I've never seen anything like this. I live in a community that doesn't recognize climate change, let alone find ways to act on it. So, really seeing this outpour of support and just humanity from people who care about this as much as we do has been phenomenal and super inspiring.

And so, climate crisis and what governments are doing to perpetuate fossil fuel energy systems that cause climate change are infringing on people's rights to life, to their health, to their safety, to their freedoms, including their abilities to live in their communities, to have families, to practice cultural traditions. So, every constitution has a claim for these young people to bring forward. And when we started this work in 2010, Our Children's Trust brought the first cases in the world on behalf of youth to protect their constitutional rights in the face of climate crisis. And since then, there's been an explosion of these cases around the world, many of which we support. And one of the biggest cases going forward, we just got the green light to head toward a trial again, after eight years, is the Juliana v. United States case, that Lander mentioned. And it's against the government most responsible for the climate crisis, historically, and that's the United States. And so, we look forward to heading to trial there too.",

And last year, Uganda was already amongst the top 10 countries of which we received requests for assistance. We were nearly, you know, over 300 requests for assistance. The good thing about our data that we're able to track that at real-time, so that we can could respond to crisis situations. In 2023, so far, we've received double the amount of requests for assistance from Uganda. And the vast majority was now over 600 requests for assistance have come since March, when the anti-homosexuality law was passed in parliament. So, the direct correlation with the further aggravation of these laws and the persecution of people. And now, Uganda is amongst 12 nations that impose the death penalty on people just for who they are or who they love.",

But the data really points to an alarming trendthat LGBTQ people from the United States are reaching out to us for assistance. And they are doing it in two aspects. One, they are asylum seekers who are reaching out for assistance, but also, U.S. born citizens who are saying that they are facing danger and are looking for assistance to flee the state, or relocate to another state or another country, which is alarming. But I will say that there's a direct correlation between those requests for help and U.S. policy across the country. One of the things our data does is look at spikes throughout the year, and we saw two interesting spikes. One was along the adoption of anti-LGBTQ, in particular anti-trans laws in various states like Florida. But the second, which was a little more surprising to us, was after Roe v. Wade. And we -- the spike then, I think, was related to some concerns that have since been solved with the Protect for Marriage Act that Roe v. Wade would open the door for less protection for LGBTQ plus persons. And so, you see our data points a general fear from people, and it continues to this year. The United States, in 2023, is amongst the top three countries of request for help, outside of Afghanistan and Uganda. So, it's a deep concern for us. And we're looking carefully about how we work with other partners across the country to address this phenomenon.",

To be clear, Rainbow Railroad is continuously advocating with the Biden administration for increased resettlement to the United States.And that is -- that continues to be our position. And at the same time, we are monitoring and are concerned about the safety of LGBTQ plus people. You know, we look at when we relocate people through international borders, what we're really looking for are whether they are generally protections under the law for LGBTQ plus persons and, you know, are there refugee protections for those individuals. And our request -- and our assistance in various countries ebb and flow. You know, when LGBTQ plus persons were facing detention under the so-called Muslim ban, previously, for example, we paused resettlement into the United States. And so -- and we do that in multiple countries as well. At the moment, you know, even though the states laws are concerning there are still overarching protections legally for LGBTQ plus in the United States. And ultimately, all of our interventions, whether it's directly in countries that criminalize same sex intimacy or in the United States are always driven by people and partners on the ground. So, in this case, we look really closely to our partners who are asylum seekers, who have sought asylum in the United States and said, you know -- and we're saying and having the conversation, should we continue our efforts and work? And ultimately, they say, yes. Because as people who've had the experience of fleeing their country it's one thing to be concerned about laws in United States, it's another thing to fleeing your country because it's life and death.

We released another report on Afghanistan. You know, I directly been in neighboring Pakistan more than once to help set up our network. You know, our organization was never -- never anticipated us being in the middle of geopolitical crises, but we're seeing direct -- Afghanistan was a real example of a larger geopolitical situation that directly impacted LGBTQ plus people at risk.

One of the challenges with Afghanistan is that civil society organizations and people were fleeing the country.

There were kind of, you know, incremental advances LGBTQ plus persons in the country, but by far, the country has not have overall protections of LGBTQ plus people. And Russia's situation was a little more dire. We actually saw more requests in Russia from people who were displaced, but our work in Russia has been continuous since the 2013 anti-LGBTQ propaganda law, and then subsequent republics like Chechnya essentially torturing LGBTQ plus persons.
