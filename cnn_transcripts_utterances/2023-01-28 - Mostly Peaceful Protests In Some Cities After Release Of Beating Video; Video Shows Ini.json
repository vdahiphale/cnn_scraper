You see Nichols there who is unarmed, kicked in the face, struck at least nine times in just several minutes.Bloodied, then, propped up onto a squad car. Officers are then seen just standing around, not providing Nichols with any potentially life-saving aid. Five former Memphis police officers now facing several charges, including second degree murder, and kidnapping. And after the release of this video, two Shelby County deputies who were also there on the scene have now been put on leave pending an investigation into their conduct. CNN Sara Sidner is there in Memphis? She's been there for the last several days. Sarah, these videos are incredibly difficult to watch, to listen to, to process. What is the reaction been there in Memphis, both last night, and then, also this morning? SARA SIDNER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): It's been peaceful. There have been protests. There were protesters on the I-55 bridge that goes north and south through Memphis. But they stopped traffic and they did so because they wanted people to stop and think about what has been going on here. Not just when it comes to Tyre Nichols, who were they were calling for justice for, but what has happened in the past between the police and members of the community, specifically, black members of the community here in Memphis. The protesters, unlike the family were actually unhappy with how the police chief has responded. While the family has been saying that they are pleased that this was such a swift response, the police chief who's been here over a year now. She fired these officers immediately upon understanding that something was wrong. She, herself, thought that the report back to the police department did not match the fact that Tyre Nichols was suddenly in the hospital and was unresponsive. And she, herself, came and looked at videos to try to see why there was a discrepancy and fire the officers after what she saw. And the DEA also acted swiftly, sending it to a grand jury who indicted, and then he put forth charges -- very severe charges: second degree murder charges, kidnapping charges, aggravated assault charges in this. But the protesters say this should never have happened. And it could have been prevented if they would be doing this, in prior cases, where people have complained to internal investigations and to the police department about the behavior of officers as a whole. They feel like a lot of things have been sweep swept under the rug. And that is why they are calling for major reforms and they want them now. I want to let you listen to one of the protesters we spoke with last night who was a Memphian born and raised, who had this to say about what she thought about the response by officials to the death of Tyree Nichols?

It was one of the things that he did not just for enjoyment, but, you know, to make himself feel free. And so, you see him, that was about 12 years ago, him skating there. Video taken by a friend. We also learned that he has a web site -- a photography web site. And that was his passion. While he worked at FedEx, his passion was going out on a nightly basis and taking photographs of the sunsets. His web site talks about the fact that -- and it's really haunting when we read his own words where he talked about, you know, instead of just talking to people, instead of just getting people's stories through voice, I like to get them through pictures. And as it turned out, it was video, which captured some of the last moments of his life, and also, some of the worst moments of his life. Not somebody talking because it is silent video for some of that. When you see it from the pole cam, from the sky cop cam, as they call it. But he was a guy that his mom said was a free spirit.

CNN's Hadas Gold is in Jerusalem. Hadas, what's the latest there tonight? HADAS GOLD, CNN POLITICS, MEDIA AND BUSINESS REPORTER (on camera): Yes, Jessica. It's really been three days of bloodshed hear for both Israelis and Palestinians. You mentioned the shooting this morning of 13-year-old boy, injuring two, but no casualties from that. And then, last night, in what's being described as one of the worst terror attacks that Israel has seen in recent years, seven people were killed outside of a synagogue, it was Friday night. Shabbat service says synagogues usually are very busy around that time, an attacker shooting and killing seven, injuring at least three more. We're getting some information about the victims. Among one of the injuries in hospital is a 15-year-old. The shooter then tried to flee, but he was then encountered by police a few minutes later. After a brief shootout, he himself was shot and killed. He was identified as a 21-year-old Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem. And Israeli police believed that he was acting on his own, but these events were not happening in a vacuum. Because just the day before on Thursday, was the deadliest day for Palestinians in the West Bank in well over a year. That happened during both an Israeli military raid in Jenin that was targeting, Israel says, Islamic Jihad militants. But we know of, at least, one civilian, a woman in her 60s, who was killed during that firefight. And then, another Palestinian -- a 10th Palestinian was killed in clashes later in the day. So, the deadliest day for Palestinians, that, by itself, those events on Thursday that led to rockets being fired from Gaza into Israel, and Israel responding with airstrikes. There were no injuries in that situation. But it was already a very tense moment leading into Friday. And then, that attack happened. Israeli police are calling both the shooting on Friday night and Saturday morning as terror attacks. And this is a big test for this new right-wing government in Israel that just took over about a month ago. And already there are calls from some of the more far-right wing members to take some drastic steps. Among them, they want to bring the death penalty they say to terrorists, some of them are even saying that there should be way more guns on the street for civilians to be armed as they go around. Meanwhile, on the diplomatic side, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is actually scheduled to be arriving here on Monday and Tuesday for meetings with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders. This was a pre-planned trip. But obviously, the events of the last few days are bringing a new sense of urgency to those talks. Jessica.",

I'm happy to be here with you. Look, a perfect storm has been building for some time now. You have a 56-year-old Israeli military occupation of the West Bank. You have a Palestinian authority that lost credibility on the streets and lost control. You have armed groups, independent also attached to Hamas in Palestine Islamic Jihad operated in the West Bank, planning terror attacks. And you have a new government most right wing in Israel's history. All of these things suggest that we haven't seen the end of this.

I think this crisis is a difficult one for him. And the real question is whether or not he can manage the two ministers to whom he's granted extraordinary authority with very large budgets. One, indicted and convicted on incitement too radical for the Israeli army. And the other one, visa allows small Trish (PH), now in charge of day to day life. Construction, permits, building for areas see in the West Bank, which is 60 percent. So, he's got to figure out a way to manage this coalition and not be pushed in a -- in a moment of high tension, and understandable anger in response to what happened in Jerusalem and those deadly strike in 15 years there to manage the situation. So, he doesn't make an already tense situation worse. And, I think, Secretary Blinken will be there, it will be understandably an extended sort of condolence call, you'll be very empathetic and sympathetic to the situation, which the Israelis find themselves. But I'm hoping you'll also press the prime minister and understand that counterterrorism is very important and essential and effective.

I vividly remember being in college riding down the union poplar going to the Lorraine Motel to honor MLK's legacy that was start at an auction block. And when I think about this particular incident and the city of Memphis with the leadership that is currently set up, I mean it's just disheartening. But I will tell you, I think Memphis is becoming a blueprint and a litmus test and putting other cities on watch for how you actually roll this out. They addressed this incident very quickly. They had an internal investigation in the police department, fired the officers, there were paramedics put on leave. There are also sheriff deputies that are now under investigation and then of course they show the family the video and brought forth criminal charges. And I think when we look at that rollout that speaks to the reason why these protests have been peaceful. And I'm happy to see that in a city that I call home and that is because we are seeing transparency and accountability and that's all that people have been asking for.",

We have interviewed hundreds of police officers. We have an innovative virtual reality training program that puts officers in the encounters they have every single day suspicious persons, traffic stops, domestic violence incidents. And we find something that's very, very important for people. We find that there are very few differences between whites and black officers in terms of their attitudes and behaviors, particularly when it comes to how they treat black people.So in other words, the broader narrative that we've heard and the broader kind of incidents that we've seen where it's typically a white officer on a black victim, that's not necessarily what we find in our research. I think that is important and important to hold up. Now, there is definitely some research that shows a place effect. In other words, if officers are from the place that they're policing or they live in that place, they are much more likely to treat people in an equitable way. We know that officers are much less likely to live in predominantly black neighborhood. So you put all this together. Our research suggests that there are some real policy solutions here to actually provide incentives for officers to live where they work and to also provide more training and accountability to ensure that these particular incidents don't happen.",

They are doing amazing work, like several of my friends who are police officers. But they'll tell you and then of course, in all the interviews we've done, they are socialized the same way. They are embedded in a culture that I'm unsure as much as systemic change we might make in terms of policy and structural changes. I'm unsure if culture is reformable.So we have to remember that the legacy of policing in the United States comes out of slave patrols, which was even before the United States was founded, there were black people fleeing plantations where individuals were trying to track them. And, of course, law enforcement outlasted that through the founding of our country, through Jim Crow, through the civil rights movement, through mass incarceration. So this is deeply embedded in the sediment. It's really what I call the way that bad apples come from rotten trees. These five cops, well, these ex cops are bad apples, but they come from somewhere, and they come from a rotten tree that we have never, never truly dealt with in the United States.",
