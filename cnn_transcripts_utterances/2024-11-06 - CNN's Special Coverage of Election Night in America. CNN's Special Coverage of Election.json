Now, you can say you can look at what's happening in Ukraine and you can look at what's happening in the Middle East and all over the world and believe that Trump had something to do with it or not believe something Trump had something to do with it. But it is true that there are wars going on right now that we're not going on during the Trump presidency. I'm not saying that correlation but I just -- I want to reassure because I know that there are people out there who are worried that this is a statement, that this vote for Donald Trump is a statement of dislike of them. And I don't think that is what people should read into election results. CHRIS WALLACE, HOST, \"THE CHRIS WALLACE SHOW\": (inaudible) point of which I agree with most of what you said. The only thing I would push back on is this is a man who would get up in rallies and say, I am your retribution. This goes back to what David Axelrod said. There obviously are millions of people in this country who feel that there's an elite, an inside game that they're looked down on, as Axelrod said, where the party, the Democratic Party, approaches them almost like missionaries, like we want to help you and make you like us and he was in effect saying I'm representing you against those people. I'd agree that a lot -- a lot of it doesn't have to do with misogyny and racism but I do think that there is a you know we talk about the one of the big dividing lines here is college educated people versus non-college educated people. I think there is certainly a class element.",

And it was still essentially, Kristen Holmes, what he has been arguing for two years on immigration or the economy, criticized the message or not that is what came through. And I think the other thing that stood out from him being on that stage tonight was the powers sources around him. Suzy Wiles getting up there, she did not speak. She was the only person he called to get on stage who did not say a word into the microphone.

And that was really a question of the closing message also, whether that would affect it. A lot of them, even inside the campaign, began to feel that way. Obviously today changed their perspectives. And just looking also on that stage tonight, Ivanka Trump was there with Jared Kushner. They were standing to the far right just off camera. That is, I believe, her first campaign trail appearance. She did not attend the trial in Manhattan. She was not at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. We've heard from her. But she hasn't been out on the campaign trail at all.",

She made thatannouncement shortly before Donald Trump announced that he was going to be running, that she and Jared were going to take a step back and take care of their family. And she has largely stayed out of light. Now, after his conviction, as we talked about, she was up at Trump Tower. She never came down with him. Even when he spoke, she wasn't there. She was never seen publicly with him. And there was a lot of questions about that. Even he brought up on the campaign trail in the last two days how she was there on the campaign trail with him back in 2016 and 2020. And she had largely disappeared. It was notable that she was there. And I was speaking to somebody earlier before the Mar-a-Lago event who said they weren't even sure she was going to show up to that Mar-a- Lago watch party.

So I just don't want to take out that many things can be true at the same time. DAVID URBAN, CNN SR. POLITICAL COMMENTATORMaybe you got a bad messenger and a bad message. Kamala Harris has never run an election in a state that wasn't 100 percent Democrat. She ran -- She's been elected in the state of California her entire career. She's run as a prosecutor, she ran for AG, she ran for Senate, in a blue, blue state. So she's never had to build a coalition, she's never had to really campaign. When she ran for president the first time on her own, she tanked. She tanked, she didn't get anywhere. And then so when this came about, this opportunity came about, she didn't run again. She's never been battle tested. And Axe, you've said this before. Running for president is a skill yet Barack Obama was a good at what he started there was no racism at it.  Barack Obama got good at it. You help them get good at it right? And so, maybe she's just a bad messenger selling a bad product.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jake, two important projections to bring you. Two flips in crossover districts beginning with a 22nd House district in New York. This is up in upstate New York in the Syracuse area, a district that four years ago Joe Biden won.Democrat John Mannion defeating Republican incumbent Brandon Williams to take that seat and we anticipate, flip it, for Democrats. The opposite happening in Pennsylvania's 8th district. This is in the Scranton area, a district that Donald Trump won, one that Democratic incumbent Matt Cartwright was the representative for, but now Rob Bresnahan, who had never held public office in his life. He's a business executive. He is now projected to win that seat in the House of Representatives. So what does this mean for the magic number, the number that Democrats need to take control of the chamber? As you can see, Democrats have to pick up seven Republican seats. They are currently leading in nine races where Republicans hold seats, but the math starts to get a little bit complicated there because keep in mind, there are districts where Republicans are leading in races where Democrats hold seats. So if you do some math, while it appears that it's trending in Democrats' direction, they may come up short if this trend continues. Let's get you an update on some key race alerts now. These are results coming into CNN as we're getting them in New York's 19th district. This is in the Ithaca area. Josh Riley, a Democratic attorney, is currently about 3,600 votes in front of freshman Republican incumbent Marc Molinaro, 94 percent of the vote in that New York district. Another one to tell you about, this one on Long Island. Another district, Joe Biden won four years ago. Laura Gillen, a town supervisor in House District 4, is currently leading Republican incumbent Anthony D'Esposito, former NYPD officer, by roughly 6,148 votes, 92 percent of the vote in this district. Looking at the first House District in Arizona, this is the northern suburbs of Phoenix. You have Amish Shah, the Democrat in this race, an E.R. doctor, a slim margin, 742 votes ahead of incumbent Republican David Schweikert. Obviously still a close race there, 56 percent of the vote in. Now let's get you some more key races where Republicans are leading. Let's take a look, beginning with the state, or rather the district in Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley area. This is House District 7. You have Ryan McKenzie leading Democratic incumbent, Susan Wild, a roughly 5,500 votes, 99 percent of the vote in there. It looks like it's trending in Republican's direction. In Michigan, House District 7, Tom Barrett leading by 17,000 votes against Curtis Hertel, 97 percent of the vote there in the 7th District. This is in the Lansing area. This is actually the district that's got an open seat because Alissa Slotkin is running for Senate. Keep your eyes on this one. Meantime, a key race alert from Alaska, Nick Begich, the Republican in this race, leading the Democratic incumbent Mary Peltola. She's a freshman was actually the first Native Alaskan ever voted to Congress. This is a ranked choice, sort of open format in Alaska. So you'll see her going up against a fellow Democrat. But right now, Begich 5,800 votes ahead, 55 percent of the vote in, in this at-large district, obviously Alaska, a state that Donald Trump won. So what does all this mean for the balance of power in the House of Representatives? The raw numbers right now. 169 for Democrats with one pickup, 197 for Republicans with four pickups, 69 seats remaining up for grabs, Anderson. As you know, 218 needed for control of the Chamber.",

But we've always talked about this would be on the margin. So if you pull off even 1 percent of one of your base constituencies, which he was able to do in some and many, or he was able to do in many of them, you were not going to be able to keep that state or hold that state. And so I've heard a lot of people talk about the conversations we need to have. And I think we do need to have conversations as a party.But the conversation I want to have for people who showed up and voted for Kamala Harris and tell them to hold their head up high. I remember in 2016 having to walk back into the White House today and I was embarrassed to go to work because I feel like I had filled our country. You know, despair is not the time to lose hope. It is the time to dig down, to do some soul searching and fight for a better day. Many of the communities that are most vulnerable and that are really afraid right now, the trans community, immigrants, people of color, even if there's polling or outcomes that are showing that some people of color voted for Donald Trump. You're worthy, you're visible, you're not alone. And so you can feel what you feel right now, but we have to do work to protect the most vulnerable, and we can and we will. And then for the people who did support Donald Trump, we've sat on this network and people have said the things that he said about retribution and about going after his enemies. That's not what he really meant. So in moments when he does that, it's your responsibility to hold him accountable and not let him do that and not let him undermine the democracy because it is bigger than him. This is not his country. It is our country. He just happened to be most likely elected to run it for four years.",

POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, look, he has an opportunity here to try to unite the country after a huge victory. This is a mandate. He's won the national popular vote for the first time since, for a Republican, for the first time since 2004. This is a big deal. This isn't backing into the office. This is a mandate to do what you said you were going to do. Get the economy working again for regular working class Americans. Fix immigration, try to get crime under control, try to reduce the chaos in the world. This is a mandate from the American people to do that. I think I'm interpreting the results tonight as the revenge of just the regular old working class American, the anonymous American who has been crushed, insulted, condescended to. They're not garbage. They're not Nazis. They're just regular people who get up and go to work every day and are trying to make a better life for their kids, and they feel like they have been told to just shut up when they have complained about the things that are hurting them in their own lives. I also feel like this election, as we sit here and pour over this tonight, is something of an indictment of the political information complex. I mean, we've been sitting around here for the last couple of weeks, and the story that was portrayed was not true. We were told Puerto Rico was going to change the election. Liz Cheney, Nikki Haley voters, women lying to their husbands. Before that it was Tim Walz and the camo hats. Night after night after night, we were told all these things and gimmicks were going to somehow push Harris over the line. And we were just ignoring the fundamentals. Inflation, people feeling like they were barely able to tread water at best. That was the fundamentals of the election. And so, I think that both parties should always look at the results of an election and figure out what went right and what went wrong. But I think for all of us who cover elections and talk about elections and do this on a day-to-day basis, we have to figure out how to understand, talk to, and listen to the half of the country that rose up tonight and said, we've had enough.",

I do think the way this campaign was run was basically on the Democrats thought there were enough people who hated Trump or were willing to fear him to win the race. And it turns out there's more to being president than simply not being Donald Trump in the eyes of the American people. I'm a little worried about how Democrats are going to react. They've been told Trump is a modern day Hitler or at least he's a fascist. And now Kamala Harris, I suspect, is going to have to wake up in the morning and concede to that person. And then she's going to have to go to the Senate and certify the election and -- and I'm just I'm a little concerned about an election in which half the country was conditioned to believe that the person who just won the national popular vote is going to be a dictator eliminate the constitution and create a bloodbath and so on and so forth. So we have -- we have to -- we have to reckon with that and the aftermath of that argument. VAN JONES, CNN SR. POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: The thing that they have been the most important remember is the people who said that he was a Hitler lover or Democrats or Republicans. The people who said that he was a fascist or Democrats they were Republicans who work for him and so it's not it's not just elite Democrats over here, you know, poisoning the well. You had a pretty broad consensus from the -- from Chomsky to the Cheneys, from, you know, that was very concerned and remains concerned. And so, I think it's not just on us to stop calling names.

DAVID AXELROD, CNN SR. POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Scott, you know look, first of all, I'm always willing to be introspective about how we talk about these things and how we think about them. Polls weren't actually that wrong. I mean, you're going to look at these polls and they're going to mostly be within the -- I think how we use polls and how we talk about polls is a discussion that we ought to have, and whether that's how we should cover campaigns. But you know, you sat on this, maybe at this very table in January of 2021, and you were compelling and moving because you are someone who believes in the institutions of this democracy and in integrity and so on. The reason that people are worried and wary about Donald Trump is because of the way Donald Trump has behaved when he was president, when he was after he was president, and during this campaign. And, you know, how many times do we have a discussion about, you know, his message as related in his campaign ads and the kind of really disturbing things that he says about jailing his opponents and shooting his opponents and so on. It's not like people make that stuff up, it's concerning now. I would say to you that it's the responsibility people who supported him to hold him as we should hold him to the commitments that he made to work on the problems of the American people and to not indulge in the kind of craziness that we sometimes heard from him.",

These were states that were decided by tens of 20,000 votes back in 2016. Joe Biden bumped it up a little bit higher than that. That's a huge margin with 83 percent reporting.Swipe over to Wisconsin, always the tightest of the Blue Wall states. Donald Trump with 96 percent reporting is up by 108,000 votes.",

Where are we again in 2024? Donald Trump with 96 percent reporting is up by 108,000 votes. We haven't even gotten into Arizona and Nevada yet, which are still kind of on the early side of reporting, but Trump with decent leads there right now.

Now the question is, Phil, why? What have we seen perhaps in some of these key battleground states? Let's go look at Pennsylvania, since everyone's familiar with it, that tells the story of what's happened here.",

What happened in 2020? He's around there, he's kind of matching up with it. You move over into Beaver County, the 58 percent back in 2020. What's he doing this time around? Bumping it up. So he's got one, two, three percent throughout the course of those places that you knew Trump was going to win. It was just a matter of how much. I do want to take one step back though, because this is not a blue wall story. This is not a Sun Belt story. This is not a Western part of the country story. If you pull up every single county in the country, you've got more than 3,000 counties in the country, and you show where Donald Trump has outperformed his 2020 results by 3 percent or more.",
