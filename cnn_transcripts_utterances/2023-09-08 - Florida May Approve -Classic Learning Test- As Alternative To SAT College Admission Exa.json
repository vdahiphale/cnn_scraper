      "sentences": "Any moment now, the Board of Governors for Florida's public universities expects to approve a new college entrance exam. It's called the Classic Learning Test, or CLT. It's going to serve as an alternative to the SAT and ACT tests. The new entrance exam is popular among Christian schools and conservative political groups, but it's been criticized by some educators as being too narrowly focused on religion to predict academic success in college. If it's approved, Florida would become the first State University system to accept the test.It is the latest move by Governor Ron DeSantis to shake up Florida's education system. Let's discuss it now with Andrew Spar. He's the president of the Florida. Education Association. Andrew, thanks so much for being with us. So what has your experience been with the CLT?",

We represent professors at all the universities, all the public universities in the state of Florida. And we're hearing from them that they are not happy with what's going on at the university level in Florida. And you know, Florida has some of the best universities, and yet our professors are talking about leaving there in droves right now because of decisions that are being made in Florida like this move to allow for an entrance exam that does not appear to really adequately predict how well students will do at the collegiate level.",

And in 2016 and 2021 enhanced the availability of the drug and it's those two steps that are especially at issue here with this 5th Circuit ruling and the reason the Department of Justice is expected to come in pretty strongly here. Is because it goes to not only the FDA approval of mifepristone, but FDA approval for all drugs and its ability to use its own expertise to ascertain the effectiveness and safety -- Jim. Yes, it'll be remarkable to see what the conservative majority of the Supreme Court, how they would rule on this, given the ruling on Roe. Joan Biskupic, thanks so much. Lots to follow -- Boris.",

Which essentially saved Damar Hamlin's life on the field on a Monday Night Football game last season before the world watching.And they actually, mid game -- mid season changed the concussion protocol after your team's quarterback, the Miami Dolphins Tua Tagovailoa had a scary concussion. So they are really vigilant now about making sure this game is continuing to be as safe as it can be. I think the biggest thing we're seeing -- the difference today, is this culture shift. This mindset in regard to player health and safety. We had a game cancelled mid game for the first time ever last season with that Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals game.
