Wounded women and children, many injuries horrific. The pile of body bags growing by the hour. At times the dead seem to outnumber the living. Naval ships calm the coast as drones hover overhead documenting the destruction. Explosion after explosion, the IDF targeting tunnels used by Hamas fighters hitting both military and civilian infrastructure.

And as long as we do this, everybody can kind of feel like they're involved somehow, right?So Hezbollah wants to show solidarity to Hamas that it's involved. And it's helping to defend Hamas, in its hour of need, as Israel is waging a battle against Hamas from the Gaza Strip. However, it's not sustainable. And we also can all keep in mind that any miscalculation can easily lead to a larger configuration. I think that the bigger question here, John, is after Israel was surprised on October 7th by Hamas, and is now trying to eliminate that threat and degrade Hamas' capabilities to the greatest possible extent. Candidate isn't willing, better yet, to live with another enemy of this stronger, more soldiers, more weapons, more rockets at its northern front. It would mean that it would end the war with Hamas, but still have a sword up against its neck in the north. And I'm not advocating another war here necessarily. But what I'm saying is, we have this other threat that might now seem to be small but it's quite large.

One is for the continued supply of weapons, two is for the continued supply of spare parts, and for its airplane and aircraft.

For details on how you can help, a special section of our website, cnn.com/impact.Now to the race for the White House. The Michigan Supreme Court has rejected a bid to remove Donald Trump's name from the state's primary ballot. But he could still be kept off for general election ballot. Trump is facing 14th Amendment charges in seven states by groups arguing he should be disqualified because he engaged in insurrection. Trump's ballot ban in Colorado is now on hold indefinitely after an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. But the challenge did not come from Trump's legal team. CNN's Paula Reid has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  The Republican Party of Colorado has filed an appeal asking the Supreme Court of the United States to overturn that unprecedented decision from the Colorado Supreme Court last week and remove former President Trump from the ballot. Now Trump has signaled he too will appeal in that ruling that, but he hasn't done so yet. But the GOP has been a party in this litigation. They are fighting for the ability to list Trump as a candidate and on the primary ballot. And one of the immediate impacts of this appeal is that the Colorado decision is now on pause. And until a Supreme Court reveals whether it wants to get involved. They're under enormous pressure to take up this case and to offer some clarity on exactly who the 14th Amendment applies to, and the extent that states have power to remove candidates from the ballots. It's unclear if the Supreme Court will take this up or how long it will take them to decide. But because of this appeal, that Colorado decision now on hold. Now, one of the places where this question of whether Trump will be on the ballot is still outstanding, is the state of Maine. Now, what's interesting about Maine is there, the Secretary of State is actually the first one to review ballot eligibility, and then it can go to the courts to be appealed. And Trump and his team calling for the Secretary of State to be recused -- to recuse herself from this case. They are arguing that things that she said about January 6th should make her ineligible to review this case. And she is expected to make her decision on this any day now, she did not respond to our request for comment, though it does appear unlikely that she would recuse herself. Now, the special counsel Jack Smith also hard at work just days after the holiday, he has filed a request with the court to limit Trump's ability to argue that he is the victim of political persecution if and when the January 6th federal case goes to trial. Now, that whole case is on hold right now while larger, constitutional questions are appealed. But the special counsel hopes to be able to take that case to trial before the 2024 election. In order to make that happen, he continues to make filings and requests of the courts so that once those appeals are resolved, if he prevails, he can move ahead with trial as quickly as possible.

And so, that will have the results of tarnishing democratic ideals and democratic vocabulary in his supporters' minds. And that's very dangerous because throughout the history of the United States are democratic rhetoric. The fact that America is tied to the rhetoric of democracy has been used as a tool against racial injustice, against Jim Crow, against the confederacy, against slavery. So, the fact that America is tied to the rhetoric of democracy has been a weapon to shore up our democracy. Donald Trump is going after that weapon.
