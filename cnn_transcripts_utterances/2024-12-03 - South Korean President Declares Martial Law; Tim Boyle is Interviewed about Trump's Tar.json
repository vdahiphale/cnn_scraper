And that is what we are all trying to figure out right now.I'll tell you, John, I live about two minutes away from the bureau here, in the heart of Seoul, South Korea. John, there are police officers on the phone who are calling their captains and are asking, what do we do? What - what is this now that martial law is declared in this bastion of stability and democracy in South Korea? This bastion of stability and democracy in east Asia. So, what has happened over the past hour? We have the president of South Korea, Yoon Suk Yeol, going on television and addressing to the nation that he's instituting martial law, but he doesn't go into what measures specifically he wants to put forward, saying, John, that martial law is needed in South Korea, from his point of view, to rid his government of forces that are sympathetic - or rid the government of forces that are sympathetic to North Korean forces and communist forces. So, we are - you should know, if you don't live here in Asia, this is a government that has been under fire. Yoon Suk Yeol, the president of South Korea, is very unpopular. His popularity approval rating hovering around 20, the low 20 percent. So, we're trying to figure out what exact kind of power move this is. The leader of the opposition says, hey, this is illegal. This cannot happen. But, John, we're going to be watching protesters who are heading to parliament right now who may be clashing with police. Buckle up. We will be waiting to see how this unfolds in the next few hours, John.",
