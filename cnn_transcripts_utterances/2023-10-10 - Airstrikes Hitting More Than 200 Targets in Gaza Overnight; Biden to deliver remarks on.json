Thanks for being with us at 5This morning, noon in Israel, they are warning that punishing strikes against Hamas and Gaza are just the beginning, as its military retaliates against the group's surprise attacks which killed more than 900 Israelis. Hamas is threatening to execute hostages they've taken if Israel continues its strikes without warning. The IDF says it hit at least 200 targets overnight. CNN's Wolf Blitzer spoke with an American pediatrician on a humanitarian mission to Gaz who is now trapped there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. BARBARA ZIND, AMERICAN PEDIATRICIAN:  Whenever you go to Gaza you always know that there's danger and some violence while you are there. But, no, I wasn't -- sorry -- prepared for this.",

Reports of as many as 300,000. Although, I can't confirm those numbers, but reports that as many as 300,000 troops are now on that southern border. And they continue with the intensity of these targeted strikes, which is seen as sort of military sort of parlance or terms as softening up the ground for a ground attack or incursion.But the IDF has also said, and I quote them here, \"The issue here is that we have been tasked with mitigating or making sure that Hamas doesn't have any military capabilities at the end of the war. And that will be achieved,\" the IDF spokesman said. And he went on to say, what happens on the way and how we implement that task will be seen. But at this stage, we continue to strike from the air and there are plans to, of course, expand that. And the troops, the reserves and the regular units that are amassing along the southern border are readying for their tasks, he said. So, I think to answer your question, a ground incursion does seem very likely. Everybody that we've spoken to, both on and off the record here, has said that that is very much on the table. I think what's going on here is that the IDF, the Israeli authorities, are just not releasing their plans at this point.",

We have got news Iran's supreme leader says that Tehran was not involved in the Hamas attack on Israel. So, this is the first televised speech from the ayatollah, Khomeini, since these attacks happened.Now, he did apparently, in this speech, were reporting praise the acts. Supporters of the Zionist regime and some from that uprising regime have said some nonsense, these past days, the Islamic Republic of Iran was behind this attack. They are mistaken. Those who say the acts of the Palestinians come from non-Palestinians don't have a true understanding. And it did say that, I guess, Khomeini praised those who did plan the attack, he just says, Iran was not involved. What's your takeaway here?",

The Iranians would deny any involvement but they have not officially. Becky Anderson, thank you very much. I'm sure we'll see you much more throughout the day.And President Biden is set to deliver new remarks on Israel today. involvement. Becky, thank you very much. And President Biden set to deliver remarks on Israel today. It will be the second time he has done so since the launch of Hamas' surprise assault Saturday. Biden says 11 Americans have been killed in Israel and it's likely that some are being held by Hamas.

You know, NSC Spokesperson John Kirby making it clear yesterday the Biden administration has no intention of putting American boots on the ground. But I think that there are still questions about the details of Biden's plan to provide aid to Israel in response to this attack.

But what this has done is this has confused the conference, this has further divided the conference, and it has complicated the task of electing a speaker. People are unsure about what McCarthy is doing, what he means, and what is going to happen.And so, last night, again, in this closed-door meeting with no cellphones and no staff, there were people who stood up and said that they would only elect Kevin McCarthy as speaker. And so, while there is -- I would put the chances at pretty much zero that he is going to be speaker again.

The math is just really tough.But let's turn back to Israel for a second, Leigh Ann, because there is this issue on the other side of the capital in the Senate where Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama has this blanket hold on military nominees, ambassadors. And right now, there are a number of incredibly important national security positions that are unfilled because of this, whether it's top generals or the ambassador, you know, the U.S. doesn't currently have confirmed ambassador to Israel.

When I served in the Obama administration as their senior liaison to the House for the State Department, and the idea of not having a speaker functioning effectively is just unthinkable. We would have to go provide classified briefings to the speaker, the speaker would make decisions right there with direct committees what to do and how to do it. And so, this speaker, currently the acting one has national security background, is not clear if legal divisions can fully be made. And in a time of crisis, it really undermines our ability to project strength and power and be effective on the global stage.

And the speaker said, yes. And that meant that the committees, Foreign Affairs, Armed Service, our Intelligence, other committees that had impact, that had oversight of those issues were read in and were able to make decisions quickly and work closely with the Pentagon in that case and our allies.You take that away, it's like you are unplugging the tub and the water is going right down the drain, and we don't know how to ensure that decisions are fully made.
