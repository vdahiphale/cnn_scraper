The president-elect appearing on the cover of the magazine as Person of the Year, ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange to mark that honor. Just ahead, I'll speak with the man who interviewed him. Unidentified frustrating objects. The U.S. government says there is no national security threat, no foreign connection to mysterious drone sightings along the East Coast. So, then what could they be? And if you're shopping for a tablet this Christmas, well, you are in luck. The oldest known stone carving of the Ten Commandments is going on sale. If you've got cash. That conversation and more coming up. First though, President-Elect Donald Trump taking a break from his inauguration plans to accept two big honors in New York. Ringing the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange, flanked by family members, Vice President-Elect J. D. Vance, as well as a number of executives. That appearance, of course, part of Time Magazine's naming of Donald Trump as its Person of the Year. It's actually the second time Trump has been given that honor by Time. U.S. stocks, though, not seeing much of a Trump bump on Thursday, the major averages falling across the board after a key gauge of inflation came in higher than expected. That said, though, Trump's re-election, well, the day since Trump's election, they've been pretty good for investors so far. The Dow and the S&amp;P up some 4 percent since Election Day. Tech stocks, as you can see there, up almost 8 percent. Mark is, of course, hoping for a more investor friendly and business friendly tone in Washington. Donald Trump discussed some of his economic plans earlier today on Wall Street. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT:  We're going to give tremendous incentive like no other country has. We're cutting your taxes. We're going to cut them very substantially. We are incentivizing everybody to come back to the United States. We want you back here, car manufacturers, everybody. And we have one product that nobody has really to the extent that we do, it's called oil and gas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Time Magazine Political Correspondent Eric Cortellessa was one of the people who interviewed Trump for its Person of the Year issue, and he joins me now. It's great to have you with us. You covered a lot in this piece. There is no president -- no elected official, frankly, who can fulfill every campaign process -- promise, rather. But as we just heard from him at the New York Stock Exchange, he is talking about prices. And we missed the tail end of what he said there, but he went on to say that with more drilling, with more oil and gas, he believes that would then, in turn, lower prices. You also asked him, about the cost of living, about lower prices, and whether he would see his presidency as a success if he couldn't bring those down. He said to you, quote, \"It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard, but I think that they will.\" Is it your sense that he feels any pressure to deliver on that promise of lowering prices for Americans?",

He wants to concentrate power in his own hands if he's president again. And this is what Arthur Schlesinger referred to as the imperial presidency, the design to restrict the power of Congress. You know, Donald Trump, as you said, a lot of governing trifecta going into January, and he really is not organizing his agenda around legislative pushes. He wants to extend the tax cuts that will expire early in 2025 that he passed in 2017. He wants to pass an immigration overhaul bill, border security bill. But other than that, he wants to take executive action. He wants to do executive orders. When I asked him why his agenda was so executive driven when he had the ability to pass major legislation, he essentially said that it was easier to sign executive orders that he didn't have to, you know, go through the complexity of Congress and no matter its composition, but he also recognized limitations of that, which is that a successor could undo what he does through executive action.

But you know, Donald Trump was sort of wistful that his last campaign was behind him. He started to ruminate on his final campaign rally. On how he had overcome obstacles that would sink any other kind of candidate, whether it's scandals, criminal conviction, you name it. And he said it's sad in a way, it will never happen again.

I expect that in terms of the kind of tariffs you see, it's going to be very ad hoc.

And so, it's not as though there's a 360 strategy that we can say this is exactly how things are going to roll out. I think that you're going to see a lot of bargaining. I think you're going to see Trump threatening tariffs in exchange for perhaps increased defense spending on the part of Europe, Europe taking more responsibility for its own defense and security. You know, in terms of how the global economy is going to react, I have to say, yes, it's been a great year, particularly for the U.S. And the equity markets have been incredible, but let's face it, even if we didn't have the threat of tariffs coming down the pike, we're overdue for a market correction. There's a lot of froth in the U.S. market. A lot of people feel the U.S. market is overvalued. We're about six years overdue for a recession. So, the market has been propped up for a long time.

But, you know, we're dealing with a big personality here, and I think that there are just a lot of challenging -- seriously challenging global events that are in play. I mean, just think about Taiwan, for example. What if China, which is already sort of taunting Trump by calling Taiwan an orphan nation now that he's in charge, because he's questioned, hey, does the U.S. need to care about Taiwan? What if China were to use this as an opportunity to blockade or invade? What's he going to do then? He doesn't want to seem weak. He doesn't want to lose allies. He doesn't want to ruin, you know, supply chains and chips, but is he going to act? Trump doesn't like wars. He doesn't like conflict in certain ways.

We have, of course, been following what is really some of the worst air pollution for theregion in the world right now, and has been terrible for weeks at this point. A lack of wind means toxins, frankly, have nowhere to go. It traps them then close to the ground. The phenomena has become just another part of winter for people in New Delhi. It is placing the country's children at risk. Hanako Montgomery reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For three-year-old Chahath (ph) and his baby sister, clean air is a luxury that their parents can barely afford. MUSKAN, RAGPICKER (through translator):  I feel scared that my children might die. I'm filled with regret when I think about what might happen to them. MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  Delhi's air is so toxic that Muskan says her kids have needed a nebulizer since birth. She spent months saving up for this machine, rag picking the very trash that's also poisoning her children, earning just a dollar a day. MUSKAN (through translator):  During the winter months, their ribs start to hurt, mucus freezes in their chest, they vomit too. We're so worried. I have three children. They keep falling sick in this dust. MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  But her children are the lucky ones. DEEPAK (PH) (through translator):  The doctor asked us to buy a nebulizer, but we don't have that kind of money. MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  When Deepak's (ph) daughter struggles to breathe, they rush to a nearby clinic, where he says each breath costs more than his daily wage. Nights are his worst fear. No doctors, just bombs and thoughts of mounting medical costs. DEEPAK (PH) (through translator):  I want to leave Delhi, but I can't because I need to pay off a debt for my daughter's health. MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  Every winter, toxic smog blankets Delhi. A deadly mix of smoke from crop fires, coal plants, and traffic. Officials block cars and close schools, as air pollution can hit 60 times the World Health Organization's air quality guidelines. But like winter, the smog returns every year, and its biggest victims are the tiniest lives.",

For years, environmentalists have warned this butterfly's population is shrinking. Many blame climate change as a major factor to the decline. Scientists say the loss of pollinators, like the monarch, could have far reaching consequences for ecosystems and for the people who rely on them. By protecting the butterfly under the endangered species act, officials hopes they can stabilize and perhaps even reverse its population decline through a variety of methods.

Mount Gerizim is a site sacred to the Samaritan people, and they included that one has to get to 10 for the Ten Commandments.
