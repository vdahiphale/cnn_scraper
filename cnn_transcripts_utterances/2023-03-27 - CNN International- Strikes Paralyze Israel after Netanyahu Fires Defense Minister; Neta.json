Just ahead happening right now a massive protest in Israel hundreds of thousands of workers holding a general strike against the government's plans to overhaul the judicial system more on this deepening political crisis in a moment Vladimir Putin provoking a swift response with his announcement to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus we'll get the view from Moscow.And Prince Harry is back in London. We'll tell you, why? We begin with a country in crisis, more strikes, more protests, paralyzing Israel and turning up the pressure on the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This is happening after he fired the Defense Minister, who suggested putting his judicial overhaul on hold. We've just heard the first comments from Netanyahu on this pivotal day. He sent a tweet, moments ago calling on all demonstrators to behave responsibly and not act violently. Right now, the backlash is consuming the country with the largest union calling for an historic strike is affecting everything from airports to seaports to McDonald's. More than two dozen mares are on a hunger strike to protest against the overhaul. Moments ago, the Israeli Justice Minister who's a major backer of the legislation suggested it could be delayed and warned that lawlessness could bring the government down.

And half-jokingly they said, well, how's it going over there with the Israeli spring? And I got to say that, although Israel is very different than our neighboring countries, because it is still, at least for now, a democracy.There is a lot to it, because I think what we see - is a very big part of the Israeli society that even if maybe at the beginning, it was more the usual suspects of the leftist and the liberals. I think it has grown and grown and grown and grown in recent weeks. That now the majority of Israelis, even those who voted for Netanyahu in the last elections, are in the streets, because they realize that what is going on is not a judicial reform, it is something far worse. And it is something that can influence their most basic freedoms.",

And I think that what brought the change is what Netanyahu did yesterday. You know, it's funny that at the beginning, it's almost comical; that you know his tweet from a few minutes ago that he said people should act responsibly.When last night he fired the Minister of Defense that he appointed only because the Minister of Defense warned that the judicial overhaul has become a threat to Israel's National Security and I think that the firing of the Minister of Defense, I think, rattled a lot of Israelis and brought those spontaneous demonstrations last night where you had more than 100,000 people at 12 at midnight, demonstrating on Israel's main highway in Tel Aviv, - the people. And those demonstrations continued today and brought this strike were announced a few hours ago. And I think that what we're seeing now to resolve the - result of a popular uprising of people went to the streets and said enough is enough.",

      "sentences": "Well, definitely the Europeans, Max, have said this is a threat to European security and they called on Belarus. To push back on this Russian announcement, they said it's up to Belarus to decide whether or not these missiles are accepted on its territory.There's been no sign of Belarus doing that, by the way. There's been a bit more of a Kremlin response, though, from the United States, the State Department of the U.S. Officials saying that, you know, they don't see any reason to change the nuclear threat posture of the U.S. and they're not seeing any sign either of Russia moving closer towards using a nuclear weapon. I mean, I think it's important that to remember that, you know, whether or not these missiles, tactical nuclear missiles, small battlefield nuclear devices, are moved to Belarus, that doesn't impact the ability of Russia to use them. You - use them now from their facilities inside Russia. And what this is being seen as is much more of a sort of, you know symbolic gesture in terms of public opinion. Well, overseas as well, definitely, but public opinion at home. And we've sort of taken a straw poll of people out on the street in Moscow earlier today. And for the most part, people are very supportive of this. They're saying, look, you know, Russia needs to do whatever it can to defend itself and you know, this is very much seen as a move in that direction. It's also being interpreted I think, by people who are closely watching the sort of situation in the Kremlin, etcetera. As being a move to tighten the Kremlin's grip on Belarus, because these missiles remember, and not just going to be given to Belarus they're still going to be under the command and control of Russian forces. So that means if and when they're sent there, there'll be large numbers of Russian Military personnel that go with them. And so it's going to increase the military presence of Moscow inside its allied a neighboring country of Belarus and so it's almost like Russia is slowly but surely tightening its grip over its Belarusian ally, Max.",

This was the first weekend and three that we didn't get bad news about a bank in the United States or elsewhere. And of course, that news around Silicon Valley Bank that after a bidding process. They finally found via First Citizens Bank will come in and take on most of their assets, loans and deposits.They are getting a discount of $16.5 billion portfolio of 72 billion, according to the FDIC, but there are sweeteners in their things like a credit line, it's a share loss agreement whereby they share their losses with the regulators and it does stabilize things for depositors and that is key. Silicon Valley Bank 17 legacy branches will reopen this morning in the United States as a division of First Citizens Bank that means people will be able to access their money and all of that. So that's why partly we're seeing this sense of relief in the markets the sense that the regulators are sort of cleaning up behind the scenes mopping all of this up. We are going to get more questions though this week. Congressional hearing start tomorrow on why Silicon Valley Bank failed?",

The scene behind me really paints a picture of what this town looks like throughout just about 2000 residents here and much of this community, it's just gone.There are very few portions of this community that were untouched by that EF-4. What really is striking to us though, as we look at these images here in the force of the wind that did this to this car, wedging it between these vehicles ripping off roofs, you know, everyone has been affected here, but they're still chipping in to help? Earlier we met a Police Officer here Antwan Jones, he's been on the Police force for five years. He took cover in a bathroom tub with his girlfriend and he was literally picked up and floating around in the air.

But we have not heard from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.We were supposed to all of the Israeli media was reporting that in the morning hours, he was going to come out give a speech announcing that he was potentially going to halt this legislation, this massive judicial overhaul, and yet we have had absolutely no speech from him yet. But in the meantime, the Israeli economy and essentially its society have ground to a halt the largest labor union in Israel. He stood route announced a massive strike that's also been joined by other elements of the private sector, Max everything from the major ports, from the airport for some time. Even McDonald's has gone on strike against this judicial overhaul, and especially the reactions from over the weekend when Benjamin Netanyahu fired his Defense Minister for being the first Minister to come out and speak out against these judicial overhaul saying reforms are needed, he said, but just the way that it's being pushed through is causing such divisiveness in Israeli society. He warned that it's causing a real incredible threat to Israeli security. Meanwhile, we have actually heard from Benjamin Netanyahu in the last hour. So he did issue a tweet, saying I call on all the demonstrators in Jerusalem, on the right and on the left to behave responsibly and not to act violently. We are brotherly people. There have been calls from the far right wing fringe movements in Israel to come out against these protesters that you can see behind me there are fears that some of these groups could get violent. I do have to say max at the protests over the last 24 hours. They have felt different, they have felt angrier, everyone is still waiting on Benjamin Netanyahu to hear him come out and either say he's pushing forward with this legislation where they're have to say honestly fewer and fewer voices supporting that move, or whether he will heed the call from essentially all sectors of Israeli society, including these protesters calling on him to at least freeze legislation for some time, Max.",

I have very many right wing friends, a lot of people who actually support the changes that are trying to be made through the legislature, but are completely against the way that it's being railroaded through, and the divisions it's causing in the country.
