And she's essentially arguing that this is not an aberration. This is emblematic of the contempt that the former President has for women in her view that she has a track record of fighting for women. And she often likes to say on the campaign trail that it is because of Trump that women are living -- one in three women are living in states with Trump abortion bans. Take a listen.Okay. But she's not only focusing on this issue, Boris and Brianna, because there is limits to the strength of that argument. Democrats will argue in some corners. And so that's why here today, we're also going to hear her talk about the opportunity economy, what she's doing to bring down the cost for families. And a big focus of this pitch is Latino voters in states like this one. A Mexican band will perform here later on today in Vegas. She's going to be joined by Jennifer Lopez. So much of her argument to these constituencies are rooted in family, just a real nod to the culture there. But I'm curious to see how she talks about this issue of immigration. She often, on the campaign trail, says that she would pass a bipartisan border security bill, one that the former President did all that he could, in her view, to squash. But she also has to balance that with talking about this issue compassionately. Here in this audience today, I'm told, are going to be immigrants' rights activists.

They're cheering wildly right now. It appears that maybe the vehicle is pulling up. The question, of course, is whether those comments are going to turn off moderate or undecided voters, especially women, and whether the former President will be able to close that gender gap. Now, as for why he is in Albuquerque, it's not a very obvious campaign destination for him. Trump lost his deep blue state by 100,000 votes last time around. We do know that he is trying to make gains with the Latino voters here, perhaps undoing some of the damage done at that garbage remark by the comedian at the Madison Square Garden rally, and also trying to boost the local House Senate race here -- sorry, the House Race in the Second District where a Republican is trying to take over that seat and possibly flip the race.

      "sentences": "Yes, some good data today. Cooling inflation once again. This is always good news for consumers. 2.1%, this is PCE. This is the Fed's preferred gauge because it shows a wide range of prices. It also looks at prices in urban centers and rural areas. And you can see right there, cooling inflation year-over-year, 2.1%, ticking up month over month. That was largely expected, though, maybe some higher food prices. But this is what the Fed likes to see. And this is what they're going to use along with other economic data to decide if they're going to cut rates again. And the expectation is that they will.However, that meeting, Boris and Brianna, is actually just right after the election. So you're going to have the election play out and then you're going to have the Fed making decisions about any rate cuts. Obviously, that will have a trickle effect afterwards. But this is good economic data. And consumers should really be pleased where inflation is right now. 2.1% is just flirting with that 2% that the Fed wants to see. Of course, you mentioned some Americans, though, maybe not feeling that totally, maybe struggling with cost of living in other areas. Wages have kept up with inflation, but we haven't seen wage growth across all sectors. And that may be something that many Americans are still dealing with.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Is this going to be an October surprise? We'll see. I mean, the thing to look at here is that there are two major factors that are going to play into this report, the last one that we're going to see before the election. You have to take into account, the two hurricanes that we saw, Hurricane Helene and Milton. That maybe slowed hiring. And also, you had several strikes, including one strike still ongoing, the Boeing strike, 33,000 members on the picket line still, that's having a downstream effect of thousands of jobs being impacted.And the White House is already bracing for this. They are saying that this is going to be a harder report than usual. There's going to be temporary impacts, potentially upwards of 100,000 in terms of taking a bite out of this jobs report. They're saying, this is temporary, they're saying this is going to be difficult, but they are still very confident in the economy. One last point, though, about a potential October surprise is the ADP jobs report came out just yesterday and it showed that hiring in the private sector was extremely strong, about 233,000 jobs added. That's double what was expected. So while we are expecting a weaker report tomorrow in the public sector, you never know. These numbers are wild. They swing. We'll just have to see what it ends up being. But no doubt both campaigns are going to jump on whatever number that is and try to encourage voters that they're on the right side of these numbers, guys.",

Catherine, inflation down, wages up. And here's a piece of data that really stood out to us from that GDP report from the Commerce Department. Americans actually have more disposable income compared to what they had before the pandemic, $4,000 more per year. And yet, they still say they're feeling squeezed. They're still saying that. Explain why.",
