      "sentences": "Good morning from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We are in the convention hall right here, where it is all happening for Republicans this week. Soon, day two of the Republican National Convention kicks off and the buildup begins for Donald Trump's former primary rival to take the stage. Today, Nikki Haley is expected to speak as the convention focus shifts today to crime, immigration and supporting law enforcement and today's theme takes on new meaning now, less than 72 hours after the assassination attempt on former President Trump.He entered this hall to wild enthusiasm last night. This was his first public appearance since Saturday's shooting. The crowd chanting, fight, fight, fight, at one point, the same words that Donald Trump himself shouted from that rally stage as Secret Service were rushing him off after that attempted assassination in Pennsylvania. Trump, now officially the Republican nominee after yesterday's roll call vote, appeared with his now new running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance last night, Vance will be giving his big speech here tomorrow, overnight, though, sending out a message that ended with, onward to victory. There's also a new reporting today on the last minute behind the scenes push that happened to secure Vance's spot on the ticket, including a push from Elon Musk, who spoke with Donald Trump less than 24 hours before he announced his running mate. A lot to get to that happened last night, a lot to get to that is still ahead. Let's get over to CNN's Alayna Treene to lead us off. Alayna, what are you learning about why Donald Trump selected J.D. Vance? What's the new reporting?",

      "sentences": "Well, there's a number of reasons, Kate. I am told, actually, that the aftermath of the shooting did not really change his decision. So, J.D. Vance and Donald Trump met Saturday morning. Vance flew to Mar-a-Lago hours before the rally and what ultimately ended up being the attempted assassination on Donald Trump. And I'm told that that meeting went very well. One source familiar with the meeting said that it really felt like the final interview before Vance got the job. Now, Donald Trump was very complimentary of the Ohio senator and they left feeling good about their chances, though, of course, Donald Trump had not yet really offered him the position just yet. Actually Donald Trump, or J.D. Vance, I should say, had just learned that he was going to be Donald Trump's running mate only about 20 minutes before the rest of the world knew. Take a listen to how Vance described that moment last night in an interview with Fox News.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH):  He just said, look, I think I'm going to go save this country. I think you're the guy who could help me in the best way. You could help me govern. You could help me win. You could help me in some of these Midwestern states, like Pennsylvania, Michigan and so forth. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Alayna Treene for us.So, for the first time since the assassination attempt on his political rival, President Biden is also back on the campaign trail today. Biden is in battleground state Nevada this morning. And the new reporting is his new focus is to drill down on policy, not personality, as he makes the case against Donald Trump. And he has a full schedule of campaign events planned, more chances also to try and prove Democratic doubters wrong that he can run, win, and lead for another four years. CNN's Arlette Saenz is tracking this for us. She's at the White House this morning. Arlette, the public calls for Biden to bow out have gone totally silent in the recent days. What are you hearing about this?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, President Biden's allies had hoped that these calls for him to step aside in their race would subside in the wake of that assassination attempt, and also some of the president's performances over the past few weeks. But CNN has learned that, privately, the pressure is still growing on the president from some top Democrats to leave this race that includes a top Democratic pollster, Stanley Greenberg, sending regular memos to Biden's inner circle warning about what he has seen when it relates to the president remaining on this ticket.There are also some Democratic lawmakers who have been trying to urge Biden's team to consider what the president's legacy would be if he were to continue on the top of the Democratic ticket and potentially lose not just his own race, but also impact the chances of Democrats in House and Senate races. Now, so far, President Biden has not shown any sign of backing down, even as someone in his party have raised these questions about whether he should remain in this race. And the president today is charging ahead with his campaign, hitting the battleground state of Nevada. While he is there today, part of his goal will be trying to court black voters, participating in a BET interview, also speaking at an NAACP convention. Tomorrow, he will turn his focus to courting Latino voters at a key summit there in Las Vegas. The president today is also expected to really drill in on policy, rolling out some new actions to try to address housing costs in this country. That includes calling on Congress to cap the annual increase on rent to 5 percent of that would apply to major landlords who own over 50 units. He's also making a push specifically for Nevada, potentially repurposing unused or underused federally owned land to create about 15,000 new affordable housing units in the state. Nevada is a state that has been hit in recent years by a housing shortage as well as high costs. But another key challenge for President Biden in these coming days is how to campaign and the kind of language he uses as he makes his case against Donald Trump. In an interview with NBC last night, the president admitted it was a mistake to use the term, bull's eye, in a call with supporters as he was trying to urge them to turn their focus to Trump. And he also had this to say about the challenge he is facing at a time when he's encouraging Americans to lower the temperature in this country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And let me walk you through what we know and then give you some context here because we're really getting a glimpse into a relationship that is normally closed off to the general public, but it's very, very close.It's this almost familial relationship between law enforcement agencies. Sometimes that relationship under the surface is fraught, but it rarely bubbles up into public view, and that is certainly what is happening here. There's new CNN reporting this morning, a source telling CNN that there were local snipers inside the building where the shooter later perched to shoot former president Donald Trump. What we know is that there were snipers who were inside that building, they were on the second floor, and they were providing overwatch. We also know that the Secret Service did not sweep that building themselves because they say that was outside of the perimeter and that local police were supposed to secure that area. The Secret Service director, Kimberly Cheatle, spoke out. She says she's taking responsibility for this. Here's her interview with ABC News. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

For example, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police sent out a statement last night taking a lot of issue with what they perceive as way too much blame being put on local law enforcement for what was ultimately an operational plan signed off on by the Secret Service.Additionally, the executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police said this. Apparently, it took two days for the buck to stop. There is going to be an erosion of this trust caused by the Secret Service's injudicious statements. Additionally, the Pennsylvania State Police which was one of the agencies that was involved in this operational plan, has said that they work with the Secret Service to provide whatever is requested but, ultimately, that they are the lead in that security. So, again, you're seeing this fracture here, who's responsible for what. And certainly within local law enforcement, there's a perception way too much blame is being put on local law enforcement for what was a Secret Service operational plan. Meanwhile, the Secret Service is saying that they are taking responsibility for this. However, I think the issue here, John, is that they are not detailing their own failures here. Back to you.",

CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Yes, I think a couple things. One, I think if Donald Trump really thought that Democrats were going to dump Joe Biden and put Kamala Harris in there, I don't think he would have picked J.D. Vance. I think he would have called an audible and picked someone more, say, demographically interesting to compete with that. I think he feels very good about his position against Joe Biden to put, basically, double down on another white guy from a state he won twice and will definitely win again, right? So, there was no demographic interest here. This was about loyalty, and I think Scott's right about the future. But I also think it channels that Trump wants Trump wants to win. Listen, say all the things we've already said about Trump. He has not made a lot of mistakes in this election in the past few months. Someone smart is telling him, do not dance on Joe Biden's grave right now. Let the news cycle play out for the Democrats. Keep your mouth shut. Someone smart is telling him, distance yourself from the 2025 Project. It doesn't have to be true. Just say it because it looks bad for you right now. He is doing the things he needs to do to win.
