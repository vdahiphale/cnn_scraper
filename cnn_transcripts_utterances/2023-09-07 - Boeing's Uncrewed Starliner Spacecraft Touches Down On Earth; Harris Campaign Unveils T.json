Janet, good morning to you.Let's start where Kristin left off this decision not to put Williams and Wilmore on this capsule return. You still think that's the right call, considering the questions about safety? JANET IVEY, CEO AND FOUNDER, JANET'S PLANET: I do, because when we think about what is the greatest resource in human spaceflight, it's humans. And I think no one wants to repeat an Apollo 1 or the Challenger disaster, Columbia disaster, and you simply don't know. I mean, you know, they're amazing engineers on the ground trying to figure out what was going on. You know, it's possible that on the way to the International Space Station in June, there was a glitch between, kind of like the software that was kind of like keeping those thrusters and in kind of like a continuous firing mode, never letting them truly cool down. That's why the Teflon extruded. So they didn't know, with that Teflon extrusion, with that somehow hinder the flight back. But I just will tell you, Victor and Amara, it's like every astronaut that I know, they said that after they returned to Earth, their first thought was, when can I get back to space? So these are career astronauts that have trained they've been there before. They're going to have an incredible story to tell, and they'll continue to do great science. And that's the hallmark of, you know, kind of like that -- the program right adaptability, the ability to adjust and change. You know, doesn't just affect Suni and Butch. It also affects Zena and Stephanie Wilson, because they are not going to be aboard their scheduled flight in February of 2025, but Zena said, you know, it's like, really, we make a grander sacrifice for the good of everyone.",

Yes, but, you know, I am a bit confused about these comments from NASA officials, and they maintained it again after the successful return of the Starliner without the crew saying that it would have been a safe and successful landing had the crew been on board.I mean, do you take issue with that, that they keep saying that yes, they could have been on board, yet they decided against it because of safety issues.",

The airbags did what they needed to do, the parachutes, the service module dropped away. But again, I just think we're much more risk averse than we were, say, 60 years ago. I mean, compared to the Apollo 13 mission. Those three astronauts had a 10 percent chance of survival as they were shivering there in that little small thing, they watched the service module fall away, realize half of it's missing. The moon is in the distance. Kind of their dream of ever walking there is fading away, and they still splash down.I just think that, yes, it's fantastic for the Boeing and all their partners that it went well and landed so well in White Sands. One of the reasons the Polaris Dawn mission has been pushed off now for nearly two and a half three weeks is because of weather off the Florida coast. So landing in the desert with that soft landing, they could have, you know, they could land anytime. So, I think it's probably everybody -- I think NASA's comments are just hopeful that if it -- if they had made that decision, then who they would have been OK. But I think, you know, let's rather be safe than sorry, because, again, human life is very precious, and whether you're on the International Space Station or wherever.",

So that was the, I think, if there's any good cause for them to have called it and said, you know, Suni and Butch will stay aboard, that was it.

Let's start with the latest polling in the six battleground states that CNN and SSRS has gotten amongst registered voters, and it shows really mixed results here. Harris holding an advantage over Trump in Wisconsin and Michigan. Trump has an edge in Arizona, according to this poll. And then, you know, the voters -- the likely voters are pretty evenly split when it comes to both candidates in Georgia, Pennsylvania and in Nevada. But what really stuck out to me is this 15 percent of likely voters who are still undecided. I mean, that is significant, especially when you look at this timeline of just 59 days from election day. What's behind this, this undecided?",

Tens of millions of people will be watching. And specifically, I mean, I think they're going to tailor their messages to those 15 percent in Michigan and Arizona, Wisconsin, because those are the votes and the thousands of vote margins that, in the grand scheme of thing, is so small, but that both of the camps need to capture to win in November.",

He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the votes had rejected -- the voters had rejected him, he can never be trusted with power again.\" Really strong words there from a fellow Republican.

And experts believe that by Thanksgiving, drivers in most states could be paying less than 3 bucks a gallon. Here's CNN's Matt Egan.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER (on camera):  Gas prices are falling fast, and that is great news for consumers. Remember, two years ago, gas prices were above $5 a gallon, that was a nightmare. Thankfully, we are nowhere near that. In fact, gas prices recently fell to six-month lows. They're about 50 cents cheaper than they were at this point last year, and many Americans, they're paying even less. Gas is now below $3 a gallon in roughly 41,000 gas stations across the country. That's up from just about a 100 at this point last   year. And drivers in ten states are averaging less than $3 a gallon, including Texas, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee. [06:40:00] And analysts say that this trend, it's likely just getting started. GasBuddy tells CNN that by Thanksgiving, we could see 35 to 40 states with $3 or less gasoline, that would be very encouraging. As far as why prices are going down, there's a few factors here. One of them is strong supply especially here in the U.S., another factor is weak demand especially in China. All of this explains why we've seen oil prices recently plunged below $70 a barrel for the first time all year. The oil market is so weak that OPEC Plus, the producer group led by Russia and Saudi Arabia, they've had to come to the rescue by canceling plans to add supply. Now, I want to stress that the mood of the oil market can change in an instant, but for now, all things are pointing to lower prices for consumers at the gas pump. Now, former President Trump, he weighed in on this issue the other day, promising that if he becomes President, he'll get gas prices below $2 a gallon. Now, this may be one promise that Trump hopes doesn't come true, because analysts tell me that to get gas prices that low, demand would have to crash. And that's something that typically only happens in an economic crisis. So, sure, dirt, cheap gas prices sounds great, but not if it means a global recession. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

An \"FT\" newspaper first of all in the heart of Hamster Teeth in London.The topics we're likely to hear them address of course, CIA Director Bill Burns, key as a negotiator, trying to find some sort of negotiated settlement and a ceasefire around the ongoing conflict in Gaza, Israel, as well. Deeply troubled tasks, certainly, that's seen enormous frustration voiced I think by multiple officials involved, real hope held out by the Biden administration, they can achieve this goal. Despite in the last day, some of their officials expressing to my colleague doubts that may indeed even be possible. But on top of that too, they have just penned an editorial this morning released in the \"Financial Times\" where they talk about how the world order, the international order is under threat now, as it never has been before. I think the appearance behind me here will be a bid to show that Trans-Atlantic U.K.-U.S. alliance, thriving like never before. They will call again for a ceasefire in the Middle East, something which both they say their services have worked tirelessly towards, and they also will praise and they have praised in this editorial, the innovation, the resilience, and what they call the in-land of the Ukrainians in adapting their resistance to Russia's invasion now over 30 months old. They also too, in that editorial, they are stark in their criticism of what they refer to as Russia's reckless campaign of sabotage across Europe, something we've reported on, but a lot of mysterious instances of important  infrastructure. Some of it related to assistance to Ukraine coming on the damage. But really a rare appearance we'll see here in about ten minutes from now, where both Washington and London keen to show the strength of their reliance, be clear about the areas where they see consistency and promote, I think, on top of all of this, their continued support for Ukraine and the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza.
