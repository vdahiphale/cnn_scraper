CNN's Delia Gallagher with more.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In many respects, Benedict the 16th was the pope who got a bad rap. Nearly 24 years as Pope John Paul II's doctrinal enforcer, and a German childhood lived in the shadows of Hitler's Nazi regime, he was often unflatteringly referred to as God's Rottweiler, or the Pantzer Cardinal. Years of negative publicity caused many of his accomplishments to go unnoticed. He was the first pope to go green, making the Vatican the first country in the world with a zero-carbon footprint, putting solar panels on its rooftops and bringing in electric vehicles, including a hybrid popemobile. He was Cardinal and Pope during the years when the Catholic Church's sex abuse scandals came to light, and he spearheaded the Vatican's efforts toward a zero-tolerance policy. It was too little too late for some, but it was Cardinal Ratzinger who organized the Vatican's response to the scandal, including creation of a special office at the Vatican to handle cases, extending, and in some cases eliminating the statute of limitations for victims. And as pope, publicly apologizing. POPE EMERITUS BENEDICT XVI, FORMER HEAD OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH: I am deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured. And I assure them, as a pastor, I do share in their suffering.",

And the surprise for which he will go down in history, being the first pope in modern times to resign, showed that the man everyone's thought of as a traditionalist was unafraid of bucking the biggest tradition of them all -- that a pope doesn't step down.",

What are people saying? What's the atmosphere like? BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTORYou know, usually what happens when a pope dies, and this has been going on obviously, for centuries in a city like Rome, is they ring the bells and the people of Rome come to the square to mourn the death of the Pope and to celebrate the life and legacy of the Pope. And so, what we're seeing here are Romans right now, we're seeing the regular tourists who happen to be here over the holiday season, but we're seeing a lot of everyday Roman citizens who heard the news, and this is the place where they'll come. The mood is not as somber, I suppose, it would be if the sitting Pope had died because this was largely expected. He resigned 10 years ago because of ill health. So, most of the people we're seeing here, are there a lot of curious people, a lot of people that just want to be part of the action. It's a beautiful day in Rome. And they're here to celebrate, you know, this is this, the Catholic Church, the Vatican is a huge, huge part of the Italian capital of Rome, of Italian life. And at times like this, you really see how Catholic the Italians really are. And they're here in full numbers, we're expecting to see a lot of people, pilgrims coming in who have really followed the life and legacy of Pope Benedict when he was Pope coming in through the through the days. When he lies in state, there will be a steady stream of people that, that pay their respects to him. And then the funeral, of course, will be a somber, that is what he wanted.

I wanted to mention also in terms of his resignation that, Pope Francis just two weeks ago said in an interview that he has already written a letter of resignation in the case that he should become incapacitated. I think the resignation of Pope Benedict had two aspects. One, it showed his great interior strength. When he spoke about his resignation afterwards, he said he spoke about -- he was very serene about it, because he spoke about it with God. He had a very deep spirituality, and he was very sure of himself. In that way, it was a very courageous move. I mean, absolutely floored everybody. But Pope Francis just two weeks ago said, you know, I've written a letter of resignation, in the case that I become incapacitated, and nobody blinked an eye.

There is very little natural immunity because they've had zero-COVID policies in for so long, and we've been dealing with this for years now at this point.

We know that their vaccination rates are not as high as they want it to be, and they don't have mRNA vaccines is a kind of a mix of all of that why we're seeing such a big surge there? BELL: Well, it was basically perfect fuel for the fire. And what's interesting is that there have been other countries like New Zealand and Australia that have also had zero-COVID policies and navigated out of those. But the difference is they waited until their vaccination rates were high, and then they let loose gradually on their restrictions. In contrast, China, as you pointed out, under vaccinated, low natural immunity, and then, they just kind of let loose of everything at the same time. So, if you do that, and you \"let it rip\", then, that's exactly what's going to happen, and unfortunately, that's what we're seeing.

I think, unfortunately, sometimes these overdoses happen and parents see no warning signs whatsoever, as we just heard in this last story.But other times there are important warning signs that parents should respond to. So, again, parents should talk to their teens open dialogue with them, ask them questions, approached from a place of curiosity. And warning signs that parents really want to be on the lookout for as they start to have this conversation are, first of all, you know, are teens aware that fentanyl is out there? Have they been approached and asked if they want to buy fentanyl online through sites like TikTok or Snapchat? But then, you know, some teens will have warning signs that include things like pre-existing mental health problems that have gone unaddressed. Depression, anxiety are some of the more common things that we see. And in fact, that's probably present in about 40 percent of teens who have an overdose. About one-third of teens have actually used opioids before. And so, this isn't the first time that they've used opioids before they overdose. And there are some teams that actually have an underlying opioid addiction. You know, I want to highlight that actually, you know, rates of experimentation with drugs across the United States are actually at almost an all-time low since we've started measuring these things.",

Something North Korea did in record numbers in 2022 -- in 2022 in terms of these launches. But the appearance has some speculating, could a woman someday rule North Korea? Joining me now to discuss this, author Lindsey Miller. Last year, she released a book, North Korea: Like Nowhere Else: Two Years of Living in the World's Most Secretive State. A pleasure to you -- to have you on, Lindsey. You lived in North Korea from 2017 to 2019. Your husband being a British diplomat. Looking at those photos, it is fascinating that you have Kim Jong-un parading his daughter out there. I believe she's believed to be his second child. But you know, knowing the speculation about Kim Jong-un's health as well, and of course, this photo op, and the way that the state media has referred to her as, you know, his beloved, most beloved precious child, what do you make of all that?

With North Korea, there is so much rumor and speculation and that's what makes short term no matter of long- term things impossible to predict. In terms of a female leader, there is a temptation to think that because North Korea is a patriarchal society, that there would be no room for a female Supreme Leader. However, there is nothing in the Constitution in North Korea or the existing orthodoxy that actually says that I think we're more likely going to be looking at a situation whereby if Kim Jong-un's health continues to deteriorate, that he could die before whoever in his bloodline is able to take over. In that case, the regime, while planning for that, could very well suggest Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un's sister as a temporary takeover for that leadership. And that would be a significant change.",
