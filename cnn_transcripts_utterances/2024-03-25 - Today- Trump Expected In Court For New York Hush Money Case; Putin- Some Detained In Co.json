      "sentences": "All right, a live look this morning at New York City, the site of Trump Tower, of course. Good morning. Thanks for waking up with us. I'm Kasie Hunt.Today was supposed to be day one of Donald Trump's first criminal trial. Instead, lawyers in his New York hush money case will get the chance to argue for a lengthy postponement or even a dismissal after the trial was delayed last week. The judge is holding a pretrial hearing in Manhattan to discuss discovery issues that caused this delay. If the trial were to start in April it would be the first of Trump's four criminal trials to begin and potentially, the only one to take place before the election. Joining me now to discuss, Stef Kight, politics reporter for Axios. And, Tia Mitchell, Washington correspondent for The Atlanta Journal- Constitution. Good morning to you both. Tia, let me start with you. The president -- or the former president, we expect to be in the courtroom for this. This, in many ways, was an error on the part of prosecutors who had to turn over all of this additional information here. What do you expect to play out here as Trump, honestly, has used this delay strategy pretty effectively? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION:  Yes. And we do know that the prosecutors have somewhat agreed to a limited delay -- this 30 days -- but I think Trump wants more. That's what he and his attorneys are going to argue. But the prosecutors are saying they've looked through the documents. It's not as bad as Trump's attorneys are trying to say as far as what they haven't received and how crucial it is to the case. So it will be in the hands of the judge, of course. But we know Trump wants more. That's been -- as you've noted, his play has been to try to buy more time and delay these trials, hopefully, until after the election is over.",

So, of course, the other thing that's playing out today, Stef, is that this is the deadline for the bond in his civil fraud trial and we could start to see his assets being seized today. It's a lot more complicated to seize property than it is to seize bank accounts. But, of course, that hasn't stopped the former president from blasting out these emails -- Trump Tower is mine -- trying to raise money off of it.",

I mean, it's very interesting and maybe expected to see the way the former president is reacting to this deadline, already kind of drawing attention to, again, justice officials coming after him and trying to paint himself the victim in all of this.As you point out, this is probably going to take some time. We're not sure exactly how quickly Letitia James is going to move on this -- whether we just get an indication of which properties she plans to take ownership of and how this is going to go down. But we know that the former president is already drawing attention to it -- already trying to spin the narrative -- and that's another one of his tactics. It's delay and also paint yourself the victim as often as possible all the way through November.",

We know his base is locked in and all of this just kind of further confirms what they believe about this being part of a political attack on Trump. And quite frankly, they consider it a political attack on them and their right to choose Trump as their leader.But we know that there are voters in the center that are persuadable and the more -- the longer these cases bog him and if these cases start -- and particularly, if he is found guilty -- that tends to draw support away from Trump in the center, which he would need if he's going to win the White House.",

Where Murkowski is saying even though he is the leader of the party, that means I might not see myself in the party anymore. But those voices are few and far between.

But after the State of the Union address, some people thought maybe they had given up on these executive orders to really crack down on people who illegally cross the border.But based on my conversations with numerous sources this is something that he is still considering and kind of holding onto to see 1) how the border numbers change. Over the spring and summer, they tend to rise. And also, of course, there's the political calculations here as well. Whether this again becomes a really central target from -- for Democrats. And we've seen, briefly, Democrats being able to go on offense on this issue following the failure of the bipartisan border deal. So I think for now, they're kind of riding that Democrats are using that to their advantage, but that could change and they are considering pretty drastic measures if so.",

Kim launched his campaign and was getting kind of the grassroots support -- not necessarily the establishment but it became clear that he was in the driver's seat. And then I think the establishment kind of followed suit. And the governor's wife, Mrs. Murphy, began to realize that there wasn't really a path forward. That he was able to coalesce that support. So, to me, it's kind of interesting because usually, you think the machine kind of pushes down on the every man.

One arrived in a wheelchair and a sort of hospital gown, basically unresponsive.Now, CNN has just asked the Kremlin about their condition and about videos that have surfaced online suggesting that they may have been tortured. A very resounding no comment. The Kremlin spokesperson saying, \"I leave this question unanswered.\" Now, on the question of the Kremlin and other Russian officials refusing to address that ISIS claim of responsibility, that was also put to the Kremlin. And they simply said that they are -- the investigation is ongoing and there is only preliminary data at this point. But it is striking that they aren't mentioning running with this idea of a connection to Ukraine in the face of that claim from ISIS itself. And in that vein, we have also learned from Russian state media that all four of those suspects have been -- that have been arrested are Tajik nationals. Now, they would have blended in in Russia. There are a lot of Central Asian migrants, particularly in big cities like Moscow there and are an important part of the workforce. But we do also know that ISIS and, in particular, ISIS-K, has been active in recruiting Tajik nationals. And the U.N., recently in a report, suggesting that has been increasing. Now, look, in terms of the Ukrainian argument, the only thing we have from the Russian side to potentially back that up is that they say that these four suspects were arrested in the Bryansk region, which is on the border with Ukraine. CNN has geolocated one video around 150 kilometers from that border but, of course, that's not conclusive evidence. Ukraine strenuously denying any connection -- Kasie.",

But when push comes to shove we ultimately get things done or do the right thing in the end. And I think that we will end up passing some form of the supplemental legislation. Seventy percent of Republicans support aid to Ukraine and assistance to Ukraine which, by the way, includes not just military aid but also humanitarian and economic. And 80 percent of Democrats support it as well. We should be able to work together in a bipartisan fashion to get this done.
