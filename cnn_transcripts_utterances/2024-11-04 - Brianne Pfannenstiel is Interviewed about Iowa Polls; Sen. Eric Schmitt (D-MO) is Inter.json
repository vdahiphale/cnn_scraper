We saw more people indicating to us through our polling that they planned to vote. And so I think you're looking - if you're a Democrat, you're really looking at this and hoping that it means something for states like Michigan and Wisconsin, that are - you know, appear to be deadlocked battleground states, that in this final week some of these - these voters could be breaking for Kamala Harris in the same way that we're seeing reflected in this Iowa poll.",

President Trump - look, I'm in Missouri. Iowa is our neighbor to the north. President Trump is going to win by a huge margin in Missouri, and in places like Iowa. And I think he's doing particularly well in those battleground states, Michigan, Wisconsin. I was up there this weekend. Because people feel like this economy has left them behind. And that's really what this race is all about. It's the center of gravity, it always has been, is how people's lives have been affected. Are they better off now than they were four years ago? And so I think when people go vote, with the only poll that actually matters, is tomorrow, that President Trump's going to win.

And there appears to be maybe a one or two percentage deference there.Now, people may say, well, Shermichael, what in the heck is the difference from 1 to 2 percent? Well, when you're looking at a margin of races within the margin of error, that 1 to 2 percent makes a big difference. There's been this argument from a lot of Republicans, including myself, that the vice president has a deficiency with men. But I think the calculation from the Harris campaign is, well, we can increase our turnout marginally with younger women, independent-leaning women, maybe even - independent right-leaning women that will make up for that deficit. And I think that is an argument worth entertaining.

That is just not something that can be taken lightly. And so many people have missed it as like, oh, well, yes, but, you know, the economy is so much more important to women.And I have talked to so many women who say, yes, Maria, the economy is important to me, but the economy's coming back, gas prices are going down, prices at the grocery store are going down. My rights, when I go into that ballot box, I need to vote for my rights. I need to vote for a country where my daughter is going to be able to make decisions about her own body.

You don't want to run the risk of those voters staying home because you want to grow your potential voter pool. You also don't want to run the risk of them buying into a message of your opponent, that being the Harris campaign, as Maria just stated, the difference between - that contrasting difference. It's not good.He's really, really strong on the economy and immigration. \"The Times\"/Siena poll that came out I think yesterday, or a day or two, 25 percent of battleground state voters say it's a top issue for them. It was the number one issue. Followed by abortion, which the vice president has done an effective drive articulating that message. Fifteen percent say immigration. When you go down and ask, if the election were today who would you vote for, 39 percent of battleground state voters said Harris, 44 percent said Trump. That's a 16-point difference. So, if I'm looking at that data, I'm saying to the former president, these are your strengths. We shouldn't be talking about anything else but where you're strong, because you do not want to run the risk of giving the vice president an opportunity to point to the things that people say, I just don't like. Talk about the things I do like. A more disciplined candidates would do those things.
