And you are watching special CNN live coverage of Donald Trump's hush money cover up trial.Today, the man who bent the truth and broke the law for his former boss, the former president, goes on the stand. Michael Dean Cohen, the former Trump fixer and lawyer who imposed Trump's will on whatever he could, bullying and dealing and lawyering his way into getting Trump whatever Trump wanted. That allegedly includes buying the silence of Stormy Daniels, the adult film star and director who claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, and then was paid to keep quiet about the tryst in 2016. Today, Cohen tells his version of that story under oath. Prosecutors say Cohen is the link who can establish the how and the why of the case, that Trump said he wanted to make Stormy Daniels go away, and that he wanted it done to save his chances to win the 2016 election. Trump's attorneys well, of course, cast Cohen in quite a different light. Expect the defense to accuse Cohen of being a litany of things, a liar, a thief, an extortionists who devised and then freelanced the Stormy Daniels scheme to line his own pockets. They will also portray him as a disgruntled former employee, hell-bent on bringing down Donald Trump however he can. CNN's team of reporters and producers inside the courthouse are going to bring you constant updates to capture all the drama from this day of testimony.

It's something you need to get around.But the bigger challenge for prosecutors is that Michael Cohen has made pretty much his whole identity over the past seven years attacking the defendant. And in speaking with sources close to the defense team, they've been completely focused on this. This cross- examination is their defense. But their biggest challenge is, how do you cold (ph) down what you put in front of the jury, because there's so much material of Cohen just attacking Trump.

For him not to curse under his breath, to make audible noises or shake his head, because they don't want it to show Michael Cohen that he's getting underneath Trump's skin because that's what they believe that they - that Michael Cohen wants a lot - or, excuse me, wants out of this is to get under Trump's skins.

He has a long record of being convicted of fraud and perjury.Also on cross-examination, when it happens a couple days from now, you can count on Donald Trump's team pointing out, Michael Cohen has bias. He hates Donald Trump. He wore this t-shirt of Donald Trump in prison just the other day. He has financial motives. He profited off his books. And other prosecution witnesses, including Keith Davidson, have said Michael Cohen was a liar. So, look for that when we get to cross- exam. Anderson, this will be the pivotal moment of this trial.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's a good question. And from a judge's perspective, there's a lot to watch.First and foremost will be that - to make sure that the prosecutor asks very pointed questions so that Michael Cohen doesn't go off the rails, if you would. That could be a problem for the prosecution. We know that Michael Cohen has an axe to grind, and we know that he doesn't always follow the rules. In fact, we heard last week Judge Merchan say, Michael Cohen, stand down, you're causing problems for this trial. Again, Judge Merchan's goal is to make sure the defendant gets the fair trial that he is entitled to get. So, he's going to be watching very carefully and he's going to be on top of the answers to make sure that Michael Cohen answers precisely the questions that are asked and nothing further. The second thing he's going to be looking for is the defendant, Donald Trump's, reaction. Because as we've seen Donald Trump in the courtroom before and heard that he has audibly responded, the judge is going to make sure that's kept to a minimum. That's what he's going to be focusing on today.",

We'd all love to have rabbis or priests or imams, but that's not who you end up with. And often you end up with people, whether it's a gang case or homicide case, people who are in that world who were witnesses to it. So, you often have compromised witnesses. Witnesses with long rap sheets. Think of the best example probably is Sammy \"The Bull\" Gravano. He admitted to myriad homicides and he was a star witness, you know, against John Gotti and John Gotti was convicted. So, you do see it. This is slightly different baggage because of the hatred that seems palpable between the two men. So, the answer is, yes, sort of yes and no.",
