Temperatures will be a little bit chilly, but we're not looking at any records this year.We broke record warm temperatures in Times Square the last two years in a row but this year you've got some dry conditions there. If you look between the buildings, little bit gray, it's mostly cloudy, but those clouds shouldn't squeeze out too much as we go into the evening. We've got one little hiccup here kind of spinning over the Great Lakes bringing some rain and snow showers to some cities like Chicago this morning as it tries to work its way east where it will bring a few flurries for some in the mid-Atlantic. But overall looking at a pretty underwhelming system. Most people getting about a dusting and you might find up to four to six inches up in the spine of Appalachian Mountains but other than that, we're not looking at anything. We've got that system again kind of clipping its way east. Area of high-pressure kind of takes over most of the U.S. and that's going to leave us quiet going into New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. Here's a look at midnight, a snapshot. You could see some of those rain and snow showers, parts of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, maybe creeping into parts of Jersey and D.C. But overall below freezing from Rapid City to Minneapolis. 44 degrees at midnight in Atlanta. And if you're in New York City for that ball drop, you're looking at temperatures up around 40 degrees at midnight with mostly cloudy skies. Maybe a snowflake or two. You'll have more confetti than snowflakes. With a little bit of a wind, you'll find those windchills in the middle and upper 30s. So definitely, of course, needing to bundle especially as they're spending so many hours out there. But I dug up the records for the midnight temperatures in New York at the ball drop. And the warmest are all in the middle and upper 50s. We see it's the third warmest midnight temperature and 54 degrees out in 2023, ringing in this year. 2022 also topped out top five for warmest ball drops on record. And then the coldest roll in the teens and the single digits 2018. Remember we were rivalling some of the coldest temperatures on record in Times Square at midnight. 9 degrees is that record that was set in 2018. That takes the number two spot. Stays pretty quiet going into New Year's Day, temperatures pretty seasonal. A few spots on the chilly side like Atlanta and Miami. But overall pretty quiet as we ring in the New Year, Amara.",

And this is in escalation of this phenomenon that we've been seeing in the Red Sea since the October 7th terror attacks in Israel, the Iranian-backed Houthi group in Yemen trying to disrupt commercial travel in the Red Sea. That is a major concern for the White House because this is such an important economic venue -- commercial ships, merchant ships and trying to transit the Red Sea as they participate in global trade. What the president has done is tried to organize this global coalition, sent war ships to the region to try and beef up security. But this is certainly a development that the U.S. hopes will not signal a wider escalation of this conflict. We did hear from John Kirby today, the National Security Council spokesman who said the U.S. Is not trying to escalate this conflict further, but that it will act to protect its own assets in the region. The Houthis are not the only Iranian proxy group in the region who is causing concern for the United States. You have seen the U.S. carry out air strikes against Iranian proxy groups in Iraq and in Syria after they targeted American troops. [14:20:00] LIPTAK: They have not yet targeted the Houthis with air strikes inside of Yemen, but certainly this is a concern for the president as he heads into the New Year. We do know that the Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be in Israel and the Middle East in this upcoming week as the U.S. continues its discussions with Israel about this transition to a lower intensity phase of its war in Gaza.

Sunday and Monday are normal working days here in the country, but even if it did, understandably, it wouldn't be in the mood for celebrating.2023 was the worst year in modern-day Israel's history since it was founded in 1948. This, of course, owing to those Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October 7th that killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 200. There are still more than 100 people being held in the Gaza strip by Hamas and other groups. But as 2023 comes to a close, there is cautious optimism that we could be inching towards talks that could see another truce coming into effect and some or all of those hostages being freed in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. This, of course, will be done via Qatari mediation. If a truce were to come into effect it would also bring a welcome and very much-needed relief to the Palestinians inside the Gaza Strip where, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, more than 20,000 people have been killed. Those figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. At the same time, there is a humanitarian disaster unfolding there. There is hunger. There is disease. There is overcrowding. And a truce would not only allow humanitarian aid to go into the Gaza Strip, but would also provide relief from the fighting that has caused so much death and destruction. Of course, just because things are bad doesn't mean that they can't get any worse. But as we move into 2024, there is at least perhaps some hope that things will get better in the coming year.

You know, I mean my job is to tell the stories of the children that wemeet and that we help and try and unpack and explain what UNICEF does to support them. And, you know, just recently, we told the story of 13-year-old called Dina(ph) who lost her family, her home, had her leg amputated and, you know, we tell these stories in the hope that they will make a difference and that they will bring together world leaders and all of those with influence to improve the situation. And a few days later we found out that Dina was killed in another attack. And it makes it incredibly difficult to continue to tell these children's stories when we don't see the situation improving. So what the children need now, they need water. They need safety. They need protection. They need food. They need education and they need hope for the future and that hope will only come with a ceasefire.",

It may sound like something out of a \"Star Trek\" movie, but a team of researchers say it is feasible. Earlier this year, they even launched a tiny prototype into space to do a dry run on the technology. I want to bring in Ali Hajimiri. He's a professor of electrical engineering at Cal Tech and co-director of the space-based Solar Power Project. Professor, a pleasure to have on. Fascinating stuff. I know you get a lot of the same questions over and over, but what would make the space-based solar power different from what we get here on Earth?",

So the idea is this idea of space solar energy has been around for a while, but the original ways that it was talked about came out of science fiction essentially was that in a bulky, complex and rigid structure where there were all of these solar panels and the central way and they transferred this sort of parabolic fissure and and send out to Earth with fixed point. Over the last 10, 15 years, that new technologies became available, that allowed us to do this in a very different way. I mean, the original way would describe it as the big elephant and we are now moving to the army of ants, where you have billions -- hundreds of billions of little transmitters working in synchronization.Now, to make that idea feasible and economical, it needs to be lightweight and flexible. So we created this structure that are flexible and lightweight that can transmit the energy and what our demonstration was to use these and transmit energy in space and we did that as a first-time demonstration of energy transfer in space. We transferred energy from these flexible, light-weight structures to our receivers in space, and then we additionally try to transmit something that pointed it to Earth and detected that showed the feasibility of using these lightweight flexible structures in space. WALKER: Are you confident, Professor, that at some point this will work on a larger scale and we will be reliant on the space-based solar panels?",
