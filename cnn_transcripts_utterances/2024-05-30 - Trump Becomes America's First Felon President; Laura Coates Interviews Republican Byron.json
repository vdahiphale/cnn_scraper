And combine that with the bias. I've never seen a single witness who hated and openly hated the defendant, wanted him to go to jail as badly as Michael Cohen. On the other hand, the name of the game everyone at this table knows is corroboration. The single word prosecutors say most, spend the most time thinking about, is corroboration. And Lanny is right, the documentation, the handwritten notes, the checks, the other witness testimony, David Pecker's testimony, none of it was 100% corroborating of Michael Cohen.

So, if you're going to do that, first of all, you have to bring expert testimony from somebody with federal background on those charges. They did not allow that to be brought forward.Now, specific to Alvin Bragg, the issue here is that he ran on the entire position of getting Donald Trump. That was one of the core pillars of his campaign to become the district attorney in Manhattan. And so now you have somebody who basically said, I'm going to go get somebody, regardless of what the charges might be, regardless of what you might think a potential crime might be. His entire campaign was focused on getting Donald Trump. That's why he's coming under scrutiny, because this is political, not actually about following the law. And I go back to not identifying a crime. The FEC looked at this. They said there's nothing to see here. They are the arbiters of what is a campaign finance violation. So, for Alvin Bragg to go out there now and say, well, this is interfering with the 2016 election, he's a state level prosecutor. It's not even his jurisdiction.

I mean -- and I'll just be frank here. In the past, you've spoken out about various verdicts. One in particular involved Derek Chauvin, a very high- profile trial.

Regardless of the result, you said, I urge all Americans to respect the verdict and the legal process at this dangerously divided moment in our history. All leaders, regardless of party, must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partners -- excuse me, this is Governor Hogan. Hold on. I'm sorry. This is Governor Hogan. I want to read yours. Excuse me. I apologize for that, congressman. What you had to say in a statement was this. My apologies. One's fate is to be determined by an impartial judicial system that is ultimately in the hands of a jury of your peers -- we saw that today. Today and every day, Americans should celebrate the fact that we live in a nation that awards every person their day in court and the opportunity for justice to prevail under the blindfold of Lady Justice.

So, judges are supposed to look at mitigating factors, aggravating factors. If there are a lot of mitigating factors, that means a more lenient sentence. If they're aggravators, that means a harsher sentence.So, if you look very quickly at mitigating factors for Donald Trump, well, there's his age. He's a senior citizen. He's almost 80 years old. He's a first-time offender. That's a mitigator. And he's also not -- this is not a violent offense, although his words have encouraged violence. So then on the aggravator side, you have, first of all, the number of victims, snd these are voters who are bamboozled because of this hush money, the cover up. There are the contempt citations, almost a dozen where he has violated court orders. And then there's an issue of recidivism. Is he likely to repeat? On a scale of one to ten, I give it a ten. Yes, this man is likely to do all of this kind of stuff again. And finally, a judge looks for remorse, contrition. You get up in front of a judge and say, I'm so sorry I did this, I shouldn't have done it. Do you think Donald Trump is going to get up in front of Judge Merchan whom he has denigrated repeatedly and do that? No. So, it bodes, in my view, if these are the aggravators and mitigators that the judge is definitely going to not just say, okay, give you a slap on the wrist, go home, I'll put you on probation for a month. That is not going to happen. So, a lot depends on the behavior of Donald Trump when he's in front of the person he has been insulting repeatedly all through this trial.

So, Republicans are feeling pretty raw about that particular issue tonight.",
