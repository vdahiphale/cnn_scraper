      "sentences": "Yes. And I have to say as well, this is unusual for the IDF to put out this sort of statement to say that they've located bodies during a combat operation.They don't normally sort of comment on things as actually happening and unfolding and that's what they say precisely happening at the moment. They're saying that they are working to extract and identify the bodies in this ongoing operation and they're asking for people to refrain from speculation, which appears to perhaps indicate that they are referencing rumors that are a circulating in Israeli media that it is possible that what the IDF has found as the bodies of hostages. That's not what the IDF is saying. They're saying something else. But I think to try to put this into context for everyone. This is not usual for the IDF to make this sort of a statement. And we will find out in the coming hours precisely more about this combat operation, more about the bodies, more about the retrieval and identification process. But at the moment, the whereabouts of the hostages is such a heartbreaking issue for further families who are some of them are protesting in Tel Aviv tonight, blocking streets. They're absolutely feeling that the government is letting them down, calling on Prime Minister Netanyahu to make that deal. Police say, by the way, those protests in Tel Aviv where there was a big security presence, but an agreed protest, parade and route. The police say that they have arrested three people at that protest. The passion and feeling is really strong. The hurt and the heartache for the families of the hostages is massive. The pain of the country is huge as it waits to find out information. So it's in this very super sensitive arena that the IDF is making this statement tonight, not to mention the fact that hostage negotiations are ongoing. That is dividing the country, that is dividing Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet. His defense minister just a couple of days ago and during a cabinet meeting, actually accusing the prime minister of micro-managing the negotiations and not -- and essentially not doing the smart thing. The divisions are big. But let's wait and find out what we hear later this night from the IDF, from this ongoing operation, this ongoing combat operation in Gaza.",

It is very unusual and my speculation it's just that is that the hunch of the IDF is that these may well indeed be hostages.You know, we know that there are at this time estimated to be 107 or 108 hostages still being kept by Hamas. The Israelis don't differentiate between those who are alive and those who are dead. But the belief is that 40 of those 107, 108 are dead. And so their bodies are somewhere under the control of Hamas. So the question would be, are these some of those bodies or are those others? And I think this is a very difficult time that I'm sure for the Israeli people and the families to get this news. Because now everybody is on the edge of their seats wondering are these hostages, how many know -- you know, we have no sense of number. And so I think we're going to have to sit tight and see how this plays out over the coming hours.",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, Hamas uses these hostages, both dead and alive, as leverage as tokens to give away to get back to Israel. We know under the tentative agreement, the first six-week phase of the plan, Israel would -- for Israel for every hostage did they would get back -- get back. It would give up so many Palestinians, 10, 15, 20. The number is unclear right now.And so as Israel recovers these bodies, both them alive, and we know just the other day an Arab-Israeli was found in one of the tunnels. It takes away their leverage. That said Jessica, I still believe that there's a lot of distance, too much distance between Israel and Hamas on the issue. As Nic, I think and others have reported earlier, the big issue right now it seems to be who will retain control or will IDF have a presence at the Philadelphi corridor, which is the southern boundary of Gaza along Egypt. And it's the main trafficking route by which Hamas brings in arms and ammunition and building materials. So I assume Bibi Netanyahu does not want to allow Hamas to get access again. They want Israelis to control that so they can cut off the flow of arms and ammunition coming into Hamas mostly from Iran, by the way. And so that future warfare, a future October 7, can be prevented. These are two challenges the Israel faces, is do you continue the war to defeat Hamas? And I'm reluctant to use that word. It requires definition or do you place the fate of the Israeli hostages before that? And this is what Israelis are wrestling with right now, although the most recent polling suggests that two-thirds of Israelis want to see the hostages returned.",

However, the Ukrainian say that yesterday the city of Kharkiv was strike -- a massive strike that took place there killing several people damaging some 20 apartments with just one very large bomb. And today there were strikes in the Sumy region which also borders Russia, and in the Kharkiv region as well, were one town was hit there and that bomb attack killed two people. And they are, again the Ukrainians are saying that the Russians used what is called a Fab-500 bomb, which is a 500 kilogram or a thousand- pound bomb. So half a ton of explosives that is in that. Two people were killed in that attack. And the Ukrainians are saying, if they want to at least prevent some of those attacks from happening, they're going to have to be able to attack the airfields that those bombers are taking off from.

Look, I think President Biden deserves credit for bringing the allies together two-and-a-half years ago, and for providing U.S. arms and ammunition and support.But I think he's going to be faulted by his by historians for not providing the Ukrainians what they needed when they needed it. For example, M1 tanks, F-16s, ATACMs, Patriots. I mean, the list goes on and on and on where deliveries the consideration there lasted months. And now of course, is part of that process. We've put restrictions on the items that they eventually got. ATACMs is the most prominent one right now. We have yet to discuss really, but I'm sure there are restrictions being placed on the use of F-16s. So look, Russia has been pummeling all parts of Ukraine now for two- and-a-half years. We've got to allow the Ukrainians to fight back, not just counterfire, which has been loosened up by the administration, but to strike deep. Now look, the administration say, the anonymous officials well, you know, the Russians have moved back their aircrafts. There's really nothing to hit. That is not true. The Institute for the Study of Warfare, who is an authoritative source on this has identified over 240 targets that are immovable, depots, weapons storage areas, fuel dumps. You name it, all these things could be destroyed, attacked in a way that would really hinder the Russian military effort. So I think we should allow the Ukrainians to strike any non-strategic -- that means non-nuclear -- military target and allow them to take the fight further to the Russians because there's going to be a major inflection points coming up here with the U.S. election and what may happen after that. The Ukrainians ability to sustain this fight both economically, militarily and through manpower. And so we have to give them the freedom to do what they need to do to save their country.",

One in four women are returning to the workforce within two weeks of giving birth, two weeks. We are setting up women we're absolute failure. And then that leads to postpartum anxiety, postpartum depression that we've all been through the early years. They are missing the early years with their children due to their mental health status. And they're missing it due to meeting to work a bunch of jobs. So I think that the very first place that we can start is not only subsidized childcare, once we get to the childbearing years where we're going and heading to work. But really at a bare minimum, can we get some, please, some parental leave?",

Thank you for asking.But, yes, I'm doing a book for Scribner on Caitlin Clark, this incredible phenomenon of seeing this young woman, this female athlete being so popular in our nation. I don't know that we've ever had a woman athlete get this much attention for this long. And I think it's safe to say, more than the '99 women's World Cup, even Billie Jean King beating Bobby Riggs, which was huge back in 1973. The attention and focus on this young woman as she keeps playing better. As you said, 31 points, her best performance so far in her young career. And she had 12 assists. And what she is doing is not only scoring but passing the ball and is really breaking records, not just rookie records, Jessica, but records for in the WNBA in terms of points and assists, reaching certain markers as the season goes on. And already has the most assists ever in a game, not just rookies, but the entire season, the entire history of the WNBA with 19 earlier this year. So she's playing with confidence. Her team is on fire. Indiana's five and one. And, yes, the book will come out next -- probably June, July. But it is a look at Title IX, 52 years of Title IX. And a look at when we give our daughters and our nieces and those granddaughters that full path to Title IX, the opportunity to play sports and be considered equal in sports. Look at the result. And Caitlin Clark is not only looking like, potentially, she will be the rookie of the year in the WNBA. She may well get votes for most valuable player. That's how well she's playing now.",
