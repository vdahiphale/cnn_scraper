Plus, is it Passover already? The exodus is now on from the Burning Man desert where tens of thousands have been stranded by a plague of mud. Good evening. John Berman here, in for Anderson, and we begin this Labor Day evening with a picnic, presidential politics, and polling. They all came together today in New Hampshire, several Republican candidates all stomping at the same picnic, in new polling that's no picnic for all, but Donald Trump. It matters the experts say because now was when voters really start paying attention. And this is attention getting, Trump now has the race nearly to himself, 59 percent support from Republicans, his nearest rival Ron DeSantis, now, 46 points behind. As for a potential Trump-Biden matchup in the general election, it is forty-thirty-nine with three percent for two-third party candidates and a large number 17 percent undecided. Head-to-head without third parties and voters forced to choose, the two are tied at 46. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is in New Hampshire for us tonight. Jeff, how many of the Republican candidates were there tonight and what are they saying?",

They hope that campaign is that the starting point not the ending point, making the case that Labor Day is the traditional launching pad of a campaign. So, that is very much an open question. Yes, of course, the former president has many supporters, as you were just saying in those national polls, but state by state, the surveys are a little more competitive without question, and the burden is on many of these candidates to make it even more competitive. When you talk to voters, when you talk to Republican voters, of course, and here in New Hampshire, the all-important independent voters, there is a sense of many more open minds here, trying to see what the field is doing, trying to see who could perhaps, you know, confront the former president in a one-on-one race, but his former vice president, Mike Pence here, just a few moments ago, was answering a question from an independent voter here in New Hampshire. And John, if there's not a Democratic contest early next year, those Independents all important here could vote in the Republican primary. That's of course what Chris Christie is hoping for, Mike Pence even just trying to woo that Independent voter so that could be a wild card. But there is no doubt whether the campaign is in the beginning stage or somewhere in the middle, Donald Trump has an overwhelming commanding lead.",

But there still is a sense that some Republicans are window shopping or eager to win the general election and they wonder if Donald Trump is the person for that.I was having a conversation earlier today with the New Hampshire governor, Chris Sununu and he pointed out how Donald Trump fared here in the general election back in 2020. Lost to Joe Biden by some 60,000 votes. Four years earlier, he only lost to Hillary Clinton by 3,000 votes. So he believes if there was a rematch between Trump and Biden, that this simply would not be good for the Republican Party. So yes, there is no doubt Donald Trump has a lead in this race. But even some Trump voters with Trump hats on, Trump shirts on still say they are sizing up this field of candidates paying careful attention to the debate. So the burden is on someone or perhaps a couple of people to certainly increase their standing here. So yes, he's the leader, the frontrunner, but you get a sense of some open minds here as well -- John.",

There's going to be a race here. Someone -- Trump isn't just going to walk away with this. The market demands are raised. To me, the question is, the person in second or third, are they going to be offering an alternative vision to Trump? And right now, the top three candidates in the Republican nomination all support Putin's position in the war, they really -- all of them say that they will pardon Trump and the insurrectionists. There is really no difference. It is Trumpism whether or not Trump is the messenger, or Ramaswamy or DeSantis is the messenger. So that to me is the question, can someone who offers a different, very different view of where the party should go in the country should go, do they have a fighting chance in this primary?

He said: \"Get candidates they support to agree to withdraw if and when their paths to the nomination were effectively closed. That decision day should be no later than, say, February 26, the Monday following the contest in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina.\" Based on what you're seeing, do you think these candidates should think about getting out if they're in the low single digits?

You know, people run for president, because they want attention. They want to be on the debate stage, and campaigns never end because like somebody just gets tired of running. They end because you run out of money or you run out of time. And a lot of these campaigns are going to live off the land, be on debates. A lot of them are really running for four years from now. Some are running for Cabinet positions, some are running probably for Veep. So most of the people in this race aren't really running for president of the United States.

MARK HERTLING (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Interesting developments today based on Defense minister Shoigu's initial visit to Ukraine or I'm sorry, to North Korea. It's going to be interesting. I don't think it will be as important as many people are saying it will be. Certainly, Putin will be able to get a lot of artillery ammunition, which is what he craves. At the same time, he is willing to trade off a lot of technologies having to do with ballistic missiles and nuclear strikes. So what you're seeing is a quid pro quo between two leaders that are both considered pariahs on the world stage, and they have no one else to turn to. China has relegated North Korea to someone they don't want to deal with. Same thing true with Putin. Putin has Iran and China potentially now as partners and allies, but he's not getting much from both of those because they'd been intimidated. And we'll see that what comes of this, and what the US government and NATO may do against Korea to advertise some of the things they might be doing and giving up intelligence to show the world what they're doing in violation of many UN mandates. So you know, they will both be able to try and get a partnership solid, but I don't think it's going to have much of an effect on the Ukrainian battlefield.",
