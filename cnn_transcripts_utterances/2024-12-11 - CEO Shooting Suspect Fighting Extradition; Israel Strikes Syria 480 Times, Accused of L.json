But left untended, bamboo can actually be very destructive, invading surrounding environments and attacking and killing other plants. So, the students here, recognizing this as an issue within their own local community, decided to find -- MONTGOMERY (voice-over): -- new and sustainable ways to put this plant to use to make sure that it doesn't go to waste. They took us to an abandoned bamboo forest, where we got to see firsthand how they processed this material. The first step is, of course, to cut down the bamboo shoots, and they use chainsaws and also very sharp knives, of course, always attended by -- by a teacher. And then the second step is they put this material through a machine that makes bamboo powder. This material is then later used in other materials. Now the third and final step is they burn the bamboo to make bamboo charcoal. Now back in the classroom, I want to show you how these students are using the materials they produced and processed to make entirely new products right now. Hi, Kiransai (ph).

DAVIES (voice-over): In Qatar, there was unprecedented levels of construction of stadiums and infrastructure. Migrant workers died in the process. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has pledged to build 11 new purpose-built venues. It was seen as a landmark moment in 2017, when FIFA became the first global sports body to write human rights commitments into the bidding process for its major events. But nearly eight years on, actions are speaking louder than words. LINA AL-HATHLOUL (ph), SAUDI HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST: I think no organization, human rights organization, has been consulted, and I will even add on that, Saudi Arabia has been forbidding human rights organizations from entering the country since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman came to power. DAVIES (voice-over): Lina al-Hathloul is a Saudi human rights activist. Hers is one of 11 organizations that recently raised concerns about FIFA's approach to Saudi's World Cup bid. Amnesty international called it \"an astonishing whitewash,\" while Human Rights Watch dubbed it \"an abysmal failure to implement mandatory human rights risk assessments.\" Their latest report, published just last week, revealed that in the first six months of this year alone, 887 Bangladeshi workers died in Saudi Arabia, citing unpublished Bangladesh government data. The report said the majority were recorded as dying of, quote, \"natural causes.\" There have been questions about how many were caused by working conditions. FIFA's overall assessment of the Saudi bid awarded it a higher score than any other that's gone before, judging the human rights risk to be medium based on an evaluation carried out by a Riyadh-based company.",

Now, this is part of their investigation into President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived attempt to impose martial law just one week ago. The head of the country's correctional service says former defense minister Kim Yong Hyun has attempted to end his own life while in custody. Kim was detained in Seoul Sunday. He allegedly recommended that martial law be imposed and was the first figure detained over the case. Kim resigned from his post on Thursday. Well, a family in Germany took the phrase \"deck the halls\" literally and claimed a world record for the most Christmas trees. It all started with one tree in the living room, but now the Jerome family has trees filling the kitchen, the hallway, even the bathroom. They have 600 decorated trees in all. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUZANNE JEROMIN, HUSBAND COLLECTS CHRISTMAS TREES (through translator): For me, it's really beautiful. Really colorful. Really great now. I say \"now,\" because it wasn't like that at first. At first, I wanted to move out. THOMAS JEROMIN, CHRISTMAS TREE COLLECTOR (through translator): Other people go to the open-air pool. I decorate Christmas trees. That's actually the biggest tree we have. Its 3.5 meters tall, and I can't put it anywhere because it's just too big. So, I thought I'd just hang it from the ceiling.
