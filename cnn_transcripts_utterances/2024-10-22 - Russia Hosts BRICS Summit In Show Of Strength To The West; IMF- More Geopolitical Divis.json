And he's been trying to chip away at this world order program for years, and now, two-and-a-half years, more than two-and-a-half years into this war, he's had probably his biggest kind of, you know, optic success in that he's had quite a few folks show up. We were talking about 30 plus world leaders, about 25 percent of the global domestic product and almost 50 percent of the population show up. So in terms of appearances, this looks like a big win. He had the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, show up to offer a little bit of a kind of a patina of credibility to it. So he is trying to demonstrate that --",

And we should be clear about the fact that that is a significant divergence from the kinds of values that the West represents, that Indonesia aspires to embrace, and that this is not advancing their agenda. It is, of course, purely transactional. They're looking for arms relationships with whether it's China or Russia. They see some utility in the national security -- the transactional national security that they could achieve in engaging with BRICS, but it is a mistake. I think there is a whole school of thought around the fact that, short- sighted transactional relationships don't advance the agenda of democracies. There should be values primacy in the way we interact with the world. So we should caution them, more than that, but we can't -- we can't just cut them off.

The IMF has just released its latest global economic outlook. The WEO, as you and I always call it, it's put forward a downside scenario that could occur if the US, EU and China all put tariffs on each other, which is highly likely if President Trump is elected. Then there is the reduced migration in the West and tight financial conditions. All in all, the IMF says global growth will be cut by nearly one percent next year and 1.3 in 2026. Julia is with me. Putting this into perspective, I mean, bearing in mind where we are post-pandemic, should we be getting ourselves hot under the collar by these numbers? JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": I was about to say steady on Dr. Doom. Can't we focus on the fact that they're saying that the global inflation fight is almost over, and that they're upgrading the United States growth, and they went through the fastest rate cycle in four decades and actually managed to come out without recession. In fact, it looks like we're going to avoid a global recession. I think there's a lot of good news in this report, Richard. I get there's a big caveat over some of the things that you mentioned, too. But I think we have to take a second to say, look, let's look at the bright side here and what was achieved, and then we can talk about the downside risks.",

So what happens politically in the United States may not be on the agenda later this week at the IMF and at the World Bank, but everybody is wondering who is going to win this election, and quite frankly, one of them is more aggressive, and you've said it, the former president is on tariffs, and we could see retaliation, but both of them are talking about protectionist policies. The view, I think, generally, is that we are going to head into a period where trade is more of a drag, where there's going to be more protectionist policies, and that is going to weigh on growth, as is the geopolitics, as is the potential limits to migration, or immigration as well, and all of that could be a problem.",

I mean, Richard, that's like recession or war period budget deficits, and yet we're talking about spending trillions more over the next four years.

We've got geopolitics, we've got a wave of technology. You and I always talk about this and the impact of artificial intelligence, so -- and how we fund that, quite frankly, and how that impacts productivity going forward, never mind climate crisis.

Hezbollah has not confirmed those claims. Rudy Giuliani must turn over his valuables to two former Georgia election workers. He had falsely accused them of helping rig the 2020 election results.

Two students and two teachers were killed, and Gray has been indicted on 55 counts related to the shooting.

It's alleged that Jeffries and two others exploited young male models over many years during sex-themed parties that involved a variety of drugs, alcohol, and Viagra. Now, the various schemes allegedly lasted from 2008 to 2015, and prosecutors shared details of the indictment a short while ago.
