I should be able to share this information with other people. I should be able to take care of myself in a way in which I feel is needed.I don't feel that many women in the WNBA, more specifically, thought that they had the proper access, the proper healthcare nor did they have the proper information. And for them to partner - the WNBA to partner with Opill, that's a really bold move. They are making a statement in a lot of ways. And for so long - and I don't know if the WNBA had the attention that it deserved - but for so long, these women have been advocates. They have been at the forefront of so many social issues. And I think that this is a really empowering moment, not only because women's sports is having this proper time in which they are being praised in honor for the work that they do, but there's a new generation of young women - girl - young girls watching these ladies play and think, okay, I want to do that. These women are heroes, in effect, in so many instances. And so now they're saying it's okay to have this conversation about reproductive health. It's okay to talk about birth control. It's okay to be informed about your body and have a say-so in the process. This is a bold move to me for the WNBA as well as Opill.",

It is the - one of the diverse league - one of the most diverse leagues, in my opinion that we have when it comes to women's sports. And for the commissioner to take a stance that says, we have a say over our bodies is going to be something that other people, especially conservative groups won't necessarily be particularly happy about. And the messaging that it's sending into Middle America and people who feel this should not be an - should not have access, women should not have access to over-the-counter birth control. This particular conversation is going to force the WNBA to talk about other issues that are on the precipice for them in terms of politics. Because I know that they are specifically creating initiatives that go with voting. They're creating initiatives that go with education. They're creating initiatives at the collegiate level. This partnership will create initiatives at the collegiate level that tell women that they have to really take part of this process. And people are not going to want to hear about it. There are those who don't believe that we should have Opill. There are those who don't believe, obviously, as we saw Roe versus Wade overturned, that there should be a conversation. And for the WNBA to take a side, essentially, it's going to put them, there's going to be some blowback, but I don't think it's going to be the type of blowback that will make them back down. This is something that is so important for women and women's rights. And I am, in this moment, saying I am proud of the WNBA because for so long, they've sat quiet. They didn't want to say too much. They've been in the middle. They've taken a stance of, let us be neutral. And now they're taking their power back as they have been given the power because they are having such a powerful moment in this country right now when it comes to basketball.

We had White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre speaking on that in the last hour. Let's try and play that soundbite. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: With today's decision, millions of Arizonians will soon face an even more extreme and dangerous abortion ban than they did before. This Arizona law, which was initially enacted in 1864, more than 150 years ago, fails to protect women even when their health is at risk. When the President's predecessor handicapped three Supreme Court justices to overturn Roe v. Wade, it paved the way for the chaos and confusion we're seeing play out across the country today.

It's a continuation of what they're calling her - reproductive rights to her. She has really been sort of the lead for the administration for the Biden campaign when talking about this issue. And she just put out a statement pinning direct blame on this decision on Donald Trump himself, saying that by his own admission, there's one person responsible for these kinds of rulings, which is Donald Trump.And the fact that this is coming only a day after Trump sort of revealed this abortion position, that he thinks it should be the right of states to decide how this issue should be resolved. They are really pointing to that and saying that that kind of position allows this sort of rule to go into effect in Arizona. And so you really do see them seizing on this issue. And certainly they do very much believe that this will be a galvanizing issue for their voters in November, for women, for progressive Democrats, for moderates, all of whom who really think that this issue should be left to women to decide.

And this is a candidate and a president who has always sort of adopted the politically appropriate stance on this instead of trying to go to the hard right of his party. He has adopted a politically convenient stance, and that's just what he did yesterday.When it comes to the Biden folks, I think that they are really viewing this as a way to try and get people to the polls, whether it's in Arizona, whether it's in Florida, all of these states where this will now be an issue on the ballot in November. This could drive people to the voting booth who wouldn't necessarily be motivated to vote in an election that many voters say that they're not enthusiastic about this year. This is an issue that they think can be a driving force. And you saw that yesterday, they put out this minute-long ad with a woman who wasn't able to receive an abortion while she was having a miscarriage and she suffered some very serious medical consequences because of that. And they do think that this is an issue that goes beyond sort of the left and right, that there are a lot of moderates who think that overturning Roe versus Wade, that the Trump stance just isn't in the mainstream and there are a lot of women and a lot of men, too, who think that this is an issue who - where the precedent should have been decided and had been decided and that they're concerned about what would happen next.",

But because some justices on our Supreme Court have decided to dictate the course of their lives, I will shortly have to be turning them away from the care that they want and need.And we know what's going to happen to these patients.
