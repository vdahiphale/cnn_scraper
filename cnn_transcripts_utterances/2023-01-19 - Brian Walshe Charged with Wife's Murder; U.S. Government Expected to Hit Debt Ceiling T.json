One, is that they're still outgunned. We heard the story of an appeal this morning from the foreign and defense minister saying Russia retains a substantial, quantitative advantage in troops, weapons and military equipment. So, there's that. There is also a real concern that Russia could be getting ready to mount a new offensive. President Zelenskyy spoke this morning about how he expects Russia to bring a new package of Iranian drones into play. He says air defense is still a weak to Ukraine. So, they're very concerned in Ukraine. That is why we see this significant uptick in requests for weapons.

Was the scene at Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson airport on Tuesday. A haze of chemicals in the air as officers tried to detain a woman near the boarding gate. The eyewitness who took this video says the woman ran to board a plane and then yelled at staff when they wouldn't let her do so. She then allegedly grabbed a fire extinguisher and sprayed bystanders with it. Police rushed to the scene and the woman was arrested and charged with assault. And in another unusual airport incident, a JetBlue flight being pushed back from the gate, bumped into a parked airplane at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on Wednesday. The other plane was unoccupied at the time and the company says no injuries were reported. The flight returned to the gate and passengers boarded a different flight. Both planes were taken out of service for inspection. Meanwhile, investigators say human error is looking more likely in the near collision last week between Delta and American Airlines flight.

Kennedy International Airport on Friday. The NTSB and FAA are investigating why an American airlines 777 taxied onto the runway as a Delta Airlines 737 was taking off at the same time. The FAA says those planes only came within about 1,000 feet of each other in the end.Now the new development, a source familiar telling me that the runway safety lights, the runway status lights, a system that warns pilots exactly against incidents like this, was, in fact, operating and airport staff at John F. Kennedy International Airport immediately went to check out if it was working properly. The runway status lights are something that are only at about 20 commercial airports nationwide, also, at JFK. The idea is to make it so that pilots can easily see if a runway is being used for takeoff or if it's unsafe to cross. The investigation is still ongoing here. The National Transportation Safety Board tells us that interviews are ongoing. Pete Muntean, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
