And then he came up here to rural Boone, Iowa where he talked about energy. A conservative Supreme Court and a future that he believes will work in a general election as well as this first in the nation caucus state.

This is an uphill battle, though not one they say is unwinnable. And that's part of why he hit this trail hard meeting. A lot of people along what was to parade routes across New Hampshire over Fourth of July shaking hands doing some of that on the ground presence that again, could help make some inroads into what has been a shadow over the GOP field. And what I mean by that is that the significant lead that polling has shown former President Trump to have over the rest of the field. Recent CNN polling has shown that among Republican and Republican leaning voters 47 percent would support the former president and the next closest, which is DeSantis is double digits away. And that's also why we saw not just DeSantis but South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, North Dakota Governor Burgum, former Texas Congressman Will Hurd out and about to try and close some of that gap as we of course, approach the first debates in August.

Vladimir Putin is putting on a show of power and strength telling his allies he is fully in charge of the situation in Russia and in Ukraine.

This is about 60 kilometers or so from the city of Kharkiv. 60 kilometers south and frankly nowhere near the front lines. This is a town that has been hit before since the war began. But the Ukrainian say that there are no military facilities here. They insist it is only civilian.We are also learning according to the chief of a Ukrainian special forces unit that when that missile came down yesterday, people were gathering for a funeral service for a fallen Ukrainian soldier It hit a house about 800 meters away. And so that is why we are seeing no one killed but a large number of people injured. 43 people injured at last count. According to the Ukrainian prosecutor general's office, the youngest among them, just three months old. There was also a 10-month-old baby that was injured by shrapnel, taken to the hospital right into intensive care. Their condition has stabilized. There were obviously apartment buildings that were damaged. That obviously is the least of their worries at this stage of the game. On the Russian-occupied side of the front lines. Authorities in Donetsk City say that there was sustained Ukrainian shelling on the city yesterday. Twenty-four Ukrainian shells actually landed killing two people, some 25 people injured. Among them, according to authorities, a two-year old little girl and a seven-year-old boy. Now, this is not the first time the Donetsk City has been hit recently. In fact, it's been a regular target throughout the course of the war. But what is worth noting is that the intensity of those strikes seems to have picked up and in the last few weeks or months as the so-called counter offensive has begun. Obviously, this is a city that is very well-fortified. It has been firmly under Russian occupation since 2014. And more broadly speaking across the frontlines, Rosemary, the Ukrainian say that look, they are making bits and pieces of progress, especially on the outer bits of Bakhmut. That highly contested city. But beyond that, they say that the Russians are really dug in and frankly, they are struggling to actually move the frontlines forward.",

It's an app that has more than a passing resemblance to Twitter. From the interface with Threads of messages to the functionality with options on the messages much like Twitter's, like reply, repost and share buttons.Multiple social media apps have been launched in competition to Twitter, true social and more recently blue sky. But a major difference is Threads can lean on Instagrams huge existing user base. It has more than 2 billion monthly active users. Plus, the timing could work in its favor. Twitter under Elon Musk is undergoing a major transformation. And not everyone thinks it's going all that well. Whether it was the removal of blue verification ticks for those who refuse to pay, or the reappearance of users who had been previously banned from the platform for hate speech, and misinformation, or even operationally their outages over the weekend. And now, Twitter has temporarily limited, how many tweets users can see. The fact is some of Twitter's users could be ripe for the picking. So, in this fight, perhaps the odds are looking favorable in Mark Zuckerberg corner. But judging by this tweet from Elon Musk, appearing to question the sanity of META's leadership team, he's not tapping out. Meanwhile, the actual fight that you have said they're ready for, no news on that yet. But from Thursday, we can look to both Twitter and Threads for any updates from Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROGER FEDERER, 20-TIME GRAND SLAM WINNER: I think, because I show up in completely different random places nowadays. You know that some people are really surprised and very happy then, to all of a sudden see me. I mean, I've had a moment when I did Orient Express, I was in Venice and a guy chased me down. He was like, can I please take a picture? I'm like, yes, are you -- who I think you are? I'm like, no, I don't know who you think I am. He was like, are you Nadal? I'm like, I'm so sorry, I'm not, you know. So, I kept on walking and the guy looked at me he goes, it's such a pity he's not Nadal. But he kept on looking back at it.
