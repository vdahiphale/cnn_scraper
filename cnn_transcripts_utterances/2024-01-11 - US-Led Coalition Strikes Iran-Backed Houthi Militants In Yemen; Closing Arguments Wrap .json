This is some of the first video of explosions tonight in Yemen's Saada province, just north of the country's capital.For weeks, with Israel and Hamas at war in Gaza and fears that war could widen Iranian backed Houthi fighters from Yemen have been attacking commercial ships in the nearby Red Sea. There have been dozens of attacks. Tonight, US and British forces have struck back using air and naval assets, both surface ships and submarines with one Houthi official, moments ago, saying that multiple cities had been hit. CNN's Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon for us tonight. MJ Lee at the White House where the president has just weighed in. I want to start at the Pentagon.

It was not just fighter jets and surface vessels, but also submarines that took part in this, launching Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles.The targets included not only radar systems, but also storage and launch sites for ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, as well as UAVs. Now, those three types of weapons are significant. Those are the types of weapons the Houthis have used to attack and, frankly, to try to terrorize international shipping in the Red Sea. It is because of that threat to one of the world's most critical international waterways that, first, a number of major shipping companies have chosen to avoid the Red Sea, but second, that the US setup what it called Operation Prosperity Guardian, a multinational coalition to defend ships there. That was purely defensive. Now, after warning repeatedly the Houthis to stop these attacks, the US, the UK and backed by other countries decided they needed to take offensive action, carrying out these strikes against once again more than a dozen Houthi targets across several cities in Yemen. This isn't an all-out attempt to try to destroy the Houthis -- far from it -- this targets the capabilities and tries to degrade the capabilities they have used to attack international shipping lanes over the course of the past several weeks and months -- Anderson.",

Part of that was a diplomatic effort, right? There was just a UN Security Council resolution passed effectively warning the Houthis to stop attacking international shipping in the Red Sea. There was also a joint statement put out by a number of countries. The US and about a dozen other countries earlier this month effectively warning the Houthis of the same thing that clearly didn't do anything to stop them. We have now seen 27 times the Houthis have attacked international shipping. And now we are seeing a coalition of partners, some taking part in the attacks, some likely taking part in the intelligence and the logistics that went into these attacks on Houthi targets.

One is Saudi Arabia, which is still trying to work out and advance a delicate sort of ceasefire with the Houthis after fighting years' long war with them. And the UAE, the Emiratis also missing. Now, look, the US has made clear that the defensive part of this Operation Prosperity Guardian isn't going away to safeguard international shipping, and President Joe Biden warning that the offensive part of this may also not go away if the Houthis don't stop attacking that shipping.

And in other words, if you're parsing that statement, this situation has gotten so intolerable that the US and the U.K., along with support from other countries, felt compelled to take this kind of action. I think it's also just really important to underscore from here at the White House how much the Biden administration didn't really want to get to this point.In so many ways, it has been a huge priority for this White House and the administration to try to keep the situation in the Middle East contained. Obviously, for a lot of reasons, the situation there is incredibly volatile. They also have been very wary of, in any way, disturbing the current truce in the Yemen civil war between the Houthis and the Saudis. So I think the fact that this action was taken anyway just really signals how intolerable the situation had become. And just, Anderson, since you noted the part of the president's statement where he was talking about the widespread effect of the attack that the Houthis have been undertaking, obviously, the potential economic impact is not just a side note. We are talking about weeks and weeks of a situation where major shipping companies have had to find different routes, basically, not operate their usual shipping lines in the Red Sea. That is going to already cause delays and other kinds of disruptions. This is something that US officials and White House officials are watching really carefully. So far at least, as of today, senior White House officials saying that they've not seen this kind of economic impact at least here domestically, but if this kind of situation goes on for days or weeks, certainly, that is going to become a more urgent problem and urgent potential concern for this White House -- Anderson.",

And if you look down here, this is the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, which an absolutely critical narrow area that ships go through into the Red Sea and then up to the Suez Canal.There were more than a dozen strikes across Yemen from north to south across a variety of targets. We're learning more and more by the minute really of what these targets were. But they were at least in five different locations, if not more, in and around the capital of Sana'a over here on the western coast of Yemen and Al-Hudaydah, and then in several other locations, up and down the -- this north-south axis in Yemen. Now, we are hearing both from the coalition that carried out these strikes, as well as the Houthis. The Houthis have said that a number of air bases and airports were hit along with several camps. They mentioned the 22nd Brigade Camp in the Taiz district, which is in the district down south. This is what we're learning from this coalition which, of course, the US is really leading in terms of the assets that were brought to bear. They hit radar systems. They hit drone, storage, and launch sites. As Oren touched on, the drones have been absolutely a critical part of those attacks that the Houthis have been carrying out ballistic, and cruise missile, storage, and launch sites. And then in terms of what assets were used, this is just what the US used in tonight's series of strikes. We also know the RAF, the British Air Force, as well as the British Destroyer, they have been out there. But the USS Eisenhower Strike Group has basically been out in the Red Sea serving as the deterrent to Iran and other countries. US trying to send a message to not widen this conflict with that formidable strike group. But fighter jets, US fighter jets were used to carry out tonight's strikes along with ships. We don't know exactly, which ones yet, but we do have the name of the submarine that was used. This is a guided missile submarine called the USS Florida. Very notable that the US military is telling us tonight the name of the submarine. And they, both the surface ships and the submarine fired these land missiles. These are essentially surface-to-surface missiles -- Tomahawk missiles against this more than a dozen locations inside Yemen. So a formidable amount of force brought to bear tonight in these strikes all across Yemen -- Anderson.",

There had been repeated warnings by the US and others to the Houthis to essentially knock it off.We have seen the US carry out responses against Iranian-backed militant groups in Iraq and Syria. We had not yet seen any kind of US response against the Houthis in Yemen. And that is, in large part, because they do threaten this waterway. But essentially having choked this off, the US now trying to send a message to the Houthis that they need to back down, they're essentially trying to punch them in the nose, bloody them, and get them to stop. Whether that will work, Anderson, is now the major question. Of course, the big foe here in the region is Iran. They back forces in Yemen, in Iraq and Syria, in Lebanon with Hezbollah, of course, and then Hamas in Gaza. So as Oren was saying, the Houthis have vowed to respond. So it remains to be seen whether there will be some kind of escalation here or whether the US and these other countries have sent the message that they are intending to send tonight. This is absolutely critical not just in terms of potential for a widening war, but for global commerce. Because of the amount of shipping that go through here, now you have ships being forced to not go through the Red Sea, instead go south around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa, which makes things a lot more complicated, a lot more expensive.",

But when you do, you must obtain escalation dominance. So I didn't see anything in the reports about taking out the boats. So there are boats. They've been used to try to attack shipping. Take out the boats. Take out every means that the Houthis have to get at these shipping areas wherever the mine fields are -- the mines are stationed. Now, the Iranians pulled their destroyers back, so they're trying to run from this. And that's the next step is to do something with Iran. But for now, it's on the Houthis. And so, they either stop or we will have to escalate what we're doing. It's all a matter of getting the targeting. The intelligence is so critical. We can strike anything in there and probably hit it if we know what we're after. So I'm sure we've been preparing this strike package for a while, but we're going to have to probably go back again and harder, and they're going to -- it's a game, and they're learning from our strike.

When it comes to it and you have to use military force, you have to use it effectively, and that means getting the escalation dominance, so we cut off their ability.

We are learning more about the foreign assets, the non-American assets that were also involved in this, notably, those Royal Air Force jets from the Brits. We also know that they have had a destroyer out in the Red Sea as well.So what we've known in terms of this conflict, Anderson, the US has actually reduced the number of US forces that they initially sent out following the October 7th massacre. Initially, there was a Carrier Strike Group, the Gerald Ford, which was already in the eastern Mediterranean, then the USS Eisenhower was sent out to join it. Those two carrier strike groups meant to send a very significant message to Iran and the groups that they back to not escalate the situation. The Ford has actually gone home with its Strike Group. There have also been hundreds of American soldiers who were sent out to the Middle East who have also gone home. But make mow mistake, still a huge number of US forces dedicated to this Red Sea issue, as well as the broader region. I mentioned the Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group. So, of course, there's the aircraft carrier, the Eisenhower. There are two -- three other ships associated with that, one cruiser and two destroyers. And then you have four fighter jet squadrons. You have a helicopter squadron, electronic warfare squadron. So all of those, just here, dealing with this threat from the Houthis in Yemen. And then more broadly, Anderson, this whole area of command as it's known in the Middle East falls under US Central Command. The biggest base there for the US Central Command is right here in Doha, and then you've got the US Fifth Fleet that patrols the seas. That is based right here in Bahrain. And then, Anderson, you have thousands and thousands of US troops who are all across the region here in Saudi Arabia, here in Kuwait, here in Iraq and Jordan. So if this were to escalate, it's not like the Eisenhower is on its own dealing with the Houthis, you also have all these US forces, all of these US assets and bases across the region who are ready to respond. Again, the US goal tonight was to de-escalate. Now whether the Houthis see it that way, we don't know yet. There certainly is an expectation that there could be a response.

These people are all connected in watching how America deals with problems overseas and then attacking them. And remember that we are deterred and have lost the initiative in Ukraine largely because of Mr. Putin's statements about widening the war and nuclear expansion. So what did the Houthi leader do today? He threatened us with a wider war and so forth, expecting that we might be deterred at that point.

For a number of years, until China got with Saudi and Iran to get a diplomatic agreement almost a year ago now, the Houthis were really active in firing cruise missiles into Saudi Arabia. Not just short missiles over the border to port cities like Jazan, but hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles to the capital of Riyadh.And this was going on over a number of years. So they do have the capability to reach. They've also since they've claimed to have sent drones into the UAE as well crashing at one time into one of the airports there. So their ability to do the unexpected, I believe, cannot be underestimated. And their persistence in taking up what -- you know, this support of the people of Gaza, which is new to them.

This is the series of attacks that we saw just two days ago. This included a U.S. commercial vessel as well as, according to this official, U.S. military vessels. And just to give you a sense of what exactly happened on Tuesday, we are told by this official that had it not been for this defensive coalition that had been in place in the Red Sea -- this is what we've been referring to as Operation Prosperity Guardian -- that ships would have been sunk and that this commercial ship that was full of jet fuel would have been hit, and they described it as a close call. Now, we are also told that some of this we also reported a little earlier, that after these attacks by the Houthis on Tuesday, this is when President Biden convened his national security team. He ordered his advisers to basically draw up what the possible plans were for retaliation. And then he directed his defense secretary, Secretary Austin, to carry out this response that we are seeing right now, led by the U.S. and the U.K. So again, more details are filtering in about how, especially the last few days have unfolded. But as we have been talking about throughout the hour, we've gotten a lot of this information from U.S. officials in recent days about how serious the situation was and that there was going to be some kind of action taken.

I just want to try to get a read on exactly what the wording on it was. But I believe that -- can you repeat what that wording was to me, Charlie, in my ear? They were told that they had said that they had launched possible retaliatory actions.",

Again, we will get back to you with more reporting once we know exactly what the U.S. assessment of this claim from the Houthis is.

I mean, if U.S. authorities are in the midst of a strike against the Houthis, I would imagine they are looking very carefully at what is being lit up in various areas controlled by the Houthis.GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Sure, and they're -- we're also doing our bomb damage assessment after the strike. And obviously the warships have got all of their radars on alert at your battle stations. You're ready to defend yourself. Sure. But one more thing, Anderson, in terms of unexpected directions, we should never forget that there is always the possibility of a terrorist strike managed by Iran in the name of the Houthis anywhere against U.S. assets, including here in the United States. We know that these capabilities are out there. We know the Iranians have the capability to strike. We know that the Iranians are -- they're very carefully managing this. They want to assert their pretensions to regional hegemony. They want to try to isolate and threaten Israel. They also want to reduce the credibility and influence of the United States in the region without being struck in such a way they lose their nuclear capabilities. So there's a dance going on with the Iranians, and it wouldn't be surprising if they -- some of the efforts come in the form of attempted terrorist activities against U.S. bases, U.S. embassies worldwide or whatever.

So their ability to launch a couple of those at short notice tonight, you know, cannot be uncounted for the, you know, for the naval assets in the region, which I'm sure they're looking out for. You know, one other point I would make here as well, and this must be going through the mind of Saudi officials when they consider what Secretary Blinken has been talking about, their willingness still with Israel to have a normalization of relationships on their provisos, two-state solution, all those things. But with the Houthis at your back door saying they support the people of Gaza, that's an implicit threat against Saudi Arabia for any normalization with Israel. If the Houthis are going after international shipping and have gone after Saudi with cruise missiles before, that clearly has to be on their agenda set potentially for the future, and Saudi Arabia will be acutely aware of that potential threat. This really -- the Houthis, have really unlocked quite a big threat in the region right now.",

We're joined now by Pentagon Press Secretary Major General Patrick Ryder. Major General, appreciate you being with us. What phase is this mission currently in? Is it ongoing? Is it finished? MAJ. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: Yes. First of all, Anderson, thanks very much for having me. So we've conducted these strikes. Of course, you know, if there's an eventuality where we may need to take self defense strikes, of course, we'll do that. But for all intents and purposes right now, we've conducted this significant multi nation operation in order to send a clear message to the Houthis that the kinds of attacks that they've been conducting since November 19th, 27 as of today will not be tolerated. And so these strikes were specifically targeting facilities that were known to have radars, missiles and UAV capabilities that have enabled the Houthis to conduct these strikes. So going forward, the intent here is to degrade and disrupt their ability to do this going ahead in the future.",

What the former president said outside the courtroom today came after the Judge Arthur Engoron, in reversal from his prior decision, allowed Trump to speak in court and then eventually cut him off six minutes into a statement ordering the defense to, quote, \"control your client\". It continued after court with the former president making a string of claims which could be true, but only if court records did not exist or newspapers, or if time flowed backwards and cause and effect were reversed. Here's the condensed version. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We didn't have a jury. We had no rights to a jury. This is a statute that's a consumer fraud statute, never been used for anything like this before. And it's a shame. We won this case already in the Court of Appeals. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So they said, you can't make it. So in terms of an in court proceeding, I do not think that he did himself any favors with respect to denigrating the attorney general, saying it's a witch hunt, et cetera. However, there's that other imperative, which is very big, and that is there's a presidential election. And with regard to that, you want to contain and keep the narrative of what am I doing here? I'm a victim. I made a lot of money for these banks and other people. There was no fraud. I'm being persecuted. And that's something, I think, that plays to his followers.

And if the judge follows factual -- his factual determinations, that's what judges do in a bench trial, Anderson. It's up to the judge to make the factual finding.

And I've covered a lot of trials to actually see it handled this way. But I think part of what the judge was doing is he was very cognizant that they were going to appeal. So he was giving the Trump side a lot of room to make their records, put a lot of things on the record. But, you know, it was a three-month long trial. You know, even today, it was this idea that he set the rules for Trump coming in and then in the end, ultimately let Trump speak because he said no one had more to lose in this trial than Trump.
