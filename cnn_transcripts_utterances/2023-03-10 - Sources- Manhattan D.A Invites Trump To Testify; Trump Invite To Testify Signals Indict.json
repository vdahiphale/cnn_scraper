Yet, so much good news does feed worries about inflation and Fed rate hikes.Up first for us though, prosecutors on the doorstep of what would be a history shattering possibility. A criminal indictment against the former President Donald Trump. A source confirming now to CNN, the Manhattan district attorney extended to Mr. Trump an opportunity to testify before a grand jury. That invitation is a legally required step before New York prosecutors can ask the grand jury to return criminal charges. That panel we know is examining if Mr. Trump broke the law by allegedly orchestrating a hush money payment. In October 2016, October 2016, that's just before the election to buy the silence of Stephanie Clifford, better known in the adult film world by her screen name, Stormy Daniels. The developments first reported by the New York Times pushed Mr. Trump into a new level of legal jeopardy, but the case is far from clear cut. It does rely on a novel legal theory. And it may hinge on a star witness who like Mr. Trump has a very rich history of straying far from the truth. That's the former Trump attorney fixer and felon, Michael Cohen. Cohen is meeting with New York prosecutors today. And a source tells CNN, he is expected to provide additional testimony on Monday. A giant question is what new evidence of prosecutors collected to consider charges now, in a tabloid drama we have all lived for years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The timing quite obvious a month before the election. Michael Cohen then was later he says reimbursed by the Trump White House for this from the White House. Why now, Kara?

But look, if you're going to take this unprecedented step to indict a former president.Big question, is this the case that you want to bring? We're talking about conduct that is approximately seven years old. It's a novel legal theory at its core, it is a paperwork crime, and your central witness is Michael Cohen, a convicted liar who just moments ago.

It is not a slam dunk case. for exactly the reasons we've been discussing.If Michael Cohen is going to be your star witness, keep in mind, the federal prosecutors across the street, my former office, the Southern District of New York, A, rejected Michael Cohen. They said we're not using him. We don't find him credible. B, passed on bringing this case. Now as to the novel legal theory here, absolutely correct. This is a novel legal theory. New York State law has never been charged in precisely this way. But I do think I should say, the fact that a theory is novel doesn't mean it's completely meritless. And so, prosecutors are going to have to make a bit of a creative legal argument here. It's really a much better fit for federal laws. So, I think we're going to see state prosecutors sort of trying to wedge a square peg into a round hole here, which is another challenge with making this case.",

We assume it's late in the investigation.Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump campaign manager, obviously. I worked with him in the White House. Hope Hicks, who was with Donald Trump in the business sector, before the campaign and then at the White House, David Pecker is the National Enquirer Publisher, Michael Cohen there. But the two women on the left, Kellyanne Conway and Hope Hicks. Hope Hicks, especially the lengthy relationship with Donald Trump pre campaign and into the White House. Do we understand?

As we learned from the federal investigation, when there was word that Stormy Daniels was thinking about going public with her allegations of an affair with Trump, which he has denied. There was a scramble to try to lock down that story.And as we've seen from the Federal filings in this case, it involved calls between Michael Cohen, David Pecker, Hope Hicks, Kellyanne Conway, all relaying in real time how this was going to play out if they'd be able to stop Daniels, and the orchestration of this payment. So, what prosecutors here want to do is they want to lock in the testimony under oath by these witnesses about their roles. They can lay out the timeline to the jury, and there's also paperwork that they can use to try to corroborate and support this. But you can see that's why they don't want to put it all in the hands of one witness. And also, if this were to, if this wouldn't be charged, and if it were to go to trial. If you bring the same witnesses in to testify, they will have their grand jury testimony locked in and something that they could always use to hold them to account on, but they want to lock in this story now.

We know for sure that he does know about them.Now there's a separate question as to criminal intent. But this shows that Donald Trump is trying to cover something up. It's a helpful piece of evidence. And I do want to be clear on this. I do not think the prosecution's case here is overwhelming, or a slam dunk or a smoking gun, but they do have a case. And you know, I did some reporting on the deliberations behind the scenes at the Southern District of New York. Two years ago, they were considering this same fact pattern trying to decide whether to charge Donald Trump. And the consensus among the federal prosecutors was that there was enough evidence to charge. Some felt it was close to the line. Others felt it was beyond that.
