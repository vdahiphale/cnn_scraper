The paramedic firefighter, who was part of the SWAT team, 40 years old. So, we learned from authorities that this happened at around 1:50 in the morning. They received a call about a domestic situation. And this was a man who had been barricaded in the home and there were seven children in there. They were ages two to 15. According to authorities, negotiators were there for quite some time trying to resolve this situation. But at some point, this man opened fire. He fired from multiple locations. Authorities saying he had several guns and also had a large amount of ammunition. They're trying to piece together exactly what happened, but we do know that that suspect is dead. That sometime after he was pronounced dead, those children were able to exit the home safely. And there is no ongoing threat to the community. But as you mentioned, so many in law enforcement there in Burnsville just heartbroken. And I want you to listen to what some of these authorities had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'll get to those in one second.We also know, though, police have not arrested or named a suspect. They do believe that there is no threat to the community. And in a statement issued last night, police described this shooting as a, quote, \"isolated incidents between parties that were known to one another and not a random attack against the school or other students at this university.\" Now, let's get to those victims. The female, identified as 26-year-old Celie Rain Montgomery of Pueblo, Colorado. She was not a student at the school. The young man, 24-year-old Sam Knopp of Parker, Colorado. Now, he was a student. The school said that he was a senior who was studying music, and a beloved member of the visual and performing arts department. He was also, were learning on accomplished tar player and an extremely talented musician according to the school chancellor. She issued that statement last night. Now, all of this terror unfolding in the early hours of Friday morning at around 6:00 a.m. University police received reports, calls about shots fired at a dorm. They arrived on scene about five minutes later. They discovered the two deceased victims. They locked down the entire canvas for about 90 minutes.

If the parties cannot agree, then the judge will say, well, here's what I need. And again, it's not going to be the full amount, but it is going to be a substantial amount.And, yes, Donald Trump absolutely does have the right to appeal to the New York State Appellate Division. If he loses there, he can try to get it up to the New York state, the highest court, which is called the Court of Appeals, but they don't -- much like the U.S. Supreme Court, they don't have to take any case.

But he gave a little bit of his reasoning behind that. He said, on the one hand, of course, Michael Cohen has his rap sheet. He's been convicted of perjury and other fraud crimes. And the judge said, and this would concern me a bit, he said there were some seeming contradictions in Michael Cohen's testimony in this trial. However, the judge said, yes, look, I was the one who observed him. I saw him testify. He seemed at ease. And also the judge said, most importantly, there was other independent evidence that corroborated key aspects of his testimony.

So, this will not work as a treatment, like the way that you give an EpiPen when someone's having a reaction. Instead, this will reduce the risk of that happening. And one FDA official, she described it this way. She said, quote,\"while it will not eliminate food allergies or allow patients to consume food allergens freely, its repeated use will help reduce the health impact if accidental exposure occurs.\" And in one clinical study, here's an example of how this works. Among patients who have a severe peanut allergy, those who were taking Xolair, 68 percent of them did not have a moderate to severe reaction when they were exposed to a single dose of peanuts in this study. That's in comparison with 6 percent of people taking a placebo. So, there's an example of how this works.
