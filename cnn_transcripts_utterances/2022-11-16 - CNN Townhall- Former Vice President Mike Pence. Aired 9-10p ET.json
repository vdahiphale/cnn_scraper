I'm Jake Tapper.He is the man at the center of one of the most fateful days in American history, January 6, 2021. And, tonight, the former vice president will lay out the details of that day, along with behind-the- scenes accounts of the Trump presidency, which he writes about in his newly published book, which is entitled \"So Help Me God.\" Mr. Pence joins us just 24 hours after Donald Trump announced that he is running for president for the third time. Our audience is here to ask the vice president about issues important to them. The questioners are Republicans and independents and Democrats from the New York area and from Mr. Pence's home state of Indiana. Please welcome former Vice President Mike Pence.

But, in the end, our administration did not end well. And I write about that in my book. But, as I have traveled across the country over the last year-and-a-half, one thing I have heard over and over again, whether it's at the grocery store in Indiana or traveling around the country, is, people want us to get back to the policies of the Trump/Pence administration. They want to see America strong, and prosperous, and advancing the policies that we advanced that left America more secure, and seven million American jobs created. But the other thing that I have heard consistently is that the American people are looking for new leadership, leadership that will unite our country around our highest ideals, leadership that will reflect the civility and respect that most Americans have for one another. Once you get out of politics, you learn pretty quickly that, while our politics is very divided, the American people actually get along pretty well every day and treat each other with kindness and with decency and with respect.

They want to get back to the policies and -- but maybe it's because of my Hoosier and Midwestern upbringing.

      "sentences": "Well, Jesse, thanks. Thanks for the question.But let me just say, it was the greatest honor of my life to serve as vice president with President Donald Trump. I don't think any candidate other than Donald Trump could have defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. Republican primary voters saw that -- that formidable candidacy of Hillary Clinton, and I think they knew we needed a fighter, someone that could step forward and help turn the country back to the policies that would make us strong and prosperous and secure. And he was the right man at the right time. And it was my honor to serve alongside him. But I truly do believe, as I just shared with Jake, that I think we're moving into a different season in America. Our nation has been through a lot, the COVID pandemic, the riots of the summer of 2020, and, of course, the tragic day in January of 2021. And what I hear people saying more than anything else is that they want to see leadership that will look at uniting the American people around our highest ideals. I truly do believe that. And I -- and I think it all begins with the golden rule. As I write in my book, the most important decision I ever made was to put my faith in Jesus Christ when I was a freshman in college. The second most important decision I ever made was to ask Karen Pence to become my wife 37 years ago. For us and for our family, we have -- we have always tried to live by the golden rule, to treat others the way that we want to be treated. It wasn't always true in my political career. When I first started out in politics, as I write, in my book, I let my ambition get ahead of me. I got involved in one of those negative personal attack campaigns. But when it was all over, I reflected on what my Christian faith required of me. And the time 10 years later that we had the opportunity to run for Congress again, we always sought to run in such a way that first demonstrated the decency and our commitment to treat people properly and respectfully about issues more important than us. And then it was about winning. And through my years in Congress, through my years as governor of Indiana and as your vice president, I have tried to emulate that. And I think, whether it's me and my family or some other standard-bearer for our party, I believe we're -- we're going into a season where the American people are looking for that kind of leadership that vigorously debates our issue, stands strongly for them, as I always have, but does so with gentleness and respect.",

Whenever we had disagreements -- and we did from time to time -- I kept them private. I thought it was important, as vice president, that I offer my advice and my counsel to the president confidentially. And we did. But I had one higher loyalty, and that was the God and the Constitution. And that's what set in motion the confrontation that would come to pass on January 6, because I had taken an oath to the Constitution of the United States. It was -- it ended with a prayer, \"So help me God,\" which inspired the title of my book. And I was determined to keep my oath, as the Bible says, to keep my oath even when it hurts, and -- but to do that with someone with whom I'd worked so closely and forged such a good relationship, someone who I'd created a record with that I will be proud of for the rest of my life, was difficult.

I told the Secret Service that I was not leaving the Capitol. I didn't want to give those people the sight of a 16-car motorcade speeding away from the Capitol that day. But frankly, when I saw those images, and when -- when I read a tweet that President Trump issued saying that I lacked courage in that moment, it angered me greatly. But to be honest with you, I didn't have time for it. The president had decided in that moment to be a part of the problem. I had decided and was determined to be part of the solution. And so, we essentially set that aside. I collected the Republican and Democrat leadership of the House and Senate on a conference call, and we began to work the problem. They tasked me to reach out to leadership at the Pentagon, the leadership at the Justice Department to surge additional resources there. And thanks to the courage of those amazing Capitol Hill police officers and federal law enforcement, we -- we quelled the violence. We reconvened the Congress the very same day. And I will always believe that, because of their courage and valor, a day of tragedy became a triumph of freedom, and we demonstrated to the American people and to the world the strength of our institutions, the resilience of our democracy.

We literally pray in the Lord's Prayer to forgive those who trespass against us. And in the days that followed, when the president asked to meet with me, after he'd made the right statements to the country; he'd committed to a peaceful transfer of power; he condemned the people that rioted at the Capitol, we met, and we sat down. And I prayed -- I prayed for God's grace to meet that moment and that spirit. And it wasn't easy. And -- and to be honest with you, I'm -- I'm as human as the next guy. And I -- I still pray for the president. And I pray for the grace to forgive him and all those responsible for that tragic day. But I truly do believe that we live in a time when the American people ought to be searching our hearts and having more grace toward one another. I mean, it seems like our country's more divided now than ever before. Even broadcast networks seem to be perceived to be divided along partisan lines, which is why I'm grateful for the opportunity to be on CNN today.

I was at a loading dock at the U.S. Capitol building working the problem and doing my level best to help facilitate the arrival of security personnel to quell the violence. But what I can tell you is, in the five days following January 6, I -- I made no effort to contact the president. He had said the things publicly that I believe needed to be said, committing to a peaceful transfer of power, condemning the violence that had taken place.But when his daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law came to my office, as I write in \"So Help Me God,\" and asked on that following Monday if I'd be willing to sit down with the president, I -- I told them I wasn't looking for a meeting, but if he had something to say to me, I'd hear him out. And I walked down to the Oval Office, that you've been to many times, into that back hallway, in the small dining room, where the president and I had spent so many productive hours working through issues at home and abroad, the progress that we had made -- we're a stronger, more prosperous country -- a lot of it had happened over that small dining room table. But I walked into the room, and the president's chief of staff was present, but he quickly left. The president looked up at me and he asked if Karen and Charlotte were OK. And I said tersely, \"They're fine, Mr. President.\" And he said, \"Were you scared?\" And I said, \"No,\" I was angry. I was angry about the differences we had, and I was -- I told him seeing those people ransacking the Capitol infuriated me. But we sat for more than an hour and a half, and I was candid with the president about my disappointment. And I must tell you that I sensed the president was deeply remorseful in that moment. And I know that's at odds with people's public perception about him. But I want to tell you it was true. I could tell he was saddened by what had happened. And we spoke through it that day. And I encouraged him to pray. He told me many times that he was a believer, and I told him, \"Well, turn to Jesus,\" hoping that he would find the comfort there that I was finding in that moment. In the days that followed, I made my way back in that office for another meeting. And the president, days later, was still what I would call downcast. His voice was fainter than I ever remember at any time in our four and a half years together. And after we finished talking through some end of the administration business, I -- I reminded him that I was praying for him. And he was dismissive about it. But as our meeting came to a close, I stood up -- and he was seated at that small table. And I looked at him, and I said, \"I guess there's just two things we'll probably never agree on.\" And he looked up and said, \"What?\" And I referred to my role on January 6th. And then I said, \"I'm never going to stop praying for you.\" And he smiled faintly and said, \"That's right. Don't ever change.\" And we parted amicably, as much as we could in the aftermath of those events. We spoke from time to time after we both left office. But, Jake, after -- after the president returned to the rhetoric that he was using before that tragic day in January, criticizing me and others who had taken a stand for the Constitution of the United States, I -- I just determined it was best to go our separate ways, and we have. But I -- I truly do believe, in -- in those moments, he was saddened by what had happened. And he conveyed that to me in -- in ways that -- that I'll never forget.",

The president's campaign lawyers, people named Justin Clark, and others, were telling the president that the legal challenges did not look like they were going to pan out, that while there were irregularities that took place in half a dozen states, that the -- the alleged evidence of fraud simply was not emerging. But the confrontation that happened in the Oval Office that day, where -- where Rudy Giuliani questioned the integrity of the president's lawyers, saying, \"They're not telling you the truth,\" set into motion a change that would happen in the days that followed, where those outside lawyers replaced the extraordinarily competent lawyers on the campaign. And it was a fateful decision in that moment. I mean, look, the president made his own decisions along the way. But the American people deserve to know that the president was surrounded by a group of advisers who, as the good book says, were telling him what his itching ears wanted to hear. And those of us that were telling him different were telling him that we have a process in this country where -- where states conduct elections, Jack -- Jake. They -- they consider in the courts any potential challenges to those elections. The states then certify the elections. And the only role of the Congress of the United States is to open and count those electoral votes. We made that case again and again to the president. But sadly there were advisers that were telling him different.",

He was not only my president, he was my friend. And I gave him advice in private. And as I recount in the book, there were moments along the way where I may have had an impact on decisions that he ultimately had. But I never made those disagreements in public. And I thought it was important as vice president that I don't. And all along the way in December and frankly all the way through January 4th, I continued to hope that he would come around. Frankly, as you read in my book, things actually didn't come to a head and became truly contentious between us until the final days and the final hours. In fact, I'll never forget, on January 4th, we had another meeting. We asked me to hear out his lawyers. I made it clear that I didn't believe I had the authority he was being told I had to reject or return votes to the states. But we spoke amicably, and the president left for the helicopter to go to that rally in Georgia. And he opened up the rally, Jake, as I watched on television -- maybe not on this network. The president opened his speech by referring to me. He said something to the effect of, our great vice president's going to have to come through for us. And he said, if he doesn't, I'm not going to like him very much. But then he paused, and he caught himself. And he said, no -- he said, no, the one thing you know about Mike is he always plays it straight. And in that moment, I thought he might be coming around, as he had in other moments in our administration with decisions at home and abroad where at the end of the day, he arrived at a decision. He had a decision-making process that was very dynamic. My hope was even in that moment that he would be there. But in the end, he was not.

And if I could find one common denominator -- and it speaks to your question -- it's that our candidates that were focused on the future, that were focused on the challenges facing American families today, whether it'd be inflation or crime or crisis at the border or high gas prices, those candidates focused on the future did very well. By contrast, I think you could argue that candidates that were focused on the past, that were focused on relitigating the past, did not fare as well. And I expect that's -- that's going to be taken to heart by Republicans in the Congress of the United States and across the country. And the truth is that we -- candidates have every right to challenge the outcome of elections in the courts of this country and in legal processes established in the Congress of the United States. But I think there's been far too much questioning of elections, not just in 2020, but in 2016, where Hillary Clinton said that the election was stolen, said that Donald Trump was not a legitimate president for years. We had Democrat members of Congress that used the same language to justify what became a two-and-a-half-year investigation into so-called Russian collusion that never happened.

We went at it hard, and we got into one of these negative personal attack campaigns that we lost not once but twice. In a very real sense, I thought my opportunity in politics was over. But I felt convicted not in my politics but in my Christian faith about the way that I'd carried myself.The Bible says do onto others as you'd have them do onto you. But in politics it's do onto others before they do onto you. But I'd failed the standard that I'd professed in my faith to live up to and I wrote an essay that I, it's actually in the back of my book, it's entitled Confessions of a Negative Campaigner. (LAUGHS) And I essentially, I wrote it to clear my own conscience, but it ended up in newspapers around Indiana and it ended up being a blessing to me. And in the years that followed when I was a talk radio show host in Indiana, I sought to live up to a higher standard. I had Republicans and Democrats on my radio show on a regular basis and we debated vigorously as you know Hoosiers love to do. But always respectfully and in a civil tone that's also characteristic of the people of Indiana. When I had the chance to go to Congress, I tried to live that out every day. And as your governor and as vice president of the United States and it's a deeply held belief of mine that democracy depends on heavy doses of civility. I mean, Jake, you've covered Congress for decades now and they've got these formal rules. The members of Congress refer to one another as \"my good friend\".",

Because as a practical matter I will tell you that if, I've never seen a member of Congress begrudge me my views and my values in a good, vigorous debate. Never prevented us from looking for other ways to work together. But when things become personal, as they have too often on both sides of the aisle, and it makes the possibility of finding common ground very difficult.I mean in my book I talk about the having been a Conservative champion in the House of Representatives. I mean been elected to leadership in the Congress. Often would say to people I'm a Conservative but I'm not in a bad mood about it. Alright? And because of that, debates on the House Floor against some of the most liberal members of the Congress of the United States never affected my ability to have relationships. You know one of the high points of my career in Congress, Jake, was when the late John Lewis, a giant of the Civil Rights Movement, came up to me on the House Floor and asked if Karen and I would co-lead the annual pilgrimage to mark the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, and walk with him across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. You know Martin Luther King, Jr. was one of the heroes of my youth, still is. And to be invited to join one of his right-hand men to mark that historic day was deeply humbling to me. Now I can tell you that John Lewis and I didn't agree on almost anything except the fact that he was a great man and a good man, who was sincere in his faith and loved this country and I sensed he thought there was some of those qualities in me as well. That's why civility is so important, and your point is so important. But I believe we're on the cusp of a new season in America where we're going to see a return to government as good as our people as respectful and as civil as the American people are and Hoosiers are with each other every day.",
