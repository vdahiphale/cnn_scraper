As you said, you know, on her road to recovery and her manager saying on Instagram they expect her to make a full recovery. So, that's good news.But without knowing a ton of details, some of the experts I've been talking with, doctors in infectious diseases, note that it is one of the most common reasons to go to the ICU, a severe bacterial infection. This is something that happen relatively frequently. It does happen more in people who are elderly or have underlying health conditions or are immunocompromised. And the word that kept coming up, every doctor I spoke with, was sepsis. And so that is something that a severe infection can lead to. It's a life-threatening reaction to that infection. It can cause dangerous drops in blood pressure. It can cause your organs to shut down. So, that is a concern that maybe this is possibly what happened. We don't have the information. But, obviously, going to the ICU means it was extremely serious and potentially life-threatening.",
