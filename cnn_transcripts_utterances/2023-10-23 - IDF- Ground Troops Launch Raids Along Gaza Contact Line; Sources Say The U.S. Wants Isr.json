      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to our continuing coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, I'm Isa Soares. And tonight, thehumanitarian crisis in Gaza grows worse by the hour. This, amid news Israel's military conducted raids underground overnight. The IDF say they're looking for intelligence on more than 200 captives taken by Hamas and getting ready for the next phase of the war. Sources say the U.S. wants Israel to delay a full-on invasion to allow for the release of more hostages and aid into Gaza. But a senior Israeli official denies that report. Well, aid has begun entering the enclave from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, but the convoys are really a trickle of what Gaza usually receives. CNN calculates there are more than 7,200 trucks short of normal deliveries. Water, food, and medical items are indeed in short supply. And the U.N. says its fuel will run out in days. And that fuel is important, why? Well, it's critical, of course, to keep generators online and hospitals working as Israel ramps up airstrikes. Well, in Gaza, some residents who didn't evacuate tell CNN, there is no safe place there, something that I have been hearing now for days, too. A senior Israeli official tells us there will be no ceasefire in Gaza, and some Palestinians fear a new massive displacement, similar to what happened after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Our Nada Bashir joins us now from Amman, Jordan, for more on this. And Nada, let's start in the humanitarian front first, 20 trucks crossing Rafah into Gaza so far on Monday, I mean, that really is a drop in the bucket, and we heard that so from U.N. Talk to the escalating humanitarian needs inside Gaza.",

And we've heard from U.N. officials saying that what we're seeing unfolding inside the Gaza Strip is a humanitarian catastrophe. We've been speaking to families on the ground in Gaza. They say they are rationing food, they don't have electricity, they don't have formula or milk for their babies, and of course, as you mentioned there, there are so many people in areas that are facing relentless aerial bombardment in northern Gaza, who are unable to evacuate as per the IDF's warning, including hospitals that we know, according to Doctors without Borders and other groups on the ground, that at least 12 hospitals inside the Gaza Strip are now inactive. And of course, as we know, many of these hospitals are completely overrun with those injured by Israel's continued bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced, and we've been hearing from U.N. teams on the ground, they say that they have provided shelter for many of them in U.N. schools, in hospitals, in evacuation centers. But these areas, these centers, are not only at capacity, but they are more than two times at capacity. Now, and of course, as we know, Gaza is under a blockade, it has been since 2007, and while we are beginning to see aid slowly, very slowly getting in, there simply is not enough, and what we're expecting to see is this humanitarian situation getting worse by the hour. And of course, as you mentioned, those airstrikes are intensifying. That death toll is rising each and every day. And the concern is, as Israel continues to ramp up its airstrikes, this is only going to get much worse.",

In fact, the IDF made that much clear yesterday when they said that they plan to intensify these strikes, and they said that the goal of doing so was to try and minimize the risk to Israeli ground troops who are expected to move into Gaza. When they move in remains the only question at this point. Even just tonight, we are hearing from the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who is making clear that Israel intends to carry out a multilateral operation from the air, ground and the sea. And he is telling troops in Ashdod this evening, that the operation, quote, \"will come soon\", and telling them to continue to prepare for that. I think what's clear is that it appears that Israel is willing to perhaps delay this ground invasion for a few days to allow some more time for these hostage negotiations that Oren was just mentioning. But that they are certainly not going to do so indefinitely. Whether you listen to Israel's political leadership or its military leadership, all of them are being very clear that a ground operation is coming. They are not saying maybe, they are not saying perhaps, they are saying in very definitive terms that it will come. And as we were driving along the border with Gaza today, what we saw is those -- the preparations for that ground operation. The troops appear to be ready to move in at a moment's notice. In just one area along the Gaza Strip, about a square mile, we saw hundreds of tanks, armored personnel carriers, and  D9 bulldozers, which are used to clear IEDs and obstacles ahead of ground forces. Now, these forces appear to have moved somewhat in the last couple of days since we last saw them, but they are still in those same staging grounds just a few kilometers away from the border with Gaza. All they appear to be waiting for at this point is the order to go ahead.",

So I don't think it will be enough if only the Israeli stop, you need Hamas to stop as well. And this is the entire difficulty in the situation. We have a terrorist organization which is embedded in the civilian society, and you know, within the Palestinians, hiding behind them, not being a discernible enemy. On the other side, you have the state of Israel. It's actually, completely opposite from Russia's war in Ukraine. You have two opposing armies, and very clearly, the Russians are shooting over the Ukrainian army at civilian targets. In Gaza, it's different. Every time the Israelis try to target a military objective, there can very well be civilians because Hamas is using them to shield themselves from potential fire. So it's very difficult. If a ceasefire could be attained, that would be adhered to by both sides, that would  certainly help the humanitarian situation. But I don't think it would be enough if only one side -- and in terms of what we in the European Union are thinking of and what we need to push for is the ultimate two-state solution. Because we don't only need a short term, we need a long term-lasting solution, which will work for peace, for both sides.

And as of now, it's just simply unsafe even in Rafah, even in Khan Yunis in the south of Gaza, there are still constant aerial bombardments, airstrikes. One of our colleagues, he lost his own nephew last night in an airstrike on Rafah. And so, we need, in order for that aid to even make a difference to people, is we need to ensure that humanitarian organizations like the Norwegian Refugee Council, like our partners on the ground, like U.N. agencies, have the ability to go and deliver aid without fear for their own safety. We need, at the very least, a ceasefire or humanitarian pause in order to really go out and reach communities in need and also allow for those people who are in need and seeking assistance to be able to access distribution points without fear and for their lives.",

That didn't happen. And instead, most of Argentinian voters, or at least the majority that took the went to the polls yesterday, they preferred the tried and trust experience of the current economic minister despite the fact that Argentina is handling the worst economic crisis of its recent history, at least for sure of the last 20 years. And that Sergio Massa who won the presidential contest, the first round of presidential contest just yesterday, is also overseeing one of the highest inflation rates in the world. And that is in itself a very remarkable achievement that the man that is -- that is in charge of the economy in such a distraught time can still pull off an electoral victory. But I think here we can talk about the scare effect of Javier Milei, the upstart, far-right, self-described anarcho-libertarian economies who was proposing to dollarize Argentina's economy. And most of the voters were not ready, maybe, for such radical plans, or that he wasn't able to convince all of them, at least for the first round. And that's also one of the reasons why Massa yesterday in his first speech as the front-runner in his new electoral contest said, trying to appeal to moderate and centrist voters. Here's what he said about his plans if he gets elected president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SERGIO MASSA, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, ARGENTINA (through translator): I want a national unity government.

And from the other side is Massa, who, although he's overseen a moment of crisis, is not proposing to completely throw the script out of the window. And he's proposing gradual reforms and a change in continuity of some of the analysts and his advisors have that I've interviewed in the last few weeks have told me. And at least yesterday the tried and trusted won. We need to see if that will be still the case when the second round happens, the second round happens in November.

It is unclear what the identities of these two prisoners are. Hamas had indicated over the weekend that they were willing to release two prisoners and follow the same format that they had on Friday, which is essentially handing hostages over to the Red Cross, which is -- which operates independently in Gaza. And then they would then be handed over to the Israelis. So, we understand from one source that these two Israelis are now with the Red Cross. They have not yet been handed over to the Israelis. And of course, this comes as part of this ongoing effort that is led primarily by Qatar, as well as Egypt, to engage with Hamas to get these prisoners out of Hamas detention. The IDF earlier today put a much more finer point, a more specific number on the number of hostages in their custody, 222 of all kinds of nationalities. We did hear from the White House earlier today saying that there's still some 10 Americans unaccounted for in the wake of the Hamas attacks and around a handful, according to the White House's John Kirby, are believed to be Hamas hostages.

This is extremely sensitive information for obvious reasons. And so, we want to be very careful with this and double-check all of this before this information is released. And that is a good question of whether or not they are dual citizens. Obviously, we had the two who were released last week, Natalie Raanan and her mother Judith. They are expected to be back on their way to the U.S. really any moment now. They were believing -- her father said that they were going to be back in the United States as soon as tomorrow. And so, what we're still trying to weigh in glean information from, we should note this is a really fluid situation because what I was hearing from one source is that these two hostages who are being released are not yet actually in the custody of the Israeli government. What we saw happen last week was these two hostages were brought to the border with Gaza and then they were brought by IDF soldiers to a base in central Israel. And that's where they met up with their family members. And so, that's the question here of how these hostages who have been released are being transported. We don't know yet what condition they're in health- wise, how are they doing medically. Last week Hamas was claiming they released Judith Raanan in part for humanitarian reasons, which I should note there was a lot of skepticism on that based on what Hamas has done over the last two weeks. But that is a question here of who these two hostages are, and of course, why these two hostages. But I can tell you, I was just in Tel Aviv. We were surrounded by a lot of these families who have had their relatives abducted by Hamas. And this is huge and welcome news for them regardless of how it came about. We do know part of this was because of some mediating done by the Qataris and the Egyptians, something that we know had been a process here, Brianna, as it had been playing out, these quiet talks. And also, this comes as the White House today was facing those questions about whether or not they had urged Israel to delay its ground invasion of Gaza in order to get more hostages out beforehand. So, there's a lot of moving parts at play here right now, but obviously very good news for the families of these two hostages.",

Of course, the United States does not talk directly to Hamas, which they consider a terrorist organization. So, they essentially deputize the Qataris and the Egyptians who do have solid ties, lines of communication into Hamas to carry out these negotiations. I think what's interesting here, Brianna, is this is yet another two hostages coming in the wake of two other hostages. This does not necessarily play to Israel's advantage here. Israel, of course, wants all of the hostages out. Every country does. But at the same time, as Hamas indicates that they are willing to release hostages, the pressure on Israel has grown to delay their ground incursion of Gaza. Hamas has now shown that they are willing to release hostages. They are willing to engage. And so, we now have reported that the United States has pressed Israel to slow their incursion into Gaza, to give it more time because we have seen this progress on both the hostage release front, as well as the aid going into Gaza. This is the second day in a row today that we have seen aid flowing into Gaza. Now, the U.S. has been very, very careful to not give the sense that they are telling Israel what to do. They are dictating terms. Israel is certainly bristling at the notion that anybody might tell them how to carry out their war against Hamas. But certainly, the Israelis and the U.S. are speaking very close -- are talking about all kinds of things all the time, particularly these hostages. And so, what we have understood is that there has been some pressure from the U.S. and others to allow for more time to get more hostages out, Brianna.",
