      "sentences": "Jim, the city military administration here in Kyiv says that this capital city of Ukraine has survived one of the most massive missile attacks it has faced since the beginning of the full scale war. They say that Russia fired around 40 missiles and they say Ukrainian air defense shot down 37 of them here in Kyiv, although we did hear some explosions when we were outside, getting ready to go on the road earlier today, the air ride sirens went off. CNN staffers living closer to the scenes of those explosions also say they heard the sound of Ukrainian air defense shooting down presumably dozens of missiles that were headed towards the Ukrainian capital.Now, we are not allowed to go to the actual scene of these attacks because the targets, we believe, are civilian power infrastructure, power stations and whatnot. But I'm standing here in the square, and you can see behind me some of the destroyed military vehicles from the beginning of this war that is going on almost ten months. Now, this means that undoubtedly there are millions of people across Ukraine, because these missile strikes didn't just target Kyiv, millions of people who have once again been plunged into the dark and the cold. There are actually entire cities, including Kharkiv, that at one point where reported to be entirely without power. That's also the situation down in Kherson, where they've been the target of constant shelling in recent days. There have been huge explosions reported in Russia opened territories to the east in Donetsk as well. But as far as these missile attacks go, not only hitting Kyiv, but also to the south, in Odessa, to the north, in Sumi (ph) and Kharkiv, and the Ukrainians are certainly worried about the well-being of their children. It was in recent days that UNICEF put out a report saying that the physical and mental health of nearly every single Ukrainian child is at risk, at desperate risk, because of this constant Russian bombardment.

We know the Fed is saying they expect half a percentage point growth. I mean, basically, near a stall in the U.S. economy for next year and the unemployment rate to rise to 4.6 percent.Jim, can I put this in perspective because, as you know, I like to kind of step back and take the big picture. It's been a tough month, down about 4 percent for the major stock averages this month. But when you look at -- for the year, we're on track for more than 18 percent down on the S&amp;P 500. That would reverse a 26 percent gain last year. Just look at the last three years, three very big years of gains over the past five years, the S&amp;P 500 is up 45 percent. That's great. This year you're giving a big chunk of that back because of this new reality, the Fed is trying to choke off inflation without tilting the U.S. economy into recession. And we don't know if that's going to happen. And, as you know, uncertainty is the kryptonite to investors. And so that has been a real tough sell for the stock market.",

A story we followed for some time. Well, today, another story, Rudy Giuliani potentially one step closerto losing his law license. A three-member attorney disciplinary board in Washington, D.C. said Thursday that Giuliani should be liable for professional sanctions. This after making repeated false election fraud claims while representing the former president, Trump, his campaign in 2020, as well as his efforts to overturn the election. That ruling is nonbinding, but a significant step that could eventually lead to Giuliani being disbarred.
