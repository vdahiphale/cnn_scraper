One, he put three justices on the Supreme Court who overturned Roe. That has been a massive hurdle for him, I would argue, as it should be, but has been a massive hurdle for him with women, particularly suburban women. His behavior over the course of this campaign has really done nothing to assuage concerns that women have about the fact that he's, you know, brutish, that he's a bully. I mean, we've really seen that. You know, he's tripled down on that kind of behavior.That doesn't really go a long way toward assuaging, again, particularly suburban women who, you know, might have some policy agreements with him but see his conduct as unacceptable. You know, Obama out for Kamala Harris, first of all, there's really no greater order in the Democratic Party than Barack Obama. When you see him out in force on the campaign trail, you remember just how effective and powerful he can be. And You know, and I think he sort of called out some of the hesitation that some men have in a really direct way that I think is productive. And he can do that in a way that others can't. He can do that in a way that's hard for Kamala Harris to do. And so that's helpful.",
