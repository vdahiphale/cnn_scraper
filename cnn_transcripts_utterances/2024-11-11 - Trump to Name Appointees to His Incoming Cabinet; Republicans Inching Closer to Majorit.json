Now, of course, Elon Musk was on stage with Donald Trump, his top campaign advisers, and his family on Tuesday night when he declared victory, during the election. But he's also been at Mar a Lago and around Donald Trump in the days since I'm told many days this week. He dined with Donald Trump just the day after the election. He brought his children to Trump's Florida home where Donald Trump gave them a tour of his resort, but he's also been at Mar-a-Lago and around Donald Trump in the day's since. I'm told many days this week they dine with Donald Trump. Just a day after the election he brought his children to Trump's Florida home where Donald Trump gave them a tour of his resort. But he's also been sitting in many times when he's been with Donald Trump. On some of the calls from foreign leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, I'm also told that Elon Musk has been weighing in on some of Donald Trump's potential picks, making it clear to the president-elect who he believes should have that role. And he's also been calling up allies of Donald Trump himself, including lawmakers and starting to in exert his influence in that way as well. Now, one thing that we saw happen on Sunday is that he came out and waded into the Senate Republican leadership fight. He quickly endorsed Florida Senator Rick Scott after Scott had supported an idea from Donald Trump to allow for recess appointments, essentially, trying to make sure that he can swiftly confirm some of his nominees and in many times bypass the senate confirmation process. Three of the men are vying for that spot, but Elon Musk said that he supports Rick Scott. And all to say, Musk has been very influential. He is very close with Donald Trump, specifically so in these final weeks before election day where he has been out there campaigning for the former president. And now he is spending a lot of time with Donald Trump and making it clear that he's going to be a top person, who Donald Trump relies on as we look ahead. Now, sources familiar with the conversations say that Musk is not expected to take on some formal role in Donald Trump's second administration. Donald Trump has mused before that he would love for him to be a cabinet secretary. However, Musk and others believe that he could have just as much power on the outside.

Here's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: President Biden made clear when President Zelenskyy was here in Washington a couple of months ago that we would spend all of the resources that were provided to us by the Congress on time and in full. And, of course, President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe.",

Last hour, I spoke with the director of the Center on U.S. Politics at University College London to ask him whether he thought the party had, as Bernie Sanders contends, lost touch with working class voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR, CENTER ON U.S. POLITICS AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: There's been a significant realignment among both parties to the point where now Donald Trump has really captured particularly the white working class, but in doing so also added, significant percentages of vote shares among Latinos, and black Americans as well. And I do think that this is partly a substantive problem in terms of Democrats not offering exactly what middle class voters are looking for, but it's largely also a communication problem. Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris really did not do a good enough job kind of communicating how they're going to help these Americans.",

I think that there were significant percentages of voters, particularly in the center, that voted for Donald Trump reluctantly, that really didn't buy into sort of his character, his morals, what he represents, but felt that they were better off economically under his administration.",

That according to state run media. And it would appear to be at least one building that had been completely destroyed, and there was heavy machinery, according to images we saw, trying to sift through the debris to see if there were any more survivors.Now, one of the local politicians there said it was a well-known resident's house, and it is possible that there were many displaced who were sheltering within that house as well. But as you say that there was more than a dozen separate strikes from Israel on different parts of Lebanon, since late Saturday. We really have seen the focus on the southern suburbs of Beirut now moving, to the eastern Lebanese areas and, of course, Southern Lebanon. A Hezbollah stronghold has been pounded since the beginning of these hostilities. Now, the IDF on late Saturday said that they had eliminated dozens of Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon, over the past day. And we are also seeing rockets continue to be fired by Hezbollah, into northern Israel. Now, when it comes to Gaza, much of the focus is still on northern Gaza. There were two homes that were hit, one in Jabalia, where there is that massive refugee camp. Also, one in Gaza City. And we understand that, at least 41 were killed, when those two homes were targeted. According to the Ministry of Health, they also say that at least half of those killed were children. This is something that is really being backed up by the international NGO, Save for Children, as well, saying that 3 generations of families, children, parents, grandchildren had been killed.

He says that his forces have clashed with these North Korean troops already resulting in casualties.And I think what's most concerning for President Zelenskyy is what he is saying that Russia is preparing to do, which is to retake the territory of Kursk. You may remember that Kursk inside Russia is where Ukraine launched this surprise offensive a few months ago, claiming Russian territory for the first time since World War II, a huge boost, a huge morale boost for Ukrainian forces. Now, President Zelenskyy says that the Kremlin is preparing to take Kursk back. It has tens of thousands of troops preparing along those front lines, alongside those North Korean forces. And what is also worrying for President Zelenskyy is that the objective behind Kursk has yet to be achieved. Of course, he expected that Russia would claim back its territory at some point, but President Zelenskyy had hoped that it would offer some distraction to Russian forces that would weaken and soften their defenses along those very long front lines in the east. None of that has materialized. Also, Ukrainians across the country, very far from those front lines, continue to suffer from this onslaught of drone strikes by the Kremlin over the weekend. 145 drones on Saturday night. 145 drones in a single night fired at Ukraine. President Zelenskyy saying that the country faced its worst ever drone assault. Their response was their biggest ever drone assault on Moscow. There, at least two major airports in the capital had to divert delayed flights because of dozens of Ukrainian drones. But, again, this pales in comparison to the consequences that Ukrainians are facing with the much larger arsenal, of course, at President Putin's hand -- hands. And all of this doesn't bode well when President Zelenskyy is preparing for a President Trump who has made clear he wants this war to end quickly, to end soon. That means bringing these two warring parties to a negotiating table at a time when Ukraine may be at its weakest negotiating position yet. Erica?",

But increasingly, hot temperatures and a steady growth in tourism traffic have also led to the erosion of some of the basin. The Trevi project is one of many conservation and renovation projects slated to finish in time for the kickoff of the Vatican's Holy Jubilee Year of 2025, which will draw millions more visitors than usual to the eternal city's popular sites. And for those who have come during this Roman construction season, all is not lost. They can still throw their coin into this smaller basin for luck. And they're getting an opportunity of a lifetime to see this fountain up close. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
