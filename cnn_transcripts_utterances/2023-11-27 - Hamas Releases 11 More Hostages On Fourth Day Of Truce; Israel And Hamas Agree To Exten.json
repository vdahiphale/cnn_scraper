At this hour, eight children and three adult women are back in Israel, where hospitals are preparing to treat them after more than seven weeks in captivity.The pause in hostilities has officially been extended for two additional days, opening the door for more releases. But there are new questions right now about this very fragile agreement. Also tonight, my special interview with the uncle of a 13-year-old hostage who was freed on Saturday without, repeat, without her mother, despite demands from Israeli officials. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv, Israel, and you're in The Situation Room. The breaking news this hour, moments ago, Israeli hostages began arriving at the hospitals here in Tel Aviv just hours after Hamas released 11 more civilians from Gaza. With a trace of extension now in effect, we expect additional captives to come home in the immediate days ahead. CNN correspondents are standing by here in the Middle East as well as back in Washington. They have new details. First, let's hear from CNN's Oren Liebermann, who has a closer look at all of today's very dramatic developments. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A nation celebrates once again as more Israeli women and children feel freedom. Fragile truce now extended by 48 hours, sealed with the release of hostages. Already some of the freed hostages, like Margalit Moses, are being discharged from the hospitals, ready to head home.",

This is actually the second night in a row, Wolf, that these hostages have been brought directly into Israel from the Gaza Strip, bypassing that initial stop in Egypt via the Rafah crossing. Yesterday, we saw that that happened near central Gaza, but today, happening at this Kerem Shalom crossing, which has actually been shut down between Israel and Gaza since that attack on October 7th. So, a very notable moment, a very notable development in the way in which these hostages are being brought back into Israel. Now, we know that these hostages are now being brought to a hospital, but where they are going to face all kinds of care, psychological, medical, et cetera. The question now, Wolf, is how will this continue over the coming days. We know that that truce has now been extended for two additional days to allow for the release of 20 additional civilian hostages, but then questions remain about the days to come after that. We know that Hamas does not have all of those hostages in its captivity, that others are with other militant groups as well. So, a lot of questions about their ability to bring them in.",
