I'm Jessica Dean in Atlanta, and Saturday night in Palm Beach is the place to be if you want to lobby President-elect Donald Trump for a place in his Cabinet.Just in the last couple of hours, Trump naming fracking CEO, Chris Wright as the next Secretary of Energy; however, Trump is facing some big issues right now out of the gate with some of his first Cabinet picks. Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice to be Secretary of Defense, is confronting a past accusation of sexual misconduct that caught the transition team off guard. Matt Gaetz, who is Trump's nominee for attorney general, was the subject of multiple investigations stemming from alleged sex trafficking and other accusations. Gaetz resigning from Congress this week, closing the door on an ongoing House Ethics investigation. And for the latest, let's head now to west palm beach. CNN's Steve Contorno is near Mar-a-Lago. We are awaiting more Cabinet announcements, Steve. But let's focus first on the controversy surrounding Pete Hegseth, Matt Gaetz, even Tulsi Gabbard. What more can you tell us.",

Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., obviously controversial picks. However, they had spent so much time around Donald Trump in the last months of his campaign. They were on the road with him, and he had all but signaled that he intended to find a place for them in his government.But Pete Hegseth, as Defense Secretary and Attorney General for Matt Gaetz, those are totally out of left field. And now his administration -- his incoming administration is dealing with some of the fallout from these picks. Hegseth, for example, caught his own team off guard with an allegation from 2017 of sexual misconduct in California. There has been recent developments around that. Now, he has been defending himself and his character on social media, even as Trump's team deals with the fallout from that pick although they have signaled that they are standing by him and expect him to be confirmed. And that is also the case with Matt Gaetz as Attorney General whose elevation to the nation's top prosecutor has alarmed many people on Capitol Hill, several of which have had run-ins with Gaetz over the years and the intraparty fights he has caused in the Republican Party and it will be interesting to see if those two individuals can get the 51 votes necessary to get confirmed by the Senate.",

In other words, the only criterion it appears that would merit you staying within the government under a Trump administration is whether you pledge complete loyalty to Donald Trump.

Keep in mind that can ultimately be admissible in court. It can be used by prosecutors to show the indicia of guilt. Why are you trying to communicate with witnesses except for the fact of trying to tailor their testimony to be more favorable for you. So all of that is incredibly problematic.

And so certainly, he is entitled to the presumption of innocence. Jessica, he will get that. It is a bench trial before a judge, not a jury.
