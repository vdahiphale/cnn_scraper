And when that didn't work, well, it was just chaos and destruction at that point. So, we are able to fit all of these events into multiple criminal statutes, and that is how our system of law works. A massive attack on constitutional democracy incorporates hundreds of different offenses, and we know that the DOJ has prosecuted more than 900 of them at this point, but it can't just apply to the foot soldiers, it has got to work all the way up to the ringleaders and the masterminds.",

And I fault us in Congress for not blowing the whistle immediately when that started, but we saw the logical expression of that public philosophy when it got to the coup and the insurrection, he literally thought he owned the government, and he could control our elections, and he could overthrow the role of the people.",

And can you meet those things, right? No matter what you believe or think.And what the Committee did quite meticulously over about 20 or 30 pages toward the end of the report is layout for each of the offenses, number one, number two, number three, number four, and this is what prosecutors have to establish. And so for instance, if you take obstruction, they said was there a proceeding, now, obviously, there was. Did someone act knowing they were obstructing that proceeding and act with corrupt intent, and they walked through every possible thing that establish each one of those elements. You have to do that whenever there's a crime. And I think people think, you know, sort of act on feeling, and just, well, we know Donald Trump did it. It's just terrible.

They've been interviewing more witnesses. They have things in addition to what is laid out in this report. So it's kind of hard to even predict necessarily where this could go, but we know they sat down with Marc Short, the Vice President's Chief of Staff, Pat Cipollone, and others. So there could be even more evidence that the Department of Justice already has. But one thing I want to note real quick, my general barometer for how successful a hearing like this is, is how outraged the former President is, and he went ahead and put out just a screed on Truth Social, in no way denying basically anything that was alleged, but basically just saying, you know, I had requested troops be at the Capitol. He wanted 20,000 troops there. Again, if you didn't incite a mob, there wouldn't be a need for troops to be at the Capitol, neither here nor there, and then blaming everyone from the Department of Justice to the FBI, and then bringing up Hunter Biden, so he is clearly rattled by this.",

Now, the advisers that I've spoken to just aren't so sure that that's going to happen this time. As we've seen Republicans and donors move away from former President Trump, they worry that he no longer has as much of a grip over the party, that he can no longer actually rally Republicans in an event like this, and that instead, this is just going to be a cloud over his 2024 campaign.

And what happened was, she had one lawyer, who had been paid for, I think, the way she describes it as by Trump world. And then it became clear that after her first interview, she said, well, they didn't ask me the right questions. And then that lawyer went away. They don't know all of the details, and she was represented by Jody Hunt. And the rest is history.

And that's why there was so much certainty that Title 42 would end at the strike of midnight on Wednesday. But now the Supreme Court is saying here, we're going to pause that termination date. So, we can more carefully consider whether these Republican led states have that ability to bring their claim.So, this decision really doesn't mean the court is siding with those states on the merits.

They could keep a hold on stopping Title 42, they could let it go into effect say Thursday or Friday or actually should say they could let it stop at that point. At this point, the law it's pretty safe to say that border officials they'll continue being permitted to quickly expel migrants at the border beyond Wednesday at this point.
