I think it is clear, from speaking with Israeli officials, that the Israeli military is going to deliver a very strong response to Iran, one that is going to have a real effect inside of Iran. That's going to deliver a serious blow to the Iranian government. Of course, the question has been, what will that target be? And we know that the Israeli government has been considering strikes on nuclear facilities, on oil facilities as well as on military targets. And the United States has been trying to pull Israel back from striking nuclear or oil targets. And this THAAD system does appear to be the carrot that is going to convince Israel to scale back that potential retaliation, effectively saying we'll provide you with this air defense system to guard against future Iranian retaliation. But you also have to take into consideration our position as far as what you will actually strike -- \"you\" being Israel in this case. And so it appears that, for now, according to a source familiar telling -- speaking to our colleague, Kevin Liptak, that there has been some kind of an understanding here, where Israel will go after military targets but will refrain from striking nuclear and oil targets. That being said, that hasn't been said officially by the Israeli government. And we really only will know once those strikes actually happen because the Israeli prime minister's office is still insisting publicly that Israel will take into account what the United States says but will ultimately make its own final decision about what to strike.

      "sentences": "Well, look, I think that the U.S. understands that Israel is likely going to try to calibrateits response at this point, given what Netanyahu told President Biden, according to our reporting, which is that he is going to primarily hit military sites in Iran and not those nuclear facilities. But still, of course, there was a lot of concern here that he could change his mind, right? I mean, the U.S. has shown that it is not able to influence Netanyahu in a number of ways over the last year. And so while they have been trying to convince them to not escalate the situation any further, they're still under no illusions here that they can control Israel's military response. And I think that this is one of the big reasons you have seen the U.S. military deploy that very sophisticated anti missile defense system to Israel in order to prepare for the worst-case scenario here. Which is that an Israeli retaliation against Iran then prompts yet another extremely large missile barrage or some other form of attack by the Iranians on Israel, which could in turn put U.S. troops, U.S. persons at risk inside the country. And so this is somewhat of an insurance policy that the U.S. is providing to the Israelis in a way that is specifically designed to help protect against ballistic missile attacks. And so that is the view from the Pentagon at this point. Those components for that THAAD system, that anti-missile system, they have started to arrive in country as well as U.S. personnel. And that is an indication, of course, just given how quickly this moved of how concerned the U.S. is that this could potentially escalate even further. But it is worth noting here that the U.S. had previously up pretty much put its foot down on sending additional U.S. troops to the region, to Israel. And now they're sending 100 troops to operate this missile defense system, really showing again, just how concerned they are that this could escalate even more. Becky.",

And what was really interesting to us as well is that large parts of the Iranian leadership also showed up there as well. The president, Masoud Pezeshkian, he was in attendance. But then also, pretty much the entire military leadership as well the head of the Revolutionary Guard Corps and also the head of the Revolutionary Guard Quds Force, which is, of course, the foreign operations wing of the Revolutionary Guard, Esmail Qaani. He was there as well. He'd been out of sight for a couple of days. So this was one of the first times that we had been able to see him.

I think the big question all along throughout this process has been, how much is prime minister Netanyahu willing to listen to what the United States says. He has been betting that, when push comes to shove, the U.S. will always come to Israel's defense and will not take the steps that the administration appears to be threatening in this letter. Because of the political conditions in the United States, this is coming at a time when the United States is poised for Israel's retaliation against Iran. That complicates the political situation here, both internationally and domestically. And this is not happening in a vacuum. There's a U.S. election taking place in three weeks. One of the key swing states, Michigan, has lots of Arab American and Muslim voters who normally vote Democratic. And there are deep concerns in the Democratic Party and in the White House that these voters may not vote for Kamala Harris specifically because of the administration's stance on the Middle East. The question is, on this letter, will anything that's involved in this come in time to mitigate those concerns? And after months of this going on, a year of this going on after October 7th attacks, it seems unlikely.",

And if it did, how much impact would it have if Donald Trump wins the presidential election on November the 5th? Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will have outlasted the Biden administration and the Democratic administration in the White House. There were times during this war when it appeared that was very unlikely to happen because of his own sometimes political situation. So any steps that the White House would take after the election would seem to be -- only have temporary leverage, if you like. I think it's going to be interesting to see whether Kamala Harris, who is in Michigan today, is going to raise this letter. It appears to give her an opening to start arguing on the campaign trail that the United States needs to be tougher in terms of humanitarian questions with Israel. And I think she may use that as a political device. And the fact this letter is being made public now makes me think that that's going to increasingly play into her campaign in this crucial swing state.",

I mean, I'm talking since November, I've been on that story. The first ceasefire was a temporary albeit temporary relief in Gaza. But the efforts have been going on behind the scenes since then to get a ceasefire, a more than temporary ceasefire. Do you -- have you just simply not bought those arguments, that effort?",

And all the while, as they're continuing to send aid, that is literally -- we are watching people burned alive. We are watching mutilated bodies of babies.

And what I can say is that, with 100 percent certainty, had this (INAUDIBLE) occurring under the Trump's presidency, we would have seen Democrats stand up and find their moral compass as they did when he moved the embassy. You had over 50 Democrats, I believe, that stood up and said, this is wrong. However, with the duopoly and the nature of politics in this country, because it is a Democratic president, you're never going to have Democrats step up, especially during an election year, and say, what he's doing is wrong. So even if Trump was to do exactly the same thing that Biden is doing, I have a little bit of hope that perhaps Democrats would find their moral compass and stand up and say that we would need a cease-fire by now with certainty. I imagined they would have called for it by now had it been under Trump. So that's one thing. On the other note, Trump, as we know, is a wild card and we've seen even after, you know, toward the end of his prior presidency that he soured on Biden. And I can only hope that, due to some personality conflict or serendipitously, he solves the crisis in the Middle East, my only goal is to ensure that people are held accountable for the genocide and that it sends a message to him and any other subsequent president that you will not be rewarded if you do what Biden has done. And that is -- that is something that I think he -- he is a political animal and I'm sure he will see that message as well.",

If you're looking at WTI or Brent crude.And I think it is important, we give it some context as you mentioned, oil prices were looking like they were going to breach the sort of $80 mark earlier this month, all based on the potential that a wider conflict in the Middle East could have on oil prices. And this is looking at both the disruption you could see in terms of oil facilities and the production of oil but also the trading of oil. And actually to be -- to be completely honest, $80 a barrel, just under, felt like, in many ways, people were almost underestimated the risk that there was. It's important to note, though, Becky, that feeding into this picture as well, we're also seeing oil prices slightly suppressed as a result of global oil demand outlook as well this week.

You know, there was so much trauma and terror that we were experiencing as parents of someone there, that I was shoving all of this emotion and fear and terror in. I like to think of it as, you know, suitcases and shoving those suitcases into a room and not dealing with that because we were in battle. We were on a mission.
