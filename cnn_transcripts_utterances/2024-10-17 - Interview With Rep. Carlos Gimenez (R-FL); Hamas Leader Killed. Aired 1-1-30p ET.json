      "sentences": "Well, Boris, this is an earth-shattering announcement from the Israeli military, confirming that Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader, the mastermind of the October 7 attacks, has indeed been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza.His body has now been brought back to Israel, and the DNA testing confirming beyond the shadow of a doubt that it was indeed Sinwar. The Israeli military is also providing new details about how and when he was killed, saying that he was actually killed yesterday during military operations in the Gaza Strip. And we have learned, of course, from our sources as well that this was not an intelligence-driven special operation that resulted in Sinwar being killed. Instead, it appears that infantry soldiers came upon a group of three militants in Gaza and fired a tank shell at them. And, ultimately, when they went and found the bodies in the rubble, they realized that one of them resembled Yahya Sinwar. That then triggered a set of alarm bells in senior ranks of the Israeli military and the Israeli government, and ultimately triggering the confirmation that it was indeed him. There was initially confirmation via dental records, and that was followed up by multiple DNA tests that ultimately gave the Israeli government and its military the confirmation to a confidence level necessary to be able to now announce this publicly. They are also saying that it was soldiers in Israel's 828th Brigade -- that is an infantry brigade responsible actually for training other infantry soldiers -- that was operating in Gaza that successfully killed Sinwar. We are already seeing in Gaza a mixed reaction from the population there, some expressing sadness and shock at his death, but others very much celebrating it and hoping that Sinwar's death will accelerate the end of the war in Gaza. And that is indeed now the question, whether or not Sinwar's killing gives the Israeli prime minister the opportunity to present a picture of victory in Israel to be able to move towards ending the war and perhaps even reaching a deal to free the hostages as well, but so much uncertainty about who might succeed Yahya Sinwar at this point, whether or not there is an immediate successor, or whether instead we will see chaos in Hamas' ranks. But, without a doubt, this is an enormous moment in this region, just over a year after Sinwar launched this October 7 attack that then triggered this deadly, deadly war in Gaza, the Israeli military now confirming that Yahya Sinwar has been killed.",

CNN has obtained a verified picture of Sinwar's body. You can see the face there blurred out, which certainly does spare some of the graphic nature, I will say, of this photo. But this is a picture of that rubble that Jeremy was describing where the infantry fired a shell at this building and in this collapse found bodies of militants, including one that resembled Sinwar and was later verified to be Sinwar. Alex Marquardt, bringing you into this, tell us more about Sinwar, who has not been seen since the war began more than a year ago, was thought to have been constantly on the move.",

And yet the training battalion is the one that caught him in the open and killed him. Really speaks to the readiness across the entire Israeli Defense Force, which means they are prepared, they are at war, and they're ready to react on a moment's notice to hunt down and kill these terrorists no matter where they are from the top level leadership like Sinwar down to the regular foot soldiers that continue this fight. I think the next step you're going to see happen is, this is where the Israeli intelligence is really going to kick in, because what you're going to see is, not only did they catch him out in the open, but then the real question is, where did he come from and where was he headed to that he would have such a light footprint out in the open trying to avoid things, when, in fact, everything we have learned would indicate that he had surrounded himself by those hostages as a kind of human shield and protection? That's not there. So now we have to look beyond the immediate death of Sinwar.",

They still have hostages, unfortunately, as a bargaining tool.So that is going to have to be dealt with on one front. By the same token, Hamas leadership is now going to have to figure out, does that leadership reside in a four-star hotel, hiding behind the Qataris and being able to do things there, or they, in fact, going to appoint someone that's on the ground and currently engaged in combat operations against the IDF? So, I think, to a point, Hamas needs to appoint the leader that the Netanyahu government can negotiate with that is in a position of authority that the fighters are now going to listen to be able to really have meaningful hostage negotiations, because while it may be hostages, hostages, hostages, you have to be able to negotiate with the group as a whole. And as we have seen in the past, Hamas does not control all the hostages. You still have Palestine Islamic Jihad and others who may control certain hostages and may not be willing to give up the fight. So I think the leadership vacuum will need to be filled, and quickly.",

We are set to hear from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in moments. We will, of course, bring you that live. But I do want to get reaction from Republican Congressman of Florida Carlos Gimenez. He is a member of the Armed Services Committee. Congressman, thank you so much for being with us. First, your reaction to this news. Do you think this makes a cease- fire deal more or less likely? REP. CARLOS GIMENEZ (R-FL):  I'm not sure. And so I think it's good news that he was killed. I mean, he was the mastermind and one of the masterminds of October 7. And so this is also very, very symbolic for Israel to get one of the people that caused that slaughter in their homeland. And I would hope that it would lead to better chances for a cease-fire and a resolution of this conflict.

I think that's what is going to determine this election. I also think that, to a certain extent, Americans' posture in the world, it's definitely been weakened during the last 3.5 years, and we need to restore American confidence and also the confidence of our allies that America will be a good ally and not try to placate our enemies. Iran is a great example of that. During this administration, they were allowed to give 500 percent more in revenue from oil because of the lack of the enforcement of sanctions against Iran. That, in turn, led to them funding Hezbollah and Hamas, which, in turn, led to these attacks, which, in turn, leads to a much less stable world. That should be on the minds of Americans too, but I believe it's going to be -- it's going to come down to the economy and immigration and other issues here at home.",

It's disjointed outside of Gaza, because you have the political leadership that is primarily based in Qatar.One of the big questions we have been asking this morning is whether the U.S. is going to put pressure on Israel and see this as a moment to strike a cease-fire, but the same question can go for Hamas. Will Hamas take this moment to try to strike a cease-fire because they are recognizing that they have been severely weakened? I reported months ago that it was the U.S. belief that Sinwar was under major pressure from his commanders on the ground because they were facing -- because they had been so decimated. And so when you look at the landscape of the Hamas leadership, so many of them have been taken out, whether it's the top political leader, who we believe was assassinated by Israel in Tehran a couple of weeks ago. He was the lead negotiator on the cease-fire deal. Sinwar's top military commander was also killed, his deputy was killed, and now Sinwar has been killed. Another big name that is still out there, someone who is still alive, is Mohammed Sinwar, who is Yahya Sinwar's brother. That, according to sources, would be among the worst-case scenarios, because he is seen to be as cut from the same cloth, just as hard-line, and could be just as rigorous about not agreeing to a cease-fire right now. So -- but there could be others who are more agreeable, if you will. There's someone named Khalil al-Hayya, who has taken the position as the top negotiator. He's on the political side, he's outside of Gaza. He's in Doha. The political echelon outside of Gaza, they have been seen as more amenable and more in favor of a cease-fire. So this is a major question. And it could go both ways. So we need to see whether Israel sees this as a moment to end the war in Gaza, but also whether Hamas sees it the same way.",
