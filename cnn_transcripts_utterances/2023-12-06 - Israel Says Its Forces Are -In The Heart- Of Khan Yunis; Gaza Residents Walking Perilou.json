The enclave's second biggest city Khan Yunis in the south is bearing the brunt of the damage. Scores of wounded are streaming into hospitals. The Israeli military says it's encircling the city as well as delivering airstrikes on Hamas tunnels and rocket launchers. In Central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent says video shows one of its ambulances fleeing the scene of artillery fire. Eyewitnesses report multiple strikes and a nearby hospital says it received 90 bodies on Tuesday. A spokesperson says many people are still trapped under rubble. He's appealing to the world to end the fighting and allow more medical aid and supplies into Gaza. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is rejecting the idea of an international force responsible for security in Gaza after the war. He says only the Israel Defense Forces should control the disarmament of Gaza. So, let's bring in CNN's Clare Sebastian following the latest developments for us live from London. Good morning to you, Claire. So, what is the latest on IDF operations in Gaza and specifically around the enclave's second largest city Khan Yunis?",

And now the U.S. State Department openly saying that Israel is not doing enough that more aid needs to get in.Look, Israel is saying that it's conducting humanitarian work alongside its military operation in the Strip that is sort of a complementary part of that. Netanyahu saying there's no contradiction between the two, but at the same time, admitting that the amount of fuel being allowed in is what he called the bare minimum. So clearly, they are still as part of this operation, restricting the amount of aid going in. Don't forget that even before October 7th, some two thirds of the population of Gaza were reliant on international welfare. So, this is a catastrophe on top of what was already a sort of slow burning crisis in the Gaza Strip. And alongside this, we see this open dispute between Israel and humanitarian agencies, specifically the United Nations spilling over the Israeli Foreign Ministry, saying on Tuesday that it had revoked the visa of the U.N. humanitarian coordinator Lynn Hastings accusing her of bias because she they say was not quick enough to condemn that Hamas terror attack of October 7th. Instead, condemning Israel's operation in the Gaza Strip and the humanitarian impact of that. She had warned by the way on Tuesday, Rosemary, that a more hellish situation was about to unfold that we were getting to the point where humanitarian work in itself would not be able to function.",

So, your organization was ordered by the IDF to move supplies from its medical warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours because of planned ground operations. The WHO scrambled to get that done, but also appealed to Israel to take every possible measure to protect civilians, hospitals, and humanitarian facilities. How did Israel respond to that appeal?

We were advised to move our supplies because our warehouse was in a location that was going to be coming under military operations. We did have to scramble, as you say, to relocate to another less suitable warehouse. We missed out on doing two aid deliveries that day, because of that advice, and that movement. And now we have a list, operation warehouse from which to work. But I think this is just -- you know, I think people should be under no illusion about the massive, massive scale of need, and incredibly difficult operating environment there is for humanitarian agencies today. You mentioned Rosemary, that 50 trucks crossed yesterday, we've been saying for weeks now, we need a minimum of 500 trucks. So, in spite of this massively increasing need, there's a 450 deficit number of trucks just yesterday, the whole week of the ports, there were only 220 trucks going in per day. The whole week of the port, we had a 2,000 truck deficit. So, things -- we are spiraling further and further down.

We cannot -- the health system has to be protected, our supply lines have to be protected. And then as you rightly say, we're coming into the winter months. AndI think your reporting then talked about the displaced. There are now hundreds and hundreds and thousands of people further and further displaced. Some people displaced, you know, self-reported that they've been placed in camps. In southern Gaza now, as one of our colleagues from (INAUDIBLE) said, the houses are full, the shelters are full, the streets are full. And all this overcrowding, of course increase the risk of infectious diseases and disease outbreaks. We continue to record about the number of cases of respiratory infections, diarrhea, including bloody diarrhea, which would suggest the potential dysentery jaundice, very concerned about hepatitis, as well as the probe with infections and childhood infections. So, an epidemic is just around the corner. And then the terrible exposure that people will face with the winter weather really puts people in incredibly high risk disease. And of course, the food supplies. Now, the World Food Program plays that every household in Gaza is food insecure. Rates of UNICEF reports that rates of acute malnutrition are going to go up substantially. This is a very toxic mix. And people if they don't die from violent trauma, they're going to be dying from infectious diseases and lack of access to basic health care even for their diabetes, high blood pressure and so on. So again, just it's hard to describe how dramatic the situation is. The aid is just not getting in. We need both sides of this conflict to commit to a ceasefire. This is the only way out of this terribly catastrophic as Martin Griffiths describe it yesterday, apocalyptic situation.",

Namely, over a separate issue dealing with the southern border. The migrant crisis, a surge at the southern border. Republicans want tighter policies on immigration to be part of their larger deal, to deal with immigrating and Israel as well as Ukraine. They say all that needs to be tied together (INAUDIBLE) the consent, particularly when it comes to Ukraine. So, when behind closed doors earlier on Tuesday, when Senate -- senators all met with administration officials who are trying to lay out an urgent case to approving Ukraine aid. Instead, it broke out into a fight over border security and immigration policy, which led to a shouting match of sorts. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): It was immediately hijacked by Leader McConnell, even one of them started was disrespectful and started screaming at the gen -- one of the generals and challenging him to why he didn't go to the border. SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): We want to help you create an Israel but we've got to have the Democrats recognize that the trade here, the deal is we stop the open border. They don't want to do that. So, Republicans are just walking out of the briefing because the people there are not willing to actually discuss what it takes to get a deal done.",
