There is absolutely no space for people to move.People have been, you know, packing with shelters, plastic tents. Hospitals are few and far between. The only hospital in Rafah right now that is from the Ministry of Health is Al-Najjar Hospital. And it's at 300 percent of its normal capacity. People are just struggling to be able to get any kind of care in Rafah right now. Because as you said, everybody in Gaza has been told to move south. And so it's a place that's completely overcrowded. And unfortunately, the sanitation, the infrastructure that was there is not at all able to sustain over a million people living there. So the conditions from a sanitary standpoint, from a health standpoint, from an everything standpoint, is catastrophic already, you know, even before any invasion might happen.",

And I will say that the reason the health system hasn't completely collapsed today, it's because of our Palestinian colleagues, writ large, who despite conditions that are absolutely not conducive to any kind of care, remain and provide whatever care they can. So people are, you know, receiving care, wounds, war wounded are obviously the priority in receiving care.But unfortunately, the supplies are not able to reach, the pain medications are few and far between. So the care that the people are receiving is what you and I would consider completely unacceptable. Women today who go and deliver, have to go back home after an hour or four hours of having delivered a child and they will go back to, you know, a tent. You will see more than likely surgeries that are probably of bigger consequence than normal. So for example, we may be able to see more amputations than necessary because people are unable to receive care on time. And so when they come, their wounds are very infected and you are left with no option, but to do surgery. So to do an amputation. So it's the kind of stuff that you see in Rafah today. Fortunately I -- go ahead.",

Let's listen to the president. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATESwith Alexei Navalny's wife and daughter. As you state the obvious, he was a man of incredible courage and it's amazing how his wife and daughter are emulating that. We're going to be announcing the sanctions against Putin, who is responsible for his death tomorrow.

So we're back, I would say, like three, four, five years ago, you'd probably have to be pretty tech savvy to do this. Now there are apps that enable you to digitally undress somebody and to create deepfakes within a couple of clicks. And so that's a huge problem. And I don't think, honestly, we're talking about it enough. And when we look at deepfakes, there's a stat that says something like 96 percent of deepfakes are sexually explicit and 99 percent of those are targeting women.",

I mean, this is already happening in high schools near us. Like there have been well-documented cases of this.And so I think one of the things we have to think about is with this type of technology, we're creating a whole new generation of victims, but we're also creating a whole new generation of abusers. And what's happened is this used to happen on these kind of behind-the-scenes forums. But because we don't have the correct moderation, content moderation, they're beginning to go viral in places like X, which is why you saw what happened with Taylor Swift with these images. It's terrible that they were made. It's almost even more terrible that they could go viral at the extent they could without the tech companies picking up on them, specifically X. The same thing happened with Bobbi Althoff.",

He's a tech leader who's been incredibly vocal about his disdain for content moderation. Also, in the process of him coming in, they laid off thousands of employees, including dissolving their Trust and Safety Council that specifically had folks on there that looked at this type of behavior. So the tech companies, I would say, need to do a much better job. And there actually is a pretty clear solution from a tech standpoint of technology to fight technology. We have technology to detect spam. They've just got to do a much better job of having AI fight AI to some degree. From a legal standpoint, I mean, we've got to have more laws that protect folks against this type of abuse. And the laws haven't caught up. I mean, we have a handful of state laws that go against non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes. There is no federal law, although there's one on the table at this moment. So I think it's really that plus education. You know, to Jessica's great point earlier, this isn't just happening with celebrities. This is also happening in high schools near you.",

Aphasia is the same disorder suffered by actor Bruce Willis. Williams' diagnosis comes just days before a controversial documentary about her life and career is set to air this weekend on Lifetime. Here's a preview. It doesn't look like we have that preview, but we do have CNN health reporter Jacqueline Howard with more insight on this condition. Jacqueline, Wendy has publicly shared some of her other health challenges, Graves' disease being one of them. What do these new diagnoses mean for her?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris. Well, we know that aphasia, it's a condition that impacts your speech. It can impact the way you write, and it can also even impact the way that you understand other people's speech and writing.So someone like Wendy, I mean, she was a legendary talk show host. This can impact the way that she communicates. And sometimes aphasia can be a symptom of something else. It can be the symptom of a stroke or a brain tumor. And sometimes we see it associated with some types of neurodegenerative brain diseases, which takes us to Wendy's other diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. Now, frontotemporal dementia, according to Mayo Clinic, it can be a blanket term to refer to brain disease and changes in the brain that we see in the frontal lobe and temporal lobe. Those changes can be, we can see shrinking in the area or the buildup of substances in the area. And we know that, according to one expert who I spoke with, said that these two things can sometimes be related. He said patients with Wendy's condition sometimes can first develop progressive aphasia and then later develop other cognitive impairments. With time, frontotemporal in patients can turn into what we see as dementia later in age. Now, it's interesting, when you think of Wendy, she's in her 50s. I believe she's age 59. So you might think, well, how did she, you know, come to this diagnosis? Frontotemporal often begins between the ages of 40 and 65. So that's what we know about aphasia and frontotemporal dementia when it comes to Wendy Williams' health -- Boris.",

And, you know, with physical therapy as well.And Wendy's team, they said that they were sharing her diagnosis. She was diagnosed last year, but they're sharing the diagnosis today because, quote, they want correct -- they want to correct inaccurate and hurtful rumors about her health. So this really helps our understanding of what she's going through, but also it raises awareness around aphasia and frontotemporal dementia as well -- Boris.",
