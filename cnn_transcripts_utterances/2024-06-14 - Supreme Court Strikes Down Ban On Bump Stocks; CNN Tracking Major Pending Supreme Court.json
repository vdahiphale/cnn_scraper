      "sentences": "Welcome to the lead. I'm Jake Tapper. This hour, a new and terrifying inflight scare investigators are trying to figure out why a Southwest Airlines plane made a rare and unsafe rolling motion during flight. What you need to know as the busy summer travel season takes off.Plus, in just hours we're going to get our first public glimpse of Princess Catherine since Christmas. What the palace said today about her cancer battle and her plans to try and resume some of her royal duties. But leading this hour, yesterday today and for the next two weeks, the U.S. Supreme Court will dominate the political conversation in this country. Today it's a major guns decision, the justices ruling six to three to strike down a federal ban on bump stocks. The ban was initially approved by Donald Trump in 2018 after the massacre at a Las Vegas Music Festival. You might remember a gunman killed 58 people at the outdoor concert when he set up perch on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and open fire for at least 10 minutes. By the time police breached the room, they say the shooter was dead, but they found 23 weapons in the room, 12 were firearms with bump stocks attached. That attack, by the way, is the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. So I know some of you are probably out there wondering what exactly is a bump stock. I keep talking about bump stocks. What is it? So, it's this piece seen here, it can be attached to a semi-automatic weapon. When a shooter uses a semi-automatic rifle, they have to pull the trigger each time they want to fire. A bump stock harnesses the energy of the fired weapon to make pulling the trigger faster, which allows the shooter to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, theoretically. Let's bring in Stephen Gutowski. He is the founder of The Reload which focuses on firearms policy and politics and is an expert when it comes to firearms. So we always want to know what we're talking about here. So, Stephen, a bump stock makes a semi-automatic rifle more like an automatic weapon, almost not quite, but almost like a machine gun.",

They've been charged with many, many different federal crimes, but that's one that has been used on, as I said, hundreds. And just from the oral arguments, the justices, a majority seem to suggest that prosecutors had gone too far with an expanded reading of that federal law that was passed actually to get at accounting practices and actual evidence issues, destruction of evidence. So they didn't think the law was properly used is that's my guess on that one.

And so I think what they're going to they're trying to do is figure out some sort of precedent that they can set on this very thorny issue of presidential immunity. And I suspect what they're going to do is they're going to do it narrowly, come up as close as they can get to nine zero for something that trims back some of the broader outreaches of Jack Smith's case, but tells the district court the things that you can actually demonstrate a real crimes, go with that stuff. And so, Trump's absolutely right, it's not going to happen on a timetable that people -- a lot of people would like it to.

He's out with a brand new book, a captivating read it offers a critique of the court that only a unique insider could he talks about scrutiny, he talks about independence. He also talks about the need for trust with the nine people whose decisions affect every single American.With us right now is retired judge David Tatel. He served on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for 30 years, filling the seat that had been vacated by Ruth Bader Ginsburg when she was appointed to the Supreme Court.
