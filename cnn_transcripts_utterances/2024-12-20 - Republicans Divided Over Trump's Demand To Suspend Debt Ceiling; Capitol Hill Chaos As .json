You are watching ONE WORLD.In exactly 12 hours' time, federal funding will expire in the United States if Congress doesn't act. House Republicans are now making a last-minute scramble to keep the government open. Sources now say they expect to hold votes on a funding plan, but are unlikely to hold a separate vote on the debt limit. Now it comes after Donald Trump and his billionaire backer Elon Musk blew up a bipartisan bill earlier this week. Then yesterday, the Republican-led House failed to pass a second funding plan that included the explosive demand by the president-elect to increase the debt ceiling. Still, some Republican lawmakers remain optimistic that a deal will get done. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD): We're going to get this done. It's just going to take a little bit of time yet. We need to get this done. It will be exceptionally stupid if we don't get this done. And I always believe that cooler heads will prevail. And that we will actually do our job around here. REP. CARLOS GIMENEZ (R-FL): Yesterday we tried. There were 38 Republicans that did not vote for a continuing to fund the government, helping the folks that have been ravaged by hurricanes and our farmers and basically all Democrats voted against that too. And so, you know, we need to keep this government running, my personal opinion. We need to get to the finish line. It's like sausage making. I guess it isn't pretty. But we need to get there because I certainly don't want to see the government shut down. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And in posting on a social media platform earlier, he said that ifthere's going to be a shutdown, he wants it to happen while Joe Biden is still president. CNN's Annie Grayer joins me now live from Capitol Hill. So we're starting to get the contours of what a Plan C would look like. And that would essentially be splitting into multiple pieces here, allowing each bill to pass or fail, essentially on their own merits. That would include a CR through March, disaster relief funding and farm aid. Notably missing though is the debt ceiling vote and that is something that Donald Trump wants to address right now.

This is what the planthat we're hearing from sources in the room, but we have not gotten official bill text and things seem to be changing at a rapid pace. What we saw last night was 38 Republicans voted against the plan that Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson supported, because the idea of suspending the debt limit is a very controversial one in the House Republican Conference. It's not something that has unanimous support. We saw that play out publicly last night, and that is what's forced Republicans to go back to the negotiating table. But lawmakers have been meeting in Speaker Mike Johnson's office all morning. President-elect JD Vance was there, including Trump's pick for -- to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought. Everyone is trying to get on the same page. And this idea of splitting up the votes into separate ones is something that they -- that Republicans if they can get more buy-in from. But in the room behind me is where Republicans are going to be meeting shortly to really sell this plan and to get a temperature check with the rest of the conference. Is this idea have enough support to move forward and go to the floor? We'll find out more at around 12:30.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, first of all, I'll say I think it's very unlikely that you'll see Donald Trump fly to Washington to dealwith this. I know that he's really tasked J.D. Vance, the VP-elect, to be his eyes and ears on the Hill and also to be in these negotiations, as Andy just laid out, and really work on the nitty-gritty of this with Mike Johnson. But look, Donald Trump really threw a lot of people, you know, for a loop. He surprised a lot of people when he came out on Wednesday, not only in opposition to this bill, but also throwing in the idea of doing -- dealing with the debt limit. And that's something, you know, dealing with the debt ceiling is very complicated. It's an incredibly complicated issue. It's also something that takes several weeks, if not months, to work out. So I know that that kind of created a lot of uneasiness on Capitol Hill, and now we're actually seeing that potentially be dropped from whatever they are going to be passing this afternoon, or at least trying to do so. Now, when I talk to Donald Trump's advisors and those who are talking with him about this, they say that really, he was still negotiating up until Wednesday, when he saw the text of this bill. He was really asking people around him, you know, what are the benefits to having a long-term or short-term spending deal, specifically, how would it affect him once he is in office and what he wants to do with his agenda? But once that text came out, he very vehemently, I'm told, felt like it gave way too much away to Democrats and that it was far too much spending. So that's kind of where some of the behind the scenes of this was. We also know that he has discussed, over the past couple weeks now, this idea of wanting to have the debt ceiling dealt with before he takes office. But it didn't become that serious, of course, until he came out and said that publicly. Now, all to say, when I talk to Donald Trump's team, they say, essentially, the reason he is saying all this, what he really believes is that he wants to clear the decks before he takes office on January 20th. What they mean by that is, one, there is going to be a shutdown or some unsavory spending fight, particularly as it relates to the debt ceiling as well. He wants that to be on Biden's watch. He wants Joe Biden to be the one who might be blamed with some of the negative impacts and the fallout of what that could mean. He also wants this to not be an issue when he's in office on day one because he wants Congress to focus on his priorities and his agenda, not on some kind of messy spending fight. So that's where Donald Trump and his team is coming at this. Now, as for your question, and you brought up Elon Musk, his billionaire backer, I mean, it's very clear how influential and powerful he is through all of this. But I will add that when I talk to Trump's team as well about the Musk dynamic, they say that both Donald Trump and Elon Musk have been talking about this before Musk even took to X to start attacking Republicans on this. So that's one thing to keep in mind as well. All to say, it's very unclear where Donald Trump will be when they see the contours of this next deal and whether, you know, if this doesn't include the debt ceiling, what that means for how he will react. But all of this has also been a little bit surprising because we also know that him and Mike Johnson have had a very close relationship. Donald Trump has been very supportive of Johnson in the past. However, the way that he is responding right now to how Johnson is dealing with this spending really could jeopardize that speaker's gavel come next year.",

And yet, here we are, less than 12 hours away from a potential government shutdown.

And Speaker Johnson was with the president, the vice president, and Elon Musk, elect, rather, last weekend at the Army-Navy game. They could have talked about it then. Instead, what we have is, I think it was what, 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, Elon Musk sending out 70 tweets on X about this bill, and all of a sudden, everything is upended. And I'll tell you, part of what I think is going to come to bear several times more during the Trump administration, Americans are going to start asking themselves, why is someone who is an unelected corporate billionaire who has financial interests in what goes into this bill. And by that, I'm talking about Elon Musk. I'm talking about when it comes to defense spending and his defense contracts. I'm talking about some of the spending and some of the tax breaks that he gets for his EVs. So here's someone who has direct financial interests, spent $260 million to get Donald Trump elected. And now he's the one driving the bus on what we do with the budget. I don't think Americans are going to believe that it was Democrats' fault. Also because this is actually a repeat of what we saw around the immigration legislation that was ready to go forward. Donald Trump makes a phone call, and all of a sudden, Republicans are essentially blowing up the bill and blowing up the deal. And the last thing I'll say on this, just from the politics, whether it's - - whether Mike Johnson is able to remain speaker or not, Whoever is the speaker going forward in this new Trump administration, is going to have a very challenging time trying to do their job, given the very small majority they have. And if they have to worry about whether the Vivek Ramaswamy or, you know, Elon Musk or Donald Trump are going to, you know, blow up a deal once the deal has been made.",

Well, a U.S. delegation visiting Syria has canceled a news conference citing security concerns and will only do a virtual briefing now. Top State Department envoys are in Damascus, where they met the de facto government, including rebel leader Ahmed al-Sharaa. They're the first U.S. officials in Syria since the fall of dictator Bashar al-Assad. The Defense Department says that the U.S. has around 2,000 troops in Syria. That's more than double what was previously disclosed. A Pentagon spokesman explains. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PATRICK RYDER, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PRESS SECRETARY: I learned today that in fact there are approximately 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria. As I understand it, and as it was explained to me, these additional forces are considered temporary rotational forces that deploy to meet shifting mission requirements. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think there was probably a lot ofnervousness around this high-level delegation, but it is quite remarkable, Bianna, because U.S. and Syria have not had diplomatic ties in more than 12 years. So here you have this senior State Department-level delegation that went to Damascus. They are supposed to give a virtual press briefing on the phone any moment now. So we are hoping to learn more details about the meeting that they had with HTS, and specifically with its leader, Ahmed al- Sharaa, who, as you know, is a designated terrorist by the U.S. He has a $10 million bounty on his head. So you have to imagine that Sharaa and the U.S. delegation talked about removing those designations of his group, HTS, and he himself being terrorist. They will certainly be pushing for lifting of the U.S. sanctions on Syria so they can get their economy back up and running. But certainly the U.S. message to Sharaa and the other Syrian officials they met with was that they hope to see a Syrian government that is inclusive, that is representative, that includes women and minorities and a variety of sex, that Syria does not again become a home to terrorists like ISIS. And, of course, one of the main focuses for these U.S. officials was to encourage HTS to help them find journalist, Austin Tice, who disappeared some 12 years ago. Roger Carstens, the top hostage affairs official, was on this trip alongside Barbara Leaf, the top State Department official for the Middle East. We are expecting to hear from them momentarily. So hopefully there will be some answers both on how they feel this transition is going and how they feel the search for Austin Tice is going. Bianna.",

Alex Marquardt, thank you so much. Keep us posted on the press briefing. And inside Syria, the mood is mostly one of joy. This as tens of thousands of Syrians gathered in the streets of Damascus and other towns after Friday prayers to celebrate the fall of the Assad regime. The euphoria continued as dusk fell with people chanting and holding flags and their cell phones to mark the occasion. It's the first such demonstration since Assad's ouster. The United Nations says about 100,000 Syrians have returned to the country from abroad since the Assad regime fell, but some came back to weigh up the situation and then left again. There's fear that the current instability could lead to further chaos. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Before Ahmed Murjan (ph) hugs his mother for the first time in 13 years, they both kneel in prayer. Gratitude for a reunion they never believed would come. This is one of many emotional homecomings across Syria after the sudden fall of the Assad regime. At just 19 years old, with security forces hunting him down, Murjan fled his family's home in Aleppo. Here he is in 2016. AHMED MURJAN (PH), REFUGEE RETURNED HOME: Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): Reporting for an opposition-based media network as barrel bombs rained down from the sky. Later that year, Murjan filmed the exodus as thousands withdrew from the last remaining rebel enclave in Aleppo. We are leaving with our dignity, Murjan says in this clip. And we will return one day. That promised return is now finally on the horizon. Murjan says he is planning to move back to Aleppo from Gaziantep, Turkey, where he currently lives with his wife and their two young daughters.",

But there are thousands of Amazon drivers on the picket lines in four states at seven locations. But we're also learning from the Teamsters that there are support picket lines happening across the country at 199 locations. So those are folks from other unions, maybe some Amazon employees that are out there supporting these drivers who are asking for better wages. Ultimately, Amazon says that they have invested millions of dollars into their third-party driver program and hope to raise the average wage to $22 an hour. But you heard from some of those workers there. They work very long hours in sometimes tough conditions. And they say that the company is actually just adding pressure for them to do the work a lot faster. And I should note, Bianna, also on strike today, Starbucks workers, in three different locations, Chicago, Los Angeles, and also in Seattle. They've taken to the picket lines this morning. They have been negotiating, the union there, with Starbucks since February, but the union says they had asked Starbucks for a new contract by the end of the year. And, of course - - of course, we are approaching the end of the year right now. Starbucks, for their part, says that there has been minimal disruption this morning and into today. A source that is familiar with the Impact says about 10 stores out of Starbucks, 10,000 stores, did not open on time this morning because of the strike. And it's the same story with these workers asking for better wages, better benefits. But ultimately, Starbucks does have the responsibility to negotiate with these workers, because, Bianna, they do recognize the more than 500 unionized stores. This is an interesting time of year for this to be happening, Bianna. This is a critical time of year for Amazon and Starbucks. These unions know what they're doing launching these strikes at this time of year. It may not make the impact financially that they're hoping for, Bianna, but it's certainly getting people's attention across the country, and that is a win for these unions.",
