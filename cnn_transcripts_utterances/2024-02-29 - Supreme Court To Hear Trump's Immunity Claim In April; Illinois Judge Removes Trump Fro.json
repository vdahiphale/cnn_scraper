Happy Leap Year.Right now on CNN THIS MORNING: The Supreme Court agrees to hear Donald Trump's absolute immunity arguments, throwing his 2024 trial schedule into turmoil. Plus, yet another legal challenge for Trump. An Illinois judge booting the former president off that state's ballot. We'll look at that. And a deal to keep the federal government open is going to get -- have a vote in a matter of hours. Still, the threat of a shutdown looms. (MUSIC)",

It's wonderful to have you with us. We're going to start there. The Supreme Court agreeing to decide whether or not former President Donald Trump is immune from criminal prosecution for the actions he took on and leading up to January 6th. It's a move that the court made that plays right into Donald Trump's deflect and delay strategy. And it really is a big win for the former president who's doing everything legally possible to push his trial dates past the November election. The justices are going to hear arguments in late April on this, a ruling not expected until late June. Meanwhile, in Illinois judge has removed Trump from that state's ballot based on the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban. The former president's legal team has a narrow window to appeal the decision. The Supreme Courts already considering whether states have the right to remove a candidate from the ballot. Joining us now to discuss all of this is White House reporter Catherine Lucey. Catherine, good morning to you. It's great to be here in studio with you.

It means that the earliest probably if this were to go forward, we late summer at that point, the Republican convention has already happened. Early voting starts in some states in September, right? So, it really pushes this right into the general election season.So this is, you know, what Trump's team is looking for. They want to keep pushing these things off as much as possible. The Biden folks, they want to draw contrast between themselves and Trump. You see them doing this very aggressively now, trying to show his -- what they argue is his leadership compared to Trump's chaos. They're going to continue doing that. These trials remain in the news, you know, whether or not they're moving forward -- you know, the legal chaos surrounding him is there. So, they're going to continue doing that regardless.",

We're now seeing kind of expand Illinois did this yesterday. The court heard arguments about, okay, should Donald Trump be kickedoff the ballot under the insurrectionist ban. They seem very inclined to decide to keep him on the ballot, right, to tell states you can't do this. He's not necessarily been convicted of anything yet, et cetera. And then the flip side of that was going to be -- well, they could have just denied hearing this immunity thing altogether. They could have led the D.C. circuit courts stand and that would sort of kind of split the difference because you're right, like the court itself is honestly facing a crisis of confidence if you look at the numbers of people who trust it. Do you think -- how do you think that is going to play into our politics overall, if it starts to feel to Americans as those Supreme Court has decided the election.",

It's got a lot of momentum behind him, of course, in Ukraine, these pushing frontlines forward. So just seeing that sort of confidence I think is quite symbolic.General themes coming out there. One of them essentially, his usual one, that America basically needs to get over itself. It doesn't rule the world anymore. I did pick out a couple of things which I thought were interesting. He's saying that Russia needs to strengthen its Western border referring to how Sweden and Finland joined NATO. So he sees that as a defensive move. That's how he's spinning it anyway. He says concerns about Russia attacking Europe, all the thoughts of total ravings of lunatics. The other one, Kasie, I know you've been talking about this recently. This idea that Russia thinking about putting nukes into space, saying these are planted stories by the U.S. He actually criticized the U.S. for blocking Russian proposals, which included a draft treaty on preventing weapons in outer space, that they prepared as early as 2008. So he's essentially suggesting that the U.S. actually, you know, isn't saying no to nukes in space, and projecting onto Russia is false, but, you know, these are just obviously Putin's words.",

I -- the conversation in Washington, I think it doesn't change, does it? Because as long as he's repeating the same lines is he would say that I didn't think it really does change the conversation much, but in terms of Russia is just about over the long term building his momentum as a tough guy, a winning tough guy, the one taking on the West.He talks a lot actually about the BRICS countries which were traditionally the developing nations who worked together as a group, saying that they've got this massive cart, the world economy now. And that's all speaking to the same thing is compare -- it's more powerful than the G8. Therefore, you know, the West is becoming weaker. He's on the winning side. That's the entire narrative.",
