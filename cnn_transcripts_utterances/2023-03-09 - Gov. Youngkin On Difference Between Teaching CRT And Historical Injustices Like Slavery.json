Communities, nationwide, reckoning with big questions, about parental rights in K through 12 classrooms, and what children are taught, in school. In Virginia, Governor Glenn Youngkin has made education, the centerpiece, of his successful campaign, and his agenda.

Thanks for coming from all over the Commonwealth, and focusing on this most important topic. We almost have to step back a little bit, and reflect on the fact that Virginia was known to have the best high schools. We have the best colleges, the best universities, ranging all the way from, from Thomas Jefferson High School, which was ranked number one, in the country, as the best high school, to our revered HBCUs, to a higher ed system that's ranked top, in the country. And yet, here we are, at Ground Zero, Ground Zero, in the debate, and the battle, over high schools, colleges, curriculum, parents, the role of teachers. This is Virginia. The big question we always ask is, how did we get here, though? And you look back to pre-pandemic. And what happened was administrations lowered expectations, for children, and for schools. And then, we got into the pandemic. And parents, all of a sudden, had a front-row seat, in their child's education, as kitchens and family rooms were transformed into classrooms. And what they saw, they didn't like. They saw the result of lowered expectations. They actually saw Jake, that what was being taught in the schools was pitting children against one another, based on race or sex, or religion. And what they also saw were materials that really weren't comfortable for them, and consistent with their family values. And then, once folks went back to school, after an extended closure, which was unnecessary, in Virginia, in my view, what happened was masks were mandated, and violence in schools went up, as school resource officers were barred, from being in schools. And the behavioral health crisis escalated. And academic performance plummeted. We saw the scores come out, over the summer from the National Report Card, otherwise known as NAEP. And what we saw was Virginia kids suffered more than kids, across the country. Fourth graders had the largest learning loss, in math, the largest learning loss, in reading. And all of a sudden, the fear that so many parents had that schools weren't delivering for their children was realized.",

And I'm just in awe of the great men and women, across the Commonwealth, who have dedicated themselves, to educating our children. And so, thank you, thank you, because I know that there will be somebody, along the way, who says, \"I remember my teacher,\" and it will be you, and you had an impact on their life. And so, thank you. One of the big challenges that we have, across the Commonwealth, and across the country, is just a horrific shortage in teachers. And the reality is, of course, that historically, teachers, in my view, were underpaid. And it was why I made at the center of our campaign, making sure that we pay teachers more. And I'm proud to say that, in my - in our first year, we were able to pay teachers more, and deliver on that promise, a 5 percent raise, last year, another 5 percent raise, this year, for 10 percent, over a two-year period. But we need to do better. And we know that because if we're going to attract the best and the brightest, into teaching, we need to make sure that they can afford to live, they can afford to live, in Virginia. And so, that's why we went to work, over the summer, when there was such a shortage in teachers, to dedicate $30 million, to recruit teachers, from across the country, to streamline the licensing transfer process, when teachers come from other states, and to make sure that teachers, who might have retired, and might come back, there won't be any blocks, to them coming back and teaching again. So, in the heart of education is parents. Right behind them are our teachers. And we know that when we have a partnership, between parents and teachers, Virginia's kids will thrive. So, thank you, again, for being a teacher.",

See, Virginia has some of the toughest gun laws, in the country. And what we continue to find is that those gun laws, don't keep us safe. Because it's not laws that keep us safe. It's the behavior of people that we need to make sure that we are paying attention to. Parents have a responsibility to keep guns out of their young children's hands, and they need to be held accountable for that. And on top of that, coming out of the pandemic, we have an extraordinary behavioral health crisis, across the Commonwealth, and across the nation. See, coming out of the pandemic, I think, our children were put in circumstances that they had never yet - they've never yet experienced, loneliness, isolation. And before we know it, we see the behavioral health crisis, representing itself, in our young people worse than almost any other generation. And that's why it's been so important for us to move forward with an aggressive transformation, of Virginia's behavioral health system. You see, our health system can't keep up with the demand. The behavioral health crisis has put such an extensive burden, on the system that we have to transform it. And that means that in our plan, which we call \"Right Help, Right Now,\" we proposed investing nearly $250 million, in order to create capacity, in schools, with counselors, with telemedicine, to create capacity, with mobile crisis units, and crisis receiving units, and to provide capacity, after a crisis, so that there's a place for people to go.",

And it was worse than we thought.And one of the big challenges, of course, is that it started prior to the pandemic, when expectations and standards were lowered, for all Virginia kids. And sadly, they met those lowered expectations. And in fact, during the pandemic, when schools were closed, for an extended period of time, kids lost even more. And the NAEP scores, and our SOL scores show this. They show that, as I said, earlier, that our fourth graders had the largest learning loss, in the nation, in math, and in reading. And in fact, for our Black families, and our Hispanic families, it was disproportionately worse. So, we went to work, immediately. And we did exactly the things that you pointed out. One is how do we provide tutoring. And so, we enabled a free tutoring service, through schoolhouse.org, for parents to come. We just announced $30 million, in micro grants, for parents, to apply for grants, for special tutoring services, for their children. We worked hard to bring more teachers back in, and our opening of a teacher pipeline, from other states, to make the licensing requirements easier, in addition to $30 million, in recruitment money, were critical. The bottom line is that we have got to make up lost ground. Two decades of progress was lost. And we've got to go fix this. The reality is that it starts all the way - it starts all the way through K through 12. But we also see it almost the worst in our younger children. And if they don't catch up, then they're in for a lifetime of challenges. That's why I was so excited about the Virginia Literacy Act that we passed, last year, in a bipartisan basis, where we're standardizing the way we teach reading, in Virginia, the science of reading. We may have known it as phonics, when we were growing up. But all teachers will be taught the same way on how to use instruction and materials, as well as parents, and where through my budget proposals can extend that to fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade. This is a critical time for us, to not lose a generation. And that's why we have been so proactive, to make sure that extra learning opportunities, extra funding, more teachers are made available, to students, all across Virginia.",

And then it was coupled with the fact that there was a young woman who was sexually assaulted in a school, and the superintendent moved that child, without telling the family, to another school and another young woman was sexually assaulted.You know, it took a new governor, an executive order, an attorney general, and Jason Miyares' investigation for nine months, in order to get an indictment of what was a cover-up.

See, I do believe that there's moments where we have to make decisions about what's age appropriate and what is appropriate. And those are hard decisions, but we shouldn't run away from them. We should engage in them. And these are healthy discussions for us to have. What books should be in an elementary school library? Should they have explicit pictures in them? Or not? Well, I don't think they should be there. And these are decisions that I think we should take on as opposed to run away from. And therefore, had that bill passed, I would have signed it. And then we would have engaged with communities. Not -- not in a strong handed way but in an engaged way, to listen and discuss and make good decisions for our kids.

And after my dad lost his job, we moved down to Virginia Beach, and I was at Lynnhaven, now middle school, but junior high school at the time and I had a pretty good basketball game.

I was telling folks earlier, I wanted to be an astronaut. They didn't tell me that at 6'6\", you're not going into a rocket. But it was an extraordinary benefit of the sport that really carried me a long way. I love school. And I look back and I'm envious of all of you who are here in school.

You know, I just have to say that, you know, 40 years ago I was in Virginia Beach, and I was washing dishes and taking out trash at Belvidere coffee shop.And I had an extraordinary opportunity with great education and people took interest in my professional career and I thought I was in my dream job when I had a chance to take over a firm that I worked at for 25 years. Then I found myself with this real clear view that Virginia was heading in the wrong direction and maybe there was a different way to do this. Maybe there was a way to bring people together around common sense, bring people together around values that aren't that controversial. We just need to express them clearly to one another and get moving. And I've been so pleased by the fact that all the things we campaigned on we accomplished. I have a big job. I love my job. Thank you for hiring me. Thank you for letting me come to work every day and go to work for 8.7 million Virginians. That's where my focus is right now. And I believe there was an enormous amount of work yet to do in Virginia. We've got a budget to negotiate. We have a lot of work still to do in education. Every morning, I wake up and I thank the Lord for putting me there. I ask him for help and then I go to work with a spring in my step. And so, again, thank you for hiring me.",

We have a long way to go, but I am so proud of what we have done in our first year. All it does is raise the bar and want me to get more done faster in our second year, so we don't lose a generation of kids, and that Virginia can return to what she once was which was a place where people came from all over the world to come to Virginia for our schools, for our great K through 12, for our great universities.
