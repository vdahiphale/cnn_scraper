I mean, she has a legacy that is beyond where she grew up, how she grew up, the relationship she was in with Ike Turner, she really expanded beyond that.And the thing that I think is really amazing about Tina Turner is the fact of her musical legacy and how many decades, as you were speaking to, she was putting out music. And at a time when people wanted to silo black music, she was like, no; this is the kind of music I'm going to do. I'm going to be the queen of rock and roll and I'm going to do songs in this way, in this genre. She was iconic in the way she performed and for how long she performed. Her positive outlook, despite what she may have gone through before, and I'd be remiss if I did not mention her energy performing and those legs. Tina Turner was known for those fantastic legs and those dance moves, right? Her iconic hair. She was always, always true and honest to herself, as she evolved as an artist and you saw that even with the kinds of songs that she did like doing, and the songs that spoke to her simply the best, which was a fantastic song. I mean, the song from Mad Max and also GoldenEye. She did iconic songs for film, for TV, but also just her songs are timeless. You could still listen to them now and they still get you in a groove.",

I looked up too quickly, I got them confused. But it's that energy that she brought to the stage and to her music and that that sort of, gravelly, gruff voice that she had that could always hit those notes, but also make you feel it in your chest, make you want to move but also just understand what she is singing about and giving it a feeling that maybe nobody else could with their voice.",

I mean, one of the things about Tina Turner who not only a legend in the musical business, but also someone who exemplifies the true scope of the last century.This is a woman who was born in the small town of Nutbush, Tennessee, she picked cotton as a child, sang in the church choir and eventually met up with a man who was her husband, the abusive, Ike Turner. And her life transformed into something which now we will enjoy for the ages in her music. Importantly, so though, she transcended all these genres from R&amp;B to rock and roll, touring with the Rolling Stones being seen in the company with the likes of Bowie and others. I will always say we talk about our favorite Tina Turner songs. And I think that there's - I never like to make a list, because simply the best has to be up there. But for me in many ways, you can never take the song away from the performance and Tina Turner at Live Aid in Philadelphia 1985 doing \"State of Shock\" and \"It's Only Rock 'n' Roll\" with Mick Jagger, she simply showed the boys who was the best. And that was always the thing about Tina Turner from where she came, the battle she fought, the song she sang, the pain she showed, the joy she gave, the dance moves that left everybody else on the floor. She was simply someone who never gave up. And though she went through this terrible long illness we hear over many years, she was also someone who at one point in her life after being on film, on stage, there's a musical now about her life, a film made about her life obviously with the great Angela Bassett in it. She was someone who also stepped back from the spotlight to live out her last years in dignity. And that of course is a testament for her strength.",

And if you just see the wide range of people who have been sending text, saying not Tina, she's my favorite, old, young, black, white, man, woman, everyone. She is one of those artists that transcends everything. She always did and she always will. And I just think, it is a sad day.

And here is what Magic Johnson just put out on Twitter.He says, \"Rest in peace to one of my favorite artists of all time, the legendary queen of rock n' roll Tina Turner. I've seen her many, many times and hands down, she gave one of the best live shows I've ever seen. She always gave you your money's worth.\" Bryan Adams, he actually went on tour with her. He writes: \"My condolences to Erwin and Tina's family. I will be forever grateful for the time we spent together on tour, in the studio and as friends.\" Bryan Adams goes on to say, \"Thank you for being the inspiration to millions of people around the world for speaking your truth and giving us the gift of your voice. It's Only Love and that's all.\" You have George Takei who calls her a true legend. He says, \"She was our River Deep and our Mountain High, the Private Dancer in our hearts. She showed us that love really does have everything to do with it,\" so true, \"and that we really did need another hero. And she was it. Rest now, Proud Mary. Raise your voice high in the heavens.\" I think that Marc Malkin makes a great point is how are these female trailblazers like Beyonce and others going to address this, and that is what I am keeping my eye out for is what is Taylor Swift going to say? What is Beyonce going to say? What are all the different music legends who are still with us, both young and older going to be saying. I was just talking to Ringo Starr over the weekend who is turning 83 this summer and he's on tour. Eighty-three for all intents and purposes is still young. And we know that Tina Turner had some serious health issues that some of us have touched on. So hopefully we'll hear some more details from her family as to what happened.
