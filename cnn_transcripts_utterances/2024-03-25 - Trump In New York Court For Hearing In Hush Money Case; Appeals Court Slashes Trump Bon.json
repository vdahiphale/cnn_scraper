      "sentences": "Welcome to Inside Politics. I'm Manu Raju in for Dana Bash. And a crucial day for Donald Trump's legal, financial and political future. Moments ago, the former president got a financial lifeline from a New York appeals court. It reduced the bond he must pay in a civil fraud case for more than $450 million to $175 million and gave him more time to pay for it. That means he might have the cash to put up without having to sell off any of his assets.Meanwhile, Trump is inside a New York courtroom -- courthouse for a criminal hearing, a separate case involving hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels. Trump's legal team was just chastised by the judge for accusing the Manhattan district attorney's office of prosecutorial misconduct without any evidence. CNN's Kaitlan Collins is live in New York City outside the courthouse. Kaitlan, what's happening behind you right now?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. A lot going on here, Manu. Multiple legal developments on that front for Donald Trump. And what we're witnessing right now is Donald Trump is back inside that courtroom. The judge had taken a 45-minute recess, as they were sorting through this -- before they left the judge had been deeply skeptical of the arguments that Trump's legal team was making -- essentially questioning why this was happening at all.Clearly not into their argument for either dismissing the trial outright or delaying it even further than it has already been delayed. A reminder, it has been delayed because of this very issue over documents related to Michael Cohen. And when they were turned over to Trump's legal team. That is why that case is not starting today, as it had initially been scheduled. And we heard from Donald Trump a few moments ago. I should note that was his reaction, walking into the courtroom to the bond announcement that we got from a New York state appeals court, saying that not only does he have 10 more days to pay his bond in the civil fraud case to put up that bond, he also does not have to put up the entire amount which is about $450 million and growing by about $100,000 each day. The judge now says, he only has to pay -- the appeals court says he now only has to pay $175 million of that. For more on this reaction, I want to bring in CNN's Paula Reid. And Paula, we were just hearing Trump as he was walking into there, not talking about what's happening inside the courtroom. But instead talking about this decision by the appeals court. He said he will pay this in the next 10 days. It's not unclear entirely how, but it is way -- way less than what he was initially believing he was going to put up.",

He was facing a possibility that at the end of the day, the attorney general of New York could start the process of seizing his assets.And now he has been handed this incredible win, this lifeline from the appeals court that says he only has to put up $175 million, not the nearly 500 million that he was unable to get either underwritten or post. And then they've also reined in some other aspects of that civil fraud verdict. He and his sons can continue to run businesses and seek loans in the state of New York. And they've also put off the attorney general's ability to enforce this judgment until September. So, this is an enormous victory for former President Trump in terms of the civil fraud verdict. Now, one of his lawyers in the civil fraud case, Alina Habba, just released a statement saying that they're very pleased with this ruling. And they believe that it rains in some of the judges' verdict, which they of course believe is, quote, an affront to all Americans is the first important step in what will be a continued fight because they are appealing that decision. Now, Kaitlan, it's not expected that they will win on an appeal. But this issue of the bond this has been hanging over Trump and a huge victory for him.",

The district attorney's office has said they will be OK with a 30-day delay to review this additional evidence. But the Trump team is pushing for 90 days. And things not going quite as well for the Trump team here in this case this morning.The judge clearly skeptical of their accusation that the prosecutors conspired with federal investigators to withhold evidence and just released it in recent weeks. And he really pushed the Trump team to show proof or case law or something to support these serious accusations that they have made against the prosecutors here. So, the judge for a few times there, his temper flared a little bit, his voice was raised. So, he's clearly very skeptical of what the Trump team is alleging here.

He otherwise would not have been able to get. The judge said he committed fraud in the filing of financial statements and paperwork, and also committed fraud in other ways by overvaluing.And so, now the judge after a bench trial, there was no jury involved said, I have these findings. I decided about the credibility of witnesses. That's all under my purview to do so. You've got this huge amount you're going to have to pay. Now in New York, it is close to bond in order to then appeal that decision. It's twofold for the reasons why. One is because look, you don't want to pay out immediately to who you owe. Because what if the appeals court says you shouldn't have had to, you can't get that money back (Inaudible) you already paid out. Second issue is what if in the course of your appeal, you become insolvent, or your money is gone all of a sudden or something else happens. And now the person you owe money to can't get it. The court want to have some assurance that you can actually pay. That's why we find ourselves here right now. And originally it was this full amount. Now the judges saying -- the judges of the appellate court are saying, actually you have 10 more days to pay it, and it's but half of what you had to pay. It doesn't to me say they're going to tell you that the judge on the trial court got it wrong. But it does say look, maybe there's enough money to actually give that guarantee that I'll get something back and that the appeal can still go forward.",

Saying that for whatever reason, we don't need 400 or however many million dollars to secure the plaintiff -- the defendant's payment down the road, $150 million insufficient. The differences they didn't tell us why.Now, it could have been they thought it was excessive. That could have been they thought that he wasn't able to pay it. I mean, who knows.

But between 350 and 400 million has been pretty consistent in the filings and people that are involved in his financial. So that's about right where he's at. So, he is liquid enough for that. I think the bonding companies have made clear that, while they weren't going to be able to take property and they certainly needed cash or cash equivalent.

We're still waiting for Judge Aileen Cannon to put a firm date on the calendar. It's unlikely that the late May date will stick. And then the case down in Georgia. Fani Willis said she's going to continue to push forward, potentially trying to start that case in August, but it's unclear how that will work after the last several months because of these efforts to disqualify her.

But the idea that Alvin Bragg himself did not want to bring this is not true. But I think, Manu, what's important and what's being telegraphed there so clearly by the former president is his unhappiness with the decision that we just got from the judge there. Judge Juan Merchan, who decided that, yes, this case will be going forward. They are not going to dismiss it as Trump's attorneys had been arguing for and they're also not going to delay it any further than it was already delayed. It was supposed to start today. Now jury selection will begin on April 15. And that was essentially what Trump was summing up there, which really -- we got an indication that he was quite annoyed with how today went by what we were hearing from our reporters inside the room, the observations of Trump's body language as he was sitting there, and the judge was pressing his attorney Todd Blanche on these efforts. They were hopeful going into this that they would succeed in getting at least a few more weeks of delay out of the judge here. They were not ultimately successful with that.
