Conservatives are bracing for a potential political white ballot after 14 years in power. Standby for exit polls and results. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Pamela Brown. And you're in the Situation Room. First up tonight, President Biden's race to shore up support from top Democrats amid these growing concerns, his debate against Donald Trump might have been a fatal blow to his reelection campaign. I'm going to go straight to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. She's at the White House. So Priscilla, is the President's stumbling when it comes to damage control?",

Now the President has tried to reassure his allies and even his campaign staff joining calls yesterday alongside Vice President Kamala Harris, and also convening those Democratic governors at a meeting here at the White House. And we are now learning more details about that candid conversation that happened behind closed door, the President's telling governors that he would stop doing events after 8Some of the room took that as a joke. And then later his campaign co- chair said quote, \"He was clearly making a joke.\" But it is these types of statements that frustrate some of his allies, the idea that the President is just fine that he is just as aggressive and he has the vigor for a second term. And basically telling allies to unseat what they saw on the debate stage. So that has been part of the cleanup that we have continued to see over the course of the last week, and that we will see more of in the days to come. Of course, the President is scheduled to go to battleground Wisconsin and Pennsylvania over the weekend. He's also going to participate in that prime time interview with ABC News, all of this to try to show that that North Carolina rally that happened right after the debate where he was quite energetic, that it wasn't a fluke. That's what advisors are trying to accomplish here. Now whether they do, still a big question going into the next few days, but tonight, the President will be here at the White House enjoying the July 4 celebrations. And it will be a chance for reporters and those invited here to the White House to see him. So, more to come, Pamela, but certainly still a scramble here in trying to respond to the ongoing criticism.",

So, he is happily criticizing both of these leaders in this moment.And I will notice, though, or note, that I think something that's really interesting is for months now, we actually haven't really seen Donald Trump and his campaign attack Vice President Harris instead, they've largely ignored her. However, that started to change this week as reality has snuck in that potentially she could succeed Joe Biden as the Democratic Party's nominee.

I have to say from my conversations with many of Trump's advisors as well as many allies close to the former president, they actually thought that this wouldn't be as big of an issue heading into this week. They thought there was going to be a lot of hand wringing, following the debate, but I got frantic calls from all corners of Trump world on Monday afternoon, asking what's going to happen?Is he going to step down? Who's going to potentially replace them? So again, they are very uncertain about how to move forward. And I think one of the issues for them is that they have spent months over a year, really, building out their general campaign infrastructure, mining data, honing their data operation, and the money, all of that geared toward a single person going against Joe Biden.

He did interviews with black radio hosts yesterday. The host came on to CNN and said, what a positive interview it was, how focused he was, how forceful he was, how honest he was. And the massive calls that they got afterward saying that they are with Joe Biden.And look, Pamela, I think that if we're going to pile on to all of the issues that Joe Biden has health wise, and it came from that \"New York Times\" piece, there were a couple of paragraphs in that \"New York Times\" piece that were very damning about Donald Trump. Both of these guys are old, talked about how Donald Trump is also declining, how he is in meetings, he, you know, starts to trail off and talks incoherencies. And in rallies, we've seen him say, names that are incorrect, dates that are incorrect, talk gibberish. And so again, if we're going to compare the two of them, let's compare the two. And what I have been hearing from so many voters from groups of people who are actually going door to door with voters and the swing states, and let's remember, those are the people that matter, a massive amount of voters are still sticking with Joe Biden. Because you know why, Pamela, they saw what we all saw on Thursday night, but they also heard what they heard. And they have all said that they will take Joe Biden on his worst night versus Donald Trump, who wants to impose an imperial presidency, who wants to rip babies from the arms of their mother, who wants to impose military tribunals to go after their -- his political opponents. All of those things matter, Pamela, because that means that is an existential threat to so many Americans in so many communities.

Many people are concerned about President Biden's capacity to serve a full four year term.This election is not about the past four years. It's about the next four years. You know, we have a situation now, whether your saying it's a choice between the incapable and the unimaginable. That's where we are right now. And I think I'd like to hear from some physicians about what happened. I mean, I know what I watched. And it just struck me that Joe Biden -- that was the beyond the bad night. That was almost a catastrophic event for the president. And if democracy is in fact on the ballot, if the rule of law on the constitutional order in people's rights, you might want to put somebody on the stage who can actually make the argument. That was not happening. Fifty million people watched that debate. Many millions more are hearing the analysis and watching the worst moments. So I think this is an enormous problem. And I do think for the good of the country, Biden should step aside and the Democrats who put up the next generation of leadership like Joe Biden said he was going to do part of transitioning being that transitional candidate. Well, you have to transit. He should transit out. I think a lot of Democrats probably agree with me on this point. Republicans are enjoying their shot for the moment.

I think it's hard to overstate just how important these next few days are going to be because this is going to be his chance to try to allay concerns. And if he's not able to, I think there's going to be a renewed push about or at least a renewed discussion about, is he the best person to have at the top of the ticket.He's got two campaign events this weekend, one in Wisconsin, one in Philadelphia. He has his first sit down interview with ABC News on Friday. And I will say I've spoken to Democrats into allies of the White House who have questioned why it's taken so long to get the President out there. And I think that has only increased anxiety about if why can't he get out there faster? Why wasn't able to get out and do an interview on Sunday right after the debate to allay concerns. Why is it taking this long? So I think these next few days and the next week, he's hosting, you know, here in D.C. with a number of leaders, he's supposed to do a solo press conference.

It's important to understand that the president's medical care isn't like what, you know, you and I have to do to see a physician or make an appointment. The President has a team of some of the world's best docs that are within every single day. And they see him every single day.

You know, perhaps the President got a lot more sleep. And one piece of the President's history that's important to understand is that he has sleep apnea, which deprives people of restorative sleep. So maybe, on top of, you know, his entire medical picture, he has trouble sleeping. Maybe he had a lot of trouble sleeping before the debate for, you know, for all kinds of reasons.

One thing is for certain, Democrats right now are really waiting and circling tomorrow on the week's calendar.

The exit polls suggesting that the Labour Party, which has been out of power for the past 14 years could win a massive 410 seats. There's only 650 seats in the British Parliament. So that would give them a majority of 170 more than every other party in the parliament.The Conservatives you can see there currently the governing party, they will go down to 131 seats according to the exit polls put some context on that. That's the worst performance for the Conservative Party in their history. And so it's an absolutely decimating for them. A real election for change by the British public, a reflection of that there's been a tweet, well, a post on X rather by Keir Starmer who is the leader of the Labour Party and would become the next prime minister of Britain. And it says this, to everyone who has campaigned for Labour in this election, who everyone who has voted for us and put their trust in our changed Labour Party, thank you. Changed Labour Party because just in 2019, Labour was seen as radically left wing, it suffered its worst election defeat back in 2019 as well. Keir Starmer, has dragged it into the center ground, making it electable, not just electable, but elected virtually now. It couldn't be his opinion polls, with the biggest majority almost in the Labour Party's history. And so a very significant moment of political change here in Britain. Pamela?",

These are the kinds of details that have been put aside for months now in search of a broad strokes framework it -- to get things going in the first place. And now they will hone in not only on the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, but details like the identity of the Palestinian prisoners, who would be released as part of this agreement, the exact ratios of hostages to Palestinian prisoners, for example, and many, many other details. One source familiar with the talks telling me that this process is expected to take two to three weeks. And while this is a significant moment, we should caveat all of this with saying that the outcome is far but assured and certainly we do not have a finalized deal in hand and nothing is agreed to until everything is ultimately agreed to.
