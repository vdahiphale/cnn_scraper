All of this as Turkey's President defends his country's quick response our other top story Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in Brussels for a historic EU meeting. Ukrainian President urging Europe to send new arms including fighter jets, and saying that his country deserves quick EU membership we are live in Brussels just ahead. But first, the bitter cold further endangering survivors and also complicating rescue efforts as rescuers race against the clock to try to clear the rubble from collapse buildings like this survivors waiting for any signs of good news. Jomana Karadsheh reports from the Southern Turkish City of Adana. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A five-year-old emerges from underneath the rubble in Turkey's hard hit her tie. One of the youngest of thousands of life saved. But for too many it was too late. In the town of Karaman they mourn one of the many who have not made it out alive with the death toll rising by the hour. This is a race against time. How many are buried under the wreckage of this massive quake zone, no one really knows estimates in the tens of thousands. Here in Adana, search and rescue crews work tirelessly around the clock, digging through what used to be a 14 storey residential building, where families lay asleep when the monstrous earthquake hit. Survivors have gathered at the site of the rescue mission, their shelter and hot meals. And in the bitter cold, they huddle around these fires, everyone with a story of the horror they've survived. The shock, the trauma, the pain visible on every face parents doing what they can to try and make their little ones forget many here are anxiously awaiting views of their loved ones and friends buried under what's left at their homes. KARADSHEH (on camera): Get down they're asking us to get down and we believe this is because they're scanning the building wreckage. This is a very, very careful and delicate operation that's going on to try and see if they can locate any survivors because so far they haven't been able to. KARADSHEH (voice over): No survivors yet, only lifeless bodies pulled. It's been three days. Why can't they get my son out this father, Wales? Is night falls the rest of the family we desperately for any news of 25-year-old --. They've been out here for three long nights.",

I mean, you think about these numbers, you think about these figures that we're discussing, they're absolutely staggering. Tens of thousands of people wounded, over 16,000 people killed, countless people now, of course, made homeless. It's really, really difficult to comprehend the scope and scale, especially when you're looking at entering now the fourth day of this crisis, and that hope that we saw previously that we might find people alive under the rubble that's slowly fading and what's coming into its place is anger and grief. You heard that there from our colleague, Jomana Karadsheh and her peace, the stories of people on the ground who are wondering why their government wasn't there. And I just want to break down for you a little bit this frustration that is not just felt in the earthquake zone is really felt across Turkey. First of all, it's about the response. This question is being asked as to whether or not the Turkish government acted quickly enough, we saw in more remote areas in that southern region that helped seemed to take forever for those families to come that some of them could hear their loved ones under the rubble but didn't have any assistance or rescue workers or equipment to be able to actually pull them out. And that we also know that many families spent several days without food, water, any assistance in not freezing cold. But again, the scope and scale and magnitude of an earthquake one of the strongest seen in this region in a century, it's possible to argue that no government could have fully prepared even one like Turkey, which has expected earthquakes sitting on a major fault line. But the second question, and you also kind of saw that there in our colleague Jomana's peace again, from that I witness on the ground is the question about building codes. Why were buildings not stable enough to withstand this? And the reason this is being asked is because Turkey had a very particular system after the earthquake in 1999. Building codes were updated, there were supposed to be more earthquake resistant rules when it comes to building these huge apartment blocks that you're seeing. But at the same time, we are looking on the ground and we are seeing these buildings that were built in recent years, you heard that again in the story that have been pancaked completely collapse. That is raising questions were the codes met could live have been saved. President Erdogan, of course, was chased with these questions, essentially, when he visited the region. And I will point out one last thing that might just point out that the Turkish government is aware of this frustration and trying to clamp down on it. Access to Twitter yesterday, as President Erdogan was touring that area, access to Twitter was limited. Signs there that they're trying to silence the concerns, but these families, they're going to keep demanding answers.",

I can't afford not to push this debate on this issue forward. He said I did he did think that he got some support from the U.K. on longer range missiles. And he also said very critically and of course, we know that this happens. There are conversations that happen in private or not and the outcome is not made public. But he said, essentially, rest assured what the assurances that I'm getting in these conversations that I'm not going to report about that I'm not going to talk about, he said, a positive. So it is his priority. And I think part of that is and this is something that seems to be shared by the leaders here, that the coming weeks and months are really important. There's a real urgency and the future of the war. And what happens to Ukraine can really be pivotal in the very, very near future. And I think that's shared and understood. But of course, he did get the congratulations from the European Council President about how much Ukraine has done despite the war to actually move towards readying itself crossing some of the hurdles in terms of judiciary, in terms of major reforms, other reforms to be able to join the European Union in the future. And to that he said to a question asked in that press conference, when was he hoping it would happen? Well, this year he said, turning to Sharm el- Sheikh and Ursula von der Leyen standing side by side with him. And I think that's another thing about Zelenskyy's visit here. He is had more time in sort of more public forums with a number of leaders, in his meeting very shortly with one on one with the Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, but it also Roberta Metsola sorry, the European Parliament precedent, we had time with her. We've seen a side of Zelenskyy, perhaps a little bit more relaxed. We've seen his humor - how he connects with these leaders. And that's another narrative that's emerged over the past 24, 36 hours is how much this one man, this President of Ukraine can influence. Are other politicians to do what they would otherwise not want today, which gets to your point, the fighter jets and the longer range missiles and he does seem to be having some progress.",

The European Union is now negotiating a tense package of sanctions against Russia to be agreed, normally around the 24th of February.

Rescue workers heard a voice and worked all night to free the family. But these are the lucky ones. The death toll now has soared past 17,000 people the race against time only intensifying. Temperatures in the disaster zone staying below zero at night before warming to about five degrees Celsius during the day and it's expected to stay that way for the next several days.

(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): To see the devastation in a city of this size is just utterly remarkable. Some streets one building fine, it seems untouched standing. The next utterly flattened, and some streets indeed with the bottom three floors of an apartment block crushed on each other and the rest of the building standing upright. It wasn't even one of those where we saw a glimmer of hope rescue workers running towards. And you can see them running behind me here as well. Running towards the scene where they thought they had found an 18-year-old girl alive sadly in front of her mother, she was brought out and seem to have perished in there. But down here at this wreckage, continued bids, to respond to the noises they hear to respond to what they hope will be people being brought out alive and anger too that we hear from bystanders. Looking in one case at the now destroyed home of their sister and her entire child family anger at the construction. How some buildings are upright through building regulations being followed and some are crumbled down to rubble. And a culture really of where construction is so part of the money here so some accused of being riddled with corruption and how that made them angry too the government culture that would permit that to occur. But still now the urgent task responding to the noise that they hear inside the rubble calls for silence or pause in work and then sadly, as we've seen over here, some bodies that have been brought out, it is a grim and constant job that we are hearing and seeing from the rescue workers here and in no case over there, some of those bodies marked with owner suggesting that they have been identified that somebody may be there to collect them soon.

People are desperate for rescue, to for someone to take them out from under the rubble. They are desperate for shelters. They need food. They need medicine. They need blankets. They need mattresses. And even on the long run this will have a lot of consequences on people's lives. That's why we say we need to put politics aside and we need all efforts to be focused on bringing relief to these people as soon as possible and as much as possible.",

      "sentences": "Yes, of course. It's a bit complicated the setup there on how it comes in. But basically, in Northwest Syria, which is under the control ofthe opposition forces. You know the United Nations Security Council have authorized the United Nations humanitarian agencies like UNHCR, to bring in aid through this border crossing from Turkey, into Northwest Syria. And this has been happening for years. More than 4 million people are dependent on this aid to survive, because 3 million of them almost are displaced anyway. And so their needs are huge. And that's why throughout the - we have been sending in relief items, food supplies, everything through. It's been distributed on the ground by local NGOs, mostly Syrians who know and they have a huge network to distribute. Now, when the earthquake happened, not only it destroyed people's homes and lives, it also destroyed the infrastructure, including a main road that led into Northwestern Syria, and it took two days to fix this road for aid to start going back in. Now, as I said, it's not like in the past two days, there was no aid being delivered. Because we had - we all had stocks of items inside and our partners on the ground were using it to reach a lot of people. But it's not enough. And we need so much more. Even if we get trucks in for the next 10 days, it is not enough. The needs are huge, because people anyway, were in need of this aid. They need so much to survive. They need so much to protect their families. And we have to remember, for 12 years, this crisis has been going on and people have started to feel that the world has forgotten about them. It's 12 years of crisis of war, of economic inflation, it's COVID. So they had been feeling alone. And now with this happening, they are really hopeless. And it's time for the world to stand by them to renew its commitment to support them that we will not forget about them. And maybe hopefully, there will be some kind of resolve that their suffering has to end. It's enough 12 years where the civilian population has paid the highest price for the Syria crisis and now that hit by this strong earthquake, shattering their lives even further.",

I do want to ask however, what do you think the biggest challenge moving forward now is? Is it the Syrian government perhaps being suspicious of outsiders coming into Syria? Is it the rebel held territories? I mean, what is the bigger challenge? I know, they're both challenges but what's the bigger challenge moving forward?",

People and the public is very charged, people areseeing these images of people stranded under the rubble, and people trying to extract them, whether in Northwest Syria or inside Syria with their own hands with shovels, and people are frustrated. So there's some a lot of blame game. People want to see more being done to help these people. They want to see equipment, real equipment, serious equipment being probed and brought in whether inside Syria where the government controls, or inside Northwest Syria, where the opposition controls the ground. So all these things are real needs and it's real families who are stranded in there, desperate for the world to come in and help regardless of any agenda, regardless of any political issues. But resources is also very important because for humanitarian agencies to reach all these people, not only with a mattress and a tent today. But for sustained humanitarian assistance, it's going to take a lot of resources, and we need the international community to commit to that, you know, even before this earthquake hit across Syria, more than 70 percent of the population was dependent on this humanitarian aid to survive it's day to be able to put food on the table to be able to send its kids to school. The hospitals, only half of the hospitals in Syria were functioning due to the 12 years of crisis. So the needs were immense and have they have been exacerbated.",

And she was filmed in front and center watching the missiles roll by. It was also a first for the sheer amount of ICBMs that we saw at this military parade a significant amount of North Korea's most powerful weapon.

Its biggest intercontinental ballistic missile the Hwasong-17 presumed capable of reaching Mainland United States. No speech from Leader Kim Jong-Un this time, but this many ICBMs are a message in themselves. CHUN IN-BUM, RETIRED SOUTH KOREAN LT. GENERAL: They've now gone into a good production line of this very capable threatening missile system.

And looking at the daughter once again, when it comes to how she has been referred to in state media that has been closely watched as well for any indication of how she should be treated.
