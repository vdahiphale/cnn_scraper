      "sentences": "Jake, they're afraid. They're angry. They're still trying to process exactly what's been going on.You heard in that sound just a second ago how so many students did not believe at first this was an actual shooting. Even right now, there's a stream of parents and students still trying to make their way back to their cars. Some people walk several miles to be able to pick up their students and I can tell you they are frustrated about all this. But at the same time, they are happy to have their hands on their loved ones. Obviously, tonight, there are parents who are going to be dealing with a notification of losing a loved one. I talked to one student who actually witnessed his teacher gets shot in the leg and head teacher faded back into the classroom. He said the classroom start to scream and yell because they've realized someone they care for was injured. And apparently two doors down, somebody else was shot. And so, you hear these stories over and over again. I can tell you the students tell me their teachers jumped in and did the best they could to not only barricade the doors, but to put them in closets, or to try to make sure that no one could get in. And then we just got this video in recently. You can see some of the students moving through the hallways. I'll pause for a second as we play this. Our Isabel Rosales was able to get this video. You'll see it as the students are walking through. This plays out. Obviously, we've seen this happen across the country with the students have their hands up as sheriffs or police officers are trying to escort them outside. It's the nightmare that no parent wants to see when you there's video being played. But these are the ones who were lucky enough to walk out alive. And then on top of that, they were all taken to the field and then several students were interviewed for several hours about exactly what happened. But the one thing that I do know and I can tell you this, student after students that they heard six to seven shots and they were very quickly a young man came up to me. He was only just coming to the school for the first time. He said one of his friends he believes was killed in this. And, of course, obviously we know next of kin still be notified, so were not releasing any of the names of the people that we believe may have been injured in this. But you understand the pain is real for high schoolers when young lady looking at immune since were an hour were outside the big city. There's no way something like this could happen. Well, it did happen today. We talk about that news conference that's supposed to happen. It's just going to happen over here over my shoulder. We believe it can happen in the next 15 to 20 minutes or so. Talking to sources, there's a lot of law enforcement in this area, so they're all gathering the notes and trying to put pieces of this investigation. You have the state investigators, the GBI, you also have the FBI here and we know the governor authorize all resources to come down to this area. And there's a perimeter around the school that stretches almost two to three miles in either direction. So you understand the hard landscape has been for some people to even get close enough with the middle school being nearby. And parents being worried about exactly what happened here. So, Jake, as this conversation continues to happen, people trying to figure out exactly how 14-year-old was able to make it into the school with a weapon and then open fire. So I've already asked a few people whether or not there are metal detectors at the school that has not been indicated yet about whether or not I was in place. We do believe there is video surveillance all over, so we know law enforcement been may have we ever to watch parts of this to see exactly what happened. And then we know that person is now in custody. So all this is going to be worked out, will hope to get more information as this news conference happens, hopefully in the next 15 minutes -- Jake.",

And the fact that the family unification has already occurred suggests that they think it's just him. I know this seems obvious to a lot of people, like, oh, they got, you know, they screwed up, they got a phone call and they didn't -- they didn't close the school. Schools get phone calls like this all the time. It is one of them -- that's why I'm very much for prosecuting people who make these kinds of calls, whether often ingest. These kinds of calls are happening all the time. We have to learn what -- what did they think of it? What did they think it was? How often was this school getting them out?

Had there been violence before what kind of -- it's a high school, what kind of metal detectors and others that were?Obviously, the age, Jake. It's 14 years old. I was looking at the statistics. It's not -- it's not as unusual as we wish that school shootings are curbed by 14. But a mass shooting like this is very rare that a young age. So then the third and important question is access to the gun. Everyone knows Georgia's gun laws are permissive. It's just -- there's no -- this isn't a political commentary. They are exceptionally permissive and that means that the parents or someone who had the gun made it either available to him or he took it from them. We need to get more aggressive against adults who buy these weapons and make them accessible or allow them to be accessible to a 14-year- old. And I guess the last question, of course, is motive. Was this against a particular person, a classroom? What was his reason for doing it? But you and I've been doing this long enough. Sometimes -- sometimes the motive isn't satisfying. It's just someone who -- who's gets guns and wants to use them in a violent manner, and we can blame mental health or whatever else, but it doesn't really get to why this morning.",

Authorities also say that the gunman was 14-years-old, a student at the school. This will be the first and last time I mentioned his name, Colt Gray, G-R-A-Y. That individual will be charged as an adult. Let's bring back Juliette Kayyem, along with CNN security correspondent Josh Campbell. Josh, a lot of information not provided. We don't know what kind of gun it was. We don't know how many rounds were fired. Tell us what the headlines are beyond the two teachers and two students killed.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Well, that was certainly important to learn what the make-up, the attributes of the victims were. But as you mentioned, is still a lot that we don't know about the actual incident. Certainly, the motive, and quite frankly, I wasn't expecting at this juncture are for authorities actually come out and start explaining anything that they've gleaned about a motive.Sadly, as you and Juliette, myself, we've covered so many of these. They'll come out with statistics, so to speak about what transpired. But particularly if you have a suspect who was taken into custody, there is still a prosecution. And so we often see law enforcement hold a lot of information close to the vest because all of this has to hold up in court. They don't want to jeopardize that. As we learn there, this juvenile, this 14-year-old, will be tried as an adult, which in the state of Georgia, for offenses, serious offenses like a capital offense involving murder, involving a potential death penalty, those will go to adult court. So we've got that detail. But still a lot we don't know about the weapon itself. And, you know, that's key for me right now is how did a 14-year-old gain access to this firearm? We've seen in a number of instances, such as at Oxford High School, the shooters' parents there were prosecuted for their ability to help him get that firearm. We also saw near Chicago, for example, the shooter of the Highland Park Fourth of July parade. That shooters father pleaded guilty to recklessness for allowing that child to get access to that weapon. So we will wait and see what happens here. How did this child obtain this weapon, and will anyone else be held responsible, Jake?",

He immediately surrendered realizing that he was going to be shot if he did not, and also that he has been interviewed by law enforcement, by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation or GBI.What else do you think is going on behind the scenes in terms of this actual shooter and his motive, however, twisted, it might be?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So a couple of things. I mean, the first is just on the chronology. It is clear that the school resource officers were the ones who really did minimize the harm. Already, four people are dead, but if they had not been on scene, it is not clear to me when law enforcement would have actually gotten there.And they've -- in the press conference, they say that they followed up that essentially this was the resource officers. So, lots of debates about resource officers in schools. No one likes the idea that there is a lot of evidence that they can be very helpful when they are effective and trained and ready for the responsibility we give them. Fourteen year old is young. It is not -- not totally new. I mean, it didn't -- 17 is your peak for school shootings in terms of students, then 16, then 18, then 14. And so, you've got this and 14 to 18 year-olds who are committing of -- students who are committing school crime. So it seems very young to us, but it is -- it is in the realm of incidences before. So you're going to want to know from him or from him? His family what signs, right. What would trigger warnings, so to speak, might we -- might have been gotten or understood by the family? Had there been any outreach to warn people and then the last and Josh is saying is access to guns. I am -- I find it inconceivable. They do not know what kind of gun it is right now. It is just ridiculous. They should have disclosed what kind of gun it was. I don't -- I don't like them playing games on that stuff.",

The mission of Safe Schools for Alex is to provide schools with the best safety practices and resources to keep students safe.Max, what goes through your mind when you hear there was once again, in the United States, yet another school shooting?",

When they went to school, when the parents send their kids to school, they expected them to come home, like they had every other day. And no family should ever have their children or their staff members murdered in a school.But, you know, what -- what goes through my head is obviously what we've done here in Florida post-Parkland. Florida leads the nation in school safety and obviously, I believe that those two who SROs that were at that school saved countless lives today. We've done that in Florida. Every school, every public and charter school is required by law to have a minimum of at least one armed school safety officer. And then the other thing that is obviously evidenced is that were not going to be able to so to prevent all of these from happening. And when a gun comes on campus, nothing good is going to happen. So what we have to do is what we've done in Florida is we focused on the best desk prevention method we have. The best tool we have is threat management. All of these individuals that go on to become a school mass murderers, they all exhibit concerning behavior ahead of time. They don't just snap overnight. They all exhibit red flags, like the Parkland mass murderer, from a very young age. So I think that we're going to see as we get in for more for information on this, this murderer is that, you know, there were telltale signs, there were red flags and that's why in Florida, we focused on -- we've got a threat management team in every school, in every district. We have -- every district has a statewide threat management, every coordinator and we need to do that across the country. Every state needs to have a coordinator to focus on this and Florida in the last quarter of 2023, we train 3,000 personnel to identify concerning behavior, so that we can get these individuals, identify them earlier before they bring a gun on campus and get them off their pathway to violence. That's the best tool we have. And if we can do that across this country, we can get to these kids before they start bringing and guns to school and doing these horrible things. And we can make school safer.",

If you've got an individual that is very depressed, that is -- his social media, if they're posting pictures of guns online, that's the leakage.All of these signs, if the teacher notices that an individual is extremely upset or we have to look at a lot of things. We've got to look at their behavior in school. We've got to look at what's happening outside the school. So that's why it's important that they've got law enforcement involved. So are they are they drawing any anything online, they posting anything and all of this is all comes together. It's got to be a holistic approach. And that's why in Florida, we have these threat management teams. So you've got -- number one, you've got somebody that knows that individual of potentially a teacher, you've got a school psychologist, you've got an assistant principal, you've got a law enforcement officer on this team. So if an individual exhibits concerning behavior, if they're talking about obviously committing a school shooting, if there's an obsession with weapons, if there's an obsession with school mass murderers, obviously, if they're doing -- searching for all of these things online, past mass murders, these are red flags. And then we have to look at what's happening outside of school, what's happening in their home life. You know, these kids, it doesn't just -- doesn't just happen in the four walls of the school. What was happening in this individual's life outside of school?",
