      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from the United States and around the world. I'm Becky Anderson, in London.Following breaking news for you this morning, reaction is now pouring in from across the Middle East and beyond to the apparent assassination of the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh. The group says he was killed in Tehran after meeting with Iran's newly elected president, which you see here, and attending his inauguration. Iran's state media says an airborne guided projectile was used to strike where Haniyeh was staying in the Iranian capital. Hamas was quick to blame Israel, calling it a, quote, \"Zionist strike.\" There has been no official confirmation from Israel, only saying that it doesn't respond to reports from foreign media. Well, Haniyeh was a longtime member of Hamas, joining in the late 1980s and rising through the ranks over the years before becoming the group's political chief in 2017. One Hamas official calls the assassination a, quote, \"moment of truth for Israel.\" Another says it's a, quote, \"cowardly act which will not pass in vain.\" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas calls Haniyeh's killing a, quote, \"dangerous development.\" As for any U.S. response, the White House says it's aware of the reports but has so far not commented. Well these reports come after Israel claimed just hours earlier that it had killed Hezbollah's most senior commander in a drone strike in Beirut. Israel says it was retaliation for Saturday's deadly rocket attack in the occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah denies being involved in that attack. The IDF blamed Fu'ad Shukr for that attack, which killed 12 children and injured more than 40 people. As I say, Hezbollah denies it was responsible and has yet to confirm the commander's death. But that militant group now acknowledges Shukr was present at the time of the strike in Beirut. The Lebanese health ministry says a woman and two children were killed in the strike with 74 others injured. Lebanon's caretaker prime minister condemned the attack, calling it a clear violation of international law. 24 hours. Two assassinations, it seems, of two significant characters, players in the Middle East militant environment. Joining me now here in London is Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton walsh. Let's start in Tehran and the death of the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. What do we know about the strike?",

      "sentences": "Certainly. Look, Israel have been absolutely clear that someone like Haniyeh is on their target list. And so his decision to travel to somewhere like Tehran for inauguration of Massoud Pazeshgian, the comparatively moderate new Iranian president inaugurated just yesterday, he must have felt he had the security guarantees he needed. He must have felt that the idea of being hit in Tehran was just an act far too brazen for Israel. What a phenomenal miscalculation that appears to have been by him and Iranian officials too.But it's a sign, I think, that Israel is on the front foot, has extraordinary capabilities and precise information there. And it's also a test for Pazeshgian as well, because here he is confronting an extraordinary challenge to the integrity, the sovereignty of Iran, its ability to offer traveling guests basic security guarantees for something as integral as an inauguration ceremony. That's going to be a huge embarrassment. The way they phrase this, though, is utterly going to dictate the next 24, 48 hours. And, Becky, the important thing here really in the real world, outside of the rhetoric and the fury, is what options does Iran indeed have? And they tried a 300-strong missile and drone strike after senior IRGC commanders were killed in Damascus in April. That didn't get through. 99 percent were intercepted by Israel and their allies. And they do have the potential card of Hezbollah in the northern border areas to Israel in Lebanon. But they haven't wanted to play that over multiple months. And it's clear, if this happens to Iran, that's something they're reserving for maybe a different time. And so, yeah, we have to see quite what they're able to do. Do they pause and choose a different time in a more asymmetric fashion to respond?",

      "sentences": "It's certainly, though, a concern around the region. We've heard that from the Turkish foreign minister, not directly pointing the finger of blame at Israel, but suggesting that Benjamin Netanyahu does not want peace in the region and worrying about further regional escalation of what is ultimately the Gaza conflict at this point.And we are hearing that from various interlocutors around the region. Good to have you. Thank you very much indeed. Nick Paton walsh in the house for you. Joining us now is Firas Maksad, senior fellow and senior director for strategic outreach at the Middle East Institute. And you, just in the past, what, 12 or so hours, had suggested that the assassination of the key Hezbollah leader, if that is, in fact, what happened, Hezbollah not admitting to the death of Fouad Saker yet, but you suggested that his death in Beirut was just the opening salvo in what may happen next with regard Israel-Lebanon. Firas, we now are reporting within the same sort of 24-hour window the, it seems, assassination of the Hamas political leader in Tehran. What do you make of where we are at at this point? FIRAS MAKSAD, SR. FELLOW AND SR. DIRECTOR FOR STRATEGIC OUTREACH, MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE: Becky, good to be with you again. At this point, all bets are off. There was a dynamic prior to the assassination that we woke up to this morning of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. There was a dynamic that, in a hopeful scenario, would have seen Iran play a restraining role on Hezbollah and its other assets in the region to de-escalate, and that this through back-channel diplomacy between Washington and Tehran would be contained. By itself, the assassination of what is essentially Hezbollah's top military commander, Fu'ad Shukr, who predates even Hassan Nasrallah, the political head of Hezbollah, in terms of being one of the founding members, the founding generation of Hezbollah, that that could be contained. Today, with the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in the heart of Tehran, in what appears to be an airstrike of a sort, either through a drone or a jet outside of Iranian airspace that totally changes the dynamic. And Iran itself now feels the need to respond, possibly directly, or I would think there's a great possibility that this will see an orchestrated, region-wide campaign that brings the various Iranian-sponsored militias from Iraq, from Yemen, from Lebanon, and maybe even Tehran itself, in a direct response on Israel. So this is unprecedented, and it's very difficult to say that, given what we've seen in the past 10 months of conflict. But I feel like we're actually a notch closer to a region-wide conflict today than we've ever been.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, that's one of the big questions out there. Have these assassinations been green-lighted and shared with the United States, or did Israel act without the foreknowledge of the Biden administration? And I ask that question because, clearly, the U.S. is going to be an active participant in whatever comes next, as it was back in April, when Israel flattened the Iranian consulate in Damascus, and that necessitated a direct Iranian response, in which U.S. defenses, where it played an essential role. Already there are early reports that U.S. warships are moving closer to the eastern Mediterranean, to the Lebanese coast, in anticipation of what might come next.So this is a situation where these decisions are not only having an impact on Israel itself, but also U.S. national security interests. And certainly the U.S. has several vulnerabilities in the region, including its bases in Iraq and Syria. [03:15:05] ANDERSON: A regional escalation is not inevitable. Those are the words of Lloyd Austin, the defense minister today, speaking over the past 24 hours in Asia, where he is traveling. Washington not responding specifically to the death of the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh. But those are the words in the past window, as it were, of Austin. And a number of people I've spoken to this morning, reading into that, to a degree, the U.S. is banking on the same sort of moment here as we had back in April, when the responses from both Israel and Iran were out there, but they were contained, not least because the U.S. was involved in everything that was going on. I just wonder whether those who are taking some comfort in Lloyd Austin's words this morning are a step, sort of, ahead of themselves at this point. What do you think?",

      "sentences": "I think the Secretary's words were very carefully chosen and very delicately crafted. He did not say that a region-wide escalation of war is unlikely.He said it's not inevitable. And to my mind here, reading between the lines, what's left unsaid is that a region-wide escalation is likely. I would say very likely. Perhaps an all-out war might not be inevitable. There might still be a chance of avoiding that. But in all likelihood, we're looking at several dark days ahead in which the region will be at the precipice of an all-out war, probably an escalation like we haven't seen in the past 10 months. But let me say this, Becky. I think what Israel has demonstrated in the past 24 hours is an extraordinary capability in terms of intelligence through the ranks of Hezbollah to be able to penetrate and also the Iranian regime the precise kind of actionable intelligence that's timely, that's needed to assassinate such senior figures. That is a huge success, no doubt, for Benjamin Netanyahu. However, these are tactical victories. We all know that these assassinations of senior leaders have taken place before, and these people are replaceable. Strategically here, Iran and its allies, through continuing to build their capabilities, hundreds of thousands of precision-guided missiles with Hezbollah, the Iranian regime being closer than ever, according to Secretary Blinken, perhaps even a week away from becoming a full- fledged nuclear state, those are major strategic victories and progress that both sides or Israel's adversaries, have been making. So this is a moment of temporary success, as it is for Israel, but in the longer term, I wonder what the strategic thinking is in Jerusalem.",

Hamas officials reacting with condemnation and defiance after the apparent assassination of the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Hamas says he was killed in an Israeli strike in Tehran after attending the inauguration of Iran's new president on Tuesday. Israel so far has not commented or claimed responsibility.Well 62-year-old Haniyeh was born in a Gaza refugee camp. He joined Hamas in the late 1980s during the first intifada. Haniyeh rose through the ranks, becoming the group's political chief in 2017 and soon after, he was named a specially designated global terrorist by the United States.

He's a Middle East Studies scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. And I was reading some of what you've been posting on X, formerly Twitter, this morning, and I thought you made a very good point in this talk of the potential for further escalation around the region, which is important. You've also made the point that we need to be very mindful about the unintended consequences of what we have seen both in Tehran overnight and the attack, the strike on the Hezbollah leader in Beirut yesterday. Just explain what you mean by that, H.A. H.A. HELLYER, MIDDLE EAST STUDIES SCHOLAR, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE: So, Becky, thank you very much. Always a pleasure to be on your program. Here's the issue. When we talk about controlled escalation or calculated escalation, I think we're really fooling ourselves. There's no such thing. When you engage in conflict and you use technology, especially on places that are quite far away from where you are, then you have no way to predict precisely what's going to happen. In fact, this is one scenario for what happened last week in Mejlis Shams in the Syrian-occupied Golan Heights. One intelligence report came out saying that actually the attack was by, quote-unquote, \"mistake.\" And I say by mistake in quotation marks because one scenario here is that Hezbollah were aiming for something else in the Golan Heights and unfortunately hit something that they didn't intend to. But as a result, children died. And then you set into this cycle of escalation. By the same token, the Israelis may feel that they are doing, quote-unquote, \"a calculated escalation\" by targeting this or that. And we're assuming that they will remain targeted and calculated because, of course, when it comes to Gaza, there's been very little in terms of targeting and calculation. It's been, you know, tens of thousands of people dead and, you know, an incredible amount of, quote-unquote, \"permissible collateral damage.\" Right? The Iranians, when they respond, as they inevitably will, to this assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran, they will probably want to avoid a regional conflict that will plunge them and everybody else into a devastating war. So they will, quote-unquote, \"calculate\" about how they're going to do it. But nobody can tell where it's going to go. You don't know what is going to happen as a result. You can't predict all of the variables and control all the factors.",

The issue here is that escalation will happen by, unfortunately, default unless de-escalation is actively sought. OK, because that's the direction. Right? When you have, you know, daily bombing and bombardment of Gaza with tens of thousands of mostly civilians dying, then, you know, escalation is the default position. We want to have a de-escalation paradigm take over here. And that can only happen as a result of an active effort. And thus far, unfortunately, not enough energy has been put into that. The United States has not been willing to use the leverage that it actually has on Israel vis-a-vis the United Nations, but also vis-a-vis arms transfers and support in order to force Israel to a serious negotiation position.On the contrary, what we've seen, and this has been confirmed multiple times now by even Israeli press itself, we've seen that Benjamin Netanyahu has sabotaged ceasefire negotiations multiple times over the past 10 months. This isn't sustainable. We need to find a way to de-escalate. Otherwise, the inevitable consequence is going to be escalation and the plunging of the region into a spiral of devastating conflict that I think would be absolutely catastrophic for everybody.",

Just hours earlier, Israel said it had killed Hezbollah's most senior military commander in a drone strike in Beirut. The IDF claims Fu'ad Shukr was responsible for the attack that left a dozen children dead in the Golan Heights on Saturday. Hezbollah acknowledges he was in the building at the time of the strike, but the group has yet to confirm his death. The Lebanese health ministry says a woman and two kids were killed. Well, joining me now, CNN's Ben Wedeman in Beirut. I just want to slightly recount the way I described what has gone on in the last 24 hours. Certainly Hezbollah, Iran-backed. Hamas more co-opted, as it were, by Iran, co-opting the Gaza conflict in and of itself. But Ben, what do you make of the news of the death of the Hamas leader in Tehran overnight local time and what we have seen now come to pass in the past 24 hours? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the Haniyeh attack is really assassination. It is something of a surprise given that in Rome on Sunday the United States, Qatar, Israel, Egypt and others were there to negotiate some sort of ceasefire agreement, the release of the hostages. And then on Wednesday Israel kills the senior Hamas leader who is involved indirectly in those negotiations. So it really sends the message that Israel has, in a sense, given up on the negotiations. Maybe you could even say has given up on those hostages and is just trying to eliminate the leadership of Hamas, whether they're making progress in those negotiations or not. So on that side it certainly does raise the level of tension to unprecedented levels. Now, the assassination last night or the strike last night on Beirut that we believe led to the killing of Fu'ad Shukr certainly raises the temperature here as well. And we don't know whether Fu'ad Shukr was actually killed. Hamas, Hezbollah put out a rather strange statement after many hours that came out this morning essentially saying, you know, the civil defense workers are clearing away the rubble at the site of the strike in Beirut. And as they progress perhaps the fate of Fu'ad Shukr will become clear. I think at this point it's obvious he is dead. Now, I think, you know, I was listening to my friend H.A. Hellyer speaking to you before the break, and I think certainly what he said is correct, underscoring that the United States has played a fairly weak and passive role in trying to bring this conflict now almost ending its 10th month, that the United States simply has not exerted the kind of influence and leverage that it has to bring this conflict to an end. It's gone on to the point where it started focused on Gaza, and now we are on the brink of potentially a regional war, and the United States simply at this point appears to be sitting on the sidelines, sitting on its hands.

That, one assumes, we would have to assume is now sort of off at this point.
