And also, there were other investigations federally that paused the state investigation for a while.He's arguing that there are statutes of limitations that apply though they don't really -- it was on hold while he was out of the state as president. He argues he was selectively prosecuted. But I don't think that will succeed either because Michael Cohen was, in fact, prosecuted and convicted for this same conduct federally that he is -- Donald Trump is now being prosecuted for in the state. So, there are a host of arguments here that the judge is expected to rule on tomorrow, and I do expect that he will not grant Donald Trump's motion to dismiss the indictment based on all of these arguments. And I do think he will set the trial date. The trial date is currently set for March 25th. He is expected to inquire about whether or not there are any conflicts with that date.

So, expect that there will be a lot of questioning about their finances and the trips that they took and exactly what if any financial benefit Fani Willis derived from his employment with her office. I also expect there will be questioning about the timing of their relationship. He has said in his papers that he did not begin a relationship with her until after she was hired. The defense claims that they have a witness who will say the opposite and has information to that effect. So, I think this is going to get messy.

Sources tell CNN that the system remains under development and the threat does not involve a weapon that would be used to attack humans.

But, in fact, they are stoppable. They have been stopped before. I think this type of weapon, if we're talking about some sort of nuclear capability that can take out satellites in space, I mean, apparently, our own intelligence indicates that this is only under development and has not been launched or perhaps even close to launching.
