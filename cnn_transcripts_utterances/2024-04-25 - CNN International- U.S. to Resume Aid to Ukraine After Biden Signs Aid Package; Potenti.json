And at UT Austin, following tense resistance, 34 people were arrested. Hundreds of flights have been cancelled or delayed at airports across Europe today after some French air traffic controllers called a one- day strike over working conditions. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments today on whether Donald Trump should have absolute presidential immunity, including for his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump maintains the alleged acts were part of his duties as president. A billion dollars' worth of military hardware being prepared for Ukraine, including long-range missiles, which the Ukrainians have asked for, for a pretty long time. After months of negotiations and delays, President Biden signed off on the $95 billion financial assistance package passed by Congress that includes nearly $61 billion in military aid for Ukraine and $26 billion for Israel and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific as well. President Biden says this was a good day for world peace. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think that's potentially even an understatement.And I think the content, as we understand it, of this first $1 billion package really reflects what's changed in the past six months, one, that the front line has been profoundly destabilized. That's why you see, obviously, there's going to be artillery ammunition, but things like HIMARS artillery rounds, anti-aircraft missiles, Bradley fighting vehicles. Those are on the list, as you see there. But also you see those air defense missiles, and that is a reflection of the fact that we've really seen Russia step up these aerial attacks on Ukraine's cities, massive attacks on critical infrastructure, energy infrastructure. And Ukraine has been crying out for more of these air defense missiles as it struggled to thwart those attacks. And President Zelenskyy is saying that the way that this package was structured really came out of a joint effort to tailor it to their specific needs. Take a listen.

It became law in 1864, during the American Civil War era, although it was revived earlier this month by state Supreme Court decisions. The Arizona High Court concluded that because there is no longer a federal constitutional right to the procedure, the 1864 ban is enforceable. This would leave in place a state law which restricts abortions to 15 weeks.Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court appears deeply divided over hearing arguments over a strict abortion ban in the state of Idaho and whether states can criminalize abortions in medical emergencies. The court's ruling is expected by the end of June in the midst of an election campaign where abortion is certain to be a big issue for American voters. CNN's Paula Reid has the latest from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Today, the Supreme Court heard another historic case on abortion as protesters on both sides of the issue gathered out front. The high stakes hearing focused on Idaho's abortion ban and how it applies in medical emergencies. The state allows exceptions when the life of a mother is at risk, but the Biden administration sued the state, arguing that federal law requires the state to allow the procedure if it is needed to stabilize a patient even when the mother's condition is not yet life-threatening.
