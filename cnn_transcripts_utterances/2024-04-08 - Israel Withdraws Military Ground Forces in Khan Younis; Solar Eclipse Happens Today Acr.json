That call coming at a pivotal moment, only days after World Central Kitchen employees were killed in an Israeli attack in Gaza.Now, according to sources, President Biden placed additional pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to change his policies in his war against Hamas, that included primarily getting more humanitarian aid into Gaza by opening a land crossing, a port and also ramping up supplies. Now, according to a source, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to that, saying that there would be more done. But the president went a step further, saying that it needed to be done soon. And indeed, hours after the call, the Israeli security cabinet approved of the measures. And the White House has so far welcomed the moves and the changes that they've seen thus far, acknowledging that there has been frustration and that more needs to be done. But what is clear is that the U.S. is steadfastly supporting Israel and its right to defend itself. The difference now is that they are more willing to change their policy if Israel doesn't change what it's doing. Of course, what that would be still remains an open question, as well as what metrics the U.S. is using to determine if Israel is making the necessary changes. Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, Washington.

It looks like we have a storm system, though, developing on the southern end of the path where a severe risk is growing for damaging winds, large hail, even isolated tornadoes from Texas into Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.The good news is, though, it looks like the storms do blow up after the eclipse. We've got a couple of showers kind of right as the eclipse is starting, that partial eclipse, and then they blow up right after that peak, probably after three or four o'clock. So you might have a one to two hour window to seek shelter if you're in a place like Dallas outside to watch the eclipse, though it will come with cloud cover, mostly cloudy skies in Dallas, temperatures in the '70s, 1:42 is your total solar eclipse time. Then it ends at three and those storms will fire up shortly after. It's all part of the system that kind of stalls right near that path of totality, bringing you some showers from Middle Tennessee and then over towards the Carolinas. We do have some clouds that will come with it from Texas into Louisiana on the southern end of the path, some clearing across the Ohio Valley and even some clearing in New England, too. Also looks like a pretty good spot to catch the total solar eclipse. We're looking at some places like Little Rock, where we'll have some mostly cloudy skies a little bit close to that system. Your totality is at 1:51, place like Rochester, also finding some mostly cloudy skies with your peak at 3:20. Now what's so cool about this, too, is we will find temperatures taking a dip while you have the peak totality of that shadow because it's cutting off the energy from the sun. So those temperatures are going to briefly come down and will pop back up once the shadow moves away from the sun and we get those temperatures to rebound. So something that we'll have to watch out for closely. So not only will you experience the total darkness and totality, you'll experience that temperature drop. The relative humidity increases as the temperatures dip closer to that dew point. The winds could decrease, too. And so could your cloud cover. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Despite international sanctions, North Korea is continuing to ramp up its nuclear capabilities. And in the South China Sea, China is increasing its aggression.

FUMIO KISHIDA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator): In our neighborhood, there are countries that are developing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons and others that are building up their defense capabilities in an opaque way. Also, there is a unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force in both the East China Sea and South China Sea. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Kishida says soaring geopolitical tensions forced Japan, long a pacifist country, to change its defense posture, moves not seen since World War II. Under his leadership, Japan plans to boost its defense spending to 2 percent of its GDP by 2027 and purchase weapons, including U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missiles, acquiring counter-strike capabilities for the first time in decades.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Rosemary, as we discussed during the last hour, she really tried to end her trip on a positive note by saying the constructive role her conversations and her trips have played in stabilizing this relationship between the U.S. and China. And also, of course, highlighting the initiatives both sides have launched on topics ranging from anti-money laundering to a quote-unquote \"more balanced growth in the domestic and global economies\". That's a platform presumably they can discuss Washington's concern about, as you mentioned, China's industrial overcapacity, which is a key item on her agenda.Now, she really emphasized how serious the Biden administration is taking with this issue in terms of cheaply-made Chinese goods and products, especially green type products, have been flooding the global markets, depressing prices and negatively impacting the U.S. and other economies, even referring back to the time when China first joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, saying a similar situation really happened then and really displacing a lot of American workers. And she said the American administration, the Biden administration is simply not going to let that happen again, that they just find the situation unacceptable. But of course, the Chinese have been pushing back very strongly and saying all of this is a politicized accusation and aimed at smearing China. Now, they are, of course, the Chinese are increasingly angry with the Americans increasingly stringent export controls of key technologies targeting China, with their leader, Xi Jinping, telling President Biden during their most recent phone calls that they find that practice, that policy unacceptable and they're not going to sit idly by. So the tensions very much remain here. And also echoing President Biden, of course, Secretary Yellen also raised the issue of warning China not to provide Russia with any material support in their war effort in Ukraine. But of course, as we speak, the Russian foreign minister Lavrov has now arrived in Beijing to talk with the Chinese counterparts and strengthening their so-called no limit partnership and potentially paving the way for another Putin visit. So all of this, of course, is a reflection of the strategic assessment of both sides about themselves and about the other's intentions. It seems the Chinese have made this choice of aligning themselves closely with the Russians because of their shared grievances against this U.S.-dominated world order and their desire of reshaping that. And that is unlikely to change even with these visits and conversations Janet Yellen has been emphasizing, especially in the U.S. election year. Rosemary.",

Yellen met with leaders to discuss the U.S. and Chinese economies as well as national security concerns. She says both countries were able to clarify potential misunderstandings that could cause unintentional escalation. One of the year's most anticipated celestial events is almost here, just hours from now, a total solar eclipse will be seen in Mexico and across the United States and Canada. Those fortunate enough to be along the path of totality will be treated to an eclipse that lasts between three and a half to four minutes, according to NASA. And earlier I spoke with NASA program executive Julie Crook on the significance of the total solar eclipse. She explained the phenomenon that sets this one apart. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JULIE CROOK, PROGRAM EXECUTIVE, NASA'S HABITABLE WORLDS OBSERVATORY: The very first time I saw it in 2017, it was life changing. I mean, it's a one in a time, I mean, in a given location, it happens once every more than 300 years. And so it is quite amazing to see not just it become dark all so quickly, but also how nature reacts. I mean, last time I saw it in 2017, I was in Western North Carolina, and all of the birds just became quiet, the crickets became quiet. I mean, it was just it was it was very astonishing.

Her legacy will be long lasting. 50 years from now, there will be people talking about the watershed moment of 2024 and Caitlin Clark and the TV ratings through the roof. I mean, 12.3 million, 14.2 million. Who knows what that game will get? These are numbers that beat Tiger Woods at the Masters. They beat the entire World Series in baseball. They beat all the NBA games that except I think one that ESPN has ever put on the air.We've never seen numbers like this for women's sports. And it's all attributed to Caitlin Clark. It truly is. The logo threes, the majesty of her play, the individualized kind of star out there that people are just paying to see do all of these incredible feats that she's able to do. And we saw it in that first quarter, 18 points, those threes. She kept, she willed Iowa to keep going. And so what's next for her? Well, she is going to take women's sports to even greater heights. She will be drafted number one in the WNBA in just a week. So if anyone's missing Caitlin Clark, she'll be gone for a week and she'll be right back on national television. And then in Bin Bay, so about what, six weeks, she will be playing in the WNBA. And I believe strongly that she should be on the U.S. Olympic team in Paris. If she's there, she will become a worldwide fascination and only bring more eyeballs to the U.S. team. So they should definitely put her on the team. We'll see how that plays out.",
