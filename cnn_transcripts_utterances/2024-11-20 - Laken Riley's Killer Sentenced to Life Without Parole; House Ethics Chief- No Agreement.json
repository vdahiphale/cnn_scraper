      "sentences": "Hi, Boris. It was not a big surprise when Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard sentenced Venezuelan national Jose Antonio Ibarra to life in prison without the possibility of parole.But we heard a collective sigh of relief inside the courtroom when he made the announcement. The judge had earlier issued a guilty verdict on all 10 counts the defendant was facing, including malice, murder, felony murder, and kidnapping with bodily injury. The verdict was announced in a completely packed courtroom. The family and friends of Laken Riley filled four of the eight rows available inside. Before reading the verdict, Judge Haggard made two observations. One, the closing statement by Special Prosecutor Ross was very powerful, he said, and two, he took into account the defense's request that he set aside his emotions before issuing a verdict. The Special Prosecutor said in fighting her attacker the victim left more than enough evidence to convict him. Ross also had a very compelling argument when she asked Judge Haggard to sentence the defendant of life in prison without the possibility of parole for the sake of Lauren Phillips, Laken Riley's younger sister. This is what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

On the other hand, the defense only called three witnesses to the stand and argued the evidence against Ibarra is circumstantial. Now back to you.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Michael Guest, the chairman of the House Ethics Committee, the Republican emerging from this closed door meeting, not saying a whole lot to reporters, but saying this very significant statement, saying there was not an agreement by the committee to release the report. Of course, that report referring to Matt Gaetz, Donald Trump's pick to be the next attorney general of the United States. This report detailing going into allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use by the former congressman.That report, of course, has been part of a bipartisan probe for the past two years. It's in its final stages, but it has not been released to the public yet. Why? Because Gaetz abruptly resigned as a house member last week in the aftermath of his selection as attorney general. Now Republicans, including the speaker of the house, say that should not be a public report because he's a former member, even though there's precedent for doing so. After two hours of debate behind closed doors, and as Democrats are demanding this report, what Guest is saying is that there was not an agreement from the two sides to put this out publicly. Now he would not say, Brianna, whether or not there was actually a vote by the committee. I asked him that several times. He would not say what the nature of the debate was or if they're going to revisit this in any way. But he did tell me on the way in that he views this report as not finished, still in the final review stages, he said, which is why he had some reservations going forward. But Democrats are not going to be satisfied by this answer. So expect this to be a big fight, especially as Senate Republicans themselves want to see the allegations here as they consider this hugely significant nomination -- Brianna, Boris.",

It also prohibits city employees from cooperating with immigration agents.That includes the LAPD, the Los Angeles Police Department, which actually has their own set of policies that prohibits officers from assisting ICE anyway.

And Walmart is not the only company sounding the alarm here. A host of other companies and retailers are saying that they, too, will have to raise prices. Steve Madden saying they're going to move 45 percent of their business out of China to try to beat these tariffs, and they will probably have to raise prices. Black &amp; Decker, the power tools company, saying they could see a hit of $200 million if these tariffs go into effect. Columbia Sportswear saying that they are ordering merchandise now for next fall just to beat these proposed tariffs. And, of course, Brianna, who ends up paying for all this?
