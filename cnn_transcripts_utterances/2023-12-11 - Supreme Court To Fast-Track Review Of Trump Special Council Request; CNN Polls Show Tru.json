The justices now set to quickly decide whether to accept the special council's request to rule on Trump's claims of immunity.Also tonight, CNN's exclusive new polling in both Michigan and Georgia finds Trump is leading President Biden in those pivotal swing states. We're going to break down the warning signs for the Biden campaign and the Democrats as Trump also appears to be gaining support over his Republican rivals in Iowa. And the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is here right now in Washington for talks with the president and key lawmakers about stalled U.S. aid to his country. Zelenskyy arguing the lack of new war funding is making Vladimir Putin's, quote, dreams come true. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get right to the breaking news, the United States Supreme Court responding just a short while ago to an extraordinary request by the special council, Jack Smith, in the criminal prosecution of Donald Trump. CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid is here with us in The Situation Room.

      "sentences": "Yes, this today was an aggressive move by the special council to try to get the election subversion case to trial before the November 2024 election.The special council is asking the Supreme Court to decide two questions. One, is Trump immune from prosecution or is he protected from prosecution because of potential double jeopardy, because he was impeached but not convicted on similar charges? Now, the special council doesn't think either one applies, but they want the Supreme Court to decide this issue so that that trial that's expected to go in March of next year does not get delayed. Because Trump is litigating these very legitimate questions, but that litigation takes time. It could take months, maybe even over a year, for questions like this to move through the appellate process and potentially get to the Supreme Court. So, the special council is saying it is in the public interest for the Supreme Court to just take up these questions and give them an answer now. They're relying on precedent from the Nixon Watergate investigations where the court was able to decide some discrete issues very quickly. And now we know we'll get an answer as to whether they are going to take up this case hopefully pretty quickly here. Again, they're not saying they will take it up, but they're saying they will give us an answer on whether they will answer these questions pretty quickly.",

The justices had said, yes, they will at least put it on an expedited schedule. They've given the Trump lawyers until December 20th to respond. That's only two days different than what Jack Smith had asked for. He had asked for December 18th. So, they're actually following the game plan so far that Jack Smith has put forward.Now, just think of this Supreme Court. This is a Supreme Court that managed to avoid a lot of the controversy during 2020. It rejected baseless claims from Donald Trump's allies about the election results, stayed out of it, every case it's ever handled with Donald Trump, whether on his policy or on his personal tax dealings, has always been fraught. So, they're probably not looking at this with eagerness. But they know that this is a case that this question has never been decided. And that was the point of Jack Smith's petition that, eventually, the Supreme Court's going to have to decide if a former president or president can be immune from criminal prosecution for actions taken while in office, which is exactly what Donald Trump is asserting. So, I frankly think this is a really strong case that Jack Smith has put forward. And I think that it will get -- it's already getting close Supreme Court attention, and we will probably know when it's just a matter of weeks whether they grant this petition.",

      "sentences": "I think so for the number of reasons that we've sort of talked about here.Now, again, a word on timing and that's sort of the key point here. Were this process to go through the normal process, were the cases to go through the normal process, it would be, number one, would first be appealed to a court of appeals, then the losing party would have the ability to appeal that to the full court of appeals, and then they'd have the ability to appeal that to the Supreme Court. That could have been months, if not, frankly, years of appeals. And so it was a very savvy move by Jackson to try to get this. Now, I think it's safe to say that a litigant would not attempt to go to the Supreme Court unless they felt quite confident in the strength of the arguments and the strength of the case they were bringing. And let's look very quickly at the two things that they're saying. Number one, this question of whether the actions at issue were in the scope of the President's official duties, there's an argument that he's a candidate for office, not a president of the United States. Yes, he held the title of President, but this was in furtherance of his candidacy. So, you could probably resolve that pretty quickly. Then on this double jeopardy question, it's also not a stellar argument in that the point of impeachment is to protect the integrity of the presidency. The point of prosecuting someone is to send them to jail. They're two very different things. And, look, the president -- the former president, is entitled to make the arguments that he wishes, but these just aren't great arguments. And I think it all speaks to the strength of Jack Smith's and the special prosecutor's hands here.",

If Jack Smith or the special council were to prosecute someone for something, they couldn't then prosecute them again for the same crime a week later. The president is making the argument that, well, because I was impeached, you can't then prosecute me for the same conduct.

And the Biden campaign has work to do on driving the contrast with Trump, on doing what you heard President Biden do, raising the stakes of the race, and also reminding people what a Trump presidency was like, about the chaos, the uncertainty, and really making this a concrete choice. So, there's no question they have work to do. The election is 11 months away. And I think that the other piece of what they've got to do, which David was kind of referencing there, there are other issues that we have seen in the last two elections have driven voters out to the polls. Abortion is one of them. The Biden campaign has to put that choice front and center and make this part of the choice. And we've seen that that will turn voters out.

She's been in and out of the emergency room and she could not wait any longer. That is why she left the state. And just moments ago, wolf, the Texas Supreme Court issued a ruling that was put in by Ken Paxton, requested by Ken Paxton last Friday.
