The U.N. says two more executions are imminent and as many as 100 people are facing charges for capital crimes in Iran. The regime is also handing out more jail sentences. We have learned a Belgium aid worker has been sentenced by an Iranian court to 40 years in prison and 74 lashes for espionage and money laundering charges according to state media. He also faces a $1 million fine. He was arrested last year while doing humanitarian work in Iran. And Iran is also toughening its crackdown on women who violate the country's hijab law. One of the driving forces behind the month long anti-government protests. And right now the main punishment for violating the law is up to two months in jail. But Iran's attorney general has reportedly ordered police to enforce even more penalties, including fines, travel bans, and loss of access to public services.Harsher penalties could be handed out of those who encourage women to remove their hijab.

This is what we feared, knowing the brutal aspects of this regime that they weren't going to be violent. They were going to be violent crackdown. And yes, the executions are sort of signaling that and signaling that the regime is increasingly becoming desperate, that the regime feels that it needs to regain control over the protests. And one of the ways that it wants to do this is through these executions with a violating its own due process laws. And it's doing this as a way to discourage the protests.

Church officials say Pell died of cardiac arrest following hip replacement surgery in Rome. The Australian-born Pell was a former archbishop of Melbourne and Sydney. And he served as Vatican treasurer for five years.But in a case that shocked the church, Pell was convicted in 2018 for allegedly abusing two choir boys in the 1990s. He denied the charges but served 13 months in prison before Australia's high court acquitted him. CNN's Kristie Lu stout has this look at Pell's life and legacy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHCOR (voice over): Cardinal George Pell, Australia's highest-ranking Catholic has died aged 81. He entered the clergy in 1966 and went on to serve as Archbishop of Melbourne and later Sydney. While in archbishop, Pell set up the Melbourne Response which included payouts for survivors of clerical sex abuse within the Archdiocese. It became one of the earliest responses to address sex abuse accusations in the church. But critics say was geared to prevent scandal and could have been more generous to victims. In 2003, Pell was ordained as a cardinal by Pope John Paul II and rose to become Vatican treasurer. Widely considered the third most powerful spot in the Vatican. The Italian newspapers referred to him as a bull in a China shop for his forthright manner when dealing with financial reform. But Powell was credited for his attempts to make the church's bookkeeping more transparent. In 2014, Powell was called back to Australia to appear before Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to sexual abuse in the country. The commission found that Pell had known about sex abuse in the church, but not reported it to police. In 2018, Pell himself faced court on five counts of historical child sex abuse.",

So, it really remains to be seen. I mean, of course, we all know that he was found innocent due to lack of evidence on appeal in Australia, but still his legacy as bishop both in Melbourne and Sydney, but also when he was working at the doctrine at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith at the Vatican, which oversees this kind of litigation that has to do with sexual abuse, can now be revalued, reestablished somehow. And we have yet to see how well will his experience stand the test of time. I heard you mentioned before he was among the first in the Catholic Church, 1996 to lock to launch some sort of investigation but perhaps his abrasive character, his lack of perhaps of understanding of the problems concerning sexual abuse at the time, or maybe we'll find out in the coming months.

The general idea is that perhaps now things are changing that there are regulations in order.Well, brands has enacted a series of laws that forced clergy to report to legal authorities and state authorities to report to the Vatican when there are cases of abuse and there have been some marginal step forwards in that sense. At the same time, the scale and really the underlying problems that have to do with clerical sexual abuse in the church still remain. And countries like Australia, like Ireland and like Germany are trying to grapple. What is it about the Catholic Church that made it such a fertile ground for this kind of predatory behavior?

Before the war, Max was an English teacher. His 43rd artillery brigade has already seen action in the battles of Kyiv, Kharkiv and now Donbas. Their target today, a building in Krimenna from where he says attack drones are launched against Ukrainian forces. WEDEMAN (on camera): This artillery system is known as a Pion. That's Soviet era artillery system, 203 millimeters, the rounds weigh 100 kilos, 220 pounds. This is a system used both by the Russians and the Ukrainians. WEDEMAN (voice over): The cold here chills to the bone making this work all the more difficult. To protect against Russian drones they've deployed a special weapon that depletes drone batteries. First the round goes into the barrel, then the cordite and the trigger cord is pulled. Sending the massive round hurtling toward its target 18 kilometers around 11 miles away. It fires again. Again. And had a forward spotter radios Max that the target has been hit. He tells his men to use shrapnel rounds to finish the job.
