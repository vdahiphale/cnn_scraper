I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and this is the CNN Newsroom.Just ahead, right now, the funeral is underway in Doha for assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. Iran has vowed to retaliate against Israel. And three Americans wrongfully detained in Russia are now back on U.S. soil, and have been welcomed by the U.S. President Joe Biden. And a monumental win for super gymnast Simone Biles at the Olympics. We're live in Paris for more details and find out what else is happening today. Hamas is calling for prayers in mosques around the world and a day of anger over the assassination of its political leader. A funeral is being held this hour for Ismail Haniyeh in Doha, Qatar. Haniyeh was killed in Tehran early Wednesday. A source says he was killed by an explosive device planted in his guest house months earlier. Iran and Hamas blame Israel, which neither confirms nor denies involvement. The high-profile killings of several powerful militant leaders have led to vows of retaliation from Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah. The Israeli military says it's on high alert and ready for a range of scenarios. We've got CNN teams on the ground covering the story. Ivan Watson is in Beirut, Lebanon. Let's begin with Clarissa Ward in Tel Aviv, Israel. Clarissa, Israel says it's ready for a range of scenarios as Israelis stock up on basic goods. So, what are those scenarios?",

We spoke to one hospital that said it had cleared an underground parking lot of cars in the event that they needed to move patients in there for treatment if there was some kind of an attack. The Jerusalem municipality has reached out to people, urging them to clean and prepare their shelters to stock up on goods, warning that there could potentially be a scenario where there would be no power for several days. And the Victory supermarket chain is reporting a 30 percent increase in sales, saying those sales are largely things like toilet paper, like canned goods. We actually went last night to a protest that was being held by some of the family members of the hostages inside Gaza and their supporters, and they told us that they had some trepidation about attending the protests because there is a growing sense that this attack, in whatever shape it takes, could be imminent, Fred.",

For example, the leader of Hezbollah here in Lebanon, he gave a speech at the funeral yesterday of a senior Hezbollah militant commander who was assassinated, killed by an Israeli airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Tuesday, and Hassan Nasrallah said that many red lines have been crossed by Israel. He said that after a lull in the cross- border fighting between Hezbollah militants and the Israeli military. This is a border conflict that's been going on for some nine months now, that Hezbollah would step up again and resume that fighting. But, that would not be part of the anticipated more severe response that would be coming sometime in the future.So, we've seen dozens of rockets fired by Hezbollah into Israel yesterday. Five of them got through, according to the Israeli military. We've had more reports of Hezbollah drone strikes today across the border into Israel. Take a listen to what Nasrallah had to say at that funeral, where he piped in from an unknown, undisclosed location. Take a listen.

But, there is one serious challenge that these armed organizations face, clearly with these two high-profile assassinations in Hezbollah and with Hamas in the Iranian capital, Tehran. These organizations have seen their security compromised. How is it possible that somebody was able to assassinate these two high-level officials, who presumably had a lot of security so close together in the same night?

And this is a program that is fitted for civilians whenever they've been detained abroad, when they've been in isolation.And Fred, just to give you an idea of how -- what this program is described like on their website, it says that the individuals are able to decompress and then reintegrate into regular physical exercise and a regular diet. And then the key thing here is that they also are reintegrated with their families. So, their families also are in the building that you see behind me, in this gigantic facility.

Good to see you, Josh. So, I mean, part of this deal to get the detainees freed included the release of a Russian assassin who had been convicted of a brazen execution in Berlin.

JOSH ROGIN, COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON POST, &amp; AUTHOR, \"CHAOS UNDER HEAVEN\": Right. Well, what we know is that there were several rounds of negotiations and several rounds of back and forth over several months, and as it turns out that there were many different versions of this deal that went back and forth before the final mix was determined. But, it's -- I think it's very telling that the people that the United States and its allies wanted out were all political dissidents, journalists, innocent people, actually, and the people that Russia wanted out were murderers and thieves and spies. And it just goes to show you which government prioritizes which type of person. And the fact that Putin prioritized this spy who murdered someone in cold blood in broad daylight just shows you that this is the type of regime that Putin is running. It's a criminal organization, essentially.

We can do some business with the Russian government without ceding any territory on the things that are most important to us, including the Defense of Ukraine. And on the other hand, it also shows that the Trump people will say, and President Trump has said that this deal was done because the Russians feared him returning.But, in my experience covering these cases, it's definitely true that once these negotiations are ongoing, if a new administration comes in, no matter which one it is, it could reset the clock.

This simply couldn't have happened without that relationship that the U.S. had with multiple countries, of course, with Norway, Slovenia, not the least of which, as I was discussing, is Germany. And when they've faced criticism about the Russians who had been released as part of this deal, they have said that they don't welcome the fact that folks like Vadim Krasikov are now free. But, they also didn't want the folks who were innocent in Russian prison, some of them sitting there for years, to stay there.Listen to what the NSC's John Kirby said about that earlier this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNICATIONS ADVISOR: Nobody is delighted or doing backflips over here because Mr. Krasikov is now a free man. That's what negotiations are all about. They require tough decisions, tough calls. The President was willing to make that tough call in order to get these -- all these individuals, not just the Americans, all of them released. In the end, Bret, when you weigh it, yes, these are all criminals that are in the Russian side. And yes, they're all innocent on the West side. In the balance, I think we could all agree that it's better to have innocent people no longer rotting in Russian prisons for the rest of their lives. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This was historic. This was an undertaking unlike anything we've really ever seen before.",

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate rose to 4.3 percent. That's underscoring concerns that the economy has slowed down too quickly.Paula Newton joins us now to crunch some of the numbers for us. All right. So, help us understand these jobs members, worse than expected. PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. 114,000 jobs in total. That is at least 60,000 less from where economists thought we were supposed to be. And Fred, it is quite concerning. The Federal Reserve, which is in charge of interest rates in the United States, just met this week and did not cut interest rates. They might have thought better than that if they thought this jobs number was going to be that low. And the reason is that we were looking at an unemployment right now at 4.3 percent in the United States. And we didn't see an unemployment rate like that until -- from 2021. That was when everyone was coming out of the pandemic. What is interesting here is that this may also propel the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates even further. So, they were going to do a quarter point cut in September to try and stimulate that economy. They might do more this year. They might do more in September. We'll have to wait and see. What's also a bit unnerving is the fact that Amazon reported its results. Now, Fred, you and I, when you look at Amazon, think about all the consumers involved there, and Amazon reported a more cautious consumer, all of that pointing to an economy that, we call it a soft landing, right, the economy is going to slow so that we can get rid of some inflation, but it's just going tap on the brakes. It is not at a full stop because it's at a red light that it didn't see. And then, that's what we're trying to get to, right? We want to avoid recession. And these numbers are a real cautionary tale for the Federal Reserve, and quite frankly, the American economy.",

We'll see if anything can study them throughout the day, and what might study them, in fact, is the fact that they will believe that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in lowering interest rates. Remember, Fred, the good news from earlier in the week in the U.S. economy was the fact that mortgage rates started to come down finally, and that in itself can help to stimulate the economy and perhaps put the jobs picture back in balance.This isn't an absolutely terrible number. I mean, new jobs were created. But, it is absolutely what I said, a warning and a real pivot point for the U.S. economy. I don't have to remind everyone about all the economies around the world that hinge on that U.S. economy. So, all eyes now on what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates. Fred.",
