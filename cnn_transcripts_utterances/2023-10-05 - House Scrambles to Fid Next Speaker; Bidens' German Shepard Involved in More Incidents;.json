We were with some units fighting on the front line and we saw thatfirsthand. Here's what we witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice over): The artillery troops need to move fast. Russian drones might be in the air. Line up, calibrate, fire. Three rockets, that's it. Even though this grad launcher would be more effective firing large salvos. It's not very precise, this soldier named Alex says. It also depends on the weather and the range. It would be good to have more precise rockets or guided ones. But the Ukrainians are running short on even these unguided Soviet era rockets and ammo shortages a problem across the battlefield here in eastern Ukraine. Soldiers from the 80th Airborne Assault Brigade have a quick snack. Then get ready to fire their western-donated howitzer. The American 105 millimeter shells, a valuable but increasingly scarce commodity. PLEITGEN (on camera): Ukrainians call this the sniper rifle of their artillery because it's so accurate, but it also illustrates one of the big problems they have. They have plenty of barrels to fire from, but not enough ammunition to fire. PLEITGEN (voice over): Battery Commander Myron telling me, the lack of shells means his forces are badly out-gunned here. It's hard to give precise numbers, he says, but I think they fire ten times for every round we fire. Sometimes it's 1 to 100. The Russians are constantly taking aim at this area, though the Ukrainians say they're making gains, pushing Vladimir Putin's army back, even using combat helicopters close to the front line. Kyiv says it needs more ammo to sustain its offensives both here in the east and in the south. The U.S. budget impasse could mean further delays.

She was a game- changer in that right because then more athletes felt comfortable speaking out about mental issues that they were dealing with on and off the court. So, she was able to make an impact in that regard.But as an athlete, you kind of are a little remiss in wishing that you were able to make it fully through.
