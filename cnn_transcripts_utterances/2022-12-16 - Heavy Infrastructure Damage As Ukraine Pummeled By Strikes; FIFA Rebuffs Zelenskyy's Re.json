We begin witha massive wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine, some of the heaviest that we've seen since the start of the entire conflict 10 months ago. CNN teams in Kyiv say they heard explosions and saw and heard missiles as a number of districts were hit, forcing people to rush to shelter. Ukraine's armed forces say 76 missiles have been launched at the country including four guided aircraft missiles. Regional leaders report critical infrastructure is being targeted. The mayor of Kharkiv says the damage there is colossal and that people are without heat, electricity and water. Ukraine's state energy provider says they are in emergency mode as critical infrastructure is targeted. CNN's Will Ripley has more from Kyiv. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm standing in a square where you can see destroyed vehicles from the beginning of the war. We actually can't take you to the scene of these attacks because the targets were critical infrastructure and Ukraine has very strict rules about filming and showing these locations. They don't want to tip off the Russians to what areas they might have hit and what areas they might have missed. But in this case, Kyiv says that most of the missiles never reached their targets because they say out of around 40 missiles that Russia fired directly at Kyiv which is a huge number, even for locals who've been living here throughout this full scale war for nearly 10 months now. They say they shot down 37 of them. There were however three explosions reported here in Kyiv, both on the east and west banks of the river, two of them in the East, one in the West. There are reports across Ukraine of entire cities plunged into darkness as a result of these attacks, which didn't just hit here in Kyiv, they also hit to the south in Odessa and to the north in Sumy and Kharkiv. But here in the capital, there were 10s of 1000s of people sheltering in place, hiding and underground subway stations waiting for an all clear and there were sounds of explosions. We actually heard them this morning, as we were getting ready to pack up and go on a road trip, the air raid sirens went off and there were some loud explosions that can be heard in our vicinity. CNN staff who lived even closer to the scenes of the explosions, said they also heard the sound of the air defense systems being activated, shooting down, presumably those dozens of missiles that were headed towards the Ukrainian Capital. The number of dead and injured, of course, those reports are always fluid. But as of now we know at least two people killed. At least five people injured, including children and UNICEF just days ago warned that these ongoing Russian attacks, this constant bombardment of the civilian power infrastructure is putting the physical and mental health of nearly every single child here in Ukraine at desperate risk.

You know, when you look at the cost of a missile, a Patriot missile, you know and compare that to the types ofmissiles that are being - and drones that are being flown against Ukrainian targets by the Russians, there's a definite cost mismatch. You know, when you - when you look at what the patriot has, it's anywhere from $3 million to $4 million per missile that that is launched, using that against you know, $20,000 to $40,000 drone. That, of course, is a different cost mismatch. And that's just one example. There are other situations though, where these kinds of missiles, the Patriot missiles would be very useful in a defensive mode if they help protect a major target, you know, such as, say, a water plant or an electrical plant in say Kyiv or Kharkiv. And even when those situations it will be important to have defenses that might cost a lot on paper, but they're also protecting from these kinds of strikes and preventing the kind of damage that that we see inflicted on them right now.",

And that's not the case. And a lot of people can't understand why they didn't give in to just accept this opportunity to send a really powerful message for our colleague, Matthew Chance who has done this report. And, you know, FIFA, their unwillingness to address this and grasp this doesn't reflect well on them when you consider that Zelensky has appeared at the G20s, at the Grammy, at the Grammys. And he's sat down with a whole host of people, including Sean Penn and David Letterman. And there was a real opportunity here from an organization that prides itself on pushing the power, football's power to build bridges and to succeed where politics often fails.

Despite how he wants pledged to keep his online. CNN's Oliver Darcy joins us now live from New York. So many questions around, you know Elon Musk's true commitment here to free speech, and he's rationalizing this by saying people were sharing his live location.

You know, he talked a lot about how he thought that the previous administration, the previous management at Twitter had been too suppressive when it comes to speech and said that he wanted anything really, but illegal speech to stay on the platform. And he has started allowing a number of banned accounts back. You know, you saw Donald Trump came back on the platform. And recent weeks, he's allowed a lot of white nationalists on the platform. And I bring that up because it really stands in contrast now to what he's doing to these journalists, which is banning them from Twitter because they were reporting basically on another banned accounts from Twitter, which was a Elon Jet account that used public information, public flight information to track his jet. And this isn't just Elon Musk's jet. There are a lot of these bots that track celebrity jets, think Taylor Swift or Kim Kardashian, one of these bots tracked Elon Musk's jet, he didn't like it, he banned that account.

But in November her daughter was born symbolizing the future she came here for in the first place. Her journey mirrors the more than 30,000 asylum seekers that have landed in New York City since the spring. Some on their own volition, some sent on a bus from Texas to make a political point. As of this week, more than 20,000 migrants remain in the city's care. And it's part of why Mayor Eric Adams declared a state of emergency in October, estimating the city will spend roughly a billion dollars on the influx of migrants.",

The United States' approach towards speech isunusual, right, compared to other countries around the world.

And I will say that, traditionally, in the United States, liberals, people on the left have called for private spaces where - that were a de facto public squares. For a period of time, it was shopping malls, and then it came to cable television and now social media, that advocated for government regulation to ensure that everyone had an opportunity to be heard, something that used to exist over public broadcast waves in the United States called the Fairness Doctrine. What's interesting is there has been a movement recently on the right. Conservatives are - are starting to advocate for the same thing. But that's not where United States courts are right now. And it really I think, is going to depend on whether or not you know, U.S. courts, particularly the United States Supreme Court, have a fundamental shift in the law in the future.

It sent 1 million litresof water crashing through the hotel and shops that surrounded the popular attraction. Two people were injured by glass and officials say, all the 1500 fish in the aquarium died. The tank is described as the world's largest freestanding, cylindrical aquarium, and it includes an elevator inside the tank for tourists to see the fish. There is speculation that extremely cold temperatures may have caused it to crack and then burst. The U.S. is sharing more details about the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The National Archives released more than 13,000 previously classified documents Thursday, including all of the remaining information. The CIA said it has that directly relates to JFK's murder. 1964 report found Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone when he shot and killed Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. Still, the killing has prompted a lot of conspiracy theories. Researchers say it could take days to learn what is in the newly released files. And in today's parting shots.

Perhaps it's the calm before the storm, but there's still a great vibe, a great energy, a really good atmosphere and hopefully we can find some fans of Argentina and France to see what they think about the big game So when we flew out here four weeks ago, of course, we were very much looking forward to the tournament and I was wondering if I was going to miss the alcohol, the chance to have a beer every now and again.
