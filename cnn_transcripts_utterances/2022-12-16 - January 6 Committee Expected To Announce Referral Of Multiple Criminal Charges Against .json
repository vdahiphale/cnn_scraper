They'll meet, for the first time, next Monday, to decide.Sources, tell CNN, the charges they're considering include obstruction of Congress, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and insurrection, the culmination of almost a year and a half investigation, into the former President, his allies, in the attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Joined now, by our Senior Justice Correspondent, Evan Perez. What more do we know about these charges that are being considered or referred?",

They've got thousands and thousands of pages of transcripts. And that's the big importance, for the Justice Department.Obviously, having these three referral charges, the insurrection, the impeding an official proceeding - interfering with an official proceeding of Congress, and the defrauding the United States, are three charges that will probably be familiar, for the Justice Department, especially the last two. We've seen people brought in, among the nearly 1,000 defendants, being charged with obstructing an official proceeding of Congress. We also, of course, have seen the defrauding the United States charge, in many, many instances. The one that is probably going to be a little bit problematic, for prosecutors, is the insurrection charge. It's a law that dates back to the Reconstruction Era. It's not something that there's a lot of case law for. So, for the Justice Department, Anderson, they have their ongoing investigation. And so, there's a lot of things they already are aware of. They're very, very, very interested in seeing the evidence that this committee has turned up.",

So, it is quite possible that they found things that the Justice Department has not found.And we heard from Merrick Garland, the Attorney General, just recently, and I asked him, you know about these transcripts that they've been asking for. That is one of the most important parts of this. Because, certainly they have their own investigation, but they want to see what some of these witnesses have said, to the Committee, independently.",

That's one of the beautiful things of free speech, and an open government, here. Congress has the ability to investigate. So that - they have more reach than you or I do. And so, that's what they're doing. They're engaging in the act of bringing things, to the Justice Department's attention. Justice Department will review it, see it, consider it, maybe. But at the end of the day, the decision of whether to proceed with charges is all comes down to whether Justice Department believes they can win, convince a jury of the facts that are charged beyond a reasonable doubt. That's it. And while it's beautiful, and compelling, and persuasive, and there might be a really nice report from Congress? At the end of the day, it just doesn't have the legal weight.",

That's why it's been charged so few times, in American history. And even if you know that, remember the name of Cliven Bundy, the rancher in Nevada, who literally took arms against the American government, was not charged with insurrection. So, that's going to be the toughest one, to establish. The other two, you have a path to charging the President, or others around him with, obstructing Congress, with the intent to do so, and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Those both - those last two, I talked about, both have a five year maximum sentence, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it's still five years in prison. It's a serious crime. It's obstructing the laws of the country.",

I think - we were always destined to wind up here, given who's on the committee, and also given what we all saw with our own two eyes, on January, the 6th. So, as Elliott said, there's really nothing to this, as it relates to what the Justice Department has to do. There is some politics involved in this, and I assume committee members will be out there making very political statements. So, it strikes me that this does throw a few rocks, in the bag of the Department of Justice, as it explains to the American people that they end up charging Donald Trump, because it'll cause some folks to say, \"Oh, you just did it, because the Congress asked you to do it.\" That may not be true, but that's what it might look like. So, I think this was always going to happen. And, as it relates to the politics of it, it adds, obviously to Donald Trump's ongoing political woes, because it's a few more rocks, in his own bags as well that he's dragging around, as he tries to get his campaign off the ground.",

But needless to say, it probably forced the Attorney General's hand, to take away this question of political interference, like sort of putting a thumb on the scale, of a president's candidacy, right? It doesn't change anything, legally. Now, right before an election, for maybe the 60 days, prior to Election Day, they would not - the Justice Department would not indict, or issue a search warrant, for a candidate's house, once somebody had identified themselves as a candidate.

Every day, every week, every month, since then, has been one day, week and month worse than the one before. And if he gets indicted here, it's going to be another bad day.

And so, on the third day of war, we have opened a base, and a storage in the town of Vorokhta. That's in western Ukraine, in Carpathian Mountains, currently, probably the most safe region, in Ukraine, where people can find safety, so to say. We have 5,000-plus internally-displaced people, from Mariupol, from Berdiansk, from Kharkiv, from Kherson, Mykolaiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions. So, we provide daily, monthly for them, as well as for the frontlines. And, of course, right now, we have to do that without heat, without electricity, without water, without internet or any connection, even cellular. Kids, you can see, right now, here are IDP kids, right, internally- displaced kids, from Berdiansk, Mariupol, Kharkiv. They are packing boxes, at our storage, for other kids that are at the frontlines, right now, living and struggling. So, they're like little elves working away. And, as they work with candles, because there's no light, in the storage, no heat, they're all dressed up. We pray that the world, and United States, will support and continue to support Ukraine.

There's still a lot of questions about exactly what he's been doing, all this time.21-year-old Kenny DeLand Jr. turned up in Spain. His father got word, while on a call with CNN. He hung up with us, but later told us he had just spoken with his son. The last known sighting of DeLand had been back on December 3, at a store, some 90 miles, from the university, he had been studying at, in France. He's a senior, at St. John Fisher University, in Rochester, New York. Now, to the still unsolved mystery, of the four students, killed near the University of Idaho, last month. Four families, going through the holidays, without their loved ones, and without any answers. Investigators say they're sorting through a list of 22,000 Hyundai Elantras, one of which could help provide a critical break, in the case. Joining me now is John Walsh, former host and creator of \"America's Most Wanted,\" and the host of ID's \"In Pursuit with John Walsh,\" streaming on Discovery+, which is owned by CNN's parent company, Warner Brothers Discovery. John, it's good to see you this. I mean, this case, it's been over a month. Authorities have yet to name a suspect, find a murder weapon. What do you make of this? JOHN WALSH, HOST OF INVESTIGATION DISCOVERY'S \"IN PURSUIT WITH JOHN WALSH,\" FORMER HOST &amp; CREATOR, \"AMERICA'S MOST WANTED,\" VICTIMS' RIGHTS ADVOCATE: Good to see you too, Anderson. It's a heartbreaker. First of all, my heart goes out to these families, because now they've joined a horrible club, I belong to, \"Parents of a murdered child.\" And it's the worst thing that you can imagine. So, you need answers and you want answers. People, have been critical of the police, I say, \"Well hold it.\" They don't have 100 homicides. Chicago has 800-plus homicides, every year. So, their experience, this is a small Police Department. They may be keeping some things back that they don't want the public to know. They don't tell parents most of the time, because parents will tell other people, who could blow the case, especially if they have a suspect. So, I think, the best thing they did was call in for help, bring people in. And maybe it got messed up when all the cars were coming through, and they could have got tire tracks, they could have got this and that. But there's a few things I hope they did do, Anderson. And the car is crucial. But it's no good until you get a partial plate. If you get a piece of a partial plate, one numeral, we have a thing called auto track, we could find out who it belong to. And there's not many cameras in that town, might be one of the fewest camera towns, in the United States. But nobody seems to have a clean shot at the car. But I also say this. Don't let that car be the red herring. You and I covered the Beltway sniper, if you remember that, Anderson.",

But the fact that she is going home, today - went home, today, is a sign to people around her that she's feeling good. She's ready to go back to her normal life. And one key thing about this statement? It's the first time we're really hearing directly, from her. She wanted to make it clear that not only was she incredibly grateful, to everyone, who was involved in her release, including to President Biden, and many, many others. But she wanted to issue a statement about Paul Whelan, the other American, who is still in detention in Russia. She said, in her statement, that she is going to do everything that she can, to make sure that both Paul and other Americans are freed. And she encouraged everyone to do so as well, knowing, I think, that there are obviously some efforts out there to divide on this issue, too. For people, who supported Griner being released, to not support Whelan to be released, I think, it was important to her, to make it clear, that was going to be part of her future, but also that she is thinking about Paul, who is still in Russia.",
