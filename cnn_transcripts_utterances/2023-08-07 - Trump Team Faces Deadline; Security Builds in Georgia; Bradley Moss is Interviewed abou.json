She's actually spoken about it publicly, saying that she's had to make changes to her own personal security. And it has not helped, the rhetoric, from the former president. He's called Fani Willis a racist. He's saying that this investigation is politically motivated.In fact, it was last week already that we saw a protester out here echoing those talking points from the former president. Now we're seeing these security changes being made here. So, you see barricades set up. That happened last week here outside Fulton County Courthouse. There are several road closures around Fulton County. One of several indications that this sprawling investigation could be nearing its end. There's a heavier than normal police presence here and there are also, you know, this letter that Fani Willis sent to law enforcement to be ready between now and September 1st. There are currently two grand juries seated in Fulton County. One of them is going to be tasked with hearing the Trump case. Twenty-four jurors on our -- are on each grand jury plus two alternates, 16 are going to be needed for quorum, and it will take 12 of them to be in agreement for indictments to be handed out.

And the Ukrainian security services, quite active in the media over the past week, claiming drone attacks on Russian cargo ships and amphibious assault vessels and indeed a bridge to Crimea, they are suggesting that they have intercepted a Russian informant, unclear of her nationality, but she worked in Kharkiv in a military surplus store down towards the Crimean peninsula on the southern coast. They suggest that she was trying to convey information to the Russians about a likely visit by Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Mykolaiv in the past. That's a key port city down on the south. And some of the messages that were exchanged apparently show them suggesting - her interlocutors suggesting, well, can you get a picture of where he might be going? Is it a hospital? What time are we talking about? That sort of thing.And another reminder, I think, too, of the daily threats against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a man who famously at the start refused to leave Kyiv, saying I don't need ammo - I don't need a ride, I need ammo allegedly when asked if he wanted an evacuation. And so this information coming out, as I say, as we hear a lot from the Ukrainian security services about their activities in the Black Sea. Another part of really actually the war opening here at a time when nightly we're also seeing an exchange of barrages between the Ukrainians and the Russians. One killed in Kherson over the past 24 hours. Ukrainians are saying, the Russians are saying, a Ukrainian drone may have gotten near Khaluga (ph), and that's to the south of Moscow. And so this tension ratcheting up slowly as the pace potentially of Ukraine's counteroffensive in the south may grow in the days ahead. But no comfort to Ukrainian civilians on the receiving end of these Russian barrages.

Andrew would likely say his greatest adventure was the role of husband and father.

And we should also note that there have been a number of Americans who have died fighting in Ukraine. The State Department, of course, still tells Americans not to travel to Ukraine right now, not to get on the front lines. But what they do is they link up with these kind of informal networks. They connect to the Ukrainians who are fighting. And then they offer their services because they feel that the mission is just that important.

Remember for more than 40 years guidance from the FDA has banned most gay men from donating blood.
