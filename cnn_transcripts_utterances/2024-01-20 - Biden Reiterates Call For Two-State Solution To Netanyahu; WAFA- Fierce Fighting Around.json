      "sentences": "Well, warm welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Paula Newton. Ahead right here on CNN Newsroom, U.S. President Joe Biden is optimistic a two-state solution can be achieved, that's after a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Donald Trump picks up a major endorsement ahead of the New Hampshire primary. We'll have the latest on the battle for the Republican nomination. And Japan successfully lands its spacecraft on the moon, but the mission might have to end sooner than expected. U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the possibility of a future Palestinian stay during their first phone call in nearly a month. A person familiar with the conversation tells CNN, Mr. Netanyahu explained that the public comments he made a day earlier, in which he appeared, and not for the first time, to reject the idea of a Palestinian state, were not, he said, meant to foreclose that outcome in any form. The White House says the president reiterated his support, meantime, for an eventual Palestinian state once the Israel-Hamas war concludes. President Biden says he believes Mr. Netanyahu would agree to a two- state solution, quote, \"given the right one.\" CNN's Scott McLean joins me now. He's been following all the latest from Istanbul. Scott, yes, President Biden, you know, still trying to salvage some type of a dialogue here with Netanyahu, even though, you know, allies in the region where you are heard the Israeli Prime Minister loud and clear.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and you know, just one example, Paula, is the Saudis have made loud and clear in recent days that there will not be any kind of normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia unless there is a Palestinian state, or at the very least, a clear pathway to a Palestinian state. And of course it is the position of most everyone in this part of the world that there needs to be the foundations for a future Palestinian states.And the Americans, as you point out, agree with that as well. But there's also the reality that Prime Minister Netanyahu may not be in office forever. He won't be in office forever. His popularity in Israel is sinking to new lows. And there are growing calls within his country for new elections, even from most recently a member of his war cabinet and from a former prime minister as well. And so perhaps that's why the U.S. approach in -- since these comments were made on Thursday, has been to sort of brush them off as not that big of a deal because they say that, look, Netanyahu has made these kind of comments in the past and then since come back to a much more measured, moderate position. And even when you, you know, if you believe one official who is briefed on the call between Biden and Netanyahu, that seems to be the case already, because as you point out, Paula, Netanyahu said to Biden that, look, his comments on Thursday should not be construed as not believing in a Palestinian state ever in any form. In fact, he said that the idea of a demilitarized Palestinian state with security backing from abroad is one idea he finds intriguing. That is an idea that's been pushed by among others, the Egyptian president. And also it seems to be an idea that President Biden himself has latched onto. Listen.

But then yesterday, we heard from the Palestinian news agency, WAFA, that there had been intense fighting and airstrikes around the area of the hospital. In fact, they say that 29 bodies and counting, had been recovered from underneath of that rubble. This is the same hospital, by the way, Paula, that one former Israeli hostage says that she was held in, something that Hamas actually denies. If you believe Israel's telling of the situation in Khan Younis, they say that they uncovered a Hamas training camp and a place where senior Hamas leaders had met and also tunnels, weapons, things like that.

And despite the eight years of relentless bombardment and airstrikes, the Houthis managed to increase their capabilities. Back then, they didn't have the ballistic missiles and the drones, now they do have them. And even that they've actually managed to refurbish some of the fighter jets, that they've had in their arsenal. And the helicopter that you've seen and the hijacking of the galaxy was also decommissioned back at the time, but they managed to get the resources, the spare parts to rehab those machineries and put them back into operation and they will increase through that. You will see an increase of their capabilities. And of course, they're backed by Iran. But they're also increasing their reach throughout the region, such as Iran.

AL-OMEISY: That's an excellent question. They are backed by Iran. They have the same playbook, but let me qualify that statement, and this is very important. Houthis -- when we say that we're robbing them of their agency -- Houthis have their own objectives, their own goals, their own agendas. So they plan independently, but they try to be on the same page with Iran on certain things.

If we kill 40 to 70 of them with drones in a day, the next day they renew their forces and continue to attack. It's been going on for several months, as Russian President Vladimir Putin seems hell bent on taking Avdiivka. Russian vehicles under artillery fire as they get close to Ukrainian positions. The ground littered with dead and dying Russian soldiers trying to overwhelm the Ukrainian defenses here. The Ukrainians say they're holding back most of the assaults, but are outgunned and outmanned. We need more people, more military, more equipment. We need more ammunition, more drones, he says. Unfortunately, we don't have the amount needed to win. We need a lot. And the Russians not facing the same shortages are dropping massive amounts of ordnance on the Ukrainians, everything from artillery to heavy guided aerial bombs. One of the key defense points, a massive coke plant at the edge of town. And that's where these guys are setting up their defenses. Under constant fire, elite snipers from Ukraine's Omega Special Forces. Here they have the cover to hit advancing Russian soldiers. Their anger visible in the hoodies they wear for our interview. With the weapons we have, at distances up to 1,300 meters, the effectiveness of our work is 90 percent, he says. For that kind of precision, they need to keep their weapons in pristine condition all the time, they say. Here at the beginning, it seemed the Russians could encircle Avdiivka very quickly, he says. But as we see, Avdiivka has been ours for three months and we're holding on. Holding Avdiivka for now, even as assault after assault eats away at Ukrainian defenses.

And it's like, I have a Communications degree and I definitely did not need that to be successful.And so, I think, like, it starts with when you turn 18, you're already put into a disadvantage.

Southern Airways Express Flight 246 took off from Dulles International Airport near Washington. It was headed to Lancaster, Pennsylvania.Now the tracking site, FlightAware, shows the plane climbed just 800 feet for about two minutes before landing on that roadway. Now, the 27-year-old pilot and another crew member and five passengers, thankfully, on board that small plane. There were no reports of any injuries, either on the aircraft or on the ground. The cause, as you can imagine, is under investigation. Meantime, in Florida, an Atlas Air cargo flight was forced to return to Miami airport after one of the plane's engines malfunctioned minutes after takeoff. A witness captured this video Thursday night and described seeing fire and sparks coming out of the Boeing 747. The flight crew declared an emergency and the jet landed safely. A soft ball sized hole was discovered above one of the engines. The National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation. Now, Japan has successfully landed its robotic smart lander on the lunar surface. Its ability to touch down in a small area has earned the craft the nickname Moon Sniper. But as Kristin Fisher reports, an unexpected glitch could cause the mission to end sooner than planned.",

The 16-year-old was overnight transformed into a sporting hero with the eyes of the world right on him.On Friday, Littler playing in his very first tournament since then. And once again, you just can't stop this kid. Luke turns 17, two days from Friday. And he gets to celebrate early with another stunning piece of history here in Bahrain. He's now the youngest player ever to throw what's called a 9 darter in the World Series. A 9 darter is when a player scores 501 with the minimum number of darts. Littler's 9 dart sequence achieved. By him throwing triple 20s with his first seven darts. And then a triple 19 and a double 12. Look at those scenes of history there in Bahrain as Luke would go on to capture his first World Series title after beating the Dutch star Michael van Gerwen. Well, Luke is a huge Man United fan. Did you know? Why wouldn't he be? I say United taking to social media shortly afterwards to pass on their own congratulations to him. He really is a quite remarkable story. Now I don't know what you were doing at age 16, but throwing triple 20s I assure you, I was not, not even in my dreams with that. It's right back to you.",
