But there are a lot of lessons learned from the six-day war, one of which is that Israel did not secure diplomatic gains immediately after. And I think that's what the big question is, is what is the diplomatic strategy to complement these military successes? How is Israel going to leverage this for stability in the north, an agreement potentially with the Lebanese government to provide that stability. What's he going to do to obtain the ceasefire in Gaza, to get the hostages back. That's not clear. So, right now, what we're seeing is essentially a military first and only strategy.
