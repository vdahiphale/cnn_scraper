At least 13 people were killed in an airstrike in Central Gaza on Saturday, according to Palestinian health officials. While Israel says it also hit a Hamas military asset in the town of Rafah, but a Palestinian news agency says the target was a residential building where a number of civilians were wounded. Israel says, all civilians were evacuated before the strike.Meanwhile, the U.S. and Jordan have conducted new airdrops of aid as U.N. officials warn of a looming famine in Gaza. The two countries dropped tens of thousands of meals and other aid on Saturday. Some humanitarian workers dismissed those drops as a band aid measure, saying they're degrading and ineffective. Gaza's health ministry says, two more people died of malnutrition and dehydration on Saturday, bringing the total to 25. For more, Nada Bashir joins us from Larnaca, Cyprus. Nada, more efforts to get aid into the region while the death toll from famine grows. How quickly might we actually see more aid?",

We have, of course, seen those land crossings through Gaza's land boardings, those have been difficult. Of course, we've seen various obstructions, and that has caused a delay in the amount of aid trucks that can get in.We have, as you mentioned, Kim, seen airdrops as well being carried out by a number of nations, including the United States. The hope is that this new maritime corridor will allow for a significant uptick in the amount of humanitarian supplies and crucially food and water getting into the Gaza Strip. Now, of course, this maritime corridor has now been announced. These ships would be departing from here in Cyprus, heading towards Gaza's coast. And of course, we know that this has been endorsed by the United States. The U.S. Military has been directed to establish a temporary pier on Gaza's coast to facilitate the delivery of that aid and humanitarian aid supplies. And of course, we have heard from U.S. officials over the last few hours saying that the first batch of equipment needed to construct this pier is now on its way to the Middle East. So, this certainly is a process that is underway. The question is how quickly this will be established? How quickly these ships can actually get to the Gaza Strip? And of course, how quickly that aid can get to those in need? Now, as we understand it, according to European Union officials, there was an expectation that those ships would be able to depart some point this weekend. It's unclear whether they still will be able to depart this weekend or whether perhaps we might see more delays. But of course, this is a significant development, although there will be significant logistical challenges ahead, of course.",

Slightly more positive tone there from President Biden. We know that the CIA director is in the region.What we have seen over the last is this, sort of, shuffle of diplomacy. We've seen these delegations from Hamas, from regional leaders, as well as, of course, Israel traveling back and forth between Cairo where these talks have primarily been held. There has been a lot of questions around why these talks are stalling, as we understand it. Of course, Israel has continued to push for all hostages to be released before the beginning of Ramadan. Clearly, that has not happened, and that continues to be the primary focus according to Israeli authorities. We have heard from U.S. officials who have accused Hamas as being the primary reason as to why these ceasefire deals have not reached any sort of formal agreement just yet. And, of course, important to remember that this isn't any sort of talks around a lasting ceasefire just yet, but rather a temporary truce. A pause in fighting. Looking at about six weeks, which would allow for further diplomatic discussions in the hopes of establishing a long-lasting ceasefire. Now, of course, we are still hearing that there are officials talking back and forth between other mediaries, but of course, no clear conclusions at this stage. No clear indication that we are seeing any sort of breakthroughs. And of course, time is very quickly running out. We've heard from the Israeli military warning that if there isn't any sort of a ceasefire, if we don't see those hostages released before the beginning of Ramadan, then they could launch their ground incursion into the southern city of Rafah and that is of course a huge point of concern and fear. Some 1.3 million Palestinians currently displaced in the southern city in these cramped conditions. And of course, we've heard those warnings from the U.N. that if indeed there is a ground incursion in Rafah, then we could see untold bloodshed on the ground and that is in addition to the looming famine that Gaza is now facing.",

And really make sure that we were funding and investing in services that we know work. And so, Measure 110 also diverted hundreds of millions of dollars into addiction and harm reduction services from the cannabis revenue account. And so that is still going on. And we've already served tens of thousands of Oregonians through those services. Unfortunately, the state, you know, was slow to fund those services and get the funds out. And so, what people saw was a lot of devastation on our streets. And Measure 110 was an easy scapegoat.",

Here is how you can reach out to get in -- get connected to those services that we've been investing in.

What happened is, is that we didn't have the services or even the, kind of, crisis and intervention that we needed for when fentanyl was coming into our market. Before Measure 110 was even passed, we experienced a 70 percent increase in overdose deaths from 2019 to 2020.So, these are tragic, but they were not because we decriminalize small personal amounts of drugs. These were because a really lethal drug supply, you know, came into our market. And we do know that, you know, our neighbors to the north also experience these kinds of spikes and overdoses. So, it really isn't -- and it's, you know, the data shows that it isn't a decriminalization issue by any stretch, but it's an easy way to poke holes in this issue.",

The country's transport ministry will launch an investigation after two Batik Air pilots fell asleep during a recent flight to Jakarta, according to the state news agency. A preliminary report released on Saturday found the pilot and co-pilot fell asleep at the same time for nearly 30 minutes, that caused the aircraft to move to an incorrect flight path. None of the 153 passengers and four crew members were hurt during the flight. There was no damage to the aircraft.Now, it was apparently not an isolated incident. The report said the second-in-command had slept during the flight prior to this incident. The pilot-in-command then asked for permission to also rest, and the second-in-command took over the aircraft. Around 90 minutes into the flight, the second-in-command then inadvertently fell asleep, according to the report. A United Airlines flight from San Francisco to Mexico City was diverted to Los Angeles on Friday. Officials say, one of the plane's three hydraulic systems experienced an issue in flight. Now, this is the fourth issue the airline has experienced this week alone. Camila Bernal reports. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
