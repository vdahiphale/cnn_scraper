Oz barely mentioned the debate during a campaign event in just the last hour and said he focused largely on crime.In the race to control Congress, the focus for both sides is narrowing to the most competitive races. New money is being injected from both sides as well, a sign of just how high the stakes are in these midterms. CNN Editor-at-Large Chris Cillizza joins us now. So Chris, where do things stand for the battle of control of the Senate? CHRIS CILLIZZA, CNN POLITICS EDITOR AT LARGE: Broadly because I want to see talk about what we're looking at, so let's just go to the map broadly. Now I'm going to write on this. There are 35 seats up, 21 of those are Republican 14 are Democrat. Fun fact, it's actually 35 races in 34 states, Oklahoma has two Senate races, but that's neither here nor there. Okay. Let's talk about where the races are. The Senate playing field is shrinking and shrinking to these races. Look, it's not complicated why. Paul - Adam Laxalt point 2 percent average lead you just mentioned Fetterman-Oz, 2.3 percent edge for Fetterman. Warnock, in Georgia, 3 percent, but I think everyone expects this to be very, very close. Now, these are the three that I think are majority makers. And by the way, this is DC, this is an RC, this is a DC. Remember 50-50 in the Senate right now. Where's our second tier? Okay. These are other races that could come along J.D. Vance, ahead of Tim Ryan, but not by a huge margin. Ted Budd, this is a race, I think, we're not talking about as much as we should. He's running into someone named Cheri Beasley, this is a close race. Ron Johnson, this surprises me, up 3.4 percent, why? Because he was behind Mandela Barnes, Lieutenant Governor, this summer. Johnson run a really effective campaign. And then there's this one, if we started at the beginning of the election cycle and said who's the most vulnerable, who's the most endangered? Mark Kelly and Raphael Warnock in Georgia would be the two, but Kelly has maintained a pretty solid lead here and there are questions as to whether Republicans are fully committed to Blake Masters, the Republican nominee. So that's - if we add that up, that's three races here, that's four races here, that's seven. I think that's where the Senate majority is going to get decided.",

It's - until all the votes get counted, I don't want to say this is a loss or this is a win. But these are unlikely to flip.New Hampshire was a state Maggie Hassan had weak numbers. It was a state that Republicans really targeted at the start of the election. Gov. Chris Sununu was expected to run, he did not run. Hassan 5.3 percent lead over Dan Bolduc, the Republican nominee who has been an election denier. Michael Bennet, Colorado is a blue-ish state but not a solid blue state, but he continues to lead by 8 percent. I think that one's falling off the board. Now, this one to me is stunning, Chuck Grassley. He's been in the Senate for longer than I've been alive and I'm not that young. But there is polling out that suggests - quality polling out that suggests he's only a few points ahead of his Democratic opponent, Mike Franken. The overall lead, he has a 6.9 percent. I would be stunned if in an election that looks like it's moving toward Republicans, Chuck Grassley loses. And then Marco Rubio, this is a state that seen massive amounts of spending. Val Demings, the Florida Congresswoman has raised a huge amount of money. But Rubio, if you're up a solid six, six and a half percent, it doesn't mean you can coast for this last 13 days of the election. You still got to run and do everything, but you should feel pretty good. So as you can see all these races, the margins are just a little bit bigger than in those seven races I showed you before.",

But the reality is they are trying to change the subject and they did that earlier this morning, placing a new ad on abortion, really trying to draw attention to three words that Mehmet Oz said during the debate last night that are still reverberating, that was local political leaders.He said that local political leaders should play a role in deciding abortion rights. Of course, he was talking about how the federal government in his view should not have a role in deciding this in the wake of the Supreme Court decision. So the Fetterman campaign and Democrats are up with an ad trying to tie him to Republican gubernatorial candidate here Doug Mastriano, who differs from Oz. He does not believe exception should pertain to abortion in the case of rape, incest or life of the mother. But there's no doubt the Fetterman campaign is trying to change this subject because they know it was not a strong debate for their candidate. They know that, of course, he has been recovering from a stroke for several months. But they know it simply was not enough to probably answer the question in the minds of some voters is he fit to serve in the Senate. Now, going into this debate watching it, voters if they supported him, they likely came out of the debate supporters. Many voters we talked to today said exactly that. The voters who had questions in their mind certainly left with questions as well. Particularly look at this answer on fracking what Fetterman said last night.

But that does not necessarily mean that some voters will hold it against him, some may. That is one of the things we will have to wait for the next 13 days to see how voters process the debate itself.Of course, fracking is very - a huge issue here in Pennsylvania. It's a method of extracting natural gas from the ground that employs thousands and thousands of Pennsylvania voters and it certainly is important.

So I don't actually think it's a huge controversy, especially in light of the fact that all the national polls and state polls we see coming out now show abortion falling down the list and inflation, crime and other issues rising.

He understood pretty clearly how to do the 32nd pitch, the 62nd pitch.And debates in this kind of format are really memory exercises. You're taking your talking points and spitting them out and Oz did that extremely effectively. But he also comes from a background where that is what he understands to do. He also prepared, according to our reporting, extensively for that. I think Fetterman, this was never going to be his strong place, and the contrast also hurt him.
