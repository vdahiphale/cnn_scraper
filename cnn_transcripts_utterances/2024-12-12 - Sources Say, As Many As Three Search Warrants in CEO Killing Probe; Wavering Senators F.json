And ABC News is reporting a New York grand jury is already hearing evidence in the case against the suspect, Luigi Mangione.Also tonight, Republican senators are feeling the heat right now as Donald Trump's allies unleashed an aggressive pressure campaign on lawmakers wavering over some of his controversial cabinet picks. This as the president-elect lays out a blueprint for his return to the White House in a wide ranging new interview. And in New Jersey right now, fear and frustration are mounting as weeks of mysterious drone sightings terrify residents. We have new details on a briefing federal authorities just gave lawmakers. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. First up tonight in The Situation Room, breaking news in the CEO killing investigation, sources now say police have executed as many as three search warrants as they probed the murder of Brian Thompson. And according to ABC News, prosecutors in Manhattan are now presenting the mounting evidence against the suspect, Luigi Mangione, to a grand jury. Our Senior Crime and Justice Correspondent Shimon Prokupecz is on the story for us. Shimon, fill us in on these late breaking developments.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, that's right, CNN is learning that three search warrants have now. At least three search warrants have been executed in connection with this investigation.You have, as you will recall, there was a backpack that it's believed the gunman was wearing. Police recovered that inside Central Park. And in it, they found Monopoly money. They also found a jacket, they believe, belonged to the alleged shooter. So, for all of that, police were able to obtain that search warrant to search inside the bag. Also significant is that they have been working with a search warrant for a burner phone. There was a cell phone that's been described as a burner phone that was located near the scene of the shooting that they believe is connected to the gunman. So, authorities have a search warrant for that phone. The question now, Wolf, becomes is whether or not authorities, the police, have been able to get inside the phone, whether or not they've been able to crack the code to get inside and look at the contents of the phone. That is very, very important for investigators who are trying to build out a timeline as to what the alleged shooter was doing during his time here in New York City and, of course, in the days and months before. So, they have all of that. Meanwhile, while all that is going on, we now have learned through ABC News that a grand jury has already been impaneled and they are hearing evidence. That is not that surprising, Wolf. It is important for authorities to move very quickly in this case. Certainly, based on everything we've been reporting between the ballistics match and the fingerprint match, they now have enough evidence, it would appear, to get an indictment. So, it won't be very difficult. The question, though, we heard from the D. A., Alvin Bragg, yesterday, who said they are trying to figure out exactly what to charge the alleged shooter with. They definitely will charge the murder, too. But given the calculated nature of this, what is essentially an assassination, could they possibly bring other charges against the shooter? And that is something that we wait to hear from the D.A. And we can have an indictment, Wolf, really, any moment now.",

And this is just to back up the things Andrew has said.Now, over the last couple of days, I've gotten the question several times, if he's already been charged with a crime, why are they going to the grand jury? Well, it's the way New York law is crafted. As Andrew had said, he was, in effect, informed of the charges against him in a complaint, which is almost a lower form of notifying a defendant of the charges that he might be facing. The kinds of things that we're looking at here, a homicide charge, a second degree murder charge, or perhaps more, as Shimon had said at the start here, has to go through a New York grand jury. Now, based on the evidence that's available, number one, suggesting that this suspect was at the scene of the crime, the ballistics evidence, the fingerprint evidence, some of the information from Pennsylvania, eyewitnesses and so on, seem to suggest that there is probable cause to move forward with an indictment.

But, again, more likely than not, is there a substantial likelihood that the individual committed the offense. Based on that evidence that we have seen in the public thus far, yes, likely that you'd get indictment.Now, of course, he has a right to mount a defense, if he wishes, and can challenge any of the evidence, can challenge the integrity of it, how it was preserved, how it was maintained.

All those things are necessary so that they don't have a problem later on when this case goes to trial.They've got strong evidence right now. They've got strong forensic evidence. We're still waiting on DNA, I would imagine. But they have the gun, they have the silencer, they have the fake I.D. that he used in New York at the hostel, and then, of course, his writings, where he pretty much describes the why he did it.

He had done this through aides, and now we are learning that Xi Jinping is not going to attend but instead send this delegation.But the move itself of Donald Trump reaching out is really unprecedented, particularly reaching out to this communist leader. And one of the things that we have heard is that this is how Donald Trump has been handling a lot of the inauguration outreach, that he has been going to various foreign leaders when he's having phone calls with them or when he runs into them, like when he was in France visiting the reopening of Notre Dame. Then he is asking them if they want to come to the inauguration. It's almost informal conversation. We've also heard behind the scenes that there have been some back- channeling in terms of administration or incoming administration reaching out to various delegations or world leaders to invite them to the inauguration. All of this is because Donald Trump himself wants it to be a global affair. Usually, how this process works is that you don't see foreign leaders at the inaugurations. Instead the joint committee that does the inauguration, it's a bipartisan committee, reaches out to the diplomats in various countries, they go through the State Department and invite them to the inauguration. But it really is up to the president, or incoming president, to determine if they want to invite foreign leaders. And Donald Trump himself has decided that he wants to make this, again, a global affair. So, he has been doing the reach out. Now, I was told in some, say some circumstances, it was him on a phone call about a completely different matter and casually mentioning, why don't you come to the inauguration? So, we'll see how this actually plays out. We don't have answers on who's actually coming. And particularly because of the informal nature, not even some of his closest aides know who he has invited. So, we'll still have to watch and see who actually accepts and shows up on inauguration day.",

He thinks that tariffs are a magical solution to bringing down the cost of everything, they'll even pay for your daycare apparently if you have tariffs. Of course, tariffs are inflationary. So, that wouldn't work. Even when he talks about expanding oil production in terms of lowering prices, there are record high of oil production currently, so that doesn't seem to work either.

I'm just not going to vote for this person. You don't have the support, Mr. President. Choose someone else. But that's not what we're seeing here.So, I understand the frustration among many Republicans, including allies of the president-elect, make a determination on these things, Wolf, and stop playing games. You're either going to support some of these folks or you are not, but make it clear. Stop saying, I'm going to wait, I need another conversation. How many conversations do you need to make a decision?",

They will now have those sentences shortened.He's also pardoning 39 individuals who will have their convictions wiped out completely. The president says this is because these individuals have committed what he calls nonviolent crimes, and also shown a successful ability to rehabilitate from their past lives and to reintegrate into their communities. But these actions come after the president faced bipartisan backlash from his pardon two weeks ago of his own son, Hunter Biden. And amid lots of pressure from advocacy groups to do more for other groups like those who are serving death sentences or facing death sentences, or elderly inmates. Today, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said that the White House and the president will continue reviewing the thousands of petitions before them and that the president will take more action before his term is over. Here's what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  He's going to continue to talk to his team to review any steps that he's going to be taking.
