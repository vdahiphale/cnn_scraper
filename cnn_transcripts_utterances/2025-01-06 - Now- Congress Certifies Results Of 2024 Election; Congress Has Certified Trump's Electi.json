You know, you need 60 votes to get much done. They'll have 53. That's good, but it's not enough. So even today, he's trying to figure out, how do you do immigration, how do you do tax cuts, how do you do spending cuts, how do you do so many other things that he's want to do? So today is a day, as Jamie said, normal. Americans, no matter how you voted, we should celebrate this January 6th looks nothing like the horrendous day four years ago. And now we move on to governing. President Biden is going to try to use his last two weeks to shape his legacy. The vice president, I think grace is the right word, and poise as she just presided over that. She has so many decisions to make about her own future. She has some time to get to that. Trump has no time. Trump has to get to the business of governing. And it was the business of governing that undid him last time. It was not the 5:00 a.m. tweets. It was his performance during Covid. And you have a unified Republican Party, in part, because they're afraid of Trump, in part, because many support Trump. The people who didn't support Trump are mostly gone. (CROSSTALK)",

There's a lot of people who want to put points on the board and get something on immigration done pretty quickly, as he gets in. Because they know from last time, governing gets harder the longer it goes on. Maybe they have about two years here. And they know the tax fight is also going to be a pretty big one. Trump himself says he doesn't see how Democrats are going to fight against renewing that, but we'll see what that looks like, obviously. So I would just say you have seen the division. And I was thinking about that, watching Senator John Thune on the floor. Because he's going to be in the middle of navigating this with Speaker Mike Johnson. And President-Elect Trump, they have been in the middle of disagreeing over whether or not this should be one bill. John Thune said there are limitations in the Senate, we can't do this process of reconciliation all that often. So that's something to be looking for. But the other thing that I was thinking about, as Trump is taking office on day one, we know he wants to pardon the January 6th rioters very quickly.",

U.S. attorney's office. What happens there? Because Trump's world has argued they we're too aggressive in prosecuting and charging a lot of these people. A lot of them pled guilty, I'll note. But they were too aggressive in that and we should expect big changes in the office, whether it's firings or people leaving because they anticipate being fired.

Obviously, U.S. attorneys do get replaced from administration to administration.But you're also -- we're hearing about, let's call it a brain drain, from the Justice Department and other departments, very senior people, people who could have made a lot of money in the private sector, who dedicated themselves to government service, who are leaving before January 20th because they don't want to be part of this administration, or think they're going to get fired. One other point before we even get to January 20th, John, you mentioned cabinet appointees. I have spoken to sources on both sides of the aisle who believe that -- and let's wait and see -- that there are a group of six or seven Republican Senators who have talked about, let's say, mixing and matching, opposing some of these cabinet appointees that they think are either not qualified or worse than that.",

He was railing on President Joe Biden and his team, in his words, \"for making it difficult through the transition.\" He said he has made it very difficult. They're putting up roadblocks in their way. Also talking about the news in Canada of Justin Trudeau stepping down as party leader. But, Anderson, it raises a point here. With Republicans poised to be completely in charge of government, they already are of the House and the Senate, and in two-weeks' time will be in charge of the White House. The time for the Democratic foils here for President-Elect Donald Trump are escaping, talking about Joe Biden and how he has been sort of difficult here. It is a reminder that the Democratic foils that Donald Trump has long sought out and talked about are going to be sort of not necessarily as relevant. He's in charge of government. The Republicans are fully and squarely are going to be in charge of government here. So it will be fascinating to watch. I'm sure he will still try and find some foils to blame. But soon this government will be all his and all his party's. But this morning at least, on Truth Social, he's been focusing on anything but that.

You don't want to highlight if you're going to oppose somebody. I think the ones that are probably in the most danger, Pete Hegseth, obviously, Tulsi Gabbard, and then Kash Patel. And so, it only takes, what, I guess three or four Republicans -- I guess four Republicans that go no to block it. I would put RFK in that, except that there's reporting out that there may be one or two Democrats looking to support RFK. That would mean he would probably get in because I would have a hard time seeing six or seven Republicans in opposition.
