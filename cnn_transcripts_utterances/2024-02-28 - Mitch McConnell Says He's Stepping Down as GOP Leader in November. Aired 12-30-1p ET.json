We expect that he will say he will stay on through this year's election. Again, this is very, very big news. This is according to a source familiar with his plans. We do know that his office has formally said that he is going to make extended remarks on the Senate floor.You see the Senate floor right now. We are watching and waiting for McConnell to come out. He just turned 82 years old. He is the longest serving leader in the United States Senate historically, and that has been a milestone that he has held onto for now a couple of years, right, Jeff Zeleny? I have my panel here. Were waiting for Manu Raju to get to the camera. And as we wait for him -- oh, Manu, you're there? Manu, can you feel the sort of marble shaking as this news is going around the United States Capitol?",

You're watching as the U.S. Senate gives the longest serving party leader in the U.S. Senate a round of applause after he makes an announcement that he is going to step down from his post in leadership after the November election of this year. Quite emotional for Mitch -- for anybody really, but particularly for Mitch McConnell who doesn't exactly wear his emotions on his sleeve. But he said that he is going towards the finish line, which is now in sight.I want to bring in Manu Raju, who is there and has covered Mitch McConnell maybe almost as long as I have, but the finish line is way further away from your vision than mine, Manu. But the fact that he said I still have enough gas in my tank to disappoint my critics, and I intend to do that with enthusiasm, the enthusiasm that they've been accustomed to, that which is one of the sort of turns of phrase that enraptured and encapsulated, Manu, so much of his tenure, particularly in recent years, because it used to be that much of the criticism that he got was from across the aisle.",

And Dana, this is going to open up a contested leadership race that will drive the future direction of the Republican Party.Look for the three Republican Senator -- John Thune, who is currently the number two Republican Senator; John Cornyn, a former Republican whip; and John Barrasso, the number three Republican Senator. All of them could run for this spot in a secret ballot election between -- that will happen after November. So, a lot of jockeying will happen between now and then as members of Congress, the Senators, grapple with this historic moment. BASH: Yeah, the battle of the Johns. Wow, this is certainly quite a moment. Manu, standby, because I want to bring in Scott Jennings. He is a CNN contributor and a longtime adviser to Mitch McConnell. Before, he was formal; and now, he's informal. And I would say, Scott, it's probably fair to they say, a very close friend. I mentioned to Manu that I don't remember -- we were talking here. I've seen Senator McConnell get sort of emotional, understandably so, when longtime colleagues pass away. But, he -- his voice was cracking throughout this entire speech. It was obviously not easy for him to give. And one of the many lines that struck me, Scott, was him -- when he talked about his age and the fact that it's time for him to move on. No longer, he said -- he's no longer the young man standing in the back, hoping people remember my name. It's time for the next generation of leadership. Scott? SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (via telephone): Yes. Listening to his speech today, I was struck by that as well, that he is sort of acknowledging what a lot of Americans are feeling about their government right now. And you also heard him say that he has many flaws, but failure to understand politics is not one of them. And I think that's part of our politics and it's part of our political conversation. The emotion you heard in his voice is fully related to just how much he reveres the institution. And I think if there's one hallmark of his time in office, it's been defend, serve (ph) in protection of the institution and he cares about it so deeply because as you said, it's been as life. I do want to point out for those who are unfamiliar with the Senate terms, he is not up for re-election this year and his term doesn't run out until 2026. My expectation and he made this clear I think, is that he plans to stay in office, finish his term. I think he would likely be in line to be Chairman of Appropriations possibly in the next congress, maybe even have a role in setting defense --",

Scott, thank you so much for hopping on the phone and you know Mitch McConnell as well as maybe better than anyone who I know in the realm of politics, and certainly personally. Scott, appreciate it. Back with the panel here. Jeff Zeleny, you have covered Mitch McConnell for a long time as well. And let's just pick up on the Trump factor. He was very critical of Donald Trump after, well, even before January 6, but certainly after January 6. And Manu mentioned this, it has led to some very, very harsh, inappropriate, downright racist comments from Donald Trump about his wife, who by the way, Elaine Chao, served in the Trump Administration until she quit because of her anger about January 6th.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. And they've not, as Manu said, spoken in three years. Scott says the timing is not connected. Certainly, he as an insider knows that, but the timing is still coming at a time when we take stock of his tenure in the Senate. Addison Mitch McConnell, born in Alabama, moved to Kentucky. At two-years-old had polio, did not think he would ever be able to walk, was a Senate page and just rose through the ranks. And really, if you think about his time, he has spanned the Reagan era through the Trump era, unlike anyone else. And that is where he is stepping aside now as leader in November.We will see if Trump gives him the space to do that or calls on him to do so sooner, but I think his worldview is something that has largely vanished from that Senate Republican conference, which is really remarkable. One thing he always did was win his own races and he vowed -- one thing I can think of that he talked about often that he did not succeed, was making Barack Obama a one-term president. That's what he wanted to do back in 2009, he told my friend and colleague, Carl Hulse of The New York Times, that that was his goal and didn't do that, of course. But, we could talk for hours about his legacy.",

You have to remember that under the Trump Administration, you really have to credit McConnell -- Republicans have to credit McConnell for remaking the federal judiciary.There is strategic discipline there. There's a strategic ruthlessness there. And though Republicans now, may dismiss him as a globalist because he's no longer ideologically in line with where the party is headed, a lot of their policy accomplishments, they wouldn't have been able to achieve without his discipline. And so, as we look to the future of this party now, under the leadership of Trump, you have to wonder, can they still be as successful in trying to advance some of these conservative policy goals without that level of discipline that McConnell offered to the real chagrin of Democrats.",
