And to know that they are on the front lines of freedom right now. They're fighting, their cause is our cause. I believe that the Ukrainians have proven that they are a really good investment for the United States. They are not asking us to be there to fight their war. They're fighting it themselves.

But it's the single Patriot Air Defense System that's getting all of the headlines. CNN's Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Patriot missile, the U.S. military's most advanced missile defense system capable of shooting down a variety of targets from ballistic missiles to aircraft. The system will bolster Ukraine's air defenses which have had to contend with repeated Russian barrages of drones, missiles and more. The Patriot batteries will fit like an extended dome over Ukraine's current systems. Patriots can have a range of 40 miles or more and the radar can detect threats even further away. A long range air defense capability which Ukraine has requested for months. Below that are systems like the U.S. provided NASAMS with a range of 25 miles. A medium range system that's proven very effective. And then there are other short range options like stingers that Ukraine has used as well.",

The system itself has six major parts according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. A control station, a radar set, a generator, an antenna and of course, the launcher and missiles. It takes about 100 personnel to operate a full system. Nearly 20 countries have Patriot missile batteries. Israel has use them to intercept drones and even Syrian aircraft.
