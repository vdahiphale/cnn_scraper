In those positions, Biden took the position that at some point Ukraine might qualify to join NATO, but that it wasn't ready because of internal corruption. It hadn't yet met the standards that were there. And so Biden has never pushed for Ukraine to join NATO. In fact, he's slowed down the effort. But that's all, you know, sort of water under the bridge for President-elect Trump, who was basically setting himself up to say, OK, part of this will be a commitment that Ukraine doesn't join NATO for 20 years or 30 years or so forth.

It is incredibly sad to see what society is going through during this exceptionally destructive event.I can't emphasize it enough. On behalf of the National Weather Service, our hearts go out to everyone who is being impacted by these fires. You know, we're in the midst of a destructive windstorm right now, a once in a decade or two decade type of wind event with winds now gusting upwards of nearly 100 miles per hour across the San Gabriel Mountains and the nearby foothills, and then also across the Santa Monica mountains, extending across parts of the Los Angeles basin area, where we're having trees coming down, significant structural damage already occurring, and it will only get worse overnight. And then, with the very dry air mass that settled over the area, a very rare, volatile combination of parameters has come together to fuel the explosive development of horrific wildfires across the Los Angeles area, all the way towards the coast across the Santa Monica Mountains and towards Malibu. This is a particularly dangerous situation, a rare category of red- flag warning that we use for the worst of the worst conditions that can come together to create the rapid spread of fires that spot miles in advance and spread rapidly, raging paths of destruction. We're seeing that come to fruition. And, you know, when we're making these forecasts, when we're making these messages, you know, these -- these correspond to real-world impacts. And it's so sad to see what's going on. And we urge everyone to stay at a high state of readiness as we head through the overnight hours into tomorrow, as this will only get worse.",

It's a very large footprint all the way. Griffith Park. Thinking of afew other areas, as well.

That's well over hurricane-force winds.Sadly, that's minus the rain that a hurricane typically brings. So, the concern here is that firefighters will not be able to keep up. So, the concern -- the focus, I should say -- is to save lives. In fact, we know, according to our several affiliates on the ground, including KCAL and KCBS, that there's currently an effort underway to evacuate the residents of a senior center. Nearly 100 of the most vulnerable people affected by this fire being rushed to safety. Some of the many people whose lives could be in danger. So do stay tuned to CNN and, certainly, to officials, as they continue to inform us on the situation on the ground. Not even 10 p.m. yet in L.A., so the night is really just getting started. All right. Meanwhile, let's get you caught up on other headlines. Meta is adjusting its content review policies on Facebook and Instagram by removing its fact checkers. Instead, they will be replaced by user-generated so-called community notes, similar to those that we've already seen on the platform X. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announcing the changes less than two weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Zuckerberg acknowledged more harmful content will likely appear on the -- on some of the platforms. The company says its systems will focus, instead, on high-severity violations like terrorism, child sex exploitation and drugs and scams. Brian Stelter is CNN's chief media analyst and joins us now with more. Brian, let's dive right in here. Zuckerberg calling this repositioning part of a so-called new era. You and I know that's very different. You've even gone as far as to call this a Trump-friendly makeover. Can you tell our viewers why that is? BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA ANALYST: Yes, Zuckerberg is very dramatically trying to reset his relationship with Trump and with Trump voters. He's clearly trying to appeal to conservative users, and it's working. But he may also be putting off some liberal and independent users in the United States. And this is much broader than any one country. These changes have big impacts all around the world. Facebook is loosening up its content rules, and it's scrapping its relationships with third-party fact checkers. That's going to leave some journalists out of work, because they rely on Facebook's funding for some of their fact-checking efforts. It feels to me as if Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg, is basically saying to the Facebook audience, you're on your own. You know, police yourselves. Figure out what's true and false on your own. And he's implementing more of an Elon Musk-style community note system in order to do that.",

It has worked in some cases on X, but there are lots of other cases on Elon Musk's platform where disinformation, lies, and just plain nonsense run rampant.So, it is not an entirely effective solution. And more broadly, what we see Zuckerberg doing here is trying to put his finger up into the wind, trying to figure out where the American public is at. And as he said, be in the mainstream. But as a result, for example, as of today, Meta's revised guidelines allow users to call women household objects and allow people to dehumanize transgender individuals, using the word \"it.\" So, those are examples of the concrete policy changes that are going into effect on Facebook, on Threads, on Instagram that may appeal to some users, but might also really repel, really tick off other users. I'm curious to see if alternatives like Bluesky gain any ground. But let's remember, Meta has a dominant position. For many people, Meta is the internet. They use WhatsApp. They use Facebook. And basically, by making these changes, Zuckerberg is making changes across the entirety of the Internet.",
