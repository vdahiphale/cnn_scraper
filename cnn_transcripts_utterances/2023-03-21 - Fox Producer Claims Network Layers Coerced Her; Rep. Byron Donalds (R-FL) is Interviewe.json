We will vigorously defend these claims.I talked to her last night, and talked to her attorney. They dispute that this was - there was a negative performance review.

He was actually just asked about the hush money payments and the investigation going on here in New York with former President Trump. We'll bring you that live in a moment. But also this morning, the Federal Reserve is facing a difficult decision as they begin a two-day meeting on whether or not to raise interest rates after we've seen the recent turmoil in the banking system. Two bank failures and an 11th hour rescue of Credit Suisse have investors expecting a smaller quarter-point increase as the central bank is continuing its fight to bring down inflation. So, joining us now to talk about all of this is Republican Congressman Byron Donalds of Florida, who serves on the Financial Services Committee. You're going to be holding hearings on this next week. What do you think the Federal Reserve is going to do? If they do a smaller interest rate raise, if they do a quarter point, is that helpful or hurtful in your view? REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): I think it's going to just keep things kind of going the way everybody assumes it's going to go. I think a quarter point's fine. Me, personally, I think the Fed should just go ahead and go to 50 basis points because the underlying issue. Go to 50 basis points because the underlying issue, whether we want to talk about bank balance sheets or not, is this inflation in our economy, which is really crippling younger families, seniors, people on the lower end of the economic spectrum in America. They're suffering the most. You have to get this inflation out of the our economy. If you can do that and get that job done, you can then figure out how to contain and protect bank balance sheets the best that you can so the banking system can continue to thrive.",

Number one, at Silicon Valley Bank they didn't have a chief risk officer for about six to nine months, somewhere in that time window. Obviously, they weren't paying attention to the duration risk on their bonds. A big question we have is, what was Mary Daly, who is the president of the San Francisco Fed, what was she paying attention to and why wasn't' she raising the alarms on a bank that she was regulating and overseeing, what was going on there?You have a failure of management at this bank, not a contagion in the banking system overall. So, I don't think there's a legislative fix. What probably should have happened is the FDIC should have allowed for a sale to happen pretty quickly and then you can figure out how to manage the rest of the banks in that same kind of position with respect to their balance sheet.",

KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Look, the thing I think about -- it was interesting. Someone briefed me on the use of money, a situation like this before. And you probably covered this. Remember when the DNC and Hillary Clinton paid the law firm $1 million but it -- and said that it was for something else, and we found out later it wasn't? It was all about the Russia collusion. It wasn't for a legal part. And so they went through and they got investigated. $1 million they spent. And you know what, at the end of the day, they didn't get prosecuted. They got fined. Hillary's campaign got fined $8,000 and the DNC got fined $100,000. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We don't want to have a system of justice in our country that is politically motivated. And if you're going to go pull out the payments to Stormy Daniels, to Michael Cohen, and now say that there's some hidden felony nobody knows about, and you're trying to raise the stakes to bring that in, yes, Congress should look at that because we don't want an unequal application of the law. We don't want a law basically to just point at one person. That's not our system of justice in America. That is, I believe, under congressional purview.

There have been issues with prosecutors who have been widely using their discretion, in some respects overusing it, while at the same time, in his city, he's ignoring violent crimes. The NYPD is arresting people. He's letting them walk out the back door. That needs to be the focus.

I was with him the other day dealing a Hurricane Ian aftermath reports, trying to get pressure on FEMA to actually do its job and get trailers to the people who are still about 1,300 homeless in my district. FEMA doesn't want to put trailers because we live in a flood zone. I mean talk about ridiculous.
