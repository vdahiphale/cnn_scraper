We'll have the latest. TikTok shock. How the Supreme Court can save the social media app from a ban in the United States. And hitting the right note. Julia's interview with superstar pianist Khatia Buniatishvili. That conversation and more coming up. But first, call it an unwelcome holiday surprise from Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve. Stocks on Wall Street fell sharply Wednesday after the U.S. Central Bank cut its outlook for rate cuts next year from four cuts to just two. Here's the damage for markets. The Dow and the S&amp;P fallen well over 2 percent. Tech stocks, the biggest loser, with the NASDAQ down 3.5 percent. The Fed, as expected, cut rates by a quarter percentage point this time. But Fed chair Jerome Powell says stubbornly high inflation is likely to stay the Fed's hand next year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEROME POWELL, CHAIR, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE: We've had a year on projection for inflation and it's kind of fallen apart as we approach the end of the year. So, that is certainly a large factor in people's thinking. I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations. It's still, you know, going to be between 2.5 and 3. It's way below where it was. But, you know, we really want to see progress on inflation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE AND CNN ANCHOR, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Yes, the cut in interest rates was expected, but what was not expected is what you just heard then from Chair Powell, which is an admission that the work isn't over, and far from it, that the situation is not where they would like it to be. The trajectory has now stalled, inflation is -- to use the word that they say, is sticky, they can't get it down further. And the worrying part is that it could be about to go back up again next year. So, the overall message from the Fed is not only job not done, but job could be getting worse. And that was what not what the Fed was -- sorry, so, that's what not what the market was looking for.

The island says, Multiple groups of Chinese naval and Coast Guard vessels are moving around the Taiwan Strait. This comes after Taiwan's president visited Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam, angering Beijing. China views Taiwan as its territory and opposes interactions between Washington and Taipei. Joining us now is Kitsch Liao. He's an assistant to the president. Director of the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub. Kitsch, thank you so much for joining us and offering your perspective here. The world, let's start with this, is used to seeing Chinese military exercises, but what is so different about this military gathering beyond its scale, and what's the message being sent here? KITSCH LIAO, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, ATLANTIC COUNCIL'S GLOBAL CHINA HUB: Thank you. First of all, I think it's very important for us to think about the fact that there has been no announcement, no pronouncement from the PRC regarding the silent ramp up. This is not how responsible powers are going to behave. And China's aim for this exercise, even though they haven't called it this way, is to demonstrate its counter intervention capability in the event of a Taiwan contingency, as in if they invade Taiwan. Now, while gradually making Taiwan Strait its interior waters, what that means is, you know, basically they get to do whatever they want within their territory. Now, for Taiwan, their response is a new one, because they try something basically like by calling Beijing out, proactive public disclosure. Beijing is aimed to slowly erode this norm, and Taiwan is taking a page out of the U.S. playbook in Ukraine by calling them out, preventing this step by step in a conduct raison strategy. Now, there has been some unexpected fallout from that within the island, because, you know, Chinese military exercise did not eventually materialize. So, some opposition, including some pro-China forces, has been accusing the government of basically using this as a political scheme.",

      "sentences": "It has, at least from the U.S. perspective. And this is a very interesting revelation in this latestreport from the U.S. called the China Military Power Report. Normally, what we're looking for in here is the latest U.S. estimate, for example, on how many nuclear weapons China has and how its nuclear modernization program is going, as well as the expansion of its military as it races to modernize there. And certainly, that's in here as well. According to the U.S. in this report, China is still growing its nuclear forces and looking for about a thousand warheads by the year 2030. But what was fascinating here was the focus on this anti-corruption campaign coming from Xi Jinping and the emphasis and the impact it's had from the U.S. perspective on Xi's long-term goals. According to the U.S., Xi has made it a goal to be ready to invade and take over Taiwan by 2027. It doesn't mean he's decided to do that, but that's the goal he's set out. But because of all these firings, 15 high ranking military officers and defense industry leaders in the second half of last year alone, the U.S. believes it has impeded China's push to get to that goal. Now, it doesn't mean they've stopped, they are certainly modernizing their forces. And we hear quite a bit about that, but to do that, you need leadership. And that's where we see this anti-corruption campaign really taking out some of the key leaders within China's military. It focuses on China's rocket force, where it handles its nuclear and conventional missiles here, but it's beyond that, into its defense industrial base as well, where we have seen that anti-corruption campaign claims some senior leaders there, including two former defense ministers who were taken down by this anti-corruption campaign. So, it's had a profound impact, and from the U.S. perspective, that means a slowdown in what has been a massive push by China and the People's Liberation Army and the military there to try to be ready for the goals that Xi has set out. Crucially, the U.S. has had its eye on that 2027 marker where they believe Xi is trying to be at least ready for the idea of a takeover or a move against Taiwan. Isabel.",

The nine justices have agreed to hear the company's challenge to a federal law that would be Ban it from the United States. The court will hear the case on January 10th, and the justices will really be racing against the clock. Under the disputed federal law. TikTok could be banned in America on January 19th. The controversy traces to last April when Congress passed and Joe Biden signed a ban on the popular social media platform. The law was responding to years of concern in Washington that TikTok's Chinese parent company posed a national security risk. The government argues that China could covertly manipulate the app to affect content and also to access user's data. TikTok Incorporated is an American company, but the ultimate parent is ByteDance, which has Chinese ownership. The TikTok platform would be banned in the U.S. unless it is divested of that Chinese ownership. If that doesn't happen, TikTok would lose the opportunity to be available through platforms and apps here. TikTok has argued that the law unfairly singles it out and violates speech rights. The company lost in an important federal court below, an appellate court, which said the federal government had made a good case on national security grounds. We'll see whether the federal government can do the same before the justices. It will be the last major argument by the Biden administration at the High Court. Again, the law is set to take effect in about a month on January 19th, which is a day before Donald Trump's inauguration and his return to the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Nissan has been struggling. Last month, it announced a major restructure, which involves cutting 9,000 jobs. It slashed its operating profit forecast for the year by 70 percent. And this would be another big chapter in Nissan's rather extraordinary history. From the 1990s, when Carlos Ghosn, then an executive with the French carmaker Renault, was credited with turning the company around with a French-Japanese alliance, to 2018, when Ghosn was arrested in Japan for financial wrongdoing, which he has always denied, before escaping the country as a fugitive. Nissan's share price has never recovered to the levels we saw under Carlos Ghosn. A merger could also be good for Honda. Now, while it is around five times the size of Nissan, it faces challenges in transitioning to zero emissions. So, adding scale and synergies to the mix, particularly in technology, would help. Not least with the likes of Tesla in the U.S. and BYD in China trying to dominate the EV market. Anna Stewart, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

There are two Democrats that were involved, two Republicans that were involved, as well as the White House. And ultimately, this deal was cut between those members and members of the critical Appropriations Committees in the House and the Senate. But after this was released, it garnered significant Republican backlash, not just because of the spending levels and probably someone in deeper cuts but also, some of the provisions that Johnson -- Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, had to give to Democrats in order to get their support. Remember in the House, which is nearly divided, they need Democratic support to get anything across to the Senate. The Senate is controlled by Democrats. So, right now, at least up until January 3rd, when the new Congress convenes, and Joe Biden is still in the White House until January 20th, which means that there needs to be a bicameral, bipartisan deal. But this deal that was reached, 1,500 pages. It was dropped on Wednesday -- last night, and they're trying to get it through Congress before the deadline at 11:59 p.m. on Friday. That is a difficult deadline for them to reach just to get this bill across the finish line, let alone the resistance they're getting now from the right. But all throughout the day today, pressure began to build. Elon Musk, for one, came out and said that any Republican who votes for this should lose their race. Donald Trump was quiet for most of the day, put out a statement late in the day saying that he could not support it. He bashed the provisions in the deal, suggested it was a bad deal that Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, cut. And also said that they should add an increase of the national debt limit as part of this negotiation. The debt limit is an incredibly fraught and complicated process. Something that typically takes months and months for Congress to resolve because no one wants to vote to authorize more borrowing. Something that actually does not have to be even dealt with until the middle of next year. But now, Trump is injecting it in part of the talks now. Why? Because he says he doesn't want to deal with it when he's president. He says Joe Biden should deal with it now. But by adding this demand late in the process, it is only going to increase the fears of a potential government shutdown, raise questions about what the next steps are as Republicans are scrambling behind the scenes to try to figure out what's next, and Democrats are weighing how to respond to this. But right now Democrats are saying pass the deal that they cut with the speaker of the House, who has now walked away from it amid Donald Trump's opposition. Isabela. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
