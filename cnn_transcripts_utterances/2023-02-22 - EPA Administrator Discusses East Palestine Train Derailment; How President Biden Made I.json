He has been looking for opportunities to put himself in the news cycle.We were just talking about fundraising and money that he has raised. His campaign has not raised a ton of money and that is part of why you are not seeing him do big rallies because those are very expensive. So he's looking for ways to put himself in and look as if he's a contrasting president with President Biden. It can be very dicey when people show up when they have no actual role in a -- in a disaster. And so, he's not known for his empathy to begin with so we will see how this visit goes.",

We have stationary air monitors all around the community strategically placed. And we have tested the indoor air quality of over 550 homes. Nothing is coming back that shows adverse health impacts.

Number two, they will pay for it -- fully pay for it. At any moment if we have to step in because they refuse to do anything we will do the cleaning up ourselves. We can fine them up to $70,000 a day and when we recoup our total costs we can charge them three times the amount of the cost of the federal government. That is what the law provides for me. We're going to use the full extent of our oversight and enforcement to hold Norfolk Southern accountable. And they have to design a very specific work plan that's approved by EPA.
