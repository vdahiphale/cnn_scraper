And with those Russian airstrikes showing no sign of letting up, the U.S. president will soon touchdown in Japan for a G7 summit, an annual meeting of the world's leading democracies and topping the agenda, support for Ukraine and the question of supplying Ukrainians with F- 16, which until now Joe Biden has consistently refused to do. Joining me now from Hiroshima, CNN Political and National Security Analyst David Sanger. He is also the White House and National Security Correspondent for The New York Times and author of The Perfect Weapon. It is good to see you, David, let's start with Joe Biden and the G7. How much pressure will the U.S. president be facing at this summit, if not to supply F-16s to Ukraine, but the next best thing, which is to approve a third party transfer?",

But this has been a very familiar pattern here where others have pressured President Biden to provide more powerful weapons. The American president has been reluctant to do anything that he thinks might lead to escalation and ultimately, to nuclear escalation. And you know, that question is going to be pretty well hanging over this group about where is that line, we are, after all meeting in Hiroshima. The second to the last place that the United States has ever used, or any country has ever used a nuclear weapon against the civilian population. And while you'll hear a lot about the need for disarmament and so forth, there's going to be a big push among many of the allies for what's called extended deterrence.

New York Police Department, the city's mayor, even the person driving the taxi hailed by Harry and Meghan, have all suggested the so called chase wasn't so dangerous, nor dramatic and certainly did not last for two hours.

A law enforcement official telling CNN they were swarmed by paparazzies in New York City on Tuesday night, followed by photographers on cars, motorcycles and scooters. It was meant to be a night of celebration, with Meghan being honored for her global advocacy to empower women and girls. Meghan stepping back into the spotlight after keeping a low profile, whilst Prince Harry attended his father King Charles's coronation alone earlier this month. A spokesperson for the couple said they were involved in the chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi.

Prince Harry's team told CNN, half a dozen blacked out vehicles were involved in Tuesday's chase, driving on sidewalks, running red lights and reversing down a one way street. Chris Sanchez, a member of Harry and Meghan security detail said the couple switched cars more than once during the chase. They were first seen in a black car, then a yellow cab. The couple left the U.K. for a life in North America in 2020, partly over press intrusion. Examples of which Harry recounted in his recent memoir Spare. And even after leaving the U.K., his fight with a British tabloids in court continues. Harry in March appeared at London's high court for a legal case against the Daily Mail. And last week, on the first day of a phone hacking trial, receiving an apology from the Mirror group newspapers. A spokesperson for the couple said the images obtained from Tuesday's car chase should not be disseminated and reiterated that being a public figure should never come at the cost of anyone's safety.

GUILLERMO LASSO, ECUADORIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is a provision of the Office of the President that is granted to me by the Constitution. Let me be clear, my decision follows the Constitution. POZZEBON (voice over): The provision is called muerte cruzada, the mutual death and it has never been invoked before. Some say it's illegal. Lasso says the impeachment trial he was facing did not stand. LASSO (through translator): I am innocent. They were trying to push me out against the law for crimes I did not commit. POZZEBON (voice over): The opposition accuses Lasso of embezzlement, profiting from contracts related to the export of crude oil. And with the president rejecting all allegations, both sides accepting that a new election is the best path forward. MARCELA HOLGUIN, ECUADORIAN OPPOSITION LAWMAKER (through translator): The democratic solution was for the president to resign and go home. But if the president invokes the mutual death, we are ready for it. POZZEBON (voice over): The Electoral Council has pledged to call the election within 90 days. But for now, Ecuador remains in a limbo. With Congress closed, Lasso would rule by decree until the vote and has pledged to boost salaries with lower taxes and to rein in a brutal spike in crime that has shocked the nation. Just last year, violent deaths increased by over 90 percent and Ecuador, a generally peaceful country until not long ago, now sees the type of violence of narcotics warfare typical of Colombia and Mexico.

But the latest we have learned is Beijing police is now launching a formal investigation into his case. Meaning that he could now potentially go to jail; because in 2021, China enacted a law banning any insults or slander against military personnel. The authorities have prosecuted people for that crime and sending them to prison for at least seven months in previous cases.
