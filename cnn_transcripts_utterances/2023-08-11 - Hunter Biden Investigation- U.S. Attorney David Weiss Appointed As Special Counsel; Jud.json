The new title gives U.S. Attorney General David Weiss, a Trump holdover who had been already been investigating Mr. Biden's son, more powers than he had as a federal prosecutor. Now, you might recall just a few weeks ago, it looked as though this investigation was coming to an end. Hunter Biden went to court after his lawyers had supposedly struck a deal with Weiss' prosecutorial team. But that deal fell apart in court among much skepticism voiced by the judge. The two sides were told try to keep negotiating, but now, the Justice Department says it looks as though this case is headed to trial. Prosecutors allege Hunter Biden failed to pay more than a million dollars in taxes on time. He also faced a federal gun charge for lying on his background check form that he was not using drugs at the time. But Republicans in Congress have also alleged Hunter Biden was involved in much more serious crimes including money laundering. Whistle blowers have claimed that the case was not treated as it should have been. Speaker Kevin McCarthy today asked of the now special counsel, Mr. Weiss, quote, if Weiss negotiated a sweetheart deal that couldn't get approved, how could he be trusted as special counsel? Let's get straight to CNN senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, this investigation has been going on for five years. So, why now for a special counsel?",

But we have seen in court filings that it appears that the talks between the U.S. attorney's office and Hunter Biden's legal team to resolve the issues that the judge identified in that plea deal, that those have fallen apart and it is likely to go to trial. That appears to be the impetus, but it's really unclear. Now, one of the big differences now he's special counsel is that Weiss is going to have to compile a full report detailing what he investigated and his findings and that the attorney general who has now to make it public. Now, I've also given the White House was not given a heads up about this and neither were Hunter Biden's attorneys.",

He had said I have the authority to do so, all the talking points are contrary to my experience was. But now, this raised a lot of questions, and whatever happened on Tuesday, as Paula alluding, now does make me feel surprised about why now? What is happening here? Remember, he's still the U.S. attorney in Delaware, but now the special counsel allows him to go beyond his jurisdiction. You can look at other areas as well. It's the reason why you have Jack Smith and go beyond that. You can have things in Florida and have things in Washington, D.C. It does now go beyond that. But at its core, I wonder what the decision really came down to. The special counsel statute says you can have this if you first look at the crowd. Does a matter actually warrant an investigation? Is it warranted? He had concluded it did if you were Garland. Was there a conflict of interest at play here? The talking point you see on the right and left suggest talking points around this very notion, that there is a conflict of being able to have the president appoint the attorney general who would oversee an investigation --",

It's a problem, ding, ding, ding.But it also lends credence now to not only the point made by whistleblowers -- which, by the way part of their claim was that those who were investigating akin to a police officer who arrest someone and then says to the prosecutor, here's what I arrest the person on, how dare you diverge on that. Well, the prosecutor has the power to decide what to bring. And so, just because you wanted something different doesn't mean it was a justifiable prosecution. But now, it raises questions about, what else was a part of it? And why would David Weiss have in writing. I think it was twice in writing have already said, no, I actually did have the power. It seems what he meant was, I have the power in Delaware and now I want the power in other places, maybe D.C., maybe California, as well part of it. So it raises a lot of questions.

She noted that even though Trump is running a political campaign, he still has to in her words yield to the administration of justice, and she said if that means his political speech has to be somewhat limited, then that's how it's going to be. So she warned she will, in fact, be carefully scrutinizing statements from both Trump and his legal team. And she didn't necessarily address some of Trump's most recent posts on his Truth Social page, when he did criticize her, the judge, and he called the special counsel Jack Smith deranged, but she did put it this way-- she said, even arguably ambiguous statements by the parties or their counsel, if they can be reasonably interpreted to intimidate witnesses or to prejudice potential jurors, that can threaten the process. So the government here, Jake, said they're prepared to start providing Trump's team with all of that discovery today. The expectation is they'll have it all handed over by August 28th. And they talked about how wide ranging this material is. It includes hundreds of reportings of witness interviews. Trump will not be able to discuss any of those. It also includes 11.6 million pages of discovery and hard drives, Jake. TAPPER: You say Trump won't be able to discuss it. Just watch him.",

So, Jake, she does want this case dragging on. Notably, the special counsel has proposed early January. Trump's team has until next week to propose their trial start date.
