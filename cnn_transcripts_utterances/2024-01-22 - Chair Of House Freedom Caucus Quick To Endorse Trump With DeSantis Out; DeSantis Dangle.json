Plus, he is often called the Kingmaker of Democratic politics, and he helped put President Biden in the White House. Can Congressman Jim Clyburn be able to help keep him there? He'll join me live, in a moment. Also, as families of hostages burst into Israel's Parliament, demanding that the government do more, to bring their loved ones home. We have new reporting, tonight, on conditions, for a possible ceasefire. I am Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. The first votes are about to be cast, in the first-in-the-nation primary. Seriously. Starting at midnight, tonight, the six registered voters, who live in the small town of Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, will cast their votes. And with three hours to go, there is just one rival standing, in the way of what could otherwise be a 2024 rematch, between President Biden and Donald Trump. That's Nikki Haley, of course, who has been crisscrossing the state, today, after Ron DeSantis dropped out, and endorsed Donald Trump, despite how the former President spent months, trying to humiliate him. In fact, you're about to see three of Trump's former rivals, on stage with him, in Laconia, New Hampshire. Senator Tim Scott. Vivek Ramaswamy, maybe not really a rival so much as someone who was a surrogate for him, on the campaign trail. But also, North Dakota governor, Doug Burgum. The old saying goes, Democrats fall in love, while Republicans fall in line. Democrats are maybe not so much in love with their choice. But Republicans, tonight, are certainly falling in line, one by one, as the GOP appears to be encircling Trump, yet again. No matter what he's said about them, no matter how outrageous, and no matter what they've said about him. Exhibit A, Senator Tim Scott. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): I am not going to defend the indefensible. What we want to see, from our president, is clarity and moral authority. And that moral authority is compromised. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is the same thing that we saw then, with these Republicans, who had come out, against the former President, only to then back him in full force. Now, they have a full show of force here, tonight. And talk about howthe campaign is feeling. They're feeling a lot better today than they were a week ago. We cannot underestimate the value of Ron DeSantis, dropping out of the race, and endorsing Donald Trump, not because of votes, here in New Hampshire. Ron DeSantis was never really a player. They never really took him seriously. They always viewed this as a two-person race, between Trump and Nikki Haley, in this state. But, in terms of being able to sell this, as Republicans, coalescing around Donald Trump. As you noted, for a year, Donald Trump went after Ron DeSantis, time and time again. And yet still Donald Trump -- excuse me, Ron DeSantis got up there, and endorsed Donald Trump. Now, again, as you noted, he's not going to be on the stage, tonight. I am told that while they haven't talked, Trump's team did reach out to DeSantis' team, and offer an open invitation, to campaign with the former President. But it does seem a little bit unlikely. We heard Donald Trump, on Fox, throwing shade at Ron DeSantis, earlier today, essentially saying he wouldn't have him, in his administration likely. And on Twitter, or X, formerly known as Twitter, Ron DeSantis throwing a little shade back at Donald Trump. So, it doesn't really feel like there's love lost. But regardless, we know the campaign is selling this, as Republicans coming together behind Trump. They want to sell this as Nikki Haley is done, she needs to drop out of the race. Kaitlan.",

He initially endorsed Governor DeSantis, last May, before DeSantis actually even got into the race. And yesterday, just moments after DeSantis dropped out, Congressman Bob Good tweeted, \"It is my privilege to provide my complete and total endorsement for Donald J. Trump as the 47th President of the United States.\" And Virginia congressman, Bob Good, is here. Congressman, thank you, for joining us, here on THE SOURCE, tonight. As I noted, you initially backed DeSantis, in this race. You had concerns about Trump's electability, in the general election. Now that you've endorsed Trump, do you still have those concerns, tonight? REP. BOB GOOD (R-VA): I think President Trump is going to win the nomination, as soon as tomorrow, as you noted. I think he's going to sail to the nomination. Republicans, across the country, and many independents, moderates, swing voters are rallying behind him. Everyone is worse off today than they were three years ago, when Joe Biden was president. President Trump gave us one of the strongest economies we've ever had. We had record low unemployment, record low inflation, record low interest rates, real wages rising. American was energy-independent, on its way to energy-dominance. We had the strongest military that was respected in the world, and no one wanted to challenge us. That's why we didn't get any conflicts, when he was president. And Americans are hungry for that again. I think they recognize how much we've suffered, under this president. They connect it to the terrible policies. And so, you're seeing Republicans, and many others, rallying behind President Trump. And I'm going to do everything I can, to make sure that he's elected.",

That's because the state and the national party are locked in a political civil war of sorts, after the Democratic National Committee booted New Hampshire, from its traditional first-in-the-nation primary spot, in favor of South Carolina. But New Hampshire is going ahead with its Democratic primary anyway. It's in the state's constitution that it must be held a week before any other contest. And President Biden has opted to keep his name off the ballot, there, leading his allies, in recent weeks, to mount a write-in campaign. The President himself pushed to make South Carolina, the first stop, on the Democratic nominating calendar. It, of course, is the state that propelled him, to the 2020 nomination, due, in large part, to the endorsement of my next guest, Congressman Jim Clyburn, who joins me now. Congressman, great to have you, you here tonight. I wonder, when you're looking at what tomorrow is going to look like, for Democrats, do you have any concerns for how it could go, for the President. Whether it could give, these long-shot competitors of his any kind of opening? REP. JIM CLYBURN (D-SC): Well, thank you very much for having me. Well, New Hampshire is kind of interesting, especially this year. Because, as you just mentioned, although President Biden will not be on the ballot, there is a pretty significant write-in taking place. And I applaud those Democrats up there, who decided to go forward, with this write-in, in order to demonstrate that they are a part of the National Democratic Party, and they are adhering to the rules and regulations of our party. And so, rather than to continue to lambaste the Rules Committee, these people, Annie Kuster and others, who I have great respect for, are running this write-in. And that's the way to do it. Now, I'll be interested in seeing how well that's done. But as you know, in South Carolina, we had a United States senator, Strom Thurmond, who won a seat in the Senate, by a write-in.

All of these things, make up a legislative -- legislative successes that's been unrivaled by anything. You have to go all the way back to Lyndon Johnson, and find anything close to it. The student loan debt, for instance. I've been amazed at the fact that this President has eliminated $137 billion in student loan debt. And we still hear people saying, he didn't keep his promise on student loan debt. My goodness, 3.7 million people have engaged in that.

And what I hear from Israeli officials is that they feel that in the last 10 days or so, every day that passes, they feel that there's more cautious optimism, that Hamas will abandon its maximalist position, of ending the war, releasing all prisoners, in Israeli prisons, giving full immunity, to Hamas leaders, and moving more, more and more towards the ability, to discuss the parameters Israel's laid out.",
