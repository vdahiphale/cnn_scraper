Police began tracking them at some point during the trip. The four students were stabbed to death in their beds in November. Now, Kohberger is charged with four counts of murder in the first degree as well as felony burglary. CNN's Jean Casarez is in Pennsylvania and Veronica Miracle is in Moscow, Idaho.

Nothing.But it's a long drive from Idaho, Washington, here to Pennsylvania, so common sense would say that sometimes it's better to have two people. But we do understand that his father flew to the West Coast, met his son to drive back with him. And according to his defense attorney, I understand that it was because it was the holidays. The doctoral courses, school was out and so he came home to be with his parents. But this is what we are understanding, what was driven from Washington to Pennsylvania was that Hyundai Electra (sic) and we are understanding that there was a stop in Pennsylvania, and we have this corroborated by two people and one said that they needed to get some work done on that car, which is an interesting little, small, alleged fact at this point that could become significant, right? And so, the work was being done and Brian was talking about his doctoral studies in criminal justice in Washington, that he had a master's degree in criminal justice from right here in Northeastern Pennsylvania. And we don't know what part of Pennsylvania this auto repair shop was, how far it was. Because Pennsylvania is a long state. But what we do know is that according to his attorney, he told me personally, that they got here about the 17 of December in that Hyundai, which is now with law enforcement here. It has been taken from the home. Of course, it is extremely important potential evidence in all of this. But with everything that's going on right now, this is something that just happened very quickly. And I asked his attorney when I spoke with him yesterday, what is Brian thinking right now as he sits by himself in the correctional facility.  Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Police say the unprovoked attack unfolded just after 10 o'clock outside a security screening zone set up for last night's festivities. The suspect was just 19 years old. Police say this is the weapon used to strike the officers. At least one suffering a skull fracture. The attack ended when one of the injured officers shot the suspect in the shoulder. Fortunately, all three injured officers were taken to the hospital and are now in stable condition. We are also learning about a shooting with multiple victims in Florida. Two people were killed, and four others injured at a shooting in Oscala (sic), just south of Gainesville, at around 4:30 am. Police say there was a loud - large crowd, about 100 people gathered at the time of the shooting. The two people killed were 30 and 24 years old.

And he accused the west of stirring up the conflict for its own gain. VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (translated):  The west lied about peace but was preparing for aggression.

      "sentences": "Yes, and we're not slighting anyone else. There's some Hall of Fame names we could mention, but time is limited, so we'll go with the following four. Bill Russell is perhaps the greatest winner in the history of American sports.At the University of San Francisco, his teams won two national titles. Then he was on the '56 Olympic team that won the gold medal. He played 13 seasons with the Celtics in the NBA and his team won the title 11 of those 13 years. He was also the first Black head coach or manager in the history of American team sports when Red Auerbach of the Celtics named him as the player-coach the last two years of his career. And he closed it out with a title. So, Bill Russell is a very significant figure. He was also front and center along with many other Black athletes during the 1960s and '70 as part of the Civil Rights movement. Seldom would we mention a broadcaster here, but Vin Scully's career was so great that I think we should mention him here. It wasn't just his talent, which was awesome. Even other broadcasters stood in awe of his command of the language and how he had a great sense of the pace and rhythm, especially of baseball. But the circumstances of his career, Paula, can never be duplicated. He starts as a 22-year-old in 1950 with the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Jackie Robinson Dodgers, the Boys of Summer Dodgers. One of the most celebrated teams in American sports history and then he goes west with them as the Los Angeles Dodgers. And during the bulk of his career, baseball truly is the national pastime. And radio is as important or more important for part of that time than television. And radio is really the broadcaster's greatest canvas. So, if a 22-year-old Vin Scully came along today he'd still be acclaimed, he'd wind up in every broadcasting hall of fame. But the circumstances of the career he had for 67 years, from 1950 through 2016, can never be duplicated. Franco Harris was to have been honored just this past weekend, Christmas weekend, on the 50th anniversary of the so-called Immaculate Reception. The NFL had set it up as a kind of reprise. It was the Raiders at the Steelers and only days before he suddenly passed away. Hall of Fame running back, wonderful person. Can't find a single person to say a bad word about him. And that play in 1972, where a desperation pass from Terry Bradshaw as deflected and Franco seemed to come out of nowhere and pluck it inches off the ground and run it in for a game-winning touchdown, that was voted as the most iconic play in the history of the National Football League and it was the beginning of the Steelers dynasty. They didn't win the Super Bowl that year, Don Shula's undefeated Dolphins eliminated them the next week. But that really set them on their way. And eventually, that great team coached by Chuck Noll, the steel curtain defense with Joe Greene and Jack Lambert and Mel Blount and the offense with Bradshaw and Franco Harris and Lynn Swann, they won four Super Bowls and one of the best-remembered teams in the history of the NFL. And then there is Pele passing away only recently. Winner of three World Cups with the Brazilian team. The originator of the bicycle kick. For a very long time, with the possible exception of Muhammad Ali, given soccer's worldwide popularity, not as popular plural (ph), gaining popularity. Not as popular in the United States as worldwide, but globally Pele may have been for a good part of his life the most acclaimed and beloved athlete in the world.",

People who are much more knowledgeable about soccer or football, as the rest of the world calls it, than I am tell me that it may well have been the best and most exciting final ever played. A lot of action. Goals scored. Near misses. Hold your breath, edge of your seat stuff. And in the end Lionel Messi finally gets his World Cup. He's one of the greatest players in history. He is in his mid- 30s. That might have been his last crack at it.So, Argentina walks off with the World Cup. Then there's Aaron judge's 62 homerun performance for the Yankees. Now statistically the record is 73. Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire have all hit more home runs in a season, came during the so-called steroid era, which is connected to the accomplishments of all three of them, unfortunately. But all three of them were National Leaguers. So, the record that Judge set was 62, is the Yankee record and it's the American League Record. And when you think about it, the only three guys who have hit 60 home runs in the American League, Ruth with 60, Roger Maris with 61 and Judge with 62, were all right fielders for the New York Yankees. And I should also throw this in here, Steph Curry, probably the greatest pure shooter in the history of the NBA, he and his Warriors won another NBA title, their fourth in eight seasons.",

The IOC, for whatever reasons, can go to Beijing twice, in 2008 and 2022, but the curtains been pulled back. People understand what's going on there. The Olympics were in Lochi, the Winter Olympics in 2014, and right under the noses of the IOC Putin's forces cheated. They had - the swapped-out urine samples, they routinely drugged their athletes going back decades and decades.Kamila Valieva in the most recent Winter Olympics, just a 15-year-old, at the mercy of her coaches and the Russian sports machine was found to have had illegal performance-enhancing drugs in her system. They're going to do what they're going to do. And when we talk about sportswashing, for example, that subject came up with the recent World Cup being in Qatar. And I think the best thing that fans can do is just watch these events for the sports performances, for the quality of the athletes, for the drama of the competition. But no one should be so naive as to believe that that actually washes away any of the realities about China or about Russia, or in this case, about Qatar and its oppression of human rights.",

The returns released by the House Ways and Means Committee spanned six years and show Trump claimed millions of dollars in losses during his presidency, and then he held foreign bank accounts while in office. CNN's Kristen Holmes has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Little or no income tax, foreign bank accounts and eyebrow-raising details about loans to his adult children, just some of the finings after the house ways and means committee released Trump's tax returns, spanning from the year Trump announced his first run for president 2015 through his last year in office, 2020.

And while Trump paid less than $1,000 in U.S. income tax in 2017, the former president's tax bill totaled nearly a million dollars in foreign taxes the same year, indicating notable business dealings in more than a dozen countries, including Azerbaijan, Turkey, China, Israel and Brazil, shedding light on where Trump's business interests were while he was in the White House. The returns also showed Trump maintains foreign bank accounts while serving in the White House, including in China.
