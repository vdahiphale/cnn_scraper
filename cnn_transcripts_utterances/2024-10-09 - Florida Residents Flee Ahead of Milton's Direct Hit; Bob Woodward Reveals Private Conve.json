In the latest update, Milton had weakened slightly, but is still at a rare category five strength.Landfall is expected late Wednesday or very early Thursday, potentially as a category three. But even if the winds decrease, Milton is expected to double in size, meaning the damage could be far more widespread. And here's what the traffic looked like on one of Florida's interstates just hours ago. Many people heeding the repeated calls from officials to get out while they still can. Statewide, about one in five gas stations are out of fuel due to the mass exodus, according to the tracking website GasBuddy. A major concern with Milton is all the debris still left behind by Hurricane Helene, which hit just two weeks ago. Many fear that debris could become dangerous projectiles when Milton's powerful winds come ashore. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You have to look at the entirety of it because it could go left or itcould go right. If you are on the right side of that cone, the right side of the eyewall landfall that's where the real problems will be with 10 to 15 feet of storm surge. If you're on the left side that number goes down dramatically. Still hurricane warnings though are in effect right now and we'll see 74 to 110 mile per hour winds all the way across the state and yes you see those category 3 or higher at least close for Fort Myers all the way to about I would say Tampa, Lakeland, will certainly see those type of winds and you will, without a doubt, lose power with that type of wind field. There goes the wind field for all the way off the East Coast and the heavy rainfall as well, probably somewhere between 8 and 12 inches of rainfall in places that could make freshwater flooding, without a doubt.
