Remember, the judge, in that case, lamented about the warning signs, and the missed opportunities they had, to prevent what their son did.

I can tell you, investigators from the inside have been very angry about some of the details they've been able to discover, over the last few hours. They've been working this non-stop.Look, we reported earlier that in a nearby county, Jackson County, that there was that report that happened, and investigators stopped by. At that point, Colin Gray, the father, indicated to investigators, yes, there were guns inside the house, but there was no unsupervised access to those guns. It's after that, that investigators tell us, that, apparently, for a holiday gift, this gun was purchased. And it's an AR-platform style weapon that was apparently broken down into a backpack, and then brought into the school. So, that is the big question now, because investigators are trying to figure out how did the gun make it into school. They're going through the video. They're searching exactly what happened. But I can tell you, they are so angry at the fact that this gun was only purchased just a few months ago. Jackson County Schools was put on alert. But he transferred to the Barrow County School System. Then there's that whole mix-up where, in terms of how many days did he actually attend school? We do know, on Tuesday, he reported that he had anxiety, went to the counselor's office. And then, of course, a couple days later, that fatal shooting that happened that has left this community torn apart. With all this happening, even right now, there are more than a dozen people standing, right behind me, at this memorial that has been gathering steam, throughout the day, because people have been arriving here non-stop, and reflecting about how much they love this school, and this community. People were shocked that the arrest happened so quickly. Now, what I want to tell you is, not only did the GBI not tell us, with the Sheriff, where was the father arrested? We spent time outside the home, today, talked to neighbors. Neighbors said they had just moved in, recently, because we know he transferred schools. We're still trying to find out those details, And when he'll have his first court appearance, is something that we're still tracking at this very hour. Kaitlan.",

But we have to remember that so far, with what little we know, about the information that police actually have, right now, it's hard to say whether or not this is a case that will stand up to the sort of legal scrutiny that we saw, in the Michigan case -- the Michigan case against the Crumbleys. You'll remember, Kaitlan, in that case, you had a situation, very rare situation, where the parents knew two things, right before the shooting took place. One, that their son had a weapon they provided to him. And two, that he was experiencing this mental distress in school and having these very violent writings and comments in his notebook. They were called into school, to address that. He actually had the gun in his backpack, during that meeting. So they knew that very close in time to when the shooting took place. So far, we don't have that same sort of temporal connection that we know of yet, between what the father knew, in the days and hours leading up to the shooting.

Remember Newport News, Virginia, the first grader, a 7-year-old went in and shot his teacher with a pistol. That mom was charged for not safeguarding that gun in a way that he couldn't get to it. So, this is going to become a recurring theme. And I believe that the charging of parents, with these extraordinarily serious charges? The convictions we saw with the Crumbley. The 21 months that the first grader's mom served for child endangerment. What we'll see in this case will start to send a warning to parents that this is not a joke about locking up these guns.",

These are charges that open up the possibility of convicting someone for engaging in reckless conduct or criminally negligent conduct. So, I'm not sure about why just those two.

They are just reaching millions and millions of people, every single day. Now, everybody, including the three gentlemen, you see there on screen, they say, they deny that they knew anything about this. Indeed, the DOJ makes clear that they seemingly were unwittingly co- opted here, as we have seen, in the past, in terms of unwitting co- opting Americans, kind of doing Russia's bidding, Moscow's bidding, for them, and they're sometimes referred to as useful idiots. But reading through this indictment, it does beg the question. Some of these guys were getting paid a lot of money. One person, who is not identified, we haven't tied the -- there's -- the commentator to name, but one U.S. commentator was getting paid about $5 million a year, just to make a few videos a month, for this operation.
