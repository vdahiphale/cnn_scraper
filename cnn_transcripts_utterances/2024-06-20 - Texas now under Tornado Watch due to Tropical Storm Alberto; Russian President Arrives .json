More than two million people in southern Texas are under a tornado watch right now due to Tropical Storm Alberto. The National Hurricane Center says Alberto has been strengthening and will continue to bring heavy rains, coastal flooding and gusty winds along the coast of Texas and northeastern Mexico through the day today. Flash flood warnings are also up in some areas. Mudslides are also possible, especially in higher terrains across northeastern Mexico. [03:05:05] The center of the storm is about 120 miles east, southeast of Tampico in Mexico, and is expected to make landfall near there in the coming hours. The winds have knocked out power to more than 10,000 customers in Texas. That's according to poweroutage.us. And storm surge combined with the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has issued a disaster declaration for 51 counties impacted by the tropical storm.

Mr. Putin is trying to dispel the perception that he's increasingly isolated by Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine.He's already met with the Vietnamese president and will speak with the prime minister and Communist Party chief in the hours ahead. The Russian leader has expressed his willingness to help Vietnam with its nuclear power program and increase tourism between the two countries.

So they may say a bit more, but I expect these reactions will be relatively bland along the lines of China welcomes to see Russia and North Korea develop neighborly, friendly, neighborly relationship because even some analysts in China have described this upgraded relationship between Pyongyang and Moscow as transactional with each side offering what the other desperately need.Now, China, at the end of day, feels very secure and confident about its own relationship with both North Korea and Russia because its role, it realizes, is simply indispensable in terms of propping up both economies. China, of course, has been providing North Korea with an economic lifeline for decades, and increasingly they've been doing this with the Russian economy, helping Moscow dodge severe Western sanctions by rapidly expanding its trade and investment relationship with Moscow. And a lot of language you heard in the past few days in Pyongyang also explains why the three leaders: Xi, Putin, and Kim, very much feeling bonded over their common shared grievance against the U.S. and its allies and these language about hegemonic power trying to suppress other countries' interests, very much reminding a lot of people of what you often hear here in Beijing as well. But China, of course, unlike Moscow and Pyongyang, is still very much part of the global trade system and they do still need Western investments and technologies, especially when they are facing economic headwinds. And Xi Jinping, also with his own political ambitions, potentially wanting to play a peacemaker in the war in Ukraine. So you're not going to hear China throw, quote unquote, \"full support\" publicly behind Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. At the end of the day, though, these tensions that have been building on the Korean peninsula with this tit-for-tat cycle, North Koreans testing more weapons while U.S. and its allies responding with bigger and bigger military exercises, not in the interest of China because everything's happening on its doorstep. That's why, interestingly, although Beijing insisted coincidentally, Chinese officials were actually in Seoul on Tuesday talking with their South Korean counterparts about improving diplomatic and security ties on the day when Putin was actually arriving in Pyongyang. So China definitely trying to strike a delicate balance here. Rosemary?",

If this military technical cooperation that President Putin spoke about involves getting more missiles, more ammunition for Ukraine, then obviously that is a big concern. And if Ukraine is going to continue, if North Korea is going to continue to send millions of rounds of ammunition to Russia as both the U.S. and South Korea believe they have already done, then that would exacerbate Ukraine's existing deficit on the front lines.Interestingly, Mikhail Podolyak, who's that advisor to President Zelenskyy, also criticized the U.N. for its, quote, \"silence on the issue of implementation of the sanctions that these weapons transfers would be in violation of.\" I think the unspoken here is that Russia, of course, wields a lot of power on the U.N. as a permanent member of the Security Council, something that now stands to benefit North Korea. But the other issue, I think, with this defense pact is that obviously this comes as the West, including the U.S., has lifted some restrictions on Ukraine using their weapons to hit across the border in Russia. There's a question over whether hitting over the border could be construed as an attack on Russia and therefore be used to justify North Korean help in Ukraine.

There is a heavy police presence here. I wanted to show you what's happening here.You see police in riot gear already. It's at least an hour and a half before the protests are officially supposed to begin. Back there you see water cannon tracks to disperse any protesters that make it this far. It will be unlikely they'll get this far to Kenya's National Assembly because of the heavy police presence around the capital here in Nairobi. This is a road that's usually accessible that goes right in front of Kenya's parliament. It's blocked on both sides. And you see police, other arms of security just out here waiting for any protesters to get this far. The right to protest is enshrined in Kenya's constitution as long as they are unarmed. Peaceably, they can present petitions to public authorities. But part of the criticism of Kenya's government is that they crack down often violently on any protesters who try to get this far, whether it's to the National Assembly or to any other kind of government buildings. And so the protesters have said they're coming back here to raise their voices against overtaxation. Some of that public protest already forced the government to reduce some of the more controversial elements in that proposed finance bill. The bill is under discussion right now inside Kenya's National Assembly. Members of the National Assembly are discussing some changes and proposals. They have a few more hours to make amendments to that before they vote on it this afternoon. But the voices they will be hearing from out here on the street will be telling them, we don't want any aspect of this. Since President Ruto came into government, he has been trying to generate more revenues internally to move the country away from debt. He says the right to protest is protected in Kenya. But these changes have to be made by institutions. And that's something that a lot of people are just not paying attention to. They feel that he's not listening to them. And one of the interesting things about these round of protests, often the political protests you see in Kenya have been by political parties, by the civil society groups. The protests we saw on Tuesday and yesterday are largely youth-driven. A lot of Gen Z's organizing on TikTok and other forms of social media and encouraging their peers to come out and have their voices heard.",

      "sentences": "History was made Wednesday night. 26 black veterans arrived in Washington, D.C. for the first ever Juneteenth Honor Flight. Juneteenth is a holiday which commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. And this time, the unsung heroes included a 101-year-old World War II veteran.CNN's Diane Gallagher was there to report on the emotional journey. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Celebration. Admiration.  Appreciation. All long overdue. And it coming on this day makes it that much sweeter for more than two dozen black veterans, including 101-year-old Calvin Kemp on board the first ever Juneteenth Honor Flight. From Atlanta to Washington, D.C. A well-earned, all-expenses-paid, jam-packed day of fanfare and camaraderie, visiting military memorials and monuments, but also confronting conflicting emotions about their own service and how a country they loved and fought for didn't always love them back. CALVIN GEORGE KEMP, 101-YEAR OLD WHO SERVED IN WORLD WAR II: I went in bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and got that Navy uniform on. I felt proud, and I was somebody. I felt like somebody. I felt very proud of representing my country. And then when I come back home, I couldn't go to school. I couldn't go in a place and buy a hamburger. I couldn't go in a motel. That broke me down. GALLAGHER (voice-over): Those feelings, shared by so many black veterans, are in part what inspired Honor Flight Network's board member, John W. McCaskill, to help push for a Juneteenth flight. JOHN W. MCCASKILL, HONOR FLIGHT NETWORK BOARD OF DIRECTORS: We want them to know that they're just as much a part of the fabric of this nation as anybody else who served. GALLAGHER (voice-over): Today, Kemp, a World War II veteran, had the honor of participating in the wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown. Kemp told CNN that respect was the last thing that he received in his service in a segregated U.S. Navy unit.",
