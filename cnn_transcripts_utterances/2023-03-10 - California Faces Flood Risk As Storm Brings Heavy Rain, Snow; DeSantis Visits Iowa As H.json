And as you can see, Dimir (PH) if you pull out, this place has been hit before hard. And very recently back in January, another one of these atmospheric rivers flooded neighborhoods around here. The people just recovering from that now getting hit again.Now, the river here has been dropping for the past couple of hours. But the fear is there is more to come because here's the thing, Victor, there has been a lot of snow falling on uplands. And the weather we're getting right now is a little bit warmer. So, we're going to get all this rain and the weather is going to melt some of that upland snow and all of that water is going to come down to places like Felton. Some of the numbers here we're talking about an inch of rain per hour in places, above 9000 feet. We're talking about another eight feet of snow is going to -- is going to fall. Now, here in Felton and other places, there were evacuation orders triggered just after midnight. We were on the road at the time. And the rain was unlike anything I've seen before outside of a hurricane. The windshield wipers just could not keep up. A lot of the roads, the road that we came in on has been closed because of slippers. We're hearing from people further inland who say that they haven't seen anything like this in 40 years. And the village of SoCal which is just down by Santa Cruz, we're going to head down there shortly, their main street has just been washed away. One of the residents there says we are now an island. So, right now, we are in a little bit of a lull in terms of rain. It's going to carry on but as you can tell, it's not that strong right now. But the problem is going to be the 11th atmospheric river of the winter is now forecast to hit Central California sometime early next week. These are these huge systems of low pressure from the north meeting moisture-laden air above Hawaii and basically aiming a fire hose at California. Listen. California needs water. The whole West needs water. We've been suffering from a drought. It would just help not to get all of this water in such a concentrated period of time, guys.",

So, prosecutors are looking at how the Trump Organization accounted for that in their books and records. So, they're looking at possible falsifying business record charge, which is a misdemeanor, or falsifying records in to -- in order to commit or conceal another crime. In this case, that could be campaign finance violations.Now, I mean, this is not an easy case. It's a novel legal theory and Trump's lawyers will certainly have a lot of defenses that they'll throw up at this. We spoke to one of the attorneys, Joe Tacopina. And in a statement, he said. The DA and the former DA have been scouring every aspect of President Trump's personal life and business affairs for years in search of a crime and needs to stop. This is simply not what our justice system is about. And as we know, Trump is facing a number of other legal challenges, other criminal investigations having to do with the 2020 election, both in Fulton County, Florida, and at the Justice Department level as well as the handling of classified documents. So, certainly, a lot coming to a head for the former president. This one looks like it could be the first move.",

So, any statement he made could be used against them. And number two, he can't control the questions that he's asked.

So, it would be maybe for probation or something like that.That's a lot of legal wrangling to go through for somebody that may never end up going to jail in the first place. So -- and then -- and if that doesn't happen, it's just a misdemeanor, which doesn't even carry less than a year in prison.

He testified under oath before Congress as to the facts of this -- of this case here. So, that itself is powerful evidence, it's under oath, it's sworn, and so on. The simple fact is he is a convicted felon based on honesty issues.And any defense attorney is going to hammer him and hammer prosecution here over the fact that the star witness has serious credibility issues. So, you know, when Kara mentioned earlier in the segment that they were bringing in a number of other witnesses and trying to get other evidence, I think that's to insulate around the fact that the evidence that you have and Michael Cohen just isn't that strong. He might be telling the truth but he's got credibility issues. And in court, all that matters is can a jury believes the evidences presented to them and when they have a witness who will himself admit on the stand that he's got a felony conviction. It's just harder to believe them in order to convict them.",

And so, I'm less sure that that's going to be the panacea she wants it to be. Overall, I'm not sure this issue is the one that's going to determine the outcome in the Republican primary.

This top adviser tells me that McConnell is doing quite well. In fact, he's lobbying staff to release -- hospital step to be released. He's getting quite impatient.I'm told he wants to get out of the hospital. He's acting normally, starting to get brief as a top adviser, Josh Holmes told me that. The first question that McConnell asked as he walked into the room was what -- did you meet with those candidates today? Referring to political candidates, Senate candidates, as Mitch McConnell, of course, tries to plot his could chart -- the party's path back to the Senate Majority. He also got a briefing about yesterday's Republican lunch in which he missed. He made a quip about missing the halibut that was served by -- for -- a courtesy of Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska saying I'm sorry, I missed the halibut. Now, I'm also told by a person familiar with the matter that there are no visible wounds from -- to the -- Mitch McConnell. He fell when he felt. He hit his head. He was taken to the hospital, but he is acting normally despite being treated for concussion. And this top adviser, Josh Holmes, told me that there was no question that Mitch McConnell will be able to continue to serve his term out as Republican leader. Of course, he's the longest-serving Republican leader in history, 81 years old, and has hit his head on that fall. But there's no doubt that he'll be continue -- be able to continue his role. So, positive news about McConnell on the health front from this top adviser saying that he expects to be out wants to get out soon, but at the moment expected to continue to remain at home -- in the hospital for observation. Releasing, potentially, we'll see in the next couple of days, guys.",
