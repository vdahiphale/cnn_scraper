Also about some COVID-era policies like vaccine mandates, travel restrictions, masking, and social distancing.Really though, folks expected going into this hearing today that it probably was going to be more political than really regulatory from a scientific perspective. And that's likely the takeaways that came from it. Dr. Fauci in his own opening statements anticipated that this would be the tenor of the hearing today, focusing in on an accusation that he says he heard that he influenced scientists by bribing them with government grants, which he called, quote, \"absolutely false\" and simply preposterous. He also talked about how he had kept an open mind about the origins of the virus, whether it leaked from a lab which was a theory that a lot of Republicans were talking about here at the hearing today, versus a natural spillover event from an animal, which a lot of people in the scientific community think is the likely route. He also was pressed a lot and addressed in his opening statements his relationship with a staff member at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, David Morens. He had the title of an adviser to the director. He said that instead this colleague's role really was to help him writing scientific papers, not to advise him on institute policies. Fauci was also asked a lot about his use of any personal e- mail to do government business. He said to the best of his knowledge he never did that. There was one exchange where Dr. Fauci actually got emotional. Whereas there had been a lot of previous heated exchanges with some congresspeople, Dr. Fauci got emotional when talking with Representative Debbie Dingell, who asked him about threats that had been made to his family.
