It had backers like NFL superstar quarterback Tom Brady, his soon-to-ex-wife supermodel, Gisele Bundchen, and tennis star, Naomi Osaka. But its value has not plummeted. Bankman-Fried's net worth, once over $15 billion, cratered to under $1 billion in a single day, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. The NBA's Miami Heat had its venue renamed as FTX Arena last year, but now that name is coming off the building. The meteoric collapse of FTX was triggered last week when serious questions were raised about the health of its finances. Those questions ignited a run on the bank-like crisis.",

You know, traditional assets have cash flow. You know, normal currencies are valued relative to one another. There's exchange rates that are determined based upon things like GDP growth in the two countries, inflation rates. That doesn't exist in cryptocurrency either.So, what you're left with is an asset class that trades entirely on sentiment. And as we've seen over the past couple of days, you know, sentiment can be extremely fickle. And so, long term, you know, cryptocurrency will not have value unless it provides genuine economic utility and we haven't seen that yet. So, that means that all of these cryptocurrency firms are resting on very shaky foundations. And so, you know, FTX, as shocking as it may seem, something like it was bound to happen. And we've already seen it happen over the past year. I mean, there's been a number of high- profile crypto failures, FTX being the latest.",

You know, we've seen of type of, you know, insider dealing like this in other instances and other cryptocurrency platforms, and it's very troubling because it potentially means that, you know, the thousands of consumers that are waiting to get their funds out of FTX, you know, that sort of hope is diminishing by the hour as they see these stories.

      "sentences": "Well, I think, you know, long term, actually, regulation would benefit cryptocurrency by allowing consumers to trust it. You know, the reason that the U.S. has, you know, the deepest and most liquid, you know, capital markets in the world is because they're regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors can invest confidently in the U.S. and in U.S. companies because they get access to information. You know, there's a court system if things go wrong.But again, none of that applies in cryptocurrency. And one of the more interesting things about, you know, the Sam Bankman-Fried saga is that he was a really vocal advocate for some forms of regulation and very active in D.C., meeting with regulators, meeting with folks on Capitol Hill. And so, I think anything that he was pushing for now, you know, people are going to take a step back and say, OK. Why was he, you know, wanting this specific piece of regulation, right? What was in it for him? What was in it for the crypto industry? So, he's toxic and anything he was touching is now toxic. And so, my hope is that, you know, policymakers keep two things in mind. One, obviously, is protecting investors and consumers. But two is, ensuring, you know, financial stability. There is a silver lining in all of this, Boris, and which is that FTX's problems and crypto's problems, more generally, haven't spilled into the traditional financial system and threatened financial stability. I think Brian mentioned this might be the Lehman moment for crypto and that's probably true, but it's not the Lehman moment for the rest of us. It's not the Lehman moment for the economy. I mean, the stock market did very well over the past week. You know, this is not going to move the needle at all on GDP. The average American is not going to feel that. So, this is a policy success that it hasn't threatened financial stability. And I worry that, you know, with some of the various regulatory proposals out there, you're -- you would see deepening connections between the traditional financial system and the crypto sector so that problems in crypto could potentially spill into the traditional financial system. And remember how upset everyone was and rightfully so about the bank bailouts in 2008?",
