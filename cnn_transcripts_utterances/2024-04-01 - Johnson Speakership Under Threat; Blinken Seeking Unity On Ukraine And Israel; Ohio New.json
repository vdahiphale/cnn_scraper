I'm Kasie Hunt.The House speaker, Mike Johnson, dismissing threats from inside his own party to try to oust him. Here's what Johnson said last night on Fox. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TREY GOWDY, FOX NEWS HOST, \"SUNDAY NIGHT IN AMERICA WITH TREY GOWDY\": How does this motion to vacate help win back the majority or win a bigger majority? REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  I don't think it does, and I think that all of my other Republican colleagues recognize this is a distraction from our mission. Again, the mission is to save the republic and the only way we can do that is if we grow the House majority, win the Senate, and win the White House. So we don't need any dissension right now.

That we've got to get into a fighting posture. And I was very pleased with how the speaker received that advice.\" Even if Gaetz is in his corner, Johnson will still have to navigate some nasty intraparty politics over Ukraine aid. Johnson telling Fox News he does expect to bring the aid package forward when Congress returns from recess. Joining me now to discuss all of this, Punchbowl News congressional reporter Mica Soellner, and Axios congressional reporter Stephen Neukam. Thank you guys both very much for being here. Good morning to you. Stephen, let me start with you on Majorie Taylor Greene and what's going on here.

She writes, quote, \"It's Uniparty Speaker Johnson, not conservative Speaker Johnson.\" She says, \"Look, kids, it's simple math. If Republicans keep leaving early we're going to lose the House. Under Speaker Johnson, George Santos was expelled and a Democrat won his seat. Gallagher is leaving.\" She referring to Mike Gallagher who is thought of as a promising young up-and-coming Republican. \"Leaving past the deadline for his district to hold a special election to replace him,\" which, of course, means that the majority is going to be even more narrow.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer gave that speech on the Senate floor calling for elections in Israel.

They've upped the age from -- the upper limit from 27 to 30, so that tells you they're throwing the net of conscription wider.It's kind of worth noting here that since the war began, Russia has conscripted more than half a million people into their fighting force. Now, they say these conscripts don't go in fighting Ukraine but I think what this tells you is that the Russians need to pull more troops into Ukraine because they're losing troops in Ukraine. And the conscripts will go and backfill around bases in other parts of the country and other functions that those more trained military personnel would be going to -- would be going to Ukraine to take up duties there.

This is why this all stood out to me. The Cleveland Plain Dealer decided they wanted to address this with their readers head-on over the weekend. The editor, Chris Quinn, writes this. \"The north star here is truth. We tell the truth, even when it offends some of the people who pay us for information. The truth is that Donald Trump undermined faith in our elections in his false bid to retain the presidency. He sparked an insurrection intended to overthrow our government and keep himself in power. No president in our history has done worse.\" And joining me now is Chris Quinn. He is the editor of The Plain Dealer and Cleveland.com. Chris, thank you so much for being here.

We don't want to lose empathy for those people. We don't want to not speak to those people. To be, you know, advocates and helpful in terms of providing those people with information.

I will just say I think that the decline in our local media has -- is a crisis for many, many reasons, but not least is that you, as a local paper, have a level of trust with people in your communities that is simply not possibly to establish when you are a national news organization. And I think that really comes through in this piece that you wrote.And you said -- another piece of this to your point of what the truth is, you said, \"Trust your eyes. Trump, on January 6, launched the most serious threat to our system of government since the Civil War. You know that. You saw it.\" And just before that you write, \"This is not subjective. We all saw it. Plenty of leaders today try to convince the masses we did not see what we saw but our eyes don't deceive us. And I think that this is the piece of it that gets me because I was there on that day and I looked out the window and I saw these people trying to attack the Capitol. And then, now, half of the -- these political leaders are trying to say no -- actually, that thing that you saw with your own eyes did not happen. Was it that that really was the thing that underscored this the most to you as well? QUINN:  Yeah. And look, it's heartbreaking what you're seeing today. I come from a state where we've had senators like George Voinovich and John Glenn -- people who would never have stood by during these recent years and allowed what's happened to happen. And today, we have J.D. Vance and we might have Bernie Moreno, whose claim to fame is they want to be puppets for Donald Trump. And it's not what we should be about. And that's why I referenced that New Yorker piece in what I wrote because the New Yorker had a book review that looked back and said the reason Hitler came to the fore wasn't because a bunch of people went and voted to have a fascist leader. It was because the people in government, in trying to get power for themselves, appeased him and that allowed him to rise. And that's what we have going on. Everybody knows what the truth is. The people in Congress were there. They were under threat from it. But for expedience, they are denying it happened.",

There aren't two sides to Donald Trump. Anybody who has been watching and trying to discern what the truth is here knows that this guy tried to destroy our entire system of government and will do so again. Somebody has to say it.
