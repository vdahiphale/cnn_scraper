So sometimes you may feel the pain from these sanctions, but everybody understands that today, you may be a fed this gas, and tomorrow you will be called because somebody some person may think why don't I take your territory, your business, your influence, create a party in your country, impose my own Prime Minister?

And this was a signal to us that the majority of countries in Europe believe in Ukraine's victory, and that means they believe in Moscow's defeat, that's the conclusion. And so, the main question is what will happen to Russia? Is that what you mean? To be honest, I don't care. To be honest, they have their own country, and they need to think about their own country. If they thought about their own country, there would be no war. If they thought about their own freedom of speech, democracy, economic reforms, their own people, poverty, slavery, they would have been a wealthy country because they have natural wealth. But that takes time to take some thinking, the way we are working with thinking. So, we don't have time to think about another country. We're thinking about ourselves, our survival, our fight, fighting COVID is like fighting COVID. Remember, that was a huge challenge for the world, when all reasonable countries thought what they could do for their societies, or they nobody thought what else they could do against somebody. So that is the question for Russia, for their history and their future. I'm not thinking that. And so, I want to say certainly there's a wrong, everybody's entitled to their view. I believe the elite's business, which absolutely, it has been absolutely fair to sanction, put sanctions against them the great business of the Russian Federation, the real estate abroad, the - everything. Of course, they don't like these very rich people, and their children were educated abroad. And that is their right. But now, they don't have it, they don't have this comfort. What do they have? They have what remains inside Russia. Do you think they will allow 2040 Russia's, do you think they will share their business? Do you think that when everything is blocked for them abroad? Absolutely fairly, I believe. Do you think they will not think how to keep this Capitol inside the country? Well, we think too much about others. I think they will sort it out among themselves. More pressure, more sanctions, more isolation for Russia and their elites, the more we do it, then the sooner will they start thinking what they ought to do inside their country so that new politicians can sit down.",

So, whether it's responding to the latest Chinese, so called peace proposals, him saying, reiterating that Ukraine has made its own series of plans for any future peace talks, the central elements of which would be withdrawal of all Russian forces from Ukrainian territory before any kind of peace talks could be committed to is, I think, a repeat of his position. I think one of the interesting things there was quite a broad hint about what he said he'd had some talks recently with the G7. And that, whilst he couldn't go public with everything that he had claimed that he got from that he was trailing and saying, well, there's going to be some good news in the near future. There's been a lot of this sort of hinting, coming from the Ukrainians, particularly when it comes to those strategic weapons that they've been asking for now. G7, of course, is a not a military alliance, it's an economic alliance. So perhaps he's talking there about a greater level of financial support. Because, of course, I've read recently in the local press here that, according to the government, the spending on the war is equal to the national budget of peacetime here in Ukraine. So, if that's the case, this is a country that desperately needs some external aid, no course has been getting a very substantial amount of aid from the EU and others. Notably, also, he reminded the Japanese that they were the only ones of the G7, who hadn't paid a government-to-government visit sort of pilgrimage, to Kyiv, but they're saying that the like the Japanese Prime Minister's direct approach, again, indicating a positive vibrations there. And this is all part of Zelenskyy's external sales pitch. He is a brilliant representative of Ukraine to the international community internally, he's not controversial, but he's not worshipped. He is not the figure that he is seen to be by the international community for the international community. And you and I know this from anecdotally from being asked, what's he like, you know, when we're outside of the country. You know, well, I mean, you know, he's doing a really good job, but internally, he's doesn't have universal support, but they do recognize in Ukraine that he's very, very good at selling the needs that Ukrainian faces externally. Internally, the focus is so much more directly on the war and tries to win it rather than any kind of cult of personality. And I have to say, that's not something that Zelenskyy has tried to build for himself, either.",

I think there was an answer to a journalist from Mexico, asking you a question. And indeed, he noted that he hadn't got the sort of support he might hope for from Africa, either. Fascinating, you make a very good point. And at the end of the day, many Ukrainians minded, not about, you know who, whether or not you know, this is a man who has sort of incredible statesman like sort of qualities with Ukraine's allies around the world. This is about what's going on, on the ground. A year in where are we at and what do you make of Zelenskyy suggesting today to the troops, at least this is a war that can be won this year in 2023.",

They're not even equal to the best of the Russian tanks. But they're important things to mention in terms of keeping the troops motivated that making sure that the troops on the ground know that they haven't been abandoned by the international community. So, when he's talking in that direction, of course, talking back in the other direction, he's saying to NATO and other allies in the west look, thanks so much for the leopard tanks, but we need these other bits of equipment too. And then we get these broad hints that maybe some good news is coming, possibly about jets, possibly about long-range artillery. They're also manufacturing their own longer-range artillery and drones to try to get in and reach behind the Russian lines and try to break the back of the logistic supply chain, because they've got to do that in order to win this war. But I think I mean, and I've spoken to a lot of military analysts, particularly Ukrainians and Ukrainian commanders. They do say that if they get the right weaponry, they could definitely win this war outright, inside a year, if they're given the right equipment. The subtext to that is they may not have very much longer in terms of the highly motivated personnel that they're still able to draw on because they are carrying very heavy losses. Now, that doesn't mean that they're going to collapse that they can be routed again, I think that that's close to impossible, even with a new Russian offensive that has been much promised than that we may be seeing the early stages of over the last few weeks, Becky. I don't think the Russians really have the motivation or even the power to punch through to reclaim the territories that they captured a little over a year ago, but they do have the potential to freeze the conflict here. And that from a Russian perspective would be a victory. This is what Ukraine is facing whenever they come under pressure to start talking peace or accept compromises if they allow. And this is the Ukrainian argument if they allow Russia to remain on Ukrainian territory. That means that Russia has an infinite infinity of time to try to continue to destabilize Ukraine to continue to destabilize her internal politics, prevent Ukraine from being a stable democracy, much less joining the European Union. And ultimately, that is success because it is a stable democratic pro- European Ukraine that is a personal existential threat, ultimately to one Vladimir Putin, Becky.",
