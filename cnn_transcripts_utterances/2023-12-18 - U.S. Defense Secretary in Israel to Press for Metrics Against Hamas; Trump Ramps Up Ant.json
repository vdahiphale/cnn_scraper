It is Monday, December 18th, it's 5Secretary Lloyd Austin's mission is to press Israeli officials on specific milestones for progress in Israel's war against Hamas, as civilian casualties climb. And here's Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen talking to \"ABC' this Sunday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD):  We do have unacceptably high levels of civilian casualties. We see very loose rules of engagement, way looser than anything the United States would exercise. We would not drop a 2,000-pound bomb on a refugee camp to target a Hamas commander.

We can see Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Defense Minister sitting alongside Secretary Austin right now in Tel Aviv, at the HaKirya; the Israeli Defense Ministry headquarters, which is where he went to straight from landing.So the U.S. has already articulated its concerns, as you mentioned, Secretary Austin will be wanting some real specifics on the milestones and the metrics of Israel's war against Hamas to date. And to get a sense, I suppose of when Israel feels that the job, this part of the job will be done, and it can move on to a somewhat less intensive phase of the war against Hamas. We'll also be pressing Israel to take more care about civilian casualties. One of the latest ones, an employee from the French consulate in Gaza was killed in an airstrike. That's according to the French Foreign Ministry, pressing Israel to take more care as far as civilians are concerned and pushing to get more humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip as well. Kerem Shalom, the Israeli crossing into Gaza was opened for aid to go directly from Israel into the Gaza Strip on Sunday. That will be seen as a step in the right direction, but still falling far short of what is required in Gaza where the amount of aid going in is about half of what it was before October the 7th. Obviously, the humanitarian situation much more dire right now. They'll also talk about regional issue, such as security for shipping in the Red Sea where shipping has come under attack from Iranian- backed Houthi rebels in Yemen looking to do what they can, not just to prevent any kind of blockade on shipping bound for Israel or related to Israel, but globally as well, to keep those shipping lanes open. That is one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. To make sure there's no impact on global trade or on the global economy. John?",

Back-to-back protests, rallies, marches on Friday and Saturday night. CNN spoke with a number of the relatives of the hostages who say that now the Netanyahu government needs to put a plan on the table to get those hostages back. They say they're also worried about the safety of the hostages, and that in the past, the bombings and the assaults by Israeli forces on Hamas militants have come dangerously close to those hostages. At the same time, Prime Minister Netanyahu is insisting that it is the military pressure on Hamas that will get the militant group to come back to the negotiating table and release more hostages. Here's a little bit more of what he had to say on Saturday night. Take a listen. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator): Without the military pressure, we would not have succeeded in creating an outline that led to the release of 110 hostages. And only continued military pressure will lead to the releases of all of our hostages. My directive to the negotiating team is based on this pressure, without which we would have nothing.",
