But Yair Lapid urges patience until all the votes are counted. We're live in Jerusalem. And how Iranian missiles could change the dynamic on the battlefield in Ukraine. We'll be live in Kyiv. Well, South Korean officials say they fired three air-to-surface missiles in response to a series of North Korean missile launches just hours earlier. The military says it carried out precision strikes targeting the international waters south of the de facto into Korean maritime border. Early Wednesday, Pyongyang launched 10 missiles of various types, including three ballistic missiles. The South Korean president called the launches effective territorial encroachment. The launches follow warnings from Pyongyang on Monday for the U.S. and South Korea to stop their large-scale joint military operations which began this week. For more on these latest developments, I'm joined by CNN's Will Ripley in Seoul for us. Will, this is certainly a much more defensive response from South Korea than what we've seen in the.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And, and a far more offensive response, sort of offensive provocation, I should say, Anna, than we've seen in quite a while. It's been at least, several months since North Korea has launched this many missiles in a single day.Back in June, they launched eight in one day. Today, 10 various types of missiles, as you mentioned, including ballistic missiles. The 29th launch event of this year. It is truly an unprecedented blitz, a missile testing binge, if you will, by North Korean leader Kim Jong- un. South Korea's Ministry of National Defense says that these missiles were fired from both the east and the west coast of North Korea, including the coastal city of Wonsan, a place that I visited five years ago. A place where also Kim Jong-un happens to have one of his luxury palaces right along the seaside. These missiles, according to the Japanese, some of them had, what they're calling an irregular trajectory, which indicates that they might be the kind that can change course mid-flight and make them particularly difficult, if not impossible to shoot down. This is the first time also that some of these missiles have crossed since, if I should say the first time since the division of the Korean Peninsula, these missiles went south of what's known as the northern limit line. That's the de facto maritime border between the North and South. And so, in response, South Korea and the United States conducted a precision strike bombing exercise using fighter jets. And they fired surface to, or I should say, air-to-surface missiles to the north of that de facto maritime border. The joint chiefs of staff says that North Korea is the one that's provoking them, they say, North Korea is fully responsible for all of this. But they have a different view in the north of course. The North is angry and they've been issuing warnings in recent days about Operation Vigilant Storm, which is a five-day military exercise between South Korea and the United States involving 240 aircraft, thousands of service members from both South Korea and the U.S. The North has called this in recent days an invasion rehearsal, and they have threatened that the United States and South Korea will pay a terrible price if they do try to attack in the north towards North Korea. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the North, said that there will be even more powerful follow up measures to come if these military exercises continue. So, this could be a very tense several days here in the region, Anna. Of course, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog group has been warning since last week that there could be a nuclear test on the horizon, but the fact that you have these missiles actually cross into, you know, very near South Korea's territorial waters, triggering air grade sirens, in some of the islands off of the Korean peninsula. It is just truly an extraordinary day. And tomorrow, on Thursday, the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the South Korean Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup will be meeting at the Pentagon in the U.S. So certainly, they will have quite a lot to talk about, Anna.",

And on the other side of the ledger, the anti-Netanyahu forces, the anti-Netanyahu camp, seems to be in major trouble with at least several left-wing and Arab parties dangerously closed to the electoral threshold, so they might not even make it into the next Israeli parliament, thereby potentially increasing Netanyahu's parliamentary majority and paving its way, as you've said, to a likely comeback as the exit polls predicted.",

Revoking citizenship, for those Arab Israelis deemed to be disloyal or perhaps meddling in terrorism, and so on and so forth.

Kherson was taken on the seventh day of the invasion.

Many thanks to you both.Well, Vladimir Putin's unprovoked war on Ukraine has faced strong criticism from some prominent Russians. And now, one billionaire says he's renouncing his Russian citizenship in protest. CNN's Matthew Chance has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He's one of the most high-profile richest Russians to publicly condemn the Ukraine war. The billionaire who founded the Tinkoff Bank, one of Russia's biggest lenders now renouncing his Russian citizenship. A major slap to the Kremlin's face. He's even posted the termination document online along with scathing criticism of the Russian state. I can't and won't be associated with a fascist country, Tinkoff wrote on his Instagram page, a country that started a war with that peaceful nation. He went even further calling on other wealthy Russians to also leave the country behind. I hope more prominent Russian businessmen will follow me, Tinkov writes, so it weakens Putin's regime and his economy and puts him eventually towards defeat. The post was quickly deleted, which Tinkov blames on Kremlin trolls. It's not the first time Tinkov has publicly criticized Putin and his Ukrainian conflict. But these almost daily scenes of violence and its horrors seem to have galvanized the billionaire. Back in May Tinkov who is suffering from cancer spoke of how his own fight for survival made it impossible to stay silent in the face of so much killing. OLEG TINKOV, FOUNDER, TINKOFF BANK (through translator):  You see kids, women, people dying for nothing, being murdered by someone. I mean, the Russian army is killing them for nothing. You can die from cancer, but why should you die from a bomb just because you live in Ukraine? This is messed up, especially in the 21st century.",

The theme has really been this defiance and determination by the protesters that we have seen now for nearly seven weeks. I mean, the government has tried all the tactics that it's used in the past to crush protests, and that doesn't seem to be working.We have seen that brutal crackdown on the streets, the beatings, the use of live ammunition according to human rights organization, the arrests of hundreds and hundreds of people across the country, if not thousands. And the horrors that take place behind closed doors at detention facilities according to human rights organizations and protesters who we have spoken to. And then you have that real severe warning. Probably the most severe warning we have had to date. Coming from the hand of the feared and powerful revolutionary guard corps over the weekend, telling protesters that Saturday was their last day of protest, that they shouldn't come back out onto the streets. And many people took that to mean that a harsher and possibly bloodier crackdown might be coming. And the response from the streets, the response from these protestors has been more protests. We have seen university students taking -- staging protests on university campuses across the country over the past couple of days. And also, you know, this is also happening as these trials, Anna, are taking place. They began over the weekend, public, trials and revolutionary courts according to Iranian state media. And we expect that many of those on trial will be possibly facing the death penalty when you look at the charges that be -- are being brought against them in court. All of that doesn't seem to be deterring these protestors as we enter the seventh week of protests right now, the government is really struggling to contain what has become a national uprising calling for regime change, Anna.",

The decision comes as the United Kingdom is battling the worst bird flu outbreak in its history.There have been 85 confirmed cases of the H5N1 bird flu strain in England since the beginning of October, and 219 cases of H5N1 in England since the start of the outbreak a year. Meanwhile, in the United States, avian influenza was first detected in February, and poultry outbreaks have been reported in 43 states. There has been only one human case in the entire country. More bird flu cases have also been reported in Mexico, as well as in several European countries. Well, Dr. Scott Miscovich is the president and CEO of Premier Medical Group USA. He joins us now from Kalua, Hawaii. Doctor, great to see you and have you with us. Tell us about bird flu and what risks it poses to humans. SCOTT MISCOVICH, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, PREMIER MEDICAL GROUP USA:  Well, bird flu and is an influenza A, and that's the family that it's in. Interestingly, as everyone knows right now, we're also in the middle of flu season in the Northern Hemisphere, which also happens to be in the family of influenza A. So, in general, it's a flu. Now is it a risk to humans? Fortunately, as you've just mentioned, there has been one case very early on in the United States, one I think in a duck keeper in the U.K. back around January, and they all did fine. So, it's a very, very low risk to humans right now from where it stands. And you know, the people that are -- that are concerned should be people working in the poultry industry. But nowadays, since we have people that are, you know, keeping their own chickens and their own birds in their home across the world for eggs and for other reasons. You know, that's the simple risk that we have that it could be there now. How would you know if you had bird flu? Well, unfortunately, you're going to have to get tested because basically it presents just like the flu, you know, with the cough and sore throat and the achiness, et cetera. And guess what? Also, presents like that, of course it's COVID. So, it's a challenge -- it's a challenging thing when it comes to a diagnosis. And fortunately, it is treatable at this stage with the simple same medicines we use for flu like Tamiflu. So, it's a very low risk. It's, you know, prevention is the droppings and that, you know, don't touch a dead bird or that type of thing. But it's mostly through droppings and then through oral with maybe some aerosol inhalation around those droppings. But it is very preventable, very low risk right now.",

And yet we now have the BQ. 1.1 even developing, and they're all kind of taking that route that we've watched the COVID take, which is it finds a way to escape the immunity that we are presenting, and that's what she discussed today.And what does concern us is that they show more what we call immune escape from our vaccinations. And you know, we're seeing about eight of those spike proteins that are changing now in the most advanced variants, which makes it challenging. And the big problem that she brought up also today is like, for example, a medicine called Evusheld that we have been prescribing to our like long-term chemotherapy and immunosuppress people where they can get a shot and then have a good three to six month shield around them of protection. It's breaking through that. Also, some of those monoclonal antibodies that you could go in and get via IV or injection. It's also not responding to those. [03:49:57] But there is still Paxlovid. That's the pill that allows us to give it to a patient when they at first have signs of COVID. So, her warning today was, please, don't, you know, don't stay at home if you are at risk, seek out treatment because we still have the pills that are very effective. And we are coming up Anna, right now to a cold and flu season. That will include another spread in peak of COVID. No doubt about it.",

You know that waning immunity.And the good news out of the new Bivalent booster is there's a really nice antibody surge that will really give you that four month or so, really strong protection. And I would recommend it to everyone because look at where we are right now. We just started November. We're really looking that the holiday get togethers are really, probably going to happen. I don't think there's any chance that that will not occur, and that's when this spread will occur. And so, if you would be going and seeking your booster right now, you're going to have a nice protection when you get with loved ones over the holiday, and I would highly advise it to give us that window in through that, you know, hopefully February, March, April window when this should all then be dropping off.",
