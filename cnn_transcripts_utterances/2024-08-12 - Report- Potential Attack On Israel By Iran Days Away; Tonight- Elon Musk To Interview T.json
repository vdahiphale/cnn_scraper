      "sentences": "Yeah, good morning, Kasie.So USA Gymnastics says they are going to appeal the decision to strip gymnast Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal. So to give you a little background, Chiles originally placed fifth in the floor exercise last week before Team USA challenged the result, arguing one of the elements of her routine was not properly scored. That challenge was successful. They gave Chiles an extra .1, which moved her ahead of Romania's Ana Barbosu into third. But then on Saturday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that the USA's challenge came four seconds after the one-minute deadline and therefore, does not count. Now, USA Gymnastics, though, says that it has new video evidence showing that the inquiry was submitted before that one-minute deadline was up and they have requested to reinstate Chiles' score and allow her to keep that bronze medal. We'll just have to wait and see how this controversy plays itself out. Now, the U.S. Women's Basketball Team, meanwhile -- they get gold again, but it was not easy against host France. The U.S. was down 10 in the third, but they rallied to take the lead by 21 points from A'Ja Wilson. Then France was down three in the final seconds of this game. Gabby Williams shot banks in, but her foot was on the line. The U.S. wins 67-66 to capture a record eighth-straight gold. It's their 61st-straight win at the Olympics. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BREANNA STEWART, 3-TIME OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST:  We've all taken time away from our teams to do something really, really hard. And the fact that this is eight-straight golds is insane, honestly, but each one is so, so different and so, so special, and so hard. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "And Team USA's basketball gold there sealed a tie with China atop the gold medal standings with 40 apiece. It's the first time in Summer Olympics history that the gold medal count finished in a tie. But the Americans certainly ran away with the total medal count with 126. It's the most since the 2016 Rio Games where the final tally was 121 for Team USA. China finished well behind in second overall with 91.Host nation France -- they finished with 64 total medals. That was their best Summer Olympics performance since they first hosted the Games back in 1900. All right. So now the Summer Games is going to move to Los Angeles for 2028. And Tom Cruise -- well, he helped deliver the Olympic flag and jumped into the stadium as only Tom Cruise can. Then he took the flag from Simone Biles, hopped on a motorcycle, and then the broadcast cut to a prerecorded video of Cruise combing the Olympic rings and the Hollywood sign, which certainly looks pretty cool. Let's see if they end up doing that in four years there, Kasie. But I'll tell you what, it kind of -- it's always kind of a sad day, right, when the -- when the Summer Olympics is over. You know, it was a fun two weeks watching all the competition. What was your favorite out of all of them?",
