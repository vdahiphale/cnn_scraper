Number one, they are going to allow proposed work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries to be implemented on a faster timetable. That was an ask by Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz. The other change that leadership says they would not repeal some of those biofuel tax credits that had caused major heartburn for midwestern Republicans who were in and out of McCarthy's office yesterday. House Speaker McCarthy is facing new urgency in the standoff with the White House over raising the debt limit. It's growing more likely that the government could default as soon as early June if Congress does not act. Of course, we have talked about that could lead to an economic disaster.So for more on that we want to bring in Christine Romans. Of course, McCarthy is saying he is not going to change his plan. He changed it overnight. The Senate has said this is dead on arrival, but it's still important because House Republicans will still have to vote on it.",

So these were things that really he had to do to get all the numbers onboard.But that's the political football that the debt ceiling has become here. The loser in the football game is the American people and American living standards, right. This is what we know we are facing, and we are facing this a lot sooner than we thought. Tax receipts are down something 35 percent from the same time last year. That means less money is coming in in the tax season. That money is being used to pay the bills because after January 19th we couldn't borrow any more money. So this is really incredibly important.",

And we have to get the point in America that people go to work, have that pride that you get from going out there and producing and bringing home, and that has to be a part of it. So we've talked about that at length.Everything else that's on the table, you talked about growing the economy, that has to happen. You can't grow the economy with the Inflation Reduction Act in place destroying American energy policy and making energy more expensive for Americans. That can't be something that takes place. And you talked about lower tax receipts. That's a part of this conversation as well, because what we're talking about dealing with, if there is lower tax receipts, we should really be paying attention to where Americans' tax dollars are going. And it's not even redistribution of wealth. It's redistribution of anybody that's paying taxes, whether it's what's going on with the tax you are going to be charged because you have a good credit score with a mortgage or paying somebody else's student loan. Those are the things that we have on the table to say let's axe those bad policies for America. Let's grow the economy. Let's claw back dollars. That makes sense to most people I talk to.",

This is the first time that the two leaders have talked since Russia invaded Ukraine. Zelenskyy said in a statement about the call, it was a long and meaningful conversation. Last month Xi Jinping visited Russian President Vladimir Russian for talks where the two leaders posed as peace brokers for Russia's own invasion of Ukraine.

But China's view of being a peace broker up until now has meant parroting Vladimir Putin's position. So right now, unless something changed on that phone call, there is no real way for China to show that it is an honest broker and not just carrying water for President Putin. But this is a problem because some other democratic leaders such as President Lula, leftwing, China obviously is its own autocratic camp.

How unusual of a move this is for the Attorney General and Oklahoma Republican to sit at the table at this clemency hearing. It just doesn't happen, he usually would send a deputy, but this just shows how much Gentner Drummond really believes that Richard Glossip who is, like Kaitlan said, scheduled to be executed just three weeks from now. That he should get at least a new hearing, with new evidence in this case.Of course, he signaled toward that just a couple of weeks ago when he urged the justices in the criminal court of appeals in Oklahoma to take another look at this case and bring this case back to a lower court. And those justices though in a five zero decision decided that the death penalty the execution should continue forward. So, I want to -- just read from what he said to the parole board in his statement. Gentner Drummond said, \"In every previous case that has come before this board, the state has maintained full confidence in the integrity of the conviction. That is simply not the case in this matter due to the material evidence that was not disclosed to the jury.\" Now, even if the clemency board decides to get or the parole board decides to give clemency. To Glossip this is not the end of the road is going to be up to the Governor to then decide if he will grant that clemency. And that's a decision he does not need to make anytime soon but certainly will have eyes on this hearing today. There will be a decision by this board about whether or not to give Glossip clemency today. And, of course, this has star power, Poppy, you talk to Kim Kardashian about this. Certainly, there are a lot of eyes now, especially with Kim tweeting this talking about it yesterday with you. She's the only one Richard Vance Branson has ever been behind this, Susan Sarandon.
