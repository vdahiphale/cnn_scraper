The deadly wildfires devastating the Hawaiian island of Maui, it's now killed at least 36 people. The bodies discovered in the ruins of the raging inferno. Officials held a news conference, just a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJOR GEN. KENNETH S. HARA, ADJUTANT GENERAL, HAWAII STATE DEPT. OF DEFENSE:  The primary focus is to save lives and to prevent human suffering and to mitigate great property loss. So that is exactly what counties were and have been doing and are doing. What we do anticipate is additional request we're already providing support for trying to get the communications back up, water distribution. We're hearing that Maui may need additional law enforcement support. So, that may be both for federal law enforcement and state law enforcement working through that. LT. GOV. SYLVIA LUKE, HAWAII:  The damage to the infrastructure is not just buildings. I mean, these were small businesses that invested in Maui. These are local residents and we need to figure out a way to help a lot of people in the next several years. School has destroyed many of the businesses, our church was destroyed. It is going to take years. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's a very rare, unfortunate, perfect scenario if you will that setup around Maui, with two different systems that influenced those winds and we'll get to those.Of course, Tuesday night, these were the pictures that we saw. We originally thought it was just trees burning for the most part. And then with the light of day, we saw that it was actually Lahaina that was burning. And you can see the hot spot right here. This is higher terrain across the central portions of Maui and then those fires just raced down towards the coast, impacting historical Lahaina. And we had wind gusts up to 82 miles per hour for the most part mid east in mid 60s is what we saw for the win. So that just because those wildfires to spread rapidly. So, as you mentioned, we had category four storm Dora to the south. We also had an area of high pressure to the north. So these, they were working together to basically funnel very strong winds in between this high and in between the low. And so that's what caused these wins to just blow out of control. The high pressure is normal. This is what causes the breeze, the trade winds across Hawaii. The storm to the south was not normal. So when you have these two together, that is what created this scenario. So Dora has pushed away, the winds are starting to weaken and so they will steadily decrease as we go forward in time. We have drought across portions of Hawaii. Maui is seeing the most extreme drought, which is actually just moderate drought but it's enough to dry out the grasses and create fuels fire, especially when you have the winds that we saw. So, Lahaina, 20 to 25 miles per hour winds. This is basically right now, we'll see those winds drop steadily throughout the afternoon. And then by the time when we get into tomorrow, the winds will die down even more. It's Hawaii. You're not going to have zero winds but you will have about 10 to 15 miles per hour wind which is definitely normal across the island chain. So, we're going to continue to see breezy conditions however those should improve but again the damages has already been. Then you have seen that from the pictures.",

Several vehicles were hit by the bullets, including Fernando Villavicencio, a 50-year-old activist, journalist, and politician who is running in Ecuador's presidential elections to be held in less than two weeks on August 20th.As Villavicencio gets in the backseat of the vehicle, at least 12 gunshots can be heard. A policeman quickly closes the door behind Villavicencio, and many people are seeing taking cover from the gunfire including his security detail. Current Ecuadorian president, Guillermo Lasso, later said on social media that he is outraged and shocked. He called the attack an assassination. Lasso also expressed solidarity and sent his condolences to Villavicencio's wife and daughters. He also about that this crime will not go unpunished. Lasso acknowledge that organized crime has gone a long way in this country, but at the same, time he promised that the full weight of the law will fall on them, meaning the criminals. In an interview with CNN in Espanol back in May, Villavicencio said that drug traffickers had already made themselves at home in Ecuador, polluting the entire nation is at least 2007, and calling his own country, a narco state run by a political mafia.

As you say, President Biden, he signed this executive order banning the new American investments and keep technology industries in China, here in Hong Kong and Macau. They could be used to enhance Beijing's military capabilities.This was long expected. China knew about it, but now we go, we've got the details, and they will target three sectors, semiconductors and micro electronics of quantum information technologies and certain artificial intelligence systems. This means that U.S. private equity, venture capital, joint ventures and green field investments will not be allowed to invest and help Chinese companies develop technologies. It could support its military modernization and undermine U.S. national security. We have heard from the Treasury Department. They released this statement. It said: The Biden administration is committed to keeping America safe and defending America's national security through appropriately protecting technologies that are critical to the next generation of military innovation. A U.S. official, Rahel, stressed that this was national security action, not an economic one but China's not buying it. You know, we've had that very strong reaction from Beijing. It believes that the U.S. is trying to contain its rise. We've heard from the Chinese commerce ministry saying that it was briefly concerned, while the foreign ministry released a statement. It said that it's a blatant act of economic coercion and scientific technological bullying. The real purpose is to deprive China of its right to development and safeguard its own hegemonic interest. Now, this comes as tensions between the U.S. and China are the most strained in decades. There's been a parade of top U.S. administration officials, recently visit Beijing, Antony Blinken, Janet Yellen, and John Kerry in an attempt to get the U.S. and China's back on track.

And we have not seen as many attacks in the western region as another part of Ukraine closer to the frontline, and look at the scale of it, I don't know if we can show you. There's some video of the regional chief standing in front of a huge blaze there, but they're saying it was pretty big, some 45 rescuers involved in putting it out. There he is. And the oil depot fully destroyed. Now, this comes as Russia is also saying that it was the victim of some attempted drone attacks. It's accusing Ukraine of perpetrating. Two, it says, were shut down on route to Moscow. And another two shot down heading for the Crimean Black Sea port city of Sevastopol, and Russia saying that it also managed to thwart another nine drones using electronic warfare, which apparently crashed into the Black Sea. Now, we can't verify this and Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for these latest attacks but they are happening with increasing regularity. They're not particularly destructive. We're not hearing any reports of damage or injuries this morning, but I think that given the comments that we've had around this from Ukrainian officials, they are designed to send a message to the Russian people that this war is not confined to the Ukrainian territory.
