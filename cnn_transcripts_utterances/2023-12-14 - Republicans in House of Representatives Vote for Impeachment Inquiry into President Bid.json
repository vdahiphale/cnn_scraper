We were able to travel inside with some medical volunteers who are working at a newly established, newly built field hospital that has been set up by the United Arab Emirates in the southern part of Gaza. As you know, the southern part of Gaza is now very much the focus of Israel's military operations. That is exacerbating an already dire humanitarian catastrophe and leading to record numbers of civilian casualties as we saw for ourselves.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) WARD (voice over):  You don't have to search for tragedy in Gaza. It finds you on every street, strewn with trash and stagnant water, desolate and foreboding. WARD (on camera):  So we have just crossed the border into southern Gaza. This is the first time we have actually been able to get into Gaza since October 7th, and we are now driving to a field hospital that has been set up by the UAE. WARD (voice over):  Up until now, Israel and Egypt have made access for international journalists next to impossible. And you can see why. WARD (on camera):  Since October 7th the Israeli military says it has hit Gaza with more than 22,000 strikes. That, by far, surpasses anything we've seen in modern warfare in terms of intensity and voracity. And we really, honestly are just getting a glimpse of it here. WARD (voice over):  Despite Israel's heavy bombardment, there are people out on streets. A crowd outside a bakery. Where else can they go? Nowhere is safe in Gaza. DR.

Since the field hospital opened less than two weeks ago, it has been inundated with patients, 130 of their 150 beds are already full. WARD (on camera):  So let me understand this. You are now basically the only hospital around that still has some beds? AL-NAQBI:  I guess so, yes. Or maybe I am very sure of that because they are telling me one of the hospitals in a city of 200, they are accommodating 1,000 right now. And the next door hospital, I am not very sure, they say 5,200, maybe 400 to 500 patients. So he called me, he said they have three patients in each bed. Please take in any.

They are literally being told to move from the north as the north gets bombed. They move to the south, then the south gets bombed. Now they are expected to move to a different area in central Gaza.And let's be very clear. It is not easy to move around right now in Gaza. We saw almost no cars on the streets. People do not have fuel. People are afraid to try to make road runs because of the risk that that incurs. And so, of course you are seeing a horrific impact not just in terms of the civilian casualties that we talked about, but in terms of the humanitarian crisis. You're talking about malnutrition. You are talking about the spread of preventable diseases. We talked to the doctors who said that they are treating cases of sepsis and patients are nearly dying where these should be straightforward operations that can't be performed. They describe one incident where a man had worms in a wound on his head because there is such a lack of sanitary -- any sanitary environment in which to perform surgeries or operations. So this is a crisis of epic proportions, and the fact that humanitarian aid workers do not have the access that they need just makes it all the more staggering. One extra point that I really need to make here, Phil, because I think it's important. This was our first time being able to gain access into Gaza. But the journalists in Gaza have been doing heroic, extraordinary work day in, day out, at enormous risk. They have paid such a high price for that. This is the deadliest conflict for journalists that we have seen in decades. More than 60 journalists in Gaza alone have been killed in the last two-and-a-half months. That is according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. So you have a perfect storm here with massive bombardment, an inability to create safe zones, an inability to get humanitarian access where it's needed, and incredibly brave journalists who are doing everything they can to tell the stories and bring the reality to the world. But the frustration of international journalists who can't get in to try to compliment and supplement their efforts.",

So, it's not like they're only calling on the Israelis to take action, but the Americans have not done that, they have given the Israeli government room to run in going after and destroying Hamas for months now. They've been told in return, we've learned lessons, we went too hard. We were too indiscriminate in our bombings in the north. Netanyahu saying that directly to the Biden administration, but that has not led to a significant shift in strategy on the ground, nor significant reduction of Palestinian civilian casualties.

I mean, these are some of the most, you know, progressive Israelis out there. There is a very strong view among the Israeli people that number one, no one on the global stage really cares for them, even after the most unspeakable violence against the Jews, so they have to go and keep going. But that's very different from the way that they engage in the war fighting, that's also very different to, you know, the fact that there isn't an urgency of timing here. Israel is vastly more powerful than Hamas, vastly more powerful than Hezbollah, than militarily, right, then their enemies in the region. And so their ability to -- I mean, they could come out and say, let all of the hostages go, and we can talk about a ceasefire. They've been unwilling to do that, even though the hostages are not about to be all freed. Why not take that position? Why not have more international support? In the early days after the terrorist attacks, Macron came to Israel and said, We are with you. We see this as a fight just as it was against ISIS, against al-Qaeda, we'll join you in this fight. Why couldn't there have been an effort, multilateralism, like the Americans did with NATO friends, after the invasion of Ukraine, because Netanyahu has been driving this by himself and feels like he can get away with it. That is a problem, right? And ultimately, that's where the Biden administration is getting itself in trouble because the US is now more isolated globally on this issue, and increasingly divisive challenges on the ground at home than the Russians were when they invaded Ukraine a couple of years ago.
