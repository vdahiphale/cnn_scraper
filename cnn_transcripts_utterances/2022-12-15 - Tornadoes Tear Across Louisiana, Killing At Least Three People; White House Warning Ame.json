This used to be a church. And you can see that this tornado came through, busting pipes, water pouring out of the building, portions of the roof ripped off. The damage here in this community was extensive. We went into the neighborhoods yesterday to speak to residents. And despite this extensive damage, we're told by the authorities here, locally, that there was no loss of life. But many of these residents were just caught off guard by the outbreak of these tornados, which is a really rare event for this time of year. One of the residents I spoke to said that the tornado lasted about 10 to 15 seconds. By the time she realized that she had to go to the basement to take cover, she said the storm had basically passed. Another resident I spoke to said that her week-and-a-half old brother was asleep in as a bassinet and the force of that tornado nearly sucked him away. So, a lot of harrowing stories, certainly traumatizing stories for these residents here. We understand that the National Weather Service will be taking crews throughout this area, canvassing it, surveying the damage. And we also expect Louisiana's governor, John Bel Edwards, to host a press conference later. And as I mentioned, there's no loss of life in this community, but across the state, at least three people have been killed and there are many injuries here. As the sun comes up, we'll have a better understanding of the extent of this damage. Don?",

He was explaining too that the reason there was this specific guidelines from the CDC for COVID is because you can spread it when you're asymptomatic, whereas he said with the RSV and the flu, you largely are spreading it when you are showing symptoms. So, again, the basic rule of thumb going into this holiday season is if you don't feel well, stay at home, stay away from other people, even if it's not what you want to do to skip that holiday family dinner.",

This morning, Democrats still waiting on a formal announcement from President Biden about whether or not he's going to run for re-election, but it now appears that one of the most influential people in his life is actually all-in. CNN has now learned that First Lady Jill Biden is supportive of her husband running for another term. That's notable given she's likely one of the decisive voices in his orbit.CNN's Kate Bennett reports that despite once being skeptical of another campaign, Joe Biden is now encouraged by the results of the midterm elections and she's ready to go. But look at this new CNN poll when asked if Biden should be the party's nominee in 2024, 40 percent of the Democratic voters said yes. That's not as strong as where Biden was at the beginning of the year but it is a little bit stronger than where he was over the summer at just 25 percent. His potential opponent, former President Trump, is not faring as well with his party. He's actually seeing the reverse of that trend, because among Republicans and those who lean to the right, only 38 percent want Trump to be their nominee. Even more striking when those same voters were asked who should be the nominee, who's the next person, the clear leader and clear favorite was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. 53 percent say they prefer anyone but Trump. So, joining us now to talk about this is Maggie Haberman, CNN's Political Analyst, and, of course from The New York Times. I feel like you can kind of hear the screams from Mar-a-Lago from here over those numbers when it comes to DeSantis.",

Now, he's the only person who is running right now. You wouldn't know that, Kaitlan, because he's done no events. I can't really remember the last time I saw somebody announce for president and do literally nothing. I'm told it's going to change next month, but we'll see what happens.

He certainly has winds at his back in a way that Donald Trump just does not.One thing that was interesting about one of the polls yesterday, The Wall Street Journal poll showed Biden getting beat by DeSantis. Now, I want to caveat that we're two years out. And polls two years out don't really tell us a ton, but they do tell us a snapshot in time right now. Biden is strong against Trump, Trump is strong against Biden -- or Trump stronger than against Biden than I think he would be against anyone else. It reminds me a little of what we saw in 2016, which is that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were the two who could beat each other.
