An attorney who actually once represented a January 6 defendant at the time blamed the network's coverage for his client's actions that day, saying essentially that he developed what the attorney called Foxitis and believed lies that were told on the network and by former President Trump about the election.The rioter was known as Anthony Antonio. He lost his job at the beginning of the pandemic, and for the next six months, he says he watched Fox News constantly with his roommates. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTHONY ANTONIO, JANUARY 6TH RIOTER: Election night happened and everything was going on. I truly believed that Trump won the election. But I felt like, you know, you know, maybe I believed that America was being robbed of a president, and I now know that that was a lie. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You talked to your former client about this lawsuit, about what we were just hearing from Oliver and these revelations. What's he making of it?JOSEPH HURLEY, FMR. ATTORNEY FOR ACCUSED JAN. 6 RIOTER ANTHONY ANTONIO: Good morning. I indicated that I would do this, but I ask that you find somebody who's not smarter than me, who would be the co- interviewee. And I already see you couldn't find anybody. And they said, if we can find one, we'll bring them so they don't exist. Let me tell you why I'm here. I am here because I saw in real time what those -- the words I would use, I shouldn't use, so I won't. People at Fox, the Tucker Carlson with a look on his face and Hannity with this smug look, and that group of people, they don't know what they do to people. And it's unimaginable that they can change the course of who a human being is because of naivete. And the person that I represented was a religious, nonpolitical individual who devoted his -- part of his time working in children's group at church, going to the South America three different times for weeks at a time to work in an orphanage. A good guy, no criminality, no bad traits that would hurt society. And he ended up in his job location out in Illinois, and they couldn't leave the house that he lived in with three other people for seven months before the election. And those people watched Fox 24/7, 7/24 and it started to seep in -- and these are my words -- seep into his brain and things that he had never thought of before he started to accept. And he ended up, when Trump said, come to Washington, it'll be well out wild of him feeling a devotion to his country, the United States of America, not Trump per se. And he ended up in Washington, and he ended up with 11 or 12 charges. And he has been facing ignominy (ph), and it's all because of the Tuckers and the Seans and the other people that are there that don't give a damn about anybody but themselves and money, and it's disgusting.",

And if essentially we look at -- look here, polls for the 2024 GOP press primary and wrote a book, anyone at at least 1 percent in the latest Fox survey. Look at all these candidates, Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, Greg Abbott, Liz Cheney, Kristi Noem, Mike Pompeo, Tim Scott, and, of course, Ron DeSantis. Pretty much all of them, all of them have written a book. The only one who was pulling the 1 percent that I don't believe has is Glenn Youngkin. So in this particular year, at least, the Republicans, who we think are potential nominees for 2024 and probably are going to run or have already declared, they have in fact written a book.

Are they not going to run? Writing a book to me is an indication that they, in fact, are going to run.But the thing that got me interested in this as well, is, OK, in the past, have presidents actually written books? And what we see here is take a look here. OK. Presidents who wrote books before winning since 1976, look at all of these candidates. Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, who actually had two New York Times bestsellers. Joe Biden the only one on the list. What -- who's not on the list, excuse me, was Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton, of course, wrote a bestseller after he left the presidency, but not beforehand. Here's the question, though, do you, in fact, need to have a bestseller to actually win? OK, so presidents with New York Times bestsellers before winning since 1976, among those who wrote a book pre-election, did they in fact have a bestseller? Look at the yes column. Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Joe Biden. But in the no, look how many nos there are. Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush. So it doesn't necessarily seem to me that actually having a book that sells, it's a prerequisite for winning. It's in fact, writing the book itself. In fact, Jimmy Carter was interested to note, actually wrote a book that basically was just in Southern bookstores, religious Southern bookstores. He wasn't interested in writing a book to actually go to the New York Times bestseller. He was just interested in writing a book. And so, look, when I look at all this data, I'm not saying to myself, OK, you know what? I'm not going to look towards the New York Times bestseller to understand if someone's going to win. I'm actually going to look towards the polls. And what do we see? We see here -- well, this is a little surprise for my dear friend Donnie over here. This is a special bonus number.
