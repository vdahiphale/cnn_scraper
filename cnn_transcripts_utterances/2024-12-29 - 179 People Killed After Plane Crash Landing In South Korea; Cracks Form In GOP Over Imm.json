But I want to start with this breaking news from overnight, 179 people were killed in South Korea after a passenger jet crashed at Muan International Airport. The plane skidded down the runway after it appears there was a problem with the landing gear, and then crashed at the end of the runway and burst into flames. Two crew members were rescued from the tail of the airplane. Let's go now to CNN's Mike Valerio, who has been following this disaster from Seoul. Mike, what do we know about how this happened?",

What caused the landing gear to fail, leading to those dramatic, honestly, heart stopping videos that we've been watching all day here in East Asia.Now, everybody else in the United States and around the world is waking up to. So the key to finding out, Pam, what might have happened here perhaps lays in the hands of the two people who miraculously survived. We're talking about two crew members who were sitting back as far back as you possibly can be, essentially underneath the tail section of the plane. So in terms of how this all unfolded, just after 2:00 a.m. local time in Bangkok, Thailand, this Jeju airlines plane takes off bound for our corner of the world in South Korea. This is an airline that has a great safety record, has been founded in 2005, a low budget air carrier. So if you're in the market to go to, you know, a vacation spot in this section of Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, you know, you might choose this airline, Jeju Air, which has never had a catastrophe on this scale. We fast forward to the 9:00 a.m. hour, just about 3.5 hours south of where we're standing, and there is a radio communication received from the airliner from the control tower saying essentially, you know, there are birds in the area. Beware of possible the potential for bird strikes. Two minutes later, Pam, then a mayday call is signaled from the airliner, and then four minutes later it crashes, but unclear how anything like a potential bird strike can lead to the flaps not being up on the aircrafts wings. The airliner landing on the runway pretty close to the end of the runway, and certainly why the landing gear was not lowered, is still a mystery at this hour.",

Why was something at the end of a runway to begin with, though?O'BRIEN:  Well, this is, to me the most tragic part of what we just witnessed. The -- there's an antenna system that needs to be lined up with the center line of the runway. It's part of the instrument landing system that airliners use to get -- get you on the ground in that dark and stormy night. It's called the localizer, and it just basically keeps the airplane on the center line. And those antennas need to be where the runway center line is. Now, what's unusual about this and dangerous is those antennas were built on top of a mound with reinforced concrete. So it was a rather significant barrier right at the end of the runway, which didn't give the airliner much overrun capability. In the U.S. and frequently at many other airports, what they would do is put those antennas as sort of breakaway antennas, kind of frangible towers that the airplane would have gone through and would have caused much less damage. Also in the U.S., at more than 100 runways now, we have this -- these engineered blocks at the end of the runway, which are designed to collapse under the weight of an aircraft, and that obviously was not present here either.",

Thank you.Turning now to here at home in Washington, Republicans are set to take unified control of Congress on Friday before President Trump takes the oath of office in just over three weeks, but cracks are already starting to form this weekend ahead of the Republican takeover. The fate of speaker Mike Johnson is uncertain in a pivotal vote now just days away with some House Republicans signaling he may not have the support he needs to hold his power. And beyond the halls of Capitol Hill, MAGA hardliners are sparring online with future DOGE leaders Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy over the future of the H-1B visa program, which allows highly skilled workers like tech engineers from abroad to work in the United States. Trump stepped in on the debate yesterday, standing by his ally Elon Musk, telling \"The New York Post\" he is in favor of the visas and uses them on Trump properties. So let's break all of this down with my panel from \"The Washington Post\". Isaac Arnsdorf and Marianna Sotomayor, \"The Boston Globe's\" Jackie Kucinich, and Bloomberg's Mario Parker. There is a lot of news on this holiday weekend. So the first question, Mario, is what is Trump saying by weighing in on this and standing by his -- his new bestie, you know, Elon Musk? MARIO PARKER, BLOOMBERG MANAGING EDITOR FOR GOVERNMENT &amp; ECONOMY:  He stood by him in some ways, but if you really squint at it, he really didn't articulate a position on it. He said that he uses H-1B visas. He doesn't. He uses unskilled labor at his property.",

They will never again say it publicly, but privately, they know they need workers. So, any kind of limitations, further limitations, just remember that the first iteration, the first Trump administration, did put some caps on a number of these visas. They want to see it expanded a little bit. But again, if Trump does lean in, does take Musk's position. It will be interesting to see if you see that smaller group again of MAGA loyalists come out and say, you know what, maybe we should have this debate.

So you have Donald Trump telling \"The New York Post\" that he supports these H-1B visas, and he also had this Truth Social post that seemed to be a message meant for Elon Musk, that Bill Gates wanted to meet. He said, where are you? When are you coming to the center of the universe, Mar-a-Lago. Bill Gates asked to come tonight. We miss you and X. New Year's Eve is going to be amazing. DJT.

His latest move, a Friday night filing to the Supreme Court asking to hit pause on the upcoming TikTok ban.The social media app is set to be banned in the United States in just three weeks, but Trump is asking for more time, saying he hopes to navigate a resolution that will protect both the First Amendment and national security. CNN's Carrie Cordero is in West Palm Beach and joins us now to explain all of this. Carrie, what is the significance of this new request from Trump? And how much do you think it could matter to the Supreme Court? CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  So the Supreme Court, Pam, is scheduled to have a hearing on this on January 10th. All the parties, including the official position of the United States government, have filed their briefs. The briefs of TikTok have been filed. And so, the president elect also decided to file a brief in this case, even though he's not currently a party to it. And his argument is basically that based on his future foreign affairs responsibilities as the future president as of January 20th, that the court should pause the law and give him time once he assumes office, to be able to negotiate a different outcome so that the app is not ultimately banned in the United States.",

Over 170 million Americans use TikTok.There are creators who base their businesses on it, and so it's widely used in the United States if the law goes through, if the Supreme Court upholds the D.C. circuit view, which resoundingly ruled in favor of the government and aligned with the government's and accepted the government's national security arguments in this case, then the app will go away, as of January 19th.",

In fact, your run up, your lead in here pretty much underscored it. Twice-impeached, convicted felon is the person who we lost the hardest working Americans to. And many of them that voted for him also agree that he's a pretty bad person. So this is not some moment for a caretaker DNC chair. Instead, we need a change maker. And that's the phrase I've heard from a lot of people that I've been speaking to on the phone. The Democratic National Committee needs to figure out whether we want to mess around or whether we want to be ruthless about winning the next elections. I vote for winning elections, and we have opportunities in front of us with 36 governors races up in two years, with special elections in between, and with the ability to actually win back the House under Hakeem Jeffries' leadership, where House members actually ran, I think much more effective campaigns than perhaps the top of the ticket would have proven.",

I mean, the good news is the message change that we need to make is really a return to our true selves. And that message has to be the economic security and well- being of the hardest working people in our economy. One of the more troubling aspects about this last election was how many younger voters that we lost. Vice President Harris held her ground, and we kept older voters. But it's the younger voters who are staring at -- who are staring at the high cost of housing, the high cost of food. This was an election about inflation. But guess what? Once Donald Trump is in office, the people he cares about are not the hardest working Americans. And the people that he will hurt with his policies will be those hardest working Americans. So the change we need on the message is about economic security. But there are other changes we need to make as well. Tactical changes in how we deliver our message, how we register more people to vote and register them as Democrats. And also how we defend voting rights not just in a few states, but in all states. Gone should be the days of retreating into an ever-shrinking blue perimeter. We need to have a 57 state-and-territory strategy, and we need to recruit candidates to run from the courthouse to city hall to the House of Representatives. BROWN: And just to note, on Donald Trump, you know that those hard- working Americans you're talking about, they saw what he did in the first term. They liked it. They thought it did -- it was good for them. And they voted for him again. Many of them. Not, you know, you can say all of them, but I just want to point that out that, you know, that is their view, that he did work for them. The question is, in terms of looking ahead, who should -- what kind of leadership should there be? Right. I want you to listen to what the incoming head of the House Progressives said last week, and how Senator Joe Manchin responded to that on this show. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. GREG CASAR (D-TX): If the Democratic Party was a little bit more like Chairwoman Jayapal and a little less like Joe Manchin, I think we would have won this election. SEN. JOE MANCHIN (I-WV): They got to be nuts. for someone to say that they've got to be completely insane. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think it's really about how we move forward and deliver for the hardest working Americans. And I would push back a little bit on the analysis that says that -- that Americans like what Donald Trump did in his first term. I don't think that's what it was about. It was about inflation going up faster than peoples wages. And that's what we need to be focused on. I don't -- I don't buy the left or right. I buy bringing the message back to every family's kitchen table about the things for the next two years that Donald Trump is going to be doing.

Do you think that Democrats should work with the incoming Trump administration or just reject it and try to work against it? O'MALLEY: I think whenever we have an opportunity to strengthen the economic well-being of people across the country, to allow people to get ahead through their hard work, we should be unabashed about actually engaging in those sorts of actions. But when Donald Trump does things that undermine people's economic security, when he does things that hold down wages, when he does things that hurt our economy like tariffs and drive up the cost of things, we should fight him on that. In other words, Miss Brown, I think that the two primary places where we need to push back hard on Donald Trump is when he does things that hurt working people and when he undermines the principles of this republic.",

A lot of the ideas that you see swirling around DOGE have nothing to do with the real world or the effective administration of our government and the service to the American people. I mean, social security is the greatest anti-poverty program, one of the most sacred promises we have to the American people. And if DOGE decides they want to do away with social security, we need to fight that, and we need to fight it tooth-and-nail.",

The dollars that pay in are the dollars that are paid out, and Congress makes an adjustment every, every 40 -- 50 years to make sure that the health of social security is extended. This is a solvable problem. Social security can be there for another 90 years, but not if Donald Trump wants to do away with it.",
