In fact, the whole world will be watching as the Ukrainian leader sits down with U.S. President Joe Biden in the Oval Office in the coming hours. Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he is on his way to the U.S. And a CNN affiliate says these are pictures of Mr. Zelenskyy arriving in Poland by train earlier on route to Washington. When the Ukrainian President arrives at the White House, he won't be empty handed. He's bringing a flag for Mr. Biden and the U.S. Congress to thank them. It's signed by Ukrainian troops from the front line. And Russia's President has been talking about what he calls Moscow's need to improve the readiness of its nuclear weapons. This of course Mr. Zelenskyy's first known trip outside his homeland since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. He faces many challenges as we hear from CNN's Will Ripley, who's in Southern Ukraine.",

But what makes today different is as the first time Zelenskyy has not been physically present in the country since the start of the full scale invasion on February 24th. He faces quite a challenge when he goes to Washington for that triumphant announcement with President Biden of billions of dollars in additional defense spending, including those highly coveted by the Ukrainians, Patriot Missile Defense Systems that they hope will be a game changer in this conflict, which has been dragging on around 10 months now. Zelenskyy has to convince U.S. lawmakers and also NATO, that they need to support Ukraine through the long haul, even though there is growing pressure, including from the French President Emmanuel Macron, for peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Now the Ukrainians here well, the conversation on the ground and Ukraine is supportive of Zelenskyy being in the United States, they are also determined to finish this war that Russia started. And that means from the Ukrainian perspective, reclaiming all territory taken by Russia, pre 2014, including Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Russia. That's what started this whole war. From the Ukrainian perspective, they've been fighting Russia for almost nine years now. Now the west might feel differently, they might feel that Ukraine should try to make some concessions that Zelenskyy domestically is under a tremendous amount of pressure not to make. But the big challenge for him as he continues to accept billions of dollars in weapons from foreign countries, and yet the lines have been basically staying relatively the same. Ukraine is not retaking a tremendous amount of territory. They're not losing ground to the Russians, either. He has to convince them that the challenge is urgent enough. And the threat is big enough for the world that they need to keep putting money and resources into Ukraine, especially with word of a potential Russian troop buildup on the Belarusian border to the North of Ukraine which could open up yet another front in this conflict, which is already seeing intense fighting to the East, to the South and of course, the regular bombardment and bombing of the civilian infrastructure here by Russia.

And we're also at a point where Washington is closing in on the funding for next year, a huge funding package is up being considered by lawmakers and there is $45 billion in that that's additional assistance for Ukraine for next year.

It's more the factthat there is always it seems every week, a new set of figures that the White House wants to wail out to give the impression essentially that the unlimited balance sheet of the U.S. government is backing Ukraine. The key things though in this latest tranche along trailed the Patriot Defense Missile System kind of the U.S. or NATO gold standard of missile interceptors. They need a lot of training, frankly, the Ukrainians to operate these. It's a big logistical jump for a Pentagon that doesn't want to put U.S. boots on the ground inside Ukraine to operate them. But once they're up and around, they will be exceptionally effective. They are essentially kind of a precious gift to some degree that the U.S. likes to hand its most close allies and they do certainly work on top of that as well. This package will contain an element of precision that can be added on to weaponry Ukraine already has that lack that capacity to be so well targeted, that will reduce the number of rounds that Ukraine needs to use every day to hit targets less than any possible civilian casualties going forwards. And is another sign that the technology the U.S. has which has been at times reticent to unleash in its full is now being put in Ukrainian hands. But the largest symbolism here Lynda is really the fact that Zelenskyy feels confident enough to leave Ukraine. Remember this is a man living in the bunker somewhere in undisclosed location in Kyiv for the first weeks of the conflict, who when he was offered the chance to evacuate at the beginning remember he said I don't need a ride I need ammo. And is now able to take it seems a U.S. military plane across to Washington for an hour's long visit to shore up most likely political support on the Hill for the billions more than needs to be given to Ukraine to keep them afloat during this war. But I think also too to show to those who are thinking maybe in Moscow that they can outwait the West, the West economic and military patients for this simply isn't as strong as the Russian patients. Russia seemingly willing to send endless numbers of its conscripts towards the front line. That really Washington is in this for the long haul that they are not about to slow down or pack in. You did hear John Kirby mention they might discuss what a just peace would look like. We know everyone in the West wants this to end as soon as possible. At the same time I think that's weighed equally by the need for the final conclusion the final boundaries to be something which is comfortable for all European security and for Ukraine as well.",

Alot of lawmakers have already left town for the holidays and are struggling to get back through incoming winter weather. But basically, if you'd said at the start of this year that the United States would be effectively bankrolling a war for survival by Ukraine, against Russia, and it would have spent billions of dollars and sent high tech sophisticated weapons. I think you'd be very surprised. But I think this visit is a sign of exactly how far this has come the strength of the West in standing up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which to a great extent, as well as the bravery of the Ukrainians themselves, has inflicted quite surprising damage on the Russian invasion forces. So the symbolism when Biden stands there in the White House with the Zelenskyy, on his first trip abroad, standing up for a foreign democracy, and when Zelenskyy goes up to Capitol Hill, will be very acute. And you know this is another great PR coup for the Zelenskyy, who's shown him to be exceedingly media savvy. And I think he needs to do this because as Nick was saying, there is growing skepticism about the whole idea of being in Ukraine for the long haul on the part of some of the Republican lawmakers who have a great deal of influence in the incoming House Republican majority in the New Year.",

I think you're going to see some analogies to that today, and then are now we're at a pivot point of this war. The big question is, how far is the U.S. willing to go and those 81 years ago meeting, you know, the only possibility was total victory. President Biden has cast himself as almost a kind of old school, U.S. President leading the West, you know, a concept and a block that perhaps wasn't as relevant after the fall of the Soviet Union. So I think we're going to see a lot of those echoes. And Biden, of course, has put democracy at the center of his foreign policy. There is no more stark indication of that than U.S. war for Ukraine, a country that's fighting for its democracy is existence in which Vladimir Putin in a sort of mid-20th century style conflict is trying to wipe off the map.",

But Biden has been very careful, although Patriot missiles are a very sophisticated weapons system, they are still essentially defensive. They're trying to protect Ukrainian civilians from the latest Russian strategy, which is, you know, weaponizing winter trying to break their morale by attacking electricity installations and cities over the winter months. But there's a balancing act that the President has taken. He's trying to ensure that the war does not expand that that is not seen as a direct military clash between NATO and Russia, which could be disastrous. But all along what the United States has done, it's recalibrated the strategy to Russian recalibration so while he'd be very happy Zelenskyy are getting precision bomb kits and Patriot missiles, he's sure to be angling for perhaps more offensive weapons, which could be very useful when you know the war enters a new phase early next year.",

Officials tell CNN that a task force overseen by the White House National Security Council is investigating. Well, the U.S. and other nations are trying to reduce the growing military relationship between Iran and Russia, Iran's foreign minister was in Jordan Tuesday.

And probably this was one of the files that are most difficult in the large amount of different measures that we have been trying to put in place. So to facilitate a good management of this disruptive situation we are going through because of the invasion of Russia and Ukraine. And of course, it is certain that for some countries, those that fear not having access to the energy materials to the gas. We're questioning and challenging what does this mean, if there are references been stated at the political level, while there were others that had a much more comfort in terms of access to gas, that could be - offering the crazy race in gas prices. So we did it to combine things in a manner that provides sufficient safeguards for that very non-access to gas and warranties for those who are in a huge, crazy race in gas prices that are not directly connected to the situation, but to the signers or non-signers, that we as politicians and as institutions, even as traders at the European level, may be sending. When we say we want to restore as much as possible at whatever price of course, we are being sold at whatever price. When we say we want to store or we want to pay more, but not so much more. It is clear that we may be having an opportunity to do it in a much more organized and meaningful manner.",

Cities on the U.S. Mexico border are bracing for deluge of migrants as a Trump era policy remains in legal limbo. Thousands of people are gathered at the border right now sleeping in tents or shelters hoping to seek asylum in the United States. The Title 42 policy, which allows U.S. border authorities to swiftly turn away migrants, was due to expire today. Several states pushed for it to be kept in place to avert an influx of migrants. The decision is with the Supreme Court right now. More migrants of course keep arriving every day. And CNN's Rosa Flores spoke to some of them from Brownsville, Texas.
