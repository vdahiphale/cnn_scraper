Wade. We find exhibit A in his very home state of Florida. Now there, there is a six week abortion ban, that amendment on the ballot that would overturn that particular ban. Yesterday, Trump appeared to suggest that he'd be willing to vote for overturning that ban when he said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It just so happens that this is a unique situation, which Donald Trump is a Florida voter who is going to cast a vote on this.

You know, I think honestly, I don't know how to answer that question for him. What I would say and what I would suggest if I was still advising him would be, you know, you have to be -- what he did with the Supreme Court is exactly what the pro- life movement and Republicans have been asking for forever, which is return the issue back to the states. He's done his job, and I think he should stand proud on doing that job and leave it be from there. Let the states decide which they are doing. And now what you're seeing is on the pro-life side and Republican side is they don't like the fact that the states are having a say in this because they're not voting the way that they thought they would be in several of these states. So I think for him, it's obviously a challenge. I don't know how you overcome that challenge except to be consistent in saying, I did what I did in my first term. The next term, the reality is, there's never going to be a federal abortion ban in front of the president of either party. You're just never gonna get the 60 votes in the Senate. You're not gonna get the 267 votes that you need in the House.

And so by doing that indictment first and then briefing it -- and he's even offered a kind of a reverse schedule. It's the defendant's motion. And so ordinarily when a defendant makes a motion, they put in their briefing first, then the government responds, defendant gets the last word. Jack Smith is proposing the opposite.

When do you want to do it with the schedule? But importantly, and to your point, Tim, that Trump is likely going to file additional motions to dismiss. They all acknowledge that in this particular motion and what they've decided.One reason is because they think that the superseding (ph) indictment is based on immunized testimony or things that should not have come in. And they are intimating that the grand jury, the new grand jury that heard it, probably heard things that were is also subject to the Supreme Court's decision.

Marcellus Williams was convicted in the 1998 murder of Felicia Gale, a one-time reporter found stabbed to death in her own home. Williams has always maintained his innocence, and his case is raising concerns that a potentially innocent man could be put to death. It's also pitting Wesley Bell, a local prosecutor running for Congress as a Democrat, against Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican seeking re-election.In January, Bell filed a request to have Williams' conviction overturned. After testing, found that his DNA was not on the murder weapon. Now, prosecutors were expected to present evidence in court just last week to support that very motion. But the hearing did not happen. Why not? New DNA testing showed the knife had, quote, \"been handled by many actors, including law enforcement.\" And the Attorney General's office argued that it could not, therefore, exonerate Williams. Then Bell's office announced that it had reached an agreement with Williams to get him off death row. It would have allowed him to be resentenced, this time to life in prison. It was approved by the court and the victim's family. But the Attorney General's office, they opposed the deal and they appealed to the state Supreme Court, which then blocked that agreement. The Supreme Court then opened a St. Louis County judge to -- and ordered that judge to hold an evidentiary hearing. Now that did happen earlier this week, and we're now waiting on that ruling. St. Louis County prosecutor, Wesley Bell joins us now. Wesley, thank you so much for joining. I mean, this case and just the iterations and the journey is very striking to so many people. He is set to be put to death on September 24th. If this current hearing does not go in his favor and the judge does not spare him execution, what happens next? Would the governor intervene? WESLEY BELL, ST. LOUIS COUNTY, MISSOURI PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: Well, we're in uncharted water, Laura, to be perfectly honest. Our legislature passed a law giving prosecutors standing to bring cases or reopen cases where there is evidence of innocence or wrongful conviction. And so we opened this case under that statute and we believe that there are serious concerns with this conviction. Obviously, this conviction was from 1998, so it predated me, but we created a conviction incident review unit so that we could make certain that we had safeguards in place to make sure we get it right. And in this case, there are serious questions about this conviction. And at the very least, regardless of your politics on the death penalty, we should not -- no one should be executed if there's questions about the conviction.",

As prosecutors, we have a duty to make certain that a defendant not only has a fair trial, but a defendant has a fair opportunity to appeal their case. And so we have to be careful with how we handle evidence at all phases of a trial. And the fact that there is questions handling of the evidence of the case, which prevents Mr. Williams from being able to mount an appeal in this case to look at potential DNA evidence, some of which was not available at the time in 1998, is a dereliction of our duty. And again, the death penalty, you know, I'm opposed to it. It's not adeterrent. It does not give families closure because of the scrutiny that courts give death cases, which they should. But in a case like this, when we have clear and we have evidence that suggests that not only Mr. Williams could potentially be innocent, but also that there's questions about the conviction itself, I think it is the only right thing to do and ethical thing to do is to at least spare this man from execution.",

Could this be an example of art imitating life? Well, it very well could be, according to my next guest. His name is Luis Elizondo. He worked for many years in many different positions for the Department of Defense, ultimately becoming a senior intelligence official and running a shadowy Pentagon program investigating UFOs.That is until he resigned in 2017, denouncing the program's secrecy. Well, in his new memoir, \"Imminent,\" he shares some earth-shattering revelations, like his assertion that the government is in possession of biological remains of non-human origin. He also describes personal encounters with an unidentified anomalous phenomena also known as UAP. Luis Elizondo joins me now. How unbelievably exciting. Everyone is almost hitting their televisions trying to lean in on this moment. I mean, you have written that the U.S. government has been operating a decades-long, I got to read this, crash retrieval program for these UAP, that biological remains of non-humans (ph) have been found.

So a lot of people are familiar with the three videos that you're showing now, but what a lot of people don't know is there's been other ones that have come out forward from the Pentagon where they released it and they said, look, we have no idea what this is. That's a perfect example. That is a another example they call the silver orb.That is the famous gimbal video. That is a vehicle that is flying at altitude. It's going 120 knots against the wind. That is hurricane force winds, right? We're not talking about a balloon. We're talking about a technical vehicle that is going against the wind, and it begins to maneuver in a very interesting way. Most aircraft, because you have wings, when you turn and you articulate the aircraft this way, you lose lift and you lose altitude. That's not what we're seeing in that video. We're seeing a cry -- and you can even hear the exasperation of the pilots when they say, well, bro, that's not a drone, dude, and there's some expletives there. And the vehicle begins to turn in a way that really these are trained pilots. These pilots are trained observers. They're combat. Some of them are Top Gun pilots. They know the difference between an SU-22, a MiG-25 and an F-16 from 10 miles away. And what they're seeing there defies all description. In some cases these things don't even have wings. No rudders, no ailerons, no control surfaces, no cockpits. And so therein lies the conundrum.",
