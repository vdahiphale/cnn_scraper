Well, the clock is ticking for Donald Trump's lawyers to respond to a legal filing in the case over his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election.Special counsel Jack Smith has requested limitations on evidence provided to Trump's team. Specifically, they're asking the former president not to receive his own copies of sensitive material fearing he could use it to threaten witnesses. And the deadline to respond is just hours away. Smith filed the request in response to Trump's posts on social media, including this one, which says, quote, \"If you go after me, I'm coming after you.\" One of Trump's attorneys tells CNN he will fight the protective order, claiming prosecutors want to hide information from the American people. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN LAURO, ATTORNEY FOR DONALD TRUMP: The point is that we will not agree to keeping information that's not sensitive from the press. The press and the American people in a campaign season have a right to know what the evidence is in this case, provided that this evidence is not protected otherwise. So we're going to oppose it, as we have. But for whatever reason, these lawyers on the prosecution team want to keep that from the press. I'm shocked that the press isn't lined up objecting to this protective order, because not only is President Trump being attacked for his First Amendment rights, now these prosecutors are trying to impinge on the freedom of the press.

We could see his former vice president and current opponent for the 2024 nomination be called to testify against him. CNN's Dana Bash put that scenario to Mike Pence earlier.

And we have seen time after time, the vast majority of Republican elected officials, virtually all of them in the current case, refusing to draw any lines.And Trump has quite understandably taken from that the lesson that he has essentially broken the party to his will, and there is no point he can go to, at which a critical mass of Republicans will coalesce against him and try the admittedly difficult task of convincing their voters that this is unacceptable. But when you add all of this up, you see the challenge it creates for American democracy. Because we are now on a situation where  the vast majority of Republican elected officials and voters are basically saying they do not believe his conduct after the 2020 election or on January 6th is disqualifying for him to be president again and the legal system may have very different judgments about what he did in that period.",

And they will be there to pick up his base if they are not seen as someone who tried too hard to take him down themselves. That strategy didn't work in 2016.

This is all part of a broader effort by the White House to sell the president's accomplishments and take credit for those accomplishments, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which you'll remember included $370 billion meant to combat climate change.Now, the president will visit Arizona first, and sources tell us that he is considering designating a new national monument around the Grand Canyon. This is something that native tribes have been lobbying for for years and it would prevent new drilling in the area. So, the president's really trying to bolster his climate agenda ahead of the 2024 election. Of course, this is a critical issue for key members of the Democratic coalition, progressives, young voters, people who haven't necessarily been satisfied with the president in this area so far when it comes to drilling for fossil fuels, when it comes to cutting carbon emissions, the president really hoping to show voters that he is serious about combating climate change. And now, this is all part of a bigger effort by the Biden administration to take more credit for their economic agenda in the month of August. And you'll see the president, the vice president, members of the cabinet all out talking about their economic record. And they do believe that they have a good story to tell. Inflation is easing. Consumer sentiment is ticking up and certainly hiring remains strong. But they does remain this disconnect with voters. In a poll last week by CNN, 75 percent said that they viewed economic conditions as poor and that is translating into political headwinds for President Biden when it comes to his approval rating. So certainly the challenge for President Biden as he gears up for reelection is to close that gap and remind voters of all that he has accomplished when it comes to the economy. Kevin Liptak, CNN, Wilmington, Delaware. (END VIDEOTAPE) CHURCH: Some 80 million people in the U.S. will begin the work week under dangerous heat alerts. The South and the Southwest will be hardest hit. Triple digit temperatures are forecast for much of those regions. The threat of severe weather also increases Monday with the potential for hail and damaging wind. It could impact more than 120 million people in the eastern U.S. The threat is highest in the southeast from Georgia to Maryland. We are following new developments out of Ukraine, where officials say at least one person has been killed after Russian shelling targeted the southern region of Kherson. Meantime, Ukraine's military is confirming strikes on two key bridges between Crimea and Russian-occupied areas nearby. Ukraine says the two road bridges targeted on Sunday were the main transportation routes for Russia in those areas. But a Russian-appointed official in the Kherson region claims the bridges are used for civilian, not military traffic and that a rupture to a gas pipeline running along one bridge cut off supplies to 20,000 residents.

Russia is pushing very hard up in the north around Kupyansk and have expended, she says, almost half a million munitions over the past week.Now that is significant because what we're seeing really is Russia going over old ground. Kupyansk is a town that they lost just about 11 months ago, that they had occupied at the beginning of the war and then lost when Ukraine carried out that counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region back last autumn. So it's a back and forth, right? They're spending massive amounts of ammunition really to just go over old ground and not achieve too much in the process. Same thing in the south. Ukraine's saying that Russia is trying to retake a village in the southern border of the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhya regions that they took about a week ago. So massive amounts of fighting and shelling, huge amounts of ammunition being expended. And not many people, not either side, are achieving very much in all of this. And meanwhile, as you said, at the top of this segment, civilians are being caught in the crossfire. Two civilians were killed in Kharkiv on Sunday. Again overnight, another civilian killed in Kherson with shelling ongoing there. Rosemary? All right, our thanks to Clare Sebastian joining us live from London.

The other aim is to cut off the roots of supply, Russian supply roots, and also the Russian warehouses, ammunition depots which are used for Russian troops to resupply its attacks on the territory of Ukraine. So this is one thing. The other thing that Russia is all the time threatening that it will do more, it will retaliate for Ukrainian attacks. This is nonsense because Russia already has used all kinds of weapons. It has included on civilian population in Ukraine. We have seen awful terrible images of residential buildings being hit by Russian missiles, houses being destroyed, civilians, hospitals, maternity wards hit by Russian missiles.

He says he actually did see other boats and saw airplanes and the helicopters, he took off his shorts and tried to wave them in the air to get people's attention. That did not work. And out of everything that happened to him, Charles told his father that the worst was the nighttime because he says he was so sunburned that the wind at night was just making it freezing cold. So he would try to get in the water to warm up, but it was extremely difficult. Thankfully, the Coast Guard rescued him on Saturday morning. His father saying that Charles is, of course, dehydrated that he is weak, that his muscles or in the muscle tissue was breaking down so he does need some days to recover because of the sunburned and the bites.

He says it's a huge financial loss and estimates the damage in his town alone will run into the millions of dollars. The Prime Minister echoing that concern, saying the price tag to clean up and rebuild across the country could top half a billion dollars. But some residents are already starting that process and local media says around 600 soldiers have been deployed to hard hit areas to help with the efforts.
