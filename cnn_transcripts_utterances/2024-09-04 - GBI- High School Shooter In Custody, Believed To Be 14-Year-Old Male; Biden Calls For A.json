A significant update from law enforcement officials out of Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia.CNN is learning that the suspect in the shooting in which four people were killed and at least nine we're rushed to area hospitals is a 14- year-old male. The source said it is not yet known whether that teen actually attended the high school. But given what we've heard from other students at the school and what they witnessed and what they heard, this coincides with that new information that we're getting.",

That is how this 14- year-old obtained a weapon.Because, as you noted a moment ago, that the message was put out to the community about parents keeping guns safe and away from where they shouldn't be. And I'm also thinking about the shooting in Oxford, Michigan, and that high school shooting, and how that shooters parents ultimately became entangled in the legal system. And we're found guilty essentially of negligence, of allowing something like that to transpire in which, I believe, eight people or four people we're killed, rather, in Michigan. So, John, I'm wondering, from that perspective, how important is it in this investigation to not only get information from the 14-year-old, but then moving forward to getting information from his parents or his legal guardian.",

The Oxford, Michigan, case led to the prosecution of both parents, the Crumbleys, after the prosecution of their son as the shooter.But if you look back at one of the most tragic school shootings that you can think of, which is the first -- the first graders and kindergarten children of Newtown, Connecticut. Here was a case where the mother had purchased a weapon. The weapon what's secured at home. But her son knew how to get at that weapon, even where it was secured. Very much why the school system in Georgia, which is a place that has liberal gun laws in terms of ownership of handguns and rifles, you know, underscored the idea that if there are guns in the house, they should be secured and in such a way that kids can't get to them. So we're going to look at more and more of these cases where the parents and the storage of those weapons may come under scrutiny.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna, that's right. The vice president was briefed on the shooting before arriving here to New Hampshire.According to a White House official, she is receiving regular updates from her staff as well as saying that the administration is in touch with federal, state and local officials. But of course, the vice president is here in New Hampshire because she was going to unveil for economic proposals. She is still expected to do that. But she's going to top her remarks to also address this shooting. And these school shootings are something that the vice president is familiar with and very involved with. In fact, President Biden had tapped her to lead the White House Office of Gun Violence. That is an office that was set up to review executive actions and additional measures that they could do outside of Congress to try to clamp down on gun violence. Now, I should say, previously, I've talked to senior administration officials about this effort and some of what had been discussed and voted was how the administration can help these communities not only in the moments, right after a school shooting, but also help immunity in the weeks and months to follow. Because the reality is, for many senior administration officials, is that they basically don't have that much that they could do without Congress. Now on the campaign trail, both the president and the vice president have touted that bipartisan Safer Communities Act and put the onus on Congress to do more on this very issue. The vice president has raised this reality that Americans grapple with every day at rallies as well. But today, in only minutes, we'll be hearing from her directly and her response to another tragedy.",
