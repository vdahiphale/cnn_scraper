Some of America's most powerful leaders are set to honor Mr. Carter's 100 years of life and his decades of service to his country and his planet, frankly.Nearly 44 years to the day after he left the White House. President Carter's journey from Joint Base Andrews will take him across the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge, he'll travel into D.C. past the Washington Monument and the National Mall and then down Pennsylvania avenue to the U.S. Navy Memorial. There his casket will be carried to a caisson, a horse drawn military carriage for the funeral procession to the U.S. Capitol. There at the Capitol, dignitaries will be on hand for a service in the Capitol rotunda. Vice President Kamala Harris, House Speaker Mike Johnson and the new Senate Majority Leader John Thune will deliver eulogies. After the service, members of the public are invited to pay their respects as President Carter lies in states at the Capitol this evening and through tomorrow ahead of his state funeral on Thursday. Let's go live now to CNN's Phil Mattingly who is at Joint Base Andrews just outside D.C. and Jeff (ph), Special Air Mission 39 is due to land any minute. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Special Air Mission 39. Most people will look at the flight and think it's Air Force One. That's obviously only the case when the current president is on board. This will actually be the same plane, though, Jake, that George H.W. Bush took in his final journey from Texas to Joint Base Andrews and then back to Texas. And while much of this six day state funeral for Jimmy Carter is extraordinarily personal and very symbolic of the life he lived from Plains Georgia to Washington and back. This particular part of that six day state funeral will be very traditional, one that underscores reverence for the office and the man. When he arrives, lands taxis and settles here at Joint Base Andrews, his casket will be taken off of the airplane. There will be an immediate move towards the honor guard, where they will play several Hail to the Chief, there will be a 21 gun salute, and then there will be a procession. Jimmy Carter chose the music for that procession to the motorcade that will take him into Washington, D.C. Abide with me, a Christian hymnal, obviously a man who's very deep in his faith. But for the 15 to 20 minutes he's on the ground here, Jake, before taking off to head back into Washington D.C. What will be most striking is for a president who eschewed so many of the trappings of office, at least as it was traditionally known, this part of it will be extraordinarily traditional. Jake I would note, while he was involved in the planning of his funeral over the course of the last 39 years, it started after five years after he left office. One thing he was explicit, he did not want the idea of taking a train from Washington back to Georgia. When this is over, he'll be flying back on Special Air Mission 39 as well. Jake.",

And I'm thinking specifically of the Panama Canal, which President Trump talked about again today in his press conference, and also a hostage crisis, which was the end of the Carter presidency. And President Trump talked about today how the hostages need to be released by Hamas in Gaza or else. I think he said there would be hell to pay or something along those lines.

But and then just to sort of go back to the hostage question. In this particular case, obviously, the issues are quite different. The Biden administration is working with the some of the Trump transition members, along with all of the key players in the Middle East, in order to make sure that hostages come home after they have been there since October 7, 2023, including seven or fewer now believed to be alive, but many Americans who are still there.",

But we said to him, look, once you are president, the people don't want you to be just the common touch. They want you to be elevated. They look up to the presidency. But even with that, he ended up selling the presidential yacht, the Sequoia, which would have been a great lobbying device. But for Rosalynn, he might have sold Camp David. He said, Jimmy, we need a place to go on the weekend. There would have been no Camp David summit for the Israelis. He turned down our limousine service for the senior staff. We had to drive in ourselves. Initially, he wanted us to pay for taxi rides up to the Hill instead of having a limousine come. And he cut the White House staff by a third.

I counted more than two dozen snowplows, trucks. The effort that was underway to ensure that this was clear, not just for the landing, but also for the family and the ceremonies that we're about to see. I do want to point out, when it comes to the family, obviously, President Carter, extraordinarily close the love story between he and his past wife, Rosalynn, but also the immediate family. There's 33 immediate family members. They were taking annual vacations from the mid-90s into the mid-2000s at the end of every single year, they're very, very close. Also staff, staff from the Carter center, schedulers, planners, organizers of the funeral process. They will be traveling with them as well. As well, Jake, as his pastor, his pastor spoke down in Georgia, said over the course of the final months of his life, he would visit him at his home or in hospice where he was staying, and he would always find him wrapped in a blanket, a blanket that had Psalm 23 on it.

And that the fact that we are in 2024 and talking about actually some of the same conflicts and challenges that Jimmy Carter dealt with in the 1970s, it tells you a story about America and the kind of persistence of this country, but also the persistence of its challenges. One of the things about Jimmy Carter that we talk about a lot here is the way in which time has helped us better understand him, because so many things began in his tenure but didn't end until later.

You know, we understand that while Jimmy Carter eschewed all the pomp and circumstance of his office in so many ways, that he and his wife Rosalynn actually started working on planning for this very funeral back in 1986. So this is something that they have their personal fingerprints on every step. So the places that they're going to stop, the people that will be involved are all of intimate importance to former President Carter and his first wife, Rosalynn Carter.

He has always been a very big part of our lives. Like you just said, he shows up for everything. And even though the past two years, I guess, he's not been able to be there in person, we always knew he was down there. And if we needed something, some words of advice, some words of wisdom, we could just get in the car and go and talk to him. But we're so proud that the world is tuning in to this.

And Jimmy Carter was just, you know, Plains made him. He grew up a mile away in a little hamlet actually called Archery. And he was literally the only white boy in Archery. And all his playmates were African Americans. He grew up in a Sears Roebuck house, again, just less than two miles away from Plains that his father had built in the 1920s. They had no running water. He had no electricity. There was an outhouse. The biggest thing in Jimmy Carter's life as a teenager was in the 1930s, late 30s when the house finally got electricity. So he really came from almost a 19th century American experience and lived to be 100 lived into the 21st century. So it's an extraordinary life. And I argue in my biography of him, the outlier. He was an outlier that he really was probably, I argued he was the most intelligent, the most hard working and certainly the most decent man to have occupied the White House in the 20th century.",

Rosalynn's sister was even named Lillian after his mother. So this is very small town. And just a lot of people have spoken about Jimmy Carter's faith.
