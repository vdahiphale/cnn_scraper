Because if you look at the recent Gallup poll and what Americans feel about Biden's economics, 80 percent believe that the country is going in the wrong direction.At the same time, you have another poll that says that Kamala Harris is beating Donald Trump on the economy. So, which one is it? But I think from an independent point of view, she has to pivot to the center. I think it's very smart to be talking about the economy, because we all know that that's the first thing that people think about in an election. I also just want to point out that she is doing very well without saying much of anything. I mean, she's now making Florida a potential swing state that could go back to her. I know you're shaking your head, but you just wait and see. She's now getting the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. votes because he's said some more crazy things. And so now the people who didn't want Trump or Biden seem to be going to Kamala Harris. And she's also chipping away at Trump's base, which is how he went through that blue wall in 2016 with Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania. She's now getting to the working class white people.
