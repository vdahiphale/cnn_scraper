      "sentences": "Today, an about-face for the Biden administration in the Middle East. The White House is re-designating the Houthis in Yemen as a global terrorist entity.Officials say the goal is to keep the Iran-backed rebels from launching more attacks in the Red Sea. And it comes after the U.S. led several nations in striking Houthi targets in Yemen. CNN political and national security analyst, David Sanger, joins us now. He is also the White House and national security correspondent for \"The New York Times.\" David, great to see you as always. Just on a technical point, what does the re-designation mean? And how does it impact security in the Red Sea? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Thank you for having me, Boris. The fact of the matter is that the Houthis have proven themselves in the past few weeks to be a classic terror organization. They have been shooting missiles at ships, taking over ships, holding people hostage. That is what it is to be a terrorist. So clearly, they deserve to be on the list. But let's not confuse that with the reality that being on the list is not going to change a lot for the Houthis. These are no people who sit around thinking about opening up bank accounts in the New York Fed or even in Switzerland. While this has some effects in the ability to crack down on countries that may be found to be moving goods to the Houthis, or banks and other operations that may be financing supplies to them. It probably will not make that big of a difference. The evidence is sanctions on Russia in the past few years have not stopped them from being able to conduct the war. SANCHEZ: The U.S.-led coalition is now engaging with the Houthis, their main backer, Iran, is more directly involved with strikes in the region, including in Iraq and Pakistan. You have written a lot about Iran being more aggressive recently, pursuing its aspirations. Why do you think Tehran is now emboldened?",

Does the U.S. have many options to contain Iran?",

      "sentences": "We don't. I think that that is part of why we've seen the Iranians act out.They are being careful. They have not gone directly -- the Iranians have not gone directly after Americans or American targets. I don't think they want to be in a direct confrontation with the United States' war with Israel. They are happy to have proxies do that, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and others. The fact of the matter is, at this point, any discussion of a revived nuclear deal is bad. You could not bring back the 2015 deal, because parts of it expire in 2030, just six years away. That looks different than it did when this was signed in the Obama administration. So the fact of the matter is the Iranians have given up on the nuclear deal. The Americans have largely given up on the nuclear deal. And I think the Iranians are thinking the U.S. has his hands full in the region and, because it does not want to see the fighting expand, it will not push back that hard. At least that is their bet. They may overstep.",

He did not file because of a change in the party calendar that made South Carolina the first Democratic contest on February 3rd. New Hampshire, loathe to give up its early contest status, did not accept the change. So voters casting ballots for Biden will have to write his name in. The University of New Hampshire and CNN poll shows 69 percent of Democratic primary voters plan to do just that. And 7 percent say they will support Dean Phillips, 6 percent are behind author, Marianne Williamson. Polls also continuing to show President Biden trailing Donald Trump nationally in hypothetical matchups, but it's still within the margin of error in the latest CBS News New Gov survey, so showing no clear winner.

Why have you downgraded? PHILLIPSSenator Gene McCarthy achieved in 1968 against a very weak Democrat incumbent who ended up leaving the race some weeks later. I think there is an analogy today. And the American Research Group poll, a tracking poll every week or so, has me going from 0 percent when I first started on October 27th to 28 percent as of yesterday. Yes, if I am in the 20s, that would be a great achievement. But more than that, it will demonstrate where people are at. The polls are not lying, Brianna. President Joe Biden is a good man and a man I respect, but he will lose to Donald Trump. If it is Nikki Haley, it will be a wipeout. And that is why Democrats should be fostering a competition and not a coronation. I am so excited for the Granite Staters here on January 3rd to demonstrate that.

This is obviously an issue you are dealing with as well. \"Politico\" highlighted this in a new report. You changed the DEI drop down to, quote, \"equity and restorative justice.\" Why did you do that? And can you explain the difference between the two things? PHILLIPS: Absolutely. First, we did not change the language. We did change the drop down. And it's because I believe in diversity, I believe in equity, I believe in inclusion. But what has inclusion done for the black community in this country? What have both parties done to close the racial wealth gap? I want to take it a step further. I made the change to restorative justice. And by the way, nobody buys me, Brianna. I am the only member of Congress who takes note PAC money, corporate or otherwise, no lobbyist money, no money from members of Congress and I don't have a leadership PAC. That makes me the only one out of 535 people that does not play that nauseating game. Nobody buys me. If a donor came to be and told me to do something, I would tell the donor to go pound sand.

You do not see that here. But when they arrived, the officers set up two flash bangs, one near a window and one in the driveway. But the one by the window blew out the window and that was the room that this young baby was sitting in a little bouncy seat bouncer. The mother said the child was diagnosed with chemical pneumonitis, which is a form of lung irritation. And this came about from the child inhaling chemicals released by the flash bangs. Now the Elyria Police Department says that the flash bangs do not produce a continuous burn and they do not deploy or contain pepper gas or chemical agents. But this young mother said her child was harmed. He is still hospitalized. They said they will bring legal action. The Elyria Police Department said, \"Any allegations suggesting that the child was exposed to chemical agents, lack of medical attention or negligence is not true.\" The mayor released this video footage from the eight body worn cameras of the officers. He said, \"While the footage captured clearly it did not show what occurred when the search warrant was executed.
