But the suffering of Palestinians goes beyond even this. There are several allegations of human rights abuses inside Israeli detention centers. A CNN investigation in May exposed abuses at the Sde Taman detention camp, including beatings. Israeli Channel 12 broadcast footage appearing to show a detainee being severely sexually assaulted by soldiers. Five were arrested and are now under house arrest. The United Nations has also reported Palestinian detainees being tortured, mistreated, and sexually abused, with at least 53 people dying in Israeli detention. And the latest, a major report from the Israeli human rights group, B'Tselem, has collected testimony from dozens of Palestinian former detainees, alleging abuse, starvation, and more. The IDF has repeatedly rejected allegations of systematic abuse. Yuli Novak is the executive director of B'Tselem and she's joining me now from Tel Aviv. Yuli Novak, welcome to the program. Your report entitled \"Welcome to Hell\" makes very, very shocking and disturbing reading. And, of course, after October 7th, where 1,200 Israelis, including civilians were brutally massacred. The Association of Civil Rights in Israel is accused the government of, quote, consciously defying international law. Can you tell us the major findings of your report? YULI NOVAK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, B'TSELEM:  Yes. So, thank you for having me. The report we published last week contains testimonies, or based on testimonies of 55 people, Palestinians, who got released from Israeli jails, different detention centers -- 16 different detention centers throughout the last month. And they told us on the condition, as I said, in these detention centers since October 7. What we heard again and again, repeating stories and description of ongoing daily abuse, physical and mental. We heard about sleep deprivation, about starvation of people, about sexual assault, about inhumane sanitary conditions that people are held in. And those things and many more are -- became -- what we figured out from all these testimonies, became the norm in Israeli prison system.",

A large part of our staff -- are field researchers, they are Palestinians, and they connected those people who were brave enough to come and give their testimonies. We're talking about people from Gaza -- the Gaza Strip from the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and some Israeli citizens. And the astonishing thing about it is that, again, different people who don't know each other, some of them young, some of them old, who got arrested in completely different circumstances, and the vast majority of them got released without any charges, right? So, they were held for a week, two weeks, a month, six months, whatever, and then got released, and all of them experienced -- repeated the same experience again and again. So, these practices and the similarities that we heard from the various testifiers show us that we're talking about pattern, about a policy, and not about a specific occasions. And in that sense, you know, you mentioned that a man and what we heard or what we know now is that Sde Teiman is actually just the tip of the iceberg as much as it concerned the treatment of Israel, of its Palestinians detainees.",

And, you know, one other thing that we heard again and again is the lack of medical treatment, right?

So, they do not deserve the same medical care as everyone else. MATTHEW CHARLES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Satellite imagery obtained by CNN shows how the Sde Teiman facility was expanded after the October 7th attacks, with detention facilities and makeshift medical bays being added after public hospitals in Israel refused to treat injured guards and suspects.

And I'm sure revenge is something that is very much instill into us, almost by our government, almost as, you know, a framework of how we're doing things. This is our conception of security. The way we keep us secure is to abuse, to kill, to distract how much as we can of the Palestinian people.

In this case, we havereceived response from the Israeli prison service, which is responsible for these detention centers. Here's what they told us today. We are not aware of the claims you described, and as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility. Nonetheless, prisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined and addressed by official authorities. They went on to say this, since October 7, 2023, as instructed by Minister Ben-Gvir, the prison conditions of the national security prisoners have been made strict in accordance with the minister's policy of stopping the improved prison conditions they have received in the past. Now, as you know, and perhaps our viewers know, Itamar Ben-Gvir is the extreme right-wing, one of the authorities that are in coalition that keep the Netanyahu government propped up. And he has been made minister of national security. He has also said since October 7th that he is proud that, during my time, we have changed all the conditions, i.e., in the prison services where they have deteriorated sharply.

As I look at the United States of America, we are a nation that is built on the idea of hope and optimism.

But it should not allow the philanthropist to overlook the economic injustice which makes philanthropy necessary. And so, what Dr. King was saying was something different than Rockefeller or Carnegie or Mellon or Ford said. What he was saying was it's not just about generosity, charity, giving back. He was saying that it was about human dignity, justice.

And so, at the Ford Foundation, we've been looking for ways to model and demonstrate how we bring about a broader sense of ownership in our society. So, for example, one of the initiatives we are working on, Ownership Works, seeks to ensure that workers have equity ownership in the companies they work for. My grandfather, who was semi-literate with the third-grade education, was a porter, a shoeshine man in his -- the oil company where he worked. He got equity. He was a participant in a profit-sharing plan that allowed him to retire with dignity. When we look at the landscape for retirement for American workers today, it's rather stark because we know from research that significant numbers of Americans are not prepared.

For example, you helped fund the Met Opera's first production by a black composer, Terence Blanchard, and the thing was called \"Fire Shut Up in My Bones.\" I interviewed him about it.

Indeed, the Metropolitan Opera had accepted a commission in the early 1900s only to reject it when they learned that the lyricist was a black man, because they said American audiences would not accept the idea of a black person creating opera. This was high art. When we look at the visual arts, the numbers of great American artists who have simply been erased, who were ignored because gatekeepers deemed their work not worthy of fine art. These are ways in which hierarchical systems more broadly in society manifest in the arts. And the arts are important, Christiane, because they tell us who we are. They are the soundtrack for who we are as a people. And unfortunately, for far too long in American history, that soundtrack has not been full.

Just this week, there was some information that came out about the Georgia State Election Board, and this is otherwise a pretty obscure, small kind of group of people who worked quietly.

So, what happened in Georgia is, I think the best way to explain it is to go back towhat happened on January 6th, because what you saw on that day was a massive pressure campaign levied at Former Vice President Mike Pence to use his role as vice president in certifying elections to somehow take that duty, and use it as a means to delay, obstruct, or block the certification of Joe Biden as president. And the word that a lot of constitutional lawyers like to throw around, and ultimately, we're convincing to him to go through and do the right thing, is that you have a ministerial duty to just count, open up the results from the states, see what happened and certify the results. And so, what you see happening at a local level, not just in Georgia, but it has happened in other places as well, is that there are other officials who look at that certification, that ministerial role and say, OK, well maybe there is an opportunity to do more than just count the votes here. And so, what happened in Georgia is that this board of elections created a rule to say that county officials at the certification process can conduct a, quote, reasonable inquiry into the results.",

I mean, this isn't a good thing by any means, to becoming targets. And we really saw a lot of this happen in the 2020 election. Yes, there was this pressure campaign in squarely at Mike Pence to get him to not perform his ministerial duty. We're seeing that play out. But you also saw pressure campaigns aimed at just regular people, you know, election workers that later ended up testifying to the January 6th Committee, like Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, and you know, just regular people doing their jobs, often in a volunteer capacity, being targeted by a lot of bad faith actors. And so, that was, you know, incredibly terrible. But at the same time, there has been a lot of accountability for what has happened as a result of those election denial conspiracies. And, you know, I think there's a big gap, right? Because most people look at what happened, and they think there hasn't been accountability because we haven't got to that step with the person who called a lot of this into action, who was Donald Trump. But going down the line, I mean, if you look at the fraudulent elector scheme, if you look at people like -- I'm thinking of the attorneys in Michigan that tried to tamper with voting equipment, and the point is, you know, the downstream effects that this had, the people who went down this route have had a very hard road, right? And so, that is the kind of deterrent effect that we need. That is why we need the rule of law to be in place to uphold these things and uphold these processes. So, once again, I mean, we're probably going to have the largest voter turnout election ever again. Despite all of this, we have incredible voter turnout. So, we have people who do have faith in the process, who do want to participate in it. And, you know, a big part of that is making sure there is accountability. And when people do get these ideas about, well, maybe I can play games of the certification, we have people talking to them, like my colleagues at Protect Democracy do, and just say, like, this is what the law says.

I mean, if you think about how long ago this happened andhow long it took for this conviction to finally be secured, that does seem like the law of justice takes a long time. But ultimately, it does catch up. But, Secondly, it's really unfortunate. This woman was clearly caught up in a conspiracy of lies that were promoted, you know, by the former president and people like Mike Lindell, who she was, you know, just by account of the prosecutors in this case, when you look at what was stated in the indictment, she was really caught up in trying to find this fraud that they promised she would find if only she would do these things. And it's really unfortunate that she went through and did these things. But it is -- it should be a deterrent for other people who may be considering future action like this and that you will not be a hero to a certain conservative base. Ultimately, you will be risking jail, which is sad.",

I mean, I would say, you know, a lot of the work that happens at the local level is just, you know, nuts and bolts educationabout what the processes are, you know, what to do when you are possibly targeted with one of these bad faith actors, what resources are available to you because, you know, our democracy depends on, you know, a lot of people just volunteering their time, working in jobs where, you know, many times they're not fairly compensated. They're not getting the compensation, you know, that the hours would lead to. I mean, we think about these election officials, we think of high-ranking people. You know, a lot of people volunteering at the polls, they just want resources. What do you do when you encounter, you know, this kind of, you know, conspiracy theory that's happening on your Facebook page? You know, what resources do I have? Who can I go to for help? You know, what are -- what does the law instruct me to do? So, that I can go back to my community and say, this is what the rules are. This is what I can do. And this is how you can participate in this process. So, I would say, you know, more than anything, it's just nuts and bolts education, networking with each other, letting them know what resources are available to them if they encounter problems. And just -- the real basic kind of stuff. But you can't overlook it because I think we've learned when you come under attack, which is a new thing with our elections, we are facing new things, not just from the political class, but just social media and everything else. There's a lot of noise. And once people feel like they're alone in this, and they don't have the help, and we're actually not all in this together, that's when it's easy to walk away, and we need the good guys to stay on the field. We can't abandon, you know, our voting booths. We can't abandon this just because it's been a little rocky. And so, I mean, the really good news is that there's a lot of people with good intentions who want the good things to happen that keep this thing going. And so, it's been really rewarding.",

And the one bright point of light that I have seen is the -- I think the Republicans going back to supporting the mail-in ballot. In 2020, there was a lot of resistance to mail-in voting, which is a wonderful necessary option for people who cannot get to the polls on election day, that might be because you're disabled and it might be because you have to work, it may be because you have two kids you got to take care of at home and the prospect of dragging them to the booth to stand in line for eight hours is really too much to contemplate, or maybe you can't stand in line for eight hours on election day, right? Like a lot of people are just not able to do that, let alone have the time to do it. And so, I think there's recognition now that, yes, mail-in voting is a safe and secure option.

And as a result of this -- just the horrifying images we saw, the testimony from the brave capital and Washington D.C. police officers who continue to speak out about the actual reality of what happened on that day, I really do believe a lot of people's eyes have opened. They have reconsidered a lot of things about who they're going to vote for, you know, what -- how they may possibly participate in politics in the future. And so, yes, there's good reason to be optimistic, but I wouldn't be working the job that I do today if I thought it was a sure thing. I don't believe it's a sure thing. I believe that we all have a role to play in this process. We have to be vigilant.
