And that new date is June 5th, according to the Treasury Secretary. In a letter to congressional leadership, including the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, Secretary Yellen writes, quote, \"Based on the most recent available data, we now estimate that Treasury will have insufficient resources to satisfy the government's obligations if Congress has not raised or suspended the debt limit by June 5th.\" A senior White House official telling me on Friday that this new timeline doesn't fundamentally change the negotiations but it certainly does inject a new sense, added sense, perhaps, of urgency to those talks. This official also said that they are now in the final stages of negotiation and that they believe they are on track to reach a deal to avoid default by June 5th. We know that one of the major sticking points in that final stage of negotiations has been this issue of work requirements for those social safety net programs.

We saw just this past week, in the last few days, Ukraine claiming it hit a Russian reconnaissance ship in the Black Sea with a maritime drone. Russia says there was no hit there. There was a mysterious derailment of a train, a freight train, in Crimea just over a week ago. And, of course, we've seen incursions, that recent incursion into Belgorod; other strikes across the border in Russia's border regions. All of this potentially fitting that pattern. And, of course, Mariupol in itself very significant, the first city, big city that Russia managed to take over in this war. The only one, in fact, that it's managed to hold on to. Of course it lost control of Kherson in November. And we know that it's an important staging ground for Russian forces in the south of the country. So significant that this was hit again. It was, by the way, also hit by explosions just about a week ago. So I think this is a pattern that we're seeing, of more and more strikes, more and more incidents behind Russian lines.",

This is the first time that we have seen Turkiye's opposition this unified. We are talking about six very different political parties, when it comes to that political spectrum, coming together behind one single candidate, Kemal Kilicdaroglu. They succeeded in getting around 45 percent of the vote in the first round. That is a significant feat for the opposition but not enough to get them over the threshold. But on the other side, President Erdogan is continuing to rally for support. The AK Party achieved 49.5 percent of the vote in the first round, just short of that 50 percent plus 1 percent to get over the threshold. The party that came third pledging its support for Erdogan. Their candidate was successful in achieving around 5 percent of the vote in the first round. So there have been some describing him as a sort of kingmaker. Potentially that 5 percent difference could be enough to get President Erdogan over the line in this second round. But it's important to note that other politicians from that third party have also backed Kemal Kilicdaroglu on the opposition. So it's not set in stone. It's not a definite switch of votes to President Erdogan. But it is certainly a good sign for President Erdogan.

He was sentenced to 18 years in federal prison on Thursday. His deputy, Kelly Meggs, 12 years. And two others, Kenneth Harrelson from Florida four years and Jessica Watkins 8.5 years. The judge who delivered all of these sentences on Thursday and Friday, his name is Amit Mehta. He's a federal judge in D.C. And he assessed each person differently but recognized that all of these people were not foot soldiers; they were people who played different specific and very important roles within this Oath Keepers group that assembled on January 6th. So Stewart Rhodes clearly was much different than the rest. None of them would have been there if he had not decided to bring his organization together on January 6th and to assemble them. But these others were involved in planning or organization or making sure there were guns stationed around Washington, D.C. So each were sentenced for different things, all of them being determined by the judge that they had encaged in crimes of domestic terrorism, a pretty significant thing that resulted in those harsh sentences. But each of these people in court during their sentences developed a very different portrait, too, of what political extremism in America looks like now. So Stewart Rhodes, he was unrepentant. He was saying that he still believed that the election of 2020 was illegitimate, that it was a regime of the government that was currently in place that he did not agree with or believed should be there. And he said he would continue to have these beliefs, even while he serves that 18-year prison sentence. Others were much more apologetic. But there are more sentencings to be done. The federal judge on this case will hear four additional defendants, the arguments for their sentences next week, and determine how much time each of those people in the Oath Keepers' case should be facing -- Katelyn Polantz, CNN, Washington.

South Korean authorities arrested the man and, according to the Yonhap news agency, he told police he felt suffocated and wanted to get off the plane quickly.CNN's Paula Hancocks has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It is every traveler's worst nightmare, an emergency door opening while the airplane is still in the air. Asiana Airlines says, two to three minutes before landing, while the aircraft was about 700 feet from the ground, a man in his 30s, sitting in the emergency seat, opened the door. A less-than-one-hour-long flight from Jeju to Daegu in South Korea turned into a nightmare for 200 passengers and crew. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Maybe the man tried to get off the plane. A flight attendant said, \"Help, help,\" and about 10 passengers stood up and pulled him in. HANCOCKS (voice-over):  Police arrested the man, saying he confessed to opening the door but gave no reason. KIM JONG-CHAN, DAEGU POLICE OFFICER (through translator):  We weren't able to talk properly with him. He was not in a good mental state. He could not even hold himself up.",

GEOFFREY THOMAS, AIRLINERATINGS.COM:  It seems implausible that the door could be opened in the first place and then against the airstream, technically impossible. But somehow or other, it has happened. HANCOCKS:  Airbus said in a statement, \"We are looking into the circumstances of this incident. Aircraft doors can usually only be opened upon touchdown.\" Asiana says the cabin was automatically depressurized before landing. Twelve people were treated for hyperventilation, nine of them in hospital. Officials say all injuries were minor, a relatively benign outcome, considering the obvious danger -- Paula Hancocks, CNN, Seoul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
