You see, he has to say certain things to motivate his people as he did in Iowa there and, you know, people really cheer that.

Will his presidency turn into a dictatorship? The odds are, again, pretty good.\"And then, at The Atlantic, you mentioned, David Frum writes, \"Trump would arrive with a much better understanding of the system's vulnerabilities, more willing enablers in tow, and much more focused agenda of retaliation against his adversaries and impunity for himself.

RITCHIE TORRES (D), MEMBER, HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE: Look, there's often been a double standard against Israel when it comes to condemning the sheer butchery and barbarism of Hamas. Public officials have a moral obligation to speak with clarity, rather than caveats. And I found it deeply troubling, for example, that the U.N. woman, the so-called woman's rights arm of the United Nations, went 50 days without commenting on or condemning the sexual atrocities in the mosque perpetrated against Israeli woman.

It's expected that in the coming weeks, there will be a more concerted push for Biden to talk about some of these agenda items. Now some of the items that he's expected to push it for in a second term would include extending those price cuts for insulin and other drugs that are currently benefiting Medicare enrollees trying to expand that to the full American public. Another issue is also trying to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies that have made Obamacare -- health care obtain on the Obamacare exchanges more affordable. Those are currently set to expire in 2025. He is hoping to make them a permanent beyond that.
