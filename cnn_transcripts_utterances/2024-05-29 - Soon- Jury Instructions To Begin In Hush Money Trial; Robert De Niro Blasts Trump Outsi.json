Those 12 New Yorkers are about to undertake the task of deciding whether former President Donald Trump is a felon. In just a few hours, Judge Juan Merchan will deliver jury instructions and then deliberations will begin. So, in theory, we could have a verdict as soon as today. Yesterday, closing arguments in Trump's hush money trial began with the defense focused on tearing down the credibility of Michael Cohen, calling him the MVP of liars, the human embodiment of reasonable doubt, and the GLOAT, standing for the greatest liar of all time. Prosecutors pushed back, arguing that there was plenty of corroboration for Cohen's testimony, both from documents and the testimony of others, particularly former tabloid publisher David Pecker, and while the legal drama unfolded inside the courtroom, the political drama played out on the streets of Lower Manhattan. Trump's supporters and critics sparred outside with the actor Robert De Niro playing the role of attack dog against the former president. (VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)",

Now, when I talked to Trump campaign officials, they maintained that this had nothing to do with the fact that Donald Trump was inside the courthouse, that it was the simple fact that all of the media was gathered in this location, so they decided to come to them.I do, of course, believed that there it is, right. There is a reason that they were outside of the courtroom, even though the majority of what we heard was actually about January 6 and argument that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy. But it's notable because it represents a sort of shift in how the Biden campaign is thinking as this trial winds down. We've also heard that Joe Biden himself might be addressing the trial after wraps from the White House. And so, there is a shift going on and I think that is in part because the Biden campaign has seen that their poll numbers are struggling, that they need to do something different. But it also is the fact that for better or for worse, this trial has taken up a lot of oxygen and all of that oxygen is going to Trump and it's been very difficult for the Biden campaign to really get through.",

Now, whether or not you believe that is one thing, but it is true so that he is on the primetime shows. He is on every podcast, he is being talked about a lot.And what's interesting is so far this trial hasn't really made waves in the polling. Voters don't seem to have tuned in. Now that could change if he is found guilty. And so, we will see if he is indeed found guilty, if the Trump campaign changes their strategy. But so far, they viewed this as we're going to say that this is all politically motivated. It worked for us in the primary and it is working for us so far in the general election. So why change when we haven't really seen any major negative effects?",

There certainly preparing for that very possible reality now, as well, and they're -- they're preparing for it in terms of how do they message that. But they're also preparing for a hung jury and how they message that.And so I think if you -- depending on who you talk to in Trump's orbit, you'll hear different things. Some people think that the case is so weak that there's no chance that you'll get convicted. Other people are saying honestly, I have no idea. And so, it's really interesting to talk to these folks over the past few weeks and months, because there is such a varying degree as to what's going to happen in the next few days.",

So that's an issue.I think immediately the implications or what happens Security Council today when there'll be discussing a ceasefire, yet again. And all eyes really on the U.S. If these were American weapons, surely they have some responsibility here is the argument about those that want them to go for a ceasefire. But whether or not there is a ceasefire, moving been there before, haven't we, you know, the security council hasn't called for a ceasefire, but it does put the spotlight on the U.S. at the U.N., and its role here and exactly where that red line is because it -- you know, it's very difficult to see right now.",

There's some severe, meaning we're just finding some heavy rain at times in some lightning not really finding the wind gust this morning, but we could continue to find maybe some damaging winds and large hail and an isolated case, not nearly as bad as yesterday, over parts of Texas from Shreveport, back down into Houston. We'll find that level two out of five flight, slight rest for rapid city, back down towards Denver in the high plains. As we go through the day today, again, a couple plus dorms possible, but not as destructive as yesterday, going into tomorrow, we could find additional storms blowing over the Texas and Oklahoma panhandle.
