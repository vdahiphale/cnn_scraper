There is no place that China is going to tell me where I can go or who I can speak to, whether you be foe or whether you be friend. (END VIDEO CLIP) COLLINS Now, it is not often that McCarthy and Nancy Pelosi agree. But Pelosi, who made her own trip to Taiwan, recently commended McCarthy's meeting, saying that it is to be committed for its leadership, bipartisan participation in distinguished and historic venue. All of this is coming as this morning, Taiwan's defense ministry says that it has detected Chinese warships around the island after that meeting happened. They're also keeping a close eye on this Chinese aircraft carrier strike group as it is passing nearby. These are photos that were taken just yesterday. Back in August, as we know, China launched massive military drills. They fired missiles near Taiwan, because they were so angry over Pelosi's visit to the self-governing island. Joining us now is CNN congressional correspondent Lauren Fox, who is on Capitol Hill and our CNN correspondent, Selina Wang, who is in Beijing.

They've repeatedly condemned this visit.And that's not a surprise, because Beijing reacts furiously every time Taiwanese leaders have these sorts of high-profile international meetings. And that's because Beijing sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that is part of its territory. So this is what China's foreign ministry said after the meeting. Quote, \"China will take resolute and strong measures to firmly defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The U.S. and Taiwan are colluding with each other, using transit as a pretext to condone Taiwan independence separatists to engage in political activities in the U.S.\" But so far, when it comes to the actual response on the ground, Kaitlan, China has been far more restrained. Wednesday morning, Beijing sent a large-scale patrol and rescue vessel to the Taiwan Strait. Then Wednesday evening, Taiwan tracked a Chinese aircraft carrier group passing through the waters of Southeast Taiwan. That response is far less than how China reacted last summer when Nancy Pelosi went to Taiwan. Now, part of that reason is because this trip is taking place on American soil, not in Taiwan. Beijing has also been trying to reconnect with the world after dropping its harsh zero-COVID policy. So it may not want to overshadow its diplomatic role with war games, Kaitlan.",

Now, these two sides were previously major adversaries and had severed diplomatic relations in 2016. So this is a big diplomatic win for China. And it's significant here that Washington was on the sidelines, especially since the Middle East has for so long been shaped by American involvement. So at this meeting in Beijing, Saudi Arabia and Iran's foreign minister, signed an agreement to reopen embassies and consulates in their countries. And now the big context amid all of this is that it comes as Beijing has been casting Xi Jinping has this global peace maker, and he has been on a diplomatic roll.

He spoke almost directly to Lynne Tracy, who's the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to Moscow. And he basically said you may not agree with me, but U.S. support for the color revolutions -- These are the pro-democracy uprisings in Eastern Europe in the 2000s -- played -- played a role in that, as did U.S. support for the toppling of the -- equal to a coup (ph), by the way, the toppling of the Ukrainian authorities in 2014 in that other pro-Western pro-democracy rising that led to the Russian intervention in the country back in 2014. It was quite an awkward exchange, because it wasn't just the United States ambassador there. There were other ambassadors, as well, presenting their credentials. For instance, to the Danish ambassador, he said, you know, we need to work out who basically attacked the gas pipeline, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline last year.
