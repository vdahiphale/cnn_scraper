Natasha reporting that the U.S. says there have been 78 drone strikes within that Syria region since 2021 by these Iranian proxies. First, what does that mean, Iranian proxy when we're talking about this? And number two, what are they up to if they're striking the U.S. so much there? GEN. WESLEY CLARK, (Ret.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: So these are groups that are affiliated with Hezbollah or other groups in the region. They are conducting resupply reconnaissance operations. They're building their forces against Israel. They're supporting Bashar al-Assad to some extent. The Israelis go against them. And our mission there is to support our allies, both our Kurdish allies working against ISIS, and also we collect information and intelligence. Now, why this is particularly disturbing is when they're able to bring accurate targeting against the United States and inflict casualties, this raises the level of risk for our personnel in the region. Attacks mortars, a mortar falls inaccurately and so forth. That's an attack. A drone that hits a barracks facility and takes out five service members, that's a different order of magnitude. So we're retaliating. The question is, will we have to actually defend against these drones in order to maintain our footprint in the region. We don't want to do that. Obviously, we don't want to escalate against Iran, as the Secretary of Defense said. So this is raising the risks for us and creating some policy dilemmas.",

That would give them greater control in the region, also reduce our ability to support Iraq and give them greater influence there.It's all part of Iran's quest for regional hegemony, and we're there to block it in a very and we're doing so in a very efficient, safe manner.

Because what's happening here and what's become urgent for Canada is that there's been an influx of migrants coming from the U.S. into Canada. So what is this agreement? It's called the Safe Third Country Agreement. It was signed in 2002, implemented in 2004, and it applies to individuals crossing at official border crossings, also known as ports of entry.So if they cross through, they can seek protection in Canada. But if they came from the U.S. and they can also claim asylum in the U.S., which is deemed a safe country, then Canada can push them back to continue that claim in the United States. What it didn't apply to, though, was unofficial border crossings. And what has been happening as of late is there's been an influx of migrants crossing in Roxham Road, that is a street connecting New York and Quebec, and they have seen an influx of migrants crossing there, nearly 5000 in January. Canadian authority, according to Canadian statistics. So what the Canadians have been trying to do is close that loophole. And now we know that they have reached a deal. So that means that migrants who cross at that road as well could be turned back to the United States and vice versa. Now, of course, we've been hearing from the Biden administration about an influx of border crossings on the U.S. southern border. They're also seeing migrants cross from Canada into the U.S. Those numbers, though, still low, nearly 2000 since October into February. In a day, John, just to give you some perspective on the U.S. southern border, authorities can encounter up to 5000. So of course these numbers are still small in comparison.
