The final details, though, still needing to be worked out.I want to get right to CNN's Jim Sciutto. So, Jim, what is the latest that you're hearing on this front?",

      "sentences": "Omar, I spoke to a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations and I'm told that they did make progress yesterday in these talks to the point that they're in the discussion of final details, final paragraphs of an agreement, right down to nuts and bolts issues such as the names of Palestinian hostages that would be released - or prisoners rather that would be released in exchange for Israeli hostages held by Hamas.Now, that does not - certainly does not guarantee that they reach a final agreement, but they did make progress. And particularly I'm told that one of the most intractable sticking points could end up being surmountable. And that's the question of a continued Israeli military presence in Gaza. The debate, the discussion at this point seems to be focused on what constitutes a densely populated area with Israel agreeing to withdraw from densely populated areas, but perhaps keep forces in less populated areas around the border between Gaza and Egypt. Again, they haven't worked out that final agreement, but I'm told that particularly when you look at Hamas' public statements that at the negotiating table Hamas seems to be more amenable to some compromise than it is letting on in some of its public comments. Again, all this comes with caveats that these deals can break apart and that the last mile can be the most difficult mile. The other point that's been told to me is that there is some hope following the exchange of fire on Sunday that Hezbollah's expected attack on Israel, now that it has happened, and it was largely defended by Israel, that that has received - has removed a potential point of pressures that Hamas was hoping. Hamas was hoping that a large attack might force Israel into bigger concessions now that Hezbollah, for now, has carried out its attack, that that might remove some leverage. Again, all these comes with caveats. But this U.S. official, with knowledge of the talks, says that they did make some progress on Sunday.",

      "sentences": "All right, Brigadier General Steve Anderson is joining me now to discuss more on this.And while the Middle East conflict continues, there was a massive Russian assault on Ukraine overnight. Just moments ago, Russia's defense ministry announced it hit all its targets. More than 100 missiles and up to 100 drones hit multiple cities across the country, leaving at least four people dead. President Zelenskyy is calling it one of the largest attacks that Ukraine has faced yet. All right, to you, Brigadier General, how long can Ukraine continue to fend off Russia when you see an attack like this one? BRIG. GEN. STEVE ANDERSON, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, thank you, Sara. You know, that's a very good question. This is a war of attrition. Neither side is truly capable of conducting decisive military actions against the other. So, what you're going to see is continued actions like this, you know, attacks against the people, attacks against hospitals and schools and apartment buildings. I mean that's right out of Vladimir Putin's playbook because that's really all that he can do. His military is just not good enough to really penetrate Ukraine. They've been on (ph) Donbass now for two-and-a-half years. Again, a war of attrition. He's simply targeting energy. He's targeting - he's trying to make things painful for the people. He tried to put political pressure on Zelenskyy, you know, and I just don't think that that's going to work because the Ukrainian people are incredibly strong.",

But the question is, do they have the weapons? Do they have the ammunition and the - and the number of soldiers that they need to try and continue this until which time they're hopefully able, in Zelenskyy's words, to end this war.I do want to go now to the Middle East. We heard from Jim Sciutto. His reporting is that Hamas seems to be more amenable to compromise when it comes to what is happening in Gaza, the Israel-Gaza War, than they are putting out publicly.

But the fact that they're really getting into nuts and bolts of the IDF withdrawal and you define withdrawal from the populated areas, I mean that's a really, really good sign.

So, some people didn't make it back to the village until well into the day on Friday. SIDNER: What is your warning to people? Because it is so beautiful. It's so enticing to go see the Grand Canyon.

So, if you're going to be in the Grand Canyon, especially on the floor of the Grand Canyon during monsoon season, to watch the weather, watch the radar, heed the warnings, take it seriously because it changed so quickly. There wasn't a whole lot of time to make decisions and react.So, if anything, maybe don't be in a slot (ph) canyon during monsoon season.",

Top NASA leadership were simply not confident enough that this Boeing Starliner spacecraft that got those two NASA astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, up to the International Space Station was safe enough to get them home, especially when they had a viable backup option in the pipeline. And that backup option is Boeing's big competitor, SpaceX.And so now the Starliner spacecraft that got Butch and Suni to space, its first crewed test flight is going to be going back to earth without a crew. That's going to happen sometime in early September. And then Butch and Suni are going to be staying up at the International Space Station until February of 2025 before hitching a ride back to earth on a SpaceX crewed Dragon. But, you know, Sara, when you talk to NASA leaders, they say, look, we're acutely aware that NASA has made mistakes in the past. Look at what happened with the Challenger accident. Look at what happened with the Columbia tragedy. Those were times when NASA engineers didn't feel comfortable or confident enough to raise their hand and speak up and have management really listened to them in a meaningful way. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson saying today they are not willing to make that mistake again. That they've learned lessons from the past, and that's why they made this decision over the weekend.

He is now funding a test and development program with SpaceX. This mission called Polaris Dawn.And what they're going to be doing is the world's first commercial spacewalk. Sara, up until this point only NASA astronauts or government astronauts have ever actually gone outside of a vehicle. This is the first time that just private citizens are going and to be doing this. And what you're going to see is the entire Dragon capsule opening up, all four people inside exposed to the vacuum of space. Never been done before.
