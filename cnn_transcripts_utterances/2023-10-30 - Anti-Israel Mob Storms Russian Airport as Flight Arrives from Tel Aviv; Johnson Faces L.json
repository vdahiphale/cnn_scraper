Authorities there had to close an airport and divert flights when a crowd of anti-Israeli protesters broke in to protest an incoming flight from Israel.In photos and videos verified by CNN, a mob outside the airport held signs that says, \"We are against Jewish refugees\", then a crowd forced its way into locked doors at the international terminal and even onto the runway, terrifying those who had just landed there. According to the Dagestan health ministry, clashes left at least ten people injured. The Kremlin blamed what they called external interference for the antisemitic riots. CNN has reached out to Red Wing Airlines for a comment. The Hamas attacks have caused a significant shift here in Israel among many in the ultra-orthodox Jewish community. Traditionally, they refused to sign up for military service, which is mandatory for most men and women in Israel after their 18th birthday, but that's changing. After the October 7th Hamas attack that killed 1,400 men, women and children. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SIDNER (voice-over):  Moti Leitner reads the Torah at least an hour every day. His family is one of the 1.2 million ultra-orthodox Jews or Hassidim who live here in Israel. For decades, many in his community have fought against Israel's mandatory military service for every Jewish Israeli man and woman as soon as they turn 18. This year, the ultra-orthodox tried to get a law passed to exempt them from having to enlist, a major source of friction in Israeli society. Then, October 7th happened. Have you ever fired a weapon, picked up a weapon before?",

Here is how he is kicking it off.A vote on $14.5 billion in aid for Israel is one thing that they are going to focus on this week, plus a trio of censure and expulsion resolutions. The new Republican leadership is also pushing ahead on three spending bills to try and move towards heading off another government shutdown, because in the midst of all the chaos over the speaker's gavel, you will remember time was running out and the government is set to run out of money in less than three weeks. CNN's Sunlen Serfaty is on Capitol Hill for us this week. And it's good to see you, Sunlen. The first full week as House speaker and already facing a legislative test.",

Sources tell CNN they are in a conference call with the Republicans last night, he indicated that he wants to move forward with an aid package to Israel this week, that $14.5 billion aid package.And on that call, he revealed two important details here, one is that he wants to move this bill forward and make it completely paid for and, two, that he wants to move the bill as a stand-alone bill meaning that he does not want to tie the aid to Israel to aid for Ukraine, like the Senate wants to do so that potentially sets up a showdown with the Senate in how they want to approach these aid packages. Also on the plate is a series -- a triple plate, if you will, of these side issues, these censure resolutions aimed at punishing members in the house. First, you have the resolution to expel George Santos. And then you have censure Marjorie Taylor Greene, in addition to the measure to censure Rashida Tlaib over her comments over Israel. So, certainly that adding some thorny issues into the new speaker's agenda of this week. In addition, all of this, as you have said, Johnson is also staring down a potential government shutdown next month. He needs to figure out a way to fund the government. So, certainly, as they approach week number one in this new job, Kate, he certainly will be -- people will be watching him as he navigates these big ticket items and also these side thorny issues that his house conference are dealing with -- Kate.",

This morning, new polling data out of Iowa shows Donald Trump holding this commanding lead, despite legal troubles.A new \"Des Moines Register\"/NBC News poll shows Trump 27 points ahead -- 27 points ahead of his closest competitors. Nikki Haley has gone up. She is now basically in a tie with Ron DeSantis for second place. With me now, CNN's senior political commentator and author of the new book \"Renegade: Defending Democracy and Liberty in Our Divided Country\". And actually, I want to talk to you about the tie-in between his book which is wonderful, \"Renegade\", and that poll which we just showed, not seen there, Mike Pence because he dropped out on Saturday because his campaign never got off the ground basically due to his actions, one might presume, on January 6th. Not following along to overturn the results of the election. So he's gone. You're out of Congress right now, it was your choice to not run again, but people who did not toe the line, did not go the Trump way, don't seem to be finding a place in the Republican Party.",

The reason I tell my story is not because I want everybody to hear my story, but because it tells the broader story of the party.

I get it, but this was such a serious moment that we could have, I think, had a chance at actually taking the narrative of this.
