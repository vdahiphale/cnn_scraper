Yes, inflation is too high, and yes, there are worries about a recession, but the economy ended last year strong. This is GDP gross domestic product, the sum of all goods and services produced in the world's largest economy. GDP bounced back from a stall in the first half of the year to register a solid fall and winter. For the year overall, 2.1 percent growth, that follows a blockbuster 2021. That was the strongest economy since Ronald Reagan was president.Now the U.S. economy has now recovered all the lost output from the COVID crash and has returned to its growth potential. That's a milestone. Now, yes, you've heard about big tech names unwinding their red-hot pandemic hiring, those layoffs in the news every day, but overall layoffs remain low. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 6000 to just 186,000. Kate, that's the lowest since April. No one knows for sure what will happen this year as the Fed's tough medicine works its way through the economy, of course, but it will happen from a strong base for jobs and the overall economy, Kate.",

And we will hear it from the district attorney who is the person that is responsible for charges in the case. We also know that two of the attorneys for the five officers who have already been fired and who could face charges are also going to be having a press conference not long after we hear from the district attorney. We're expecting that in the next couple of hours or so. And so, we will let you know what they said. I will tell you what the family has said. The family has said -- his mother in particular, Nichols' Mother has said I do not want to see anything less than murder charges.

They wanted to see charges in this case. They believe that they should see charged in this case, especially because the police chief herself has said what she saw from her own officers was inhumane.
