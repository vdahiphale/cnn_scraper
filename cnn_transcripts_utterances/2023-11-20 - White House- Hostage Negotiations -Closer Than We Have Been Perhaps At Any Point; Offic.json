We've spent the last eight years trying to negotiate a deal that would release two Israeli soldiers -- armies that were killed in 2014 -- and two Israeli civilians who were held by Hamas since 2014. We were not successful there. I tried to get him to spend a few days with me either in Norway and Switzerland where we would brainstorm together. That never happened. In the last month, I was pushing him to meet me for a few days in Cairo. But what happened during this war as I was trying to advance a deal on the release of women, children, and elderly hostages in exchange for women and prisoners under the age of 18 in Israeli jails, in transferring messages back and forth it became apparent to me that he was out of the circle of decisionmakers being in Beirut and not connected to Gaza anymore. And then he went on air on Lebanese television in which he justified the terrorist actions of Hamas inside of Israel and said that we would do October 7 again, and again, and again a million times and that Israel needed to be annihilated. At that point, it was just too far. And the Ghazi Hamad that I've known for 18 -- 17 years is not the same Ghazi Hamad who is serving as the spokesperson for Hamas in this war.",

We -- as journalists, we have a very important rule -- verify -- trust but verify, right? I mean, one of the main things that I teach my students is whatever any government -- whether it's the Saudi government, Emirate government, or American government -- whatever they tell you, you need really to verify. It's the golden rule, which is accuracy and transparency.However, 40 -- four percent of Israeli citizens trust the government -- only four. So they are asking the American citizens to trust what they deliver as evidence without trusting our journalists actually to verify them. Any journalist, including Liebermann, is not allowed to access freely and every footage that he films has to be accessed by the IDF, reviewed by them, and censored by them. So I don't know what to call this. This is not transparency. This is something else. In the meantime, when they are saying that and delivering these kind of evidence that are obviously delivered by them, they're saying that they're bombarding other hospitals -- not only Al-Shifa Hospital, the Ahli Hospital, the Rantisi Hospital. Sixteen hospitals have been bombarded -- so hospitals. And their -- and their officials are telling us day in and day out in Israel and here in the United States that basically, in Gaza there is no innocent civilians. They are either people who are in cahoots with Hamas -- sympathizers -- or Hamas operatives. There's .2 -- two million -- two million people in Gaza. Fifty percent are children under the age of 15 that were not even born when Hamas came to power in '06. So again, I think we need to ask them what are -- what is really the objective?

We see this aggregate number of how the GDP is doing and the economy seems to be doing well, but then you see people who are at the lower end of the income scale who are struggling to make ends meet because inflation was so high. So now, we've seen over the course of the last year -- there's a great budget index that just came out that shows that people are now starting to see their incomes go ahead of inflation and they may now be about to beat inflation, which means people will have more money, which will help lessen some of the strife. Then, of course, you've got foreign policy out there. There's a lot of things that are really angering. And let's forget the cultural changes that have happened in America in the last decade and a half.
