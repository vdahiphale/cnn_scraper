An intruder, said to be drunk, somehow got into the home, of President Biden's National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan. We're told that no one was hurt, and the suspect got away, without Secret Service, even knowing. But the news comes, after a string of attacks, or threats of violence, against lawmakers, and federal workers. Just yesterday, a man, waving a bat, assaulted staffers, at the office, of Democratic congressman, Gerry Connolly. His father says, the suspect's father, says he was suffering, from schizophrenia. In March, one of Republican senator Rand Paul's staffers was stabbed in Washington. In February, Democratic congresswoman, Angie Craig, was assaulted, in the elevator, of her apartment building. And the most severe attack so far occurred in October, a man demanding to see then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, broke into her home, and attacked her husband, with a hammer. Joining me now, CNN Congressional Correspondent, Jessica Dean, along with L.A. Times Columnist, LZ Granderson; and Jason Osborne, a Republican strategist, and former Trump campaign adviser. All right, thank you all for being here. Jessica, I want to start with you. How did this happen? That Secret Service didn't notice this, when it was going on?",

And it's quite surprising. And so, now, as you would imagine, Secret Service is trying to get to the bottom of this, to figure out exactly how this happened.

I'm seeing the pressures of anyone, who has any public sort of presence that could be attached, to a political ideology, quite possibly being vulnerable, to someone, who may be mentally ill, or someone who has an opposing political viewpoint.

But Russia claims that they actually destroyed a Patriot air defense system. The barrage of missiles came from three sides, all at once, north, south and east, across front lines, reaching deep, inside Ukraine. And, on the Eastern Front, Ukraine says they have liberated substantial areas, north and south of Bakhmut, within the past few days. Joining me now, to make sense of all of this, the host of \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS,\" Fareed Zakaria himself. All right. Let's talk about if Russia can keep up this pace? We heard from the head of the Wagner Group that there was a problem, with munitions. Are we going to continue to see these kinds of barrages, in places, like Bakhmut, and also, surprisingly, which hasn't happened, in quite some time, Kyiv, the capital? FAREED ZAKARIA, HOST, CNN'S FAREED ZAKARIA GPS: Well, what you see with Russia is the outward appearance of extraordinary force and power. It's a very big country. It's a relatively rich country, with a huge army. And so, there's a lot of shock and awe, in being able to do this kind of thing that in some ways dazzles. But underneath it, think about what you just said. The head of the Wagner Group is openly feuding, with the Defense Minister, and the Defense Ministry, because he believes that they are -- the troops are insufficiently armed munitions of government. What is that all about? What that's about is the Russian army is flailing. It is doing badly, in areas, like Bakhmut. What they thought they were going to be able to take, the Ukrainian forces, and beat them? They have not been able to, despite the fact that they overwhelm, and overpower Ukrainian forces.

But he's also been very clear, from the start, that once he put out his budget, on March 9, when the Republicans put out theirs, he was willing to sit down, and have a separate budget negotiation. And as soon as they did, the President brought them together. People have been working. We've all been working, throughout the last week. The leaders met together, for the first time -- I mean, for the second time, within a week. And we're about to move to a new phase, where there'll be more direct communication, between the President's team, and the Speaker's team.

You can literally see them pummeling each other, there. Brown is held on the ground, but released after about a minute.Brown then begins to leave, but appears to turn around, and move toward the guard. That is when Anthony fires his gun. We are not showing you that because it is too disturbing. Anthony told Police that Brown repeatedly threatened to stab him, during that fight. Prosecutors ruled the guard's fear was reasonable. But Police have noted no knife was found in Brown's possession. Joining me now is John Burris, the attorney representing Banko Brown's family.

He's the one that attacked Banko. He's the one that beat him up, slugged him, tried to choke him, tossed him around, all over the place.And Banko tried to leave. And he was going back. He was backing out. And his arm was raised. And then, he was backing up, and he gets shot. He was not the aggressor. And so, that's why it's troubling to me, to have this view that the officer claims that he was the one that was in fear, when he was the one with the gun. He was the one that was assaulted -- physically assaulted Banko. So, it's hard for me to understand how the subjective intent can be acknowledged, and be accepted. Where are the objective facts to support it, like everyone else has to have? You can have an honest but unreasonable belief. Here, there was no evidence to support that he was trying to be attacked, and the fact, and there's no knife. So, we don't know if this was true. No one else heard this.",

He beat him up. That's not an occasion that you get to do just because a person has committed a small petty theft.So, the assault of conduct on part of the security officer was way beyond what was reasonable, and necessary. Stopping someone and talking to them is different than stopping them, and beating them up, and then ultimately killing them. There is no basis. Just because it's a petty theft, that didn't give you a right to use deadly force. And there's no weapon to support this notion. So, to me, it means to me that this was a shooting that was woefully unnecessary. And it seems to me this officer was particularly excited, because he jumped -- jumped Banko, right at the beginning. He never gave him a chance to talk, and try to surrender. He just beat him up, tossed him around. You said it was a battle. It wasn't a battle. This was a situation, where he was tossing him around. He was beating him up. He was on his back. He was choking in. If anything, the kid was trying to protect himself. So, and then he tried to get away. If he was not trying to get away, he --",

You don't have guns, in security placed in the banks. So, to me, that is a policy question was made. And then I understand, when I gather, there's been changes in the policy, over a period of time. So, the officers very well may not be clear about what their responsibilities are. And were they properly trained? Were they given authority that you stop someone, if they don't respond, you kill them, you shoot them? Is that a policy? If so, that's a wrongheaded policy, and one should not be accepted.
