It is the worst day since March for the Dow and the broader market and the tech market isn't showing any better. In fact, it's worse. If you look at the NASDAQ, that's off one-and-a-half percent. It is all about economic worries. People are deeply concerned about what's happening. Just about no stock in the Dow 30 is high, maybe one or two. We'll show you as the market moves and as the program moves on. The events that we're going to talk about over the next hour: President Biden has joined the striking car workers on the picket line. It's a first for a US president. The US government is now accusing Amazon of being a monopoly. And the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak prepares to defend weakening climate targets in next week's Tory Party Conference. Tonight, we have the head of Britain's Chamber of Commerce, who joins me. Indeed, I'm live in London tonight on Tuesday, September, the 26th. I'm Richard Quest, and yes, in London, I mean business. Good evening. President Biden made a historic show of solidarity with striking auto workers today, as he became the first sitting president to join a picket line, leaving no question, which side he is taking in this labor dispute.

You know, President Biden and the White House aides here at the White House have been careful to avoid sort of the perception that the president is taking sides in an ongoing labor dispute and ongoing negotiations, but you're very much right that with what he did today, visiting these auto workers at the picket line, and essentially saying yes, when he was asked by reporters, do you support these workers standing next to you getting, for example, a 40 percent pay raise, he did not take sides, essentially, in this ongoing negotiation. It is something again, that White House officials have been careful to try to sort of walk this tightrope. Yesterday, for example, when White House press secretary, Kaine Jean-Pierre was asked repeatedly whether the fact that he was going to Detroit meant that he was taking the side of the auto workers, she tried to say no, he is just showing -- he is just wanting to show his general support, but it doesn't mean that he is going to weigh in on the negotiations.

So over in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader and Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, have been in talks over a bipartisan plan to temporarily fund the government for around 45 days. And initially, they were thinking about adding an additional billion dollar -- multiple billion dollar aid package for Ukraine, but now it looks like they're not going to include that much money. They want to make this as the least controversial option that they can to make it most likely to get this thing passed. But over in the House, Speaker Kevin McCarthy has been trying to rally his Republican members around a conservative short-term plan to keep the government open, that would include tougher border security and that it also would include spending cuts. But it's unclear whether McCarthy would have the votes within his own ranks to even pass a bill like that. So the most likely scenario at this point is that the Senate is able to pass something in the next couple of days, and then, the decision is on McCarthy, whether he's going to take that bill up, which would likely infuriate his right flank and potentially could trigger a vote to remove him as speaker. Does he ignore it, which would trigger a shutdown? Or does he try to amend it and send it back? So those are the options for Kevin McCarthy right now.",

It is going to require some compromise between Democrats and Republicans. The question for McCarthy is, can he get enough wins that Democrats are willing to agree to, that his own conservatives are comfortable with? That they can at least swallow a deal at the end of the day, and that they're not going to try to force him out of the speakership. They did give him pass during the summer negotiations over the bipartisan debt ceiling deal, but it's unclear if they would be willing to give him a second pass here during these negotiations. Both sides are really agitating for a fight. You have hardliners who actually want a government shutdown. And so for Kevin McCarthy, it might ultimately come down to a choice.

Meanwhile, heavy fighting continues near the city of Bakhmut. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has traveled with a Ukrainian drone unit to see more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Rolling into battle as night falls, Ukraine's army attacking in the east around Bakhmut. PLEITGEN (on camera): For the Ukrainians, this is an extremely important, but also very complicated and potentially very dangerous mission and we're going to be located very close to where the Russians are. PLEITGEN (voice over): We are with a frontline drone unit called Code 9.2. Their drone, the Ukrainian made Vampire, the crew attaching the bombs, as artillery whistles over our heads. The Vampire is fully night vision capable and plays a soundtrack showing it means business. The team leader's callsign is \"Groove\" (ph) and he confirms because Ukraine doesn't have a modern Air Force. Tonight, they are the Air Force. (GROOVE speaking in foreign language.) PLEITGEN (voice over): \"The drones see in the night like in daylight,\" he says. \"We see the infantry. We hit the vehicles, cannons, everything we need to destroy.\" Groove also says, Russians from the Wagner private military company have returned to the battlefield around Bakhmut. (GROOVE speaking in foreign language.) PLEITGEN (voice over): \"Yes, there is Wagner here, too. They swiftly changed their commanders and have returned here,\" he says. \"We're breaking through their line of defense and hitting them well.\" As the drone takes off, the battle is already well underway. The Ukrainians using Western extended range artillery shells, and cluster munitions to attack Russian ground force. Groove is already busy targeting the Russians. (GROOVE speaking in foreign language.) PLEITGEN (voice over): \"Oh, something's burning,\" he says. His unit also managing to take out a Russian main battle tank by dropping several bombs on it. The Ukrainian army now starting to push forward. Our photojournalist, Dan Hodge films powerful explosions as armored vehicles advance in the moonlit night. PLEITGEN (on camera): We're now hearing a lot of fire -- a lot of outgoing fire, a lot of incoming fire actually also as well as the Ukrainians are trying to move forward and they say they want to take a key road away from the Russians. PLEITGEN (voice over): But the Russians are fighting back, firing flares to unmask the Ukrainians advance and hit Kyiv's forces. Groove remains unfazed hunting a Russian tactical vehicle before destroying it. The Code 9.2 drone team often hunts Russian armor here recently even destroying a modern T-90 tank in a highly complex operation. After more than a half dozen missions, the drone returns a final time. But as we tried to get away from the battlefield, a tire burst on our Humvee. No time for a spare, we push on. PLEITGEN (on camera): We just witnessed an extremely tough battle between the Russians and the Ukrainians, both sides going at it for hours with very heavy weapons and the area where we were, shells landed close to there on various occasions. Now, we're heading back to base. PLEITGEN (voice over): Hobbled but rolling after a long night on one of Ukraine's most dangerous frontline. Fred Pleitgen CNN, Bakhmut, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
