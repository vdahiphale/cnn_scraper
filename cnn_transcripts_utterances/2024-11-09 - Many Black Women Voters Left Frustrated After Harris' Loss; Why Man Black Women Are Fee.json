      "sentences": "They are frustrated. We're going to have a conversation about why and what comes next. And there also may be no surprise that the president says that his promise of mass deportations in the campaign is his number one presidential priority. The president also won Latino voters with a message on immigration and the economy. Someone who told me this was going to happen months ago is back with me.And later, children, college students, black people across two dozen states say they're getting these racist text messages that reference slavery and picking cotton. We're going to get some historical context from Michael Eric Dyson. So stay with us. Packed show. Let's start it right now. Well, first of all, this morning, I want to start with a little story, personal story. If you've never been to Atlanta Airport, there's a rotating art exhibition. Just as you're leaving Terminal T, you're headed out to baggage claim, going to your car. There are glass cases on either side and they're usually filled with works by local artists. And I love those shows. So usually I stop to check out the new pieces. But there was one particular day, 2016, it was March 15th. One portrait stopped me. And this is it. The name of it is Grandma's Glory. It's by Atlanta artist David Roby. An elderly black woman, bare feet, hair braided in a simple wooden chair wrapped in the American flag. I was awestruck. I couldn't move. I know I was in the way. And people were rushing by. I just could not take my eyes off of this. It's a stunning image, but also because we don't see black women like this featured in patriotic works. Right. Black women in Americana. I later learned that it was inspired by photographs of Ms. Milvertha Hendricks as she was wrapped in an American flag blanket after Hurricane Katrina. She was waiting to be evacuated in New Orleans. But there's an important difference between the photo and the painting. If you look closely at the woman in this painting, she's not just wrapped in the flag. Look at her hands, needle, and thread. I sat with this image this week again, awestruck, but for a different reason. 91 percent of black women, according to CNN exit polls, voted for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the first black woman president of the United States. And black women were 7 percent of the electorate. No other demographic across race or gender, age, income, education, married, rural, suburban. Nobody supported either candidate so abundantly. Now, black women have long been the backbone of the Democratic Party, but it warrants repeating, 91 percent. And less important than who they voted for is what they say they were voting for. Because you know what the most important issue for Harris voters was, according to CNN exit polls? It was not foreign policy. It wasn't the economy. It wasn't immigration. It wasn't abortion rights. It was American democracy. Think of it. This is a country that has never elected a black woman governor. Of the more than 11,500 members of Congress in the history of America, 60 have been black women. That's about one-half of 1 percent. And next session, two black women will serve in the Senate together for the first time ever. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, Elisa Bunt Rochester of Delaware. And still, so many black women voted to protect the democracy of a country. Let's make it plain here that for centuries denied their grandmothers and their great-grandmothers full participation in it. So, yes, I sat with this painting this week. Grandma's glory now hangs in my home. And as I've listened to the black women who voted for Vice President Harris and who say they voted for democracy and are frustrated and hurt, I understand it a little bit more. Black women, needle and thread, mending the flag. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They say, don't call us again because we have shown up for you over and over. And when we needed you were not there. So what do you say to those black women this morning who share that sentiment? HOLLY HOLIDAY, LEAD ORGANIZER, #WINWITHBLACKWOMEN: Yes, I say I appreciate it. I appreciate them. I appreciate their work. And the reality is we are proud of this race. We're disappointed in the outcome. But let's be really clear. We showed up for ourselves. We showed up for the reason that democracy is important is because we recognize that democracy is a system where black people have opportunity and access. So we care about democracy because we care about our families. And I'd also like to say, and I appreciate you bringing up some of them, we won some stuff in 2024, and we won some stuff because we showed up. Yes, you talked about the senators. But let me add a little bit more context to the Congress. I don't know if people recognize every single black woman incumbent in the Congress was reelected, even in some red states like Amelia Sykes in Ohio and Summer Lee in Pennsylvania. We also elected a new crop of black women prosecutors where black women represent less than 1 percent of all prosecutors, including reelecting Fani Willis, who Trump came after with both barrels and Monique Worrell in Florida, who DeSantis literally ousted from her job. So I say to black women, yes, be disappointed. I understand, especially when you're focused on the top of the ticket. But think about what is happening in your own communities that you're making a difference in because we are seeing lots of wins there.",

And if they want to make sure that black men continue and increase showing up, I suggest that black women are going to be part of that formula. I'm not quite sure how they're doing their analysis on how you do outreach to people, but it actually requires you to have some type of relationship with them. And creating wedges and disenfranchising or seeking to disenfranchise black women from black men is literally like breaking up our own family.

When we look at the conversations that were had online, a lot of the white women that voted for Trump were talking about saving their daughters by voting for a candidate that was going to protect them in locker rooms and on their sports teams from trans people. And this messaging hit very hard online.We had no infrastructure to combat it. We thought that this was a winning message and that we could disseminate that message through our traditional campaign structure. We needed to be online, we needed to be seeing this misinformation, this firehose of misinformation that was being presented to people and they felt that they were voting in the interest of women and their daughters by protecting them from red dye 40 in Doritos and trans athletes. And it's really terrifying that we just -- we were not having the same conversation that were. We were playing checkers, they were playing chess. We need to develop an online infrastructure with paid influencers who can message to people on the things that resonate with them and can turn their fears into action at the voting booth. The right has done an incredible job of that. They've been investing in that infrastructure for a decade.

The entrepreneurship was being unleashed. More Latinos were entering the workforce as entrepreneurs and starting their own businesses.They removed unneeded certification. They cut government jobs and spending to a certain extent. So all this really helped them to flourish better.

They've not responded to requests for comment on the lawsuit. It's almost strange when you say it out loud, but in progressive California, a ballot proposal to end a so called slavery loophole failed this week. Now, to be clear, slavery is illegal in California. But Proposition 6 would have closed a provision in the California constitution that allows jails and prisons to force prison inmates to work. Meanwhile, a tough on crime measure, Proposition 36, passed overwhelmingly. And last week I spoke with Samuel Brown, a former California inmate who helped write Prop 6. He said the failure of Prop 6 and the passage of Prop 36 feeds a system that harms communities of color. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAM BROWN, ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF CALIFORNIA'S PROP 6: The tough on crime legislation is oftentimes historically supported by large organizations and corporations that benefit from prison labor. What Prop 6 does, Prop 6 undermines that and takes away the benefit and incentives for them to invest in tough on crime legislation that destroys communities of color. And so many people are being, you know, fooled to think that they're focused on public safety. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLACKWELL: Prop 36 makes shoplifting a felony for repeat offenders and increases penalties on some drug offenses. We've also been tracking this story. Two Ohio police officers charged in the death of a man who died in their custody earlier this year have now entered not guilty pleas in the case. That's according to CNN affiliate WOIO. And we first shared Frank Tyson's story in May. He died in April after he crashed his vehicle and ran from police. Now, that's when officers wrestled him to the ground. One of them placed a knee on his neck or near his neck. In the video, Tyson can be heard telling them, I can't breathe five times in a minute. And after he stopped speaking, the officers realized he was unresponsive. I spoke with Tyson's fiancee back in May. And she responded to the video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SIBRENA JONES, FRANK TYSON'S FIANCEE: I was hurt, devastated, angry, mad. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was wrong. Man, I can't get that video out of my mind. I wanted to see those police officers in jail, not only because I don't want them to have another job. I want them to be taken away from their families, just like they took Frank away. I know they won't be dead, but just would have to be done. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It inspired me to try and project the sadness that she must have felt and the uncertainty that she must have surely felt being left behind.And the flag was a blanket and a security and she was taking pride in stitching it. That's not in the photo. You know, matter of fact, I didn't see her hands. There was a message that, you know, the plight of black people in this country and in spite of it, she just took upon herself to repair that flag. That was her comfort. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
