I told him, you know, some of the reason why you don't get those faith-based Black Democrats is because of the racism that comes from the former president, some of the racist comments that he's made. Well, he told me, listen, Democrats have made racist comments as well, and that ultimately this is going to be about going where Republicans are not necessarily invited to make this case and having them battle it out on policy.",

It was very disturbing. Some of the things that we saw as listed in the criminal complaint, very simply where we had one individual who had his water turned off, wasn't fed nine out of 12 times during a four- day stretch.We had individuals who weren't receiving all of their medications as they're supposed to be. We had individuals who weren't being checked on, on a regular basis. They're supposed to have hourly checks as part of your daily duty as a correctional officer. That's your job and that wasn't being done. But then the problems went even higher. They went to the level of supervisors and administration not holding staff accountable. And that goes to the level of warden and it really even goes beyond that. And so it's very frustrating and I've really struggled with this case. And from the governor to the secretary of the Department of Corrections, there needs to be a vast change in the state of Wisconsin and the Department of Corrections, the culture, the accountability of staff, and that starts at the top. But certainly those frontline staff also need to make sure they're holding themselves accountable.",
