And the number of the wounded also increases almost 2,000.

At least 29 people died after this fire erupted in a hospital in Beijing.Among the dead, 26 patients, a nurse, a care provider and a family member of a patient, and according to state-run news media, this fire broke out on Tuesday, around 1.00 p.m. local time. It was put out about half an hour later, 71 patients were evacuated. And we also learned thanks to a press event that took place, earlier today, a Beijing district official talked about the cause of the fire. He said that it was caused by sparks generated during construction, which ignited this combustible paint on site and 12 people have been detained as a result on suspicion of gross negligence. And I want to show you this, this dramatic video of people escaping this deadly fire. You can see one person is exiting the hospital window, he's wearing white, presumably as a patient. He's using a bed sheet in order to climb down. He lands on this roof like blue-colored structure and scrambles across to reach safety on the rooftop of the building next door. And then later on in this clip, you have to wait for the moment for when the amateur video taker pans to the left. And again, this clip has been circulating widely on social media, seen across China and around the world. But take a look at those external air conditioning units outside the hospital because you can see people perching and balancing themselves on top of them just waiting to be rescued. At CNN, we do not know whether these people were rescued or not. This hospital fire is one of the deadliest in Beijing in recent years. It surpasses the toll from the fire in Daxing in Beijing in 2017 that killed 19 people in a cramped building for migrant workers, and that tragedy prompted authorities to demolish illegal apartment blocks. Official Chinese media did not report on this latest fire until many hours after it was extinguished, and that prompted widespread criticism and even anger on social media. Back to you.",

And in this letter, it says that the plant contains quote, \"U.S. origin nuclear technical data that is export controlled by the U.S. government,\" warning that it would be unlawful for any Russian citizens or Russian entities to handle this technology. Now, since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we've seen this Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant being disconnected to the Ukrainian national grid on multiple occasions as a result of Russian shilling, raising concerns around the potential for a nuclear accident in Europe.

Here's CNN's Patrick Oppman with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For decades, it was a question that obsessed policymakers from Washington to Moscow who would succeed the Castros, one they'd left power in Cuba. Only in 2013 did Raul Castro and the speculation by announcing Miguel Diaz-Canel as first vice president and his heir apparent. Comrade Diaz-Canel isn't an upstart or an improvisation, he says. His trajectory has lasted nearly 30 years. An engineer by training and a longtime communist party bureaucrat, Diaz-Canel in 2018 became president of Cuba, the first head of state on the island since the revolution, not named Castro. But his tenure has been marked by nearly every calamity imaginable. A month after Diaz-Canel took office, Cuba suffered one of the island's worst aviation disasters, when a plane operated by the state airline crashed, killing 112 people aboard. U.S. economic sanctions, many of which were lifted under the Obama administration, were renewed with a vengeance by then president Donald Trump. Generous shipments of oil from socialist ally Venezuela have waned as that country grapples with its own economic meltdown. The pandemic shuttered Cuba's tourism industry for the worsening already widespread shortages of food and medicines. Then on July 11th 2021, thousands of Cubans took to the streets in the largest anti government demonstrations since the revolution. Within hours, Diaz-Canel went on state TV to order those who'll faithful to the government to attack the protesters. The order to combat has been given, he said. The streets belong to the revolutionaries. The crackdown on protesters led to more economic sanctions from the Biden administration, which may have only further unify the communist run government. On Wednesday, Cuba's national assembly will meet in his widely expected to approve a second five-year term as president for Diaz-Canel.",
