The dead and wounded a still being counted and more death and injury in the Kyiv region, where Ukrainian officials say there has been a series of strikes with Iran made drone. The United Nations says more than 8,300 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since Russia began its war, as Putin continues striking civilian infrastructure and dwellings. These numbers come as both he and his minister for Children's Affairs have been slapped with arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court over the forced deportation of thousands upon thousands of Ukrainian children from Russian occupied regions. I've been speaking about accountability for these and other war crimes with Oleksandra Matviichuk, the human rights lawyer and head of Ukraine's Center for Civil Liberties, which last year was one of the recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize.

And Russia attempts to break people resistance and occupy the Ukraine by inflicting that immense pain on millions of people. But second, my feelings, it's a feeling of love because when large scale invasions started, it resulted in a huge wave of solidarity among people in Ukraine. And we become witness how ordinary people started to do extraordinary things. And when international organizations evacuated their personnel, ordinary people remained and start to do their work. They broke encirclement to provide humanitarian aid. They helped people to survive under artilleries fire.

And that's makes roughly decade-long plan executed by the far-right and the Christian Nationalist Movement to bring us to the point of this conversation.

I think as the line from \"The Majorettes\" goes, I believe in coincidence, I just don't trust in coincidence. And so, I put together a team or investigative journalist and we just started digging and just started asking the questions about, well, who are the people behind these and where are they? And I not only do we come up with links, you know, of similarities, but then, we basically uncovered what we could only describe as the anti-trans hate machine. That's why we labelled the investigative series that, because there is an interlocking group of organizations and systems that are driving these bills. They are in conversation with each other, they are in coordination of each other. They are testing these bills, parts of their universe. Have focused grouped this issue. That's actually one of the ways that they landed on trans youth was because of a series of focus groups in 2018.

The power of the state, the need for the power of the state. The second thing that it does, is that it allows authoritarians to actually begin to road test how far they can go in their push towards authoritarians, what laws are they going to be able to do when executive actions, how aggressive can the police be and the judiciary? It allows them to be able to experiment with kind of the cocktail that they'll use within their authoritarian regimes. The third thing that it does is that it creates then also amongst people a legitimacy for state action that is muscular and punitive. And what do I mean by that? By turning on a group of people that you can easily stigmatize, isolate and demonized you create a rationale for why this muscular state is necessary, right? Because you need to be protected from these people that you fear and that are a threat to everything that you hold dear. And I think those are some of the three essential ingredients as to why we can chart the rise of authoritarianism with a focus on gender and gender identity and their intersection.

And that's very reveal. And for me, the impact, personally, is two-fold. One, I'd think twice about what state I'm going go to. Not because I can generally navigate society just trying. But if someone recognizes me from doing this program or other things, and you know, I'm in the bathroom in a state or something that has passed laws, I could be real jeopardy. And so, I do think twice about where I'm going to go and how I'm going to spend my time in this country. The second thing that I would say is that it is not -- I live in New York. But -- and people would go, oh, well, it's fine there. But just this weekend, outside the LGBTQ center here, there was a Proud Boys protest. And they have to be -- the Proud Boys had -- were there and demonstrating. And it got -- contention sets at moments. We had increasing Proud Boys and Oath Keepers protest at various public libraries and events here.
