Now after three days of extensive Israeli airstrikes on southern Lebanon, Israel's army chief has told troops that strikes are, quote, preparing the ground for their possible entry. Now they are calling up two reserve brigades to join the battle. This morning, Israel intercepted a ballistic missile aimed at Tel Aviv and Hezbollah says it was targeting the headquarters of Israel's intelligence service. They say in defense of Lebanon and the Palestinian people of Gaza, its the first time though a missile fired by Hezbollah has ever come this close to Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden today said, all out war is now possible in the Middle East. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Jeremy Diamond is in Haifa, Israel, Jomana Karadsheh is in Beirut and Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon.Jeremy, I want to start with you because Prime Minister Netanyahu, he said he's open to the U.S. mediating tensions, but they also so seem to be preparing for an escalation if a ground invasion actually does happen here, where's this going? What are you hearing on your end? JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, that's right. Today, two top Israeli generals, including the Israeli military's chief of staff making explicitly clear that the Israeli military is preparing for the possibility of a major ground offensive into Lebanon. The Israeli military's chief of staff, General Herzi Halevi, meeting with Israeli troops in northern Israel, talking to them about the potential for Israeli boots on the ground in Lebanese territory, saying that the Israeli airstrike that we have seen over the last several days are, of course, designed on the one hand to try and degrade Hezbollah's capabilities. But at the same time that they're also designed to shape the ground of for the possibility of Israeli troops to go in. It doesn't seem like that decision has been made yet, but as we are speaking, these Israeli governments security cabinet is currently meeting, discussing that very possibility. But what they are also, of course discussing, I expect is these diplomatic efforts led by the United States to see if a ceasefire can be reached between Israel and Hezbollah and perhaps if something even broader could be reached, that also affects the ongoing fighting in Gaza and those stalled negotiations for a ceasefire agreements over there. And so, these threats of a potential ground invasion. I think we shouldn't look at them as somehow exclusive from those potential diplomatic negotiations to reach some kind of a settlement here. The Israelis very much view this -- the military campaign that they have led over the last few days. And now the specter of this ground incursion Russian as bringing more pressure to bear, as they try and reach this goal, ultimately of getting Hezbollah to stop firing rockets on northern Israel to allow for the return of tens of thousands of Israelis who have been displaced from their homes to go back. But of course we don't know whether or not this strategy will be successful and even officials in the United States have cast doubt on this strategy of de-escalation through escalation as the Israelis have said and instead, it seems very clear that regardless of what Hezbollah does, as we have seen hundreds, several hundred rockets each day being fired by Hezbollah, but nothing close to what Israeli officials had been expecting in the event of a major escalation. What is clear is that regardless of what Hezbollah does, the Israelis clearly seemed prepared to continue to escalate the situation, to continue striking harder and deeper into Lebanon and perhaps even to send troops into Lebanese territory.",

What the U.S. has been doing is they've been placing assets all across the region in the Red Sea, in the eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf of Oman, in order to prepare for the possibility that Iran perhaps starts firing on Israel, that Hezbollah escalates its attacks even further and of course, that the U.S. might have to help get citizens out of Lebanon.And that is the most pressing issue at the moment, is this planning for what's called a noncombatant evacuation operation, which is what we saw in 2021 out of Afghanistan, that went so disastrously according to critics for the Biden administration. So this time around, they're really taking all necessary steps to try to be as prepared as possible if it comes to that, if the war between Israel and Hezbollah escalates to such an extent that they have to get U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals out of Lebanon entirely and to that end, they've actually deployed dozens of additional us troops to Cyprus in the Eastern Mediterranean to prepare for that possible contingency, as well as others. Cyprus played a really key role in helping to facilitate the departure of foreign nationals from Lebanon back in 2006 during that war between Israel and Hezbollah. And they have said that they're standing by to help again, and the Brits, they have also deployed about 700 troops to Cyprus to prepare for this possibility. So they're preparing for really the worst year, hoping for the best just hoping these diplomatic talks actually yield some kind of success. But still, the ultimate role of the U.S. military, as it stands right now, is that non-combatant evacuation operation in addition, of course, to just helping intercept missiles and drones that may be fired at Israel's way if things escalate even further, Omar.",

So we have seen tens of thousands of people moving to different parts of the countries here in Beirut, we have had in our own hotel, we have seen people who have been displaced, families from southern Lebanon, from the southern suburbs of Beirut even that has been hit by Israeli strikes. You have had people crossing the border, Omar, into Syria, into war torn Syria. Those are Syrians and Lebanese who say they have nowhere else to go and they're crossing the border into Syria in search of safety. Now, the government hasn't provided exact figures. It's very hard to estimate when you have people who are fleeing, staying with relatives, renting apartments are staying in hotels. The United Nations is saying that more than 90,000 people have been displaced.

It's not something where you're going to see them akin to Gaza, setting up some kind of an occupation force. You have to remember the Israelis occupied southern Lebanon from 1980 to 2000.

We also have a bit of her remarks where she's really going to lean into this character argument. She'll say, in part, for Donald Trump, or economy works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers and not those who build them or wire them or mop the floors.

U.S. consumers will pay more, and most economists believe that's the way tariffs work. And finally, Omar, you could end up with the perverse. Let's take a U.S. company, a U.S. company that manufacturers overseas and imports to the United States. But it's moved its jobs there could be penalized with 200 percent tariffs.

We will identify common sense solutions to help Americans buy a home, start a business, and build wealth, and we will adopt them.So let's start then with the first pillar of an opportunity economy, which is lowering costs. So I made that our top priority for obvious reasons because if we want the middle-class to be the growth engine of our economy, we need to restore basic economic security for middle- class families. To that end, the most practical thing we can do right now is to cut taxes for middle-class families and individuals, that's what we will do. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a middle-class tax break that includes $6,000 for new parents during the first year of their child's life. (APPLAUSE)",

I mean, look, Kevin, we knew have known that the economy would be the central focal point for voters in this election here. And we're hearing some of her economic message there. We've heard her talk about the opportunity economy, which again, she talked about here. But how is she trying to differentiate her economic vision from President Biden's?

Its now 12 to 18 feet along that Big Bend of Florida and it is because we really worried about the wind field with this one, it is wide for sure.Right now, a category one hurricane, the winds have been stretching tropical-storm-force and hurricane-force from Cancun to Havana all day today. Again, because it just is wide and continuing to get wider. Winds right now are 80 miles per hour. We also have some very warm ocean temperatures here in the middle and upper 80s. That is what caused it to already rapidly intensify from yesterday and what could cause it to rapidly intensify again as we go into tomorrow, which one? Is what would take it to that category three major hurricane status. We've got hurricane warnings in effect in the rug there. That's where we could be looking at that category three landfall. But look at all the blue tropical storm warnings in effect for the entire peninsula here because again, the wind field will be so wide and then look at this. We're looking at tropical storm conditions in Atlanta. You've got tropical storm watches in effect there in the yellow as we go into Friday. Here's that storm surge I was talking about, 12 to 18 feet. That is unsurvivable when you're talking about 12 to 18 feet of ocean water, is pushing inland. That could do some significant damage, five to eight feet of storm surge in the Tampa Bay area. But again, where you have this very large wind field with the eye making landfalls, we will get that biggest push of the ocean water that were incredibly concerned about. The storm will continue to get fatter. We're talking about tropical storm-force winds extending more than 400 miles. So, again, the entire peninsula of Florida and then making it even as far north as Atlanta. I mean, look, Atlanta, it could be looking at wins up to 73 miles per hour, even that far north around that eye where it could get make landfall 110 mile per hour winds. On top of this, we're also talking about incredibly heavy rain. You're talking about four to eight inches pretty widespread across a lot of Georgia and then going into the Carolinas and then look at this pocket right here up to a foot possible the southern Appalachians that could cause some landslides because that is mountainous terrain -- Omar.",
