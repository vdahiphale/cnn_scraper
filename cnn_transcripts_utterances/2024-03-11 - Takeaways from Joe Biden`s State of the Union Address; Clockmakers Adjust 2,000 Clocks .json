(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  The curtain finally goes up on a historic presidential rematch, Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Emerging from Super Tuesday primaries as the effective nominees of their parties. But there are warning signs in winning, with both men facing distinct challenges of rebuilding their coalitions.

Tonight, after a string of Democratic primary victories, President Biden is preparing to make his case at the State of the Union Address on Thursday, a primetime opportunity to tackle myriad challenges he faces to win re- election. Biden easily swept away long-shot rivals like Dean Phillips, but a series of protest votes made clear he faces the task of uniting Democrats too, like in Minnesota on Tuesday, where uncommitted received 19% of the vote. With a general election contest finally taking shape, history will be tested anew, as Trump seeks to become the first president since Grover Cleveland was voted out of office to be sent back for a second term. ZELENY (on camera):  So the sequel between Biden and Trump will play out in a far different political context. And there are wildcards galore, from Trump`s criminal cases to Biden`s foreign policy challenges and the fitness of both of these presidential candidates. There is no doubt these primaries have shown the vulnerabilities of both campaigns and both candidates. There`s no modern-day historical guide for the campaign that is to come, but it starts now.

On April 30th, 1916, Germany adopted Daylight Saving Time as it looked to conserve electricity. Weeks later, the United Kingdom followed suit. All right, how are we feeling today? Losing an hour of sleep is no good. In most of the U.S. and many other countries around the world, we spring ahead or move our clocks forward by one hour in early spring, then fall back or move them back an hour again in mid to late fall. But most of us might not actually have to physically change too many clocks, right, because our devices might do it for us. But what if I told you, you had to change 2,000 clocks? That`s the task at hand for clockmasters at London`s Palace of Westminster. CNN followed the small team there a few years ago as they tick-tocked their way through adjusting those clocks before British lawmakers arrived to work. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
