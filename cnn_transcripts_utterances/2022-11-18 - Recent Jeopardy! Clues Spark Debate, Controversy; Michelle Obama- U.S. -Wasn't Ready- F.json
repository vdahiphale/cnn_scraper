And I looked at him and I remember like it was yesterday. And it was in 2000. It was in West Virginia. And I was just like wow, I'm going to wear my hair how I wear my hair, which was natural. This obviously is not my hair but I wore my hair out, which is if you wash it, it looks like it could be texturized. It's not very familiar. You know how it is.

There are some stablecoins that are backed one-for-one by real money -- bank deposits, short-term treasuries. They put themselves out as having stable value.But most crypto is highly volatile. It's more in the nature of an equity investment or a commodity investment. There's a big debate about what it is. I do think it would be helpful for the SEC and SFDC to jointly provide guidance about what's going to be subject to securities and what's going to be subject to commodities regulation. Right now, they kind of cancel each other out because Gary Gensler says they're securities. And by definition, the CFDC doesn't have authority. The CFDC says it's a commodity by definition. The SEC doesn't have authority. So I think a joint statement from them would be really helpful. And stablecoins -- I think they deserve some type of bank-like regulation. We have it at the state level now but I think a federal regime would be helpful. The core problem here is that we have this siloed regulatory structure, so we have different agencies sometimes, unfortunately, competing for jurisdiction. You have different committees in Congress overseeing them. They also compete for jurisdiction.
