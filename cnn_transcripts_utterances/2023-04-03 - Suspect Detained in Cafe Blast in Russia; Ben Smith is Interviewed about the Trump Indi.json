A young woman. Her name is Daria Trepova. And she was at the event in which Tatarsky was a guest speaker. And she actually handed him a gift. A small statue. A small figurine. Which eyewitnesses say was the source of the explosion. And that's what Russian investigators say now they're looking at most of all, that this statute that was handed to Tatarsky by this -- this woman, Daria Trepova, was actually an explosive device, and it detonated and caused all this destruction. There's been an announcement from the Russian Anti-Terrorism Committee as well. They're the organization that are investigating what's going on here. They're calling it a terrorist act, as is the Kremlin, and they're blaming the Ukrainian special services for carrying this out, for planning it, in conjunction with agents, they say, from Alexei Navalny's anti-corruption campaign. So that's what the official line is at the moment. This was a Ukrainian special services act in conjunction with Alexei Navalny's anti-corruption campaign. The Navalny Group, by the way, has categorically denied any connection. Don.",

He is going to fly then to New York, where he is going to be arraigned tomorrow. We are learning this morning that the former president is expected to spend the night at Trump Tower and then returned straight to Florida after his appearance. That is where he's going to be speaking tomorrow night.Right now he is facing what we believe are about 30 counts related to the business -- to business fraud and this historic indictment by a Manhattan grand jury. We're still waiting on it to be unsealed. But we should note that his indictment is the first of a current or former president in U.S. history. It stems from that alleged 2016 hush money payment covering up - cover-up involving the adult film star Stormy Daniels. And it appears that Trump is preparing to capitalize politically on this, with sources telling CNN that as he was playing golf over the weekend, he was also strategizing with his allies about how to use this to his advantage. It's certainly working when it comes to fundraising. His re-election campaign says they've already raised more than $5 million since news of the indictment came down Thursday night. Trump is expected to give a speech at Mar-a-Lago tomorrow night. So for perspective on all of this, I want to bring in the editor in chief of Semafor, Ben Smith. I think Peter Baker has it right in the way he's talking about how Trump is flourishing this morning. On the front page of \"The New York Times\" he says, the ex-president is at home in the indictment's glare. BEN SMITH, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"SEMAFOR\": You know this has always been, to some degree, of the core of Trump's appeal, that the establishment hates him, that they're out to get him, that he sort of -- you know, that he's transgressive and stands for people who feel really alienated from the establishment. And so, yes, I mean, I think this is in some ways back to basics, back to him coming down the golden staircase and saying things that are incredibly offensive.",

This decision was made in response to continued staffing and financial challenges that Valor Health is facing due to various factors, including Covid-19 impacts, inflation, staff shortages and decreasing reimbursements. Now, I want to zero in on that last one there. Birth do not pay well. If you've got a bed in a hospital, you are better off giving it to a patient who needs bypass surgery -- financially speaking -- bypass surgery or someone who needs an artificial hip. Births don't pay well, especially because nearly half of all births in the U.S. are paid for by Medicaid. Medicaid only pays about $6,500 for birth, whereas employer-sponsored insurance pays about $15,000. In the past 12 months, these are all the places we found, Don, that have shutdown either their labor and delivery or their entire hospital. That's a lot of places just in the past 12 months.

And that was the only time the chief justice decided to say something public. And he issued that statement that said, we have no Obama judges. We have no Trump judges. We don't have Bush or Clinton judges. We just have these neutral judges. And Trump then fires back. But it was just so -- I thought it was so symbolic of exactly what finally pushed Chief Justice John Roberts over the edge to say, I have to speak out against him, because the point was, and as we see right now with these proceedings that are going to be held tomorrow, Poppy -",
