U.S. military vessels launched Tomahawk missiles at more than a dozen Houthi missile launchers. And the U.S. announced it's re-designating the Houthis as a global terrorist organization. Now, this comes after the Houthis successfully struck a U.S. vessel earlier on Wednesday, according to U.S. Central Command. Their one-way attack drone hit a bulk carrier ship in the Gulf of Aden. No one was injured and we're told the ship was able to carry on with its journey.

They cause terror inside that station for more than an hour.

And in the day since, we've started to see folks slowly emerge from that, wanting to get back to normal life. But what played out for that prosecutor being shot and killed, Cesar Suarez is an example of this still ongoing, internal armed conflict. That's how President Noboa has labelled this. And he says his focus is to neutralize these terror groups. Now, you need to take a step back and look at why this is going beyond Ecuador. Folks might just say that's an isolated issue with a country that unfortunately was seen as an island of peace, it is no longer, But it's bigger than that. And President Noboa has heed on this. He's called on the U.S. to help out, to help when it comes to resources for armed forces, for police. Everything from jackets, to helmets to ammunition. And his argument is that if this isn't stopped here in Ecuador, that drugs in particular could continue to flow north into the U.S. and cause even more chaos for Americans. Beyond that, though, you have to think if you're destabilizing this country, then you have folks here, who for many years have been very content here and suddenly will start to think, well, we need to pack up and go somewhere else. Where will they go? The argument is they'll go north, and they'll add to the crisis at the U.S. southern border. For that reason, a lot of the officials here are calling on the international community to step in, and to halt the violence here at Ecuador.

I think he is less likely to be restrained this time.
