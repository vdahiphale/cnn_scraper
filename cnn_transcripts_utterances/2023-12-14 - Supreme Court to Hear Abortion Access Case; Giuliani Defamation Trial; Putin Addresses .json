Other than that, though, a pretty chill term ahead. On Mifepristone, which we've spoken about a lot since the night that this all started kind of heading in this direction, the FDA has made several changes over recent years to increase accessibility to the abortion pill by allowing the drug to be taken later in pregnancy, mail directed at patients in states that allow abortion access.

You know, we're in a whole new front now on -- in the national controversy over abortion. And the specific regulations here date not to the year 2000, when it was approved, but to starting in 2016 when the FDA started to relax some of the regulations around the drug saying that women could have access to it up to ten weeks of pregnancy, not just up to seven weeks of pregnancy, that non- physicians could be prescribing and dispensing it, as well as physicians, and that that also when it came time to actually get the drug, after consultation with a physician, that it could be by mail rather than in person. So, all those things made it more available. And the FDA said the reason it had decided that is just because the prior restrictions were not -- they were more strict, just were not necessary for the safety and effectiveness in the drug. And those in that -- that's one of the key things here is not just the availability of a medication abortion, that is now the main way that women end pregnancies in America, but also the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to decide what is best for this drug rather than have lower court judges second guess that.",

So, it will be fascinating to see the fallout depending on that decision.The Supreme Court also announced, Joan, on Wednesday, that it is going to consider whether part of a federal obstruction law can be used to prosecute some of the rioters who were involved in the January 6th attack. What's the impact on former President Trump's election interference case potentially? BISKUPIC: OK, so that one, there's an open-ended question there. The statute at issue, Erica, say -- makes it a crime to corruptly obstruct an official proceeding. And it's one of many parts of federal law that these January 6th rioters cases have been brought under. And so this would - this would definitely affect the case of the man, Joseph Fisher, who is challenging this law as part of his prosecution, but it could have reverberations to the other cases, including Donald Trump's. But I do want to remind everyone that Donald Trump has -- faces a multitude of charges from the special counsel Jack Smith. So, while this case could inform some of what happens with Donald Trump, he's more broadly -- he has been more broadly charged and probably the really key thing there is, I know what you and Phil are aware of, is the fact that he's - he's saying he should be immune from everything in a criminal prosecution right now, and that's the other part of the case that's up at the Supreme Court.",

That's what jurors do, not a juror in the sense that you're on the panel, but you're having an emotional reaction and a connection with the impact that this had.Going back, what is defamation? False statements that are injurious to your reputation. Statements have consequences. We've heard not only what we heard about Trump saying these things about Ruby Freeman, Ruby Freeman, what she did, which were not true, by the way, but we heard the venom from the public with respect to, we're going to hang you, we're going to do all these things to you. What am I saying? We're at the damage phase. The jury has to assess, how did this damaged you? How has your life changed? What should the consequences be for that? And our system of justice converts that to money. And not only are you allowed to consider the actual damages, I had to move away from my home, what it did to my child, et cetera, my life's not the same. But what about the emotional damages and stress and what about the jury wanting to punish, that's what punitive damages are. So, when you hear that and then you hear the president buttoning this up, saying things that are not true, that's a big bully pulpit that affects a lot of people. That's damages 101.
