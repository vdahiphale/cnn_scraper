Tonight, Russian and Syrian forces fighting back after rebels took control of most of the city of Aleppo. Activists and journalists in the city telling CNN Russian war planes have now carried out at least 10 strikes on rebel positions in the past several days, as forces have advanced. Overnight, Syrian rebels entering the city for the first time since the government forces regained control in 2016. The rebels say they are also in control of the airport. It's a claim, though, that CNN has been unable to verify. Dozens of government soldiers were killed in the surprise attack in what is being seen as a major challenge to President Bashar al-Assad and his regime. Joining us now is former US ambassador to NATO, Kurt Volker, who was also the US Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations during the Trump administration.

That's why they brought in North Korean soldiers to fight on their behalf, because they can't move their forces from Eastern Ukraine, and they have drawn down Russian forces that have been in other parts of the world, including in Syria, because they needed them in Ukraine.Now we're seeing that others are taking advantage of those Russian decisions. And at the same time, we are seeing an urgency on the part of many players, whether it is Iran trying to shut down Hezbollah a little bit, whether it is these Islamists trying to take over more ground in Syria, whether it's Hamas releasing this video of a hostage trying to get a deal with Israel, or whether it's Russia, despite their weaknesses, stepping up attacks in Ukraine and threatening nuclear use, all in order to try to position before Trump takes office.",

They have inflation over 25 percent and they're printing rubles so that inflation is going to increase. Interest rates are already over 21 percent. They're having difficulty getting components. The ruble is crashing. So he knows he's in trouble economically and also militarily, because he doesn't have the troops that he needs. He relies on North Korea for artillery shells, relies on Iran for drones. So Putin is actually ready to pause this war. I think Zelensky is also ready to do that.So I think there will be a short term end of fighting. The trick is to turn that into a permanent peace and that is where I think Zelenskyy's ideas of bringing in NATO membership, and perhaps even European NATO members to have troops inside Ukraine as a deterrent to further Russian aggression, this may be what is necessary, and I think it could actually play out, and indeed play out fairly quickly in the new year.",

There was no reason to have done that.International law only requires that a country has a right to defend itself, so Ukraine fits that category, and that they only hit military targets rather than civilian. No one is talking about range, and by allowing Russia to attack Ukraine from a great distance and restricting Ukraine from hitting back, that was a nonsensical decision that should have long ago been reversed. Russia is, of course, trying to capitalize on that reversal by claiming that it is some new affront. But we shouldn't pay too much attention to what Russia propaganda is.

He charges the Biden administration with having been weak, with having created conditions that allow that -- that caused Russia to decide they could get away with invading Georgia. That caused Iran to decide they could unleash their proxies in the Middle East. So I think they know now we need to re-establish a position of strength. Now, what we're talking about here is Georgia, and Russia is not only trying to flip the government there, also in Romania, also in Bulgaria, also putting pressure on Montenegro. Russia has a strategy for that wider region. Here, I think we've been focused only on the big issues, the Middle East and Russia's war on Ukraine and China, but we have to have a comprehensive and a global strategy, because our adversaries are out there doing this every day.",

He described the meeting as \"Having discussed many important topics that will require both countries to work together to address like the fentanyl and drug crisis that has decimated so many lives as a result of illegal immigration, fair trade deals that do not jeopardize American workers and the massive trade deficit the United States has with Canada.\" He went on to say that they also talked about energy and the Arctic partnership. But the reason I wanted to highlight his mention of the drug crisis is that that was really the motivation that Donald Trump cited when he issued that threat, both against Mexico and Canada, saying that if they do not do enough to crack down on the flow of drugs, migrants and crime over both of the borders, that he would issue that 25 percent tariff on all products coming from those countries. Now, as for Trudeau's part, we did hear him this morning, our own CNN's Kit Maher caught up with him when he was leaving his hotel in West Palm Beach. He described it as an excellent meeting, and then later posted on social media as well. He posted a photo of them together and said that he looked forward to working with Donald Trump moving forward. But one thing that's very interesting, I think you know, to take a step back from this all, the fact that -- the significance really of Justin Trudeau flying down to Florida to meet with Donald Trump in person, I think, really highlights how much he recognizes that Donald Trump means what he says and he said as much, Justin Trudeau yesterday in an unrelated press conference, hours before making that trip. He described what Donald Trump was doing as not an empty threat. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Newsom kind of showing tangibly how he would push back on the Trump administration.

Trump, for his part, has repeatedly slammed Newsom over California's problems with crime and homelessness, often calling the governor, Newscum.
