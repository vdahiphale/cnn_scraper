      "sentences": "Yeah, Kate. This represents one of the most up-to-date intelligence assessments that's been circulated amongst U.S. officials about Netanyahu's mindset -- and obviously, that's critical insight for policymakers and for the president as they try to broker an end to the conflict in Gaza.And look, this assessment puts in very blunt terms that Netanyahu is currently engaged in a balancing act. He's trying to maintain support from the U.S. and from the international community, but also trying to preserve his spot as the leader of Israel. He does face pressure from some of the right-wing elements of his own government to continue the war against Hamas. And look, the CIA assessment says that Netanyahu will likely continue to defy pressure from the U.S. and members of his own government to define a post-war plan. That's something we've only heard Netanyahu talk about in vague terms, and the CIA believes that he will continue to only address it in vague terms until very specific benchmarks are reached. We've heard Netanyahu even describe those benchmarks in very vague terms, using the phrase \"military operations\" as something that he needs to ensure the security of Israel before he's willing to talk about a peace deal. The assessment does name specifically, though, that eliminating the Hamas leader Mohammed Deif -- the shadowy figure who has been linked to the planning behind the October 7 attack -- that specifically is somebody who the CIA assesses that Netanyahu likely needs to eliminate before he's willing to seriously talk about post-war issues. And I want to compare that, though, to what President Joe Biden has said about the post-war Gaza and about -- he actually says that is the one thing that he disagrees with Netanyahu the most on. He said to Time magazine, \"My major disagreement with Netanyahu is what happens after Gaza's over. What does it go back to? Do Israeli forces go back in?\" And according to the CIA, it sounds like Netanyahu is not ready to talk in specific terms and may not be ready to for months.",

And, of course, if a clot travels to your heart or your brain, that can cause a heart attack or a stroke.
