      "sentences": "Good morning.Well, it's called Operation Fouled Anchor. And it was an investigation into sexual assault at the Coast Guard Academy which uncovered a history of substantiated rapes and assaults that were ignored or even covered up by high-ranking officials. You've never heard of it because no one ever saw that report. It was buried. Even though it was completed a few years ago. The findings were kept secret by Coast Guard's top leadership. And, get this, after all this time, the Coast Guard finally came forward and reported it to Congress this month only after CNN's investigative team asked about it. The report found dozens of cases of alleged sexual assault at the Coast Guard Academy, even though they only looked at a limited time frame from 1988 to 2006. And here's some more details about what's in Operation Fouled Anchor. It said that, quote, there was a disturbing pattern of not treating reported sexual assaults as criminal matters even in cases where there was overwhelming evidence. Leadership was more concerned at that time about Coast Guard Academy reputation than about the victims of crimes who were members of our service. And that the suspects and sometimes the victims were simply disenrolled from the academy with no investigation at all. Now, if there were punishments, some were laughable. Minor things, like extra homework or lower class standings. Those were the, quote/unquote, punishments. Even those pushed out of the academy were sometimes able to serve in the U.S. military. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR: Now, Pamela, though the report talks about the past, you talked to a woman who was a more recent cadet at the Coast Guard Academy, right?",

In a letter to their students, Harvard administrator's write, quote, in the weeks and months ahead, drawing on the talent and expertise of our Harvard community, we'll determine how to preserve, consistent with the court's new precedent, our central values.The key question, though, is, how will this actually play out on college campuses for students, right, for high school kids waiting to get into college. We're going to talk to a few key people about this. Andrew Brennen, a 2019 UNC Chapel Hill grad who was heading to Columbia Law School this fall, perhaps the last affirmative action class. He's the son of two attorneys. And he told CNN last year that his parents taught him how affirmative action helped black families prosper. Brennen also testified in a lower court hearing on this case and then attended the Supreme Court's oral arguments. Kyra Abrams graduated from UC Berkeley last spring, the first in her family to finish college. In California, race-conscious admissions had been banned at public universities for more than two decades. She told \"The New York Times\" about what she faced at Berkeley. Quote, black students, she said, refer to themselves as the 1.9 percent, their share of the student population, down from the low double digits years -- just a year before the ban. You feel isolated, she said. Also with us, Janice Jackson, the former Chicago public schools chief. She is now the CEO of Hope Chicago, which pays for college for thousands of Chicago area students and their parents. In its first year, Hope Chicago says college enrollment for students at the schools they work with jumped 30 percent. Here is what she told \"60 Minutes.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And as Kyra pointed out in her remarks, you're going to see more and more students having to circumvent different processes, which again is yet another barrier towards the promise of education. I think educators and decisionmakers across this country are upset by this, but my message to folks is that we really have to get out here and think creatively about how we don't lose the ground that we've made over the past generation.

This just makes it harder. And you only have to look at California, look at what Prop 209 did.
