You get a severe weather outbreak like this when the winter tries to push summer away.So, 18 tornadoes reports, as you said, there may be more they'll be out looking for them. Also looking at the size of them. Here's the tornado you showed from Sulphur Springs not long after this storm -- it got a lot bigger. There were reports there of things falling from the sky and the radar also showing things that weren't raindrops or hailstones in the sky as well. So, leaves, twigs, sticks, and you know, all the other things that come apart with a tornado here, the pictures here, many, many spots had long tornadoes on the ground for miles and some could easily be EF-3 or higher. There was weather all the way from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, all the way down to the Gulf Coast. And there still is -- there was hail in Madison, that was golf ball size. So, you go from Lake Michigan all the way to the Gulf Coast. And yes, that is snow on the backside because it's going to get windy and it's going to get cold on the other side of this storm, and there will be some snow coming down. Wind gusts to 60 miles per hour today in some spots there along the Great Lakes. The severe weather risk today significantly less, only Category One, where yesterday we were up into Category Four out of Five. So, yes, it will rain. Yes, there'll be thunder. Yes, there'll be lightning. Yes, there will be people outside at college football games and other things out here today on a Saturday or tomorrow into the Sunday, there will be some lightning as well.

All right, joining me now are Brian Robinson, a Republican Strategist and President of Robinson Republic P.R.; and Theron Johnson, Former South Regional Director for the 2012 Obama Campaign and President and CEO of Paramount Consulting Group LLC. They are also the co-hosts of the \"Political Breakfast\" podcast. Great to have you both on.Theron, let me start with you, you know, especially as we're getting into the final few days, abortion and democracy in peril, you know, these seem to be the closing arguments that Biden and Democrats have been focusing on. But look, the polls show it's the economy, right. That's like the urgent, acute concern for most voters. Is this the wrong approach, Theron? THERON JOHNSON, FORMER SOUTH REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE 2012 OBAMA CAMPAIGN: Well, I think you can actually talk about the abortion issue that we have in this country, with the Dobbs decision. You can talk about health care. But you can also talk about the economy. And I think one of the things that you see in a lot of key states around the country, particularly where we have very competitive Senate races, the Democrats are talking about the job growth that we've had in this country. We just had a recent third quarter growth and jobs. Wages are up as gas prices are going down. People are actually working. But we just have to remind the American people that we endured a deadly pandemic, we had the war in Ukraine, supply chain issues, and we have many tax breaks for the wealthiest people in America, particularly a lot of corporations. And so, I believe that we've got to tell our story. As Democrats, we got to remind voters that when we say our most economic prosperity in this country with Democrats, we're in the White House, and we got to be very, very specific on that message moving forward. WALKER: OK. But unfortunately, the reality for Democrats is that it's the Republicans that really seem to have the momentum, right? Enthusiasm about the midterms is higher with Republicans actually, compared to Democrats. This is according to the latest CNN national poll: 38 percent of Republicans extremely enthusiastic, versus 24 percent among Democrats. And, Brian, I mean, they've been pounding the Democrats for the \"rampant inflation.\" But what is the Republican plan then to fix the economy?",

I think the Republicans said earlier in the year, they're going to make the Democrats own their own record here, and, and then figure it out once they get into office. And that's how elections go. I don't see a lot of big plans from the Democrats on how to fix it either. So, they're pretty even on that score.The fact of the matter is in these swing states, the ones that will determine control of the U.S. Senate, you're seeing some of the highest inflation in the entire country. You're seeing that in metro Atlanta, and you're seeing that in metro Phoenix. You know, and in Pennsylvania, you see a heavy emphasis on the crime issue. These are some topics where Democrats are on the defense right now. And unfortunately, for Democrats and good for the Republicans, the economy and crime are voter's top issues. So, Democrats are having to talk about stuff that aren't top issues, because they're trying to scare their base. They're trying to get turnout because like your numbers show, they don't have enthusiasm. And I would say that those Republican enthusiasm numbers are even higher in those swing states that I just mentioned: Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, those voters know the odds of the nation are on them, they know their vote really matters, could determine the direction of the country.",

And now, polling has been a little all over the board but has always shown him pretty close.

And so, I'm very confident, if you look at Senator Warnock's record, and how he's delivered time and time again, for Georgia voters when it comes to the economy, protecting our veterans, he's making tons of announcements around what he's doing to stimulate the economy. He's working to bring electric school buses here. He just announced a lot of funding around public safety. These are the issues that this senator has led on in Washington.Now, let me also be very clear, when I'm going to be watching on election night is the Metro Atlanta turnout when counties like DeKalb County, Fulton, Cobb, and Gwinnett, but I'm also going to be very, very keyed in on some of the Southeast and Southwest counties in Georgia. I believe that Senator Warnock would do better than respect in those counties.
