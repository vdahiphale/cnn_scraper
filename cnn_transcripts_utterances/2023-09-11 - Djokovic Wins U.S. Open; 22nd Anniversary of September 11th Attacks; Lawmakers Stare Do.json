In fact, the plan is to get lawmakers in a room when the House returns and try to see if there's a path forward among House Republicans. All eyes are going to be on Kevin McCarthy, the House speaker, who has his work cut out for him. That's because typically when you don't have an agreement on the broader, year-long spending bill you pass some kind of short term spending bill. Something like a CR, a stop-gap measure, to make sure that you get over that October 1st deadline. But even that is going to be a huge challenge for McCarthy.Over the recess, he had members on his right flank signaling that they were not going to support a short-term spending bill. Someone like Chip Roy arguing that he thought that that was something that he couldn't back unless there were a series of other writers attached to it, something that would never pass out of the Senate, Phil. So, you already have this fight over the larger spending bill, but then you have a fight over even a stopgap measure to fund the government for a couple of weeks. Now, McCarthy can always choose to put a bill on the floor, to make sure that the government stays funded, but he could anger those on his right flank. And you're already seeing people like Matt Gaetz agitating that perhaps House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's time as speaker is coming to an end. So, those are the challenges that House Speaker McCarthy has in the weeks ahead, and that is some of the things that you're going to see over the next several days. When the House returns they're going to try to pass a defense spending bill, but aides told me yesterday that they still don't have the votes for that. And over in the Senate, they are passing their bills on a bipartisan basis, which is going to make it very difficult for the House to continue to argue that they are going to be able to pass the funding bills with just Republican votes when the Senate is doing it on a bipartisan basis.

And our hearts go out to the family members that were lost, but also to the talented men and women of the United States who defended them.Turning to the economy, over the last two years you've seen Americans start 10.5 million small businesses, which is a record number. One fourth of those are Latino businesses. We've created hundreds of thousands of jobs. The economy is moving in the right direction, especially when you look at our competitors internationally, in the G- 7, the U.S. economy is doing far better. But it's important to remember where we're coming from. We faced a pandemic that had global repercussions. The American people are still recovering from that. But as we recover from that, what we know is the American economy is doing better than any other economy in the world. We're creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Inflation is coming down. Our economy is growing. Investments are being made here in the United States. When I travel around the world as part of my job, companies around the world keep telling me that the place where they want to make investments is here in America. And that's proving to be true.",
