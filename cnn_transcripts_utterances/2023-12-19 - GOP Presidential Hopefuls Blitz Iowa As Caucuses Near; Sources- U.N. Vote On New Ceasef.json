The volcano is spewing magma fountains nearly 100 feet high, releasing toxic gases. The bright orange lava flow is visible some two miles away. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is trying to get as close as humanly and safely possible. And his live report is coming up in a few minutes. But things are also heating up in our 2024 lead with just 27 days into the first voters get their say. Cue the music, election music. Yes, yes. The sweet, sweet sounds of CNN's election season. It's an all-out blitz in Iowa today where Republican presidential hopefuls are holding a dozen official campaign events on the schedule today. That includes former President Trump back in Iowa for the fourth time in less than a month. Today, Trump's campaign is projecting confidence, not only confidence that they're going to win the Iowa caucuses, but confidence they will have the entire race secure by mid-March. The senior Trump campaign official says based on their internal data, they expect the former president to win the party's nomination around spring break, although they do caution those calculations could change if a rival does better than expected. And after months of going after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, it appears it's former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley who the Trump campaign is growing more concerned about. The super PAC supporting Donald Trump has just launched its first big ad attacking Haley in the early voting state of New Hampshire. CNN's Jeff Zeleny starts off our coverage today from Waterloo, Iowa, where Trump is holding a rally today with a behind-the-scenes look at the campaign machine hoping to propel the former president to a decisive victory in Iowa next month, a state he could not win eight years ago.

You know, we want the right fiscal policies in, place we wanted to drain the swamp. He didn't do any of it, and there's no -- you don't even have to run ads on that, he just didn't get it done.

Hamas has said that those remaining hostages won't be released until, in their words, the war is over.There's a big difference between ending this war and a humanitarian pause to allow in desperately needed aid to Gaza. We saw those heartbreaking pictures over the weekend of people jumping on aid trucks, fighting over the few scraps of supplies that remain. Of course, there is additional damage being reported to everything from hospitals to churches, people are dying, including Israeli hostages, accidentally shot over the weekend. So, the cease-fire is needed, but what that looks like, and what is agreed to, that is the tricky part here. That's why you had this Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in the region, but he didn't believe certainly with any deal imminent. And so, it's certainly something the U.S. is working on very hard, Jake.

And when necessary, escorting a lot of these commercial vessels, so that they can transit safely through the southern Red Sea and up towards the Suez Canal, where, of course, so much of international trade and commerce passes for the rule on a daily basis.

But there is a crack going right through that town as well, the lava hasn't erupted there yet, but nevertheless, the situation there is very concerning. And the other thing that you mentioned, this volcano is essentially erupting, where this volcanic eruption is taking place right between the capital of Iceland, and the main airport of Iceland. The Icelanders themselves seem pretty relaxed about it so far, but they do say that there could be disruptions in the air travel. Nevertheless, this is a massive spectacle of nature that we are able to witness here. There have been huge fountains of lava gushing from this volcanic eruption.

This is as close as the authorities are going to lead us in the volcanic eruption in the southwest of Iceland. This is the so-called, fissure eruption. That means an eruption along a crack, that could be seven several miles long, rather than on a volcanic cone. Now one of the good things about these eruptions is that actually usually, they don't spew ash into the atmosphere a very high which can, and it has in the past, disrupt air travel internationally.
