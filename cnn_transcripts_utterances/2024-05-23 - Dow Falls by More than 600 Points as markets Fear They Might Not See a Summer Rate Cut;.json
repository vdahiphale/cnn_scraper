      "sentences": "Well, of course, Brianna, that's right. But it really is all about concerns about what the Fed is going to do next. What's interesting here is that it was just six days ago that the Dow closed above 40,000 for the first time ever.Now you can see it's much closer to 39,000. But the mood can change very quickly on Wall Street, and we are, of course, seeing that play out today. You know, not that long ago, there were a lot of people on Wall Street who thought the Fed was going to be able to cut interest rates as many as six times this year because there were all these hopes that inflation was going to be moving right back to 2 percent. Of course, inflation has proven to be a lot more stubborn than people had anticipated. And the jobs market and the economy at large has been more resilient than anticipated. And so now there are these growing concerns that maybe the Fed won't be able to lower interest rates this summer, maybe not even in the fall. And that is raising some worry among investors. One of the triggers here were minutes that were released just yesterday from the most recent Fed meeting, and it showed that some officials remained worried about inflation and some of them even left open the possibility that they could have to raise interest rates. Now, that is not the consensus at this point, but just the fact that Fed officials were talking about that was enough to spook investors. And so we are seeing the Dow down 600 points, about one and a half percent with 29 minutes left in trading. U.S. stocks are basically at the lows of the day -- Boris and Brianna.",

This is about more than consumers.That was the message from the Justice Department this morning. Attorney General Merrick Garland spoke extensively about the service fees that consumers do pay when they buy tickets through Ticketmaster, the largest seller of tickets through Live Nation venues. That's their parent company in the country. But they also, the Justice Department also takes issue with how artists and venues are locked into their system. They believe that the company retaliates against concert venues that work with their rivals. They have contracts that make things problematic. But General Garland did talk quite a lot about the fees associated with tickets, even in a personal sense. He talked about a concert he went to long ago, Bruce Springsteen and Bonnie Raitt. Here's a little bit more from General Garland. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Production costs that get higher and higher, artist popularity, online scalping, ubiquitous, something that they have been very proud to say previously that they have defended, cutting that out by controlling the resale of tickets as well. Their final quote, they talk about the merger between the two companies, Live Nation, the concert promoter, and Ticketmaster, the ticket sales company. Back in 2010, the Obama administration approved it. They say the world is a better place because of that merger, not a worse one. And they are ready to go to trial.

And here's part of what it entails. $235 million for past and future cleanup costs. $25 million to establish a community health program. That's so that folks there in East Palestine in that affected area can go and have their health checked for a period of up to 20 years. $15 million for long-term water monitoring. That includes groundwater and surface water. Checking up on that for a period of 10 years in addition to paying $15 million for violations of the Clean Waters Act. Now, Norfolk Southern, for its part, its CEO, Alan Shaw, saying the following in a statement saying: We are pleased we were able to reach a timely resolution of these investigations that recognizes our comprehensive response to the community's needs and our mission to be the gold standard of safety in the rail industry. And just to give you an example of how important monitoring is, it was just last month that the EPA out there checking some of the water that goes through East Palestine found a number of deceased fish in the area, which just goes to show you the importance of the need to have increased testing there, increased monitoring of the waterways. We should also tell you that in addition to this lawsuit, in a separate lawsuit, Norfolk Southern agreed to pay $600 million in a settlement that would resolve many of the lawsuits there from residents and businesses in the affected area. But I also have to tell you after, you know, just going through and texting some folks out there, including one businessman who has a warehouse right next to the site of the derailment, he says he's not going to be part of any of these lawsuits. He does not still trust the government here, does not trust Norfolk Southern. So there are folks out there still pursuing their own lawsuits -- guys, back to you.",

That's someone who cares about the people around him, cares about his family, and wants to make a good impact in society. When you're in the locker room, there's a lot of people from a lot of different areas of life, and they have a lot of different views on everything. And we're not always going to agree.

And when you give a commencement speech, and I've been honored to give a few, the idea is to uplift and to encourage and not diminish, as he did, the women in the room and their goals and their hopes and their dreams.So, you know, that's exactly what's happening. And to Patrick Mahomes' credit and any other teammates he has, they want to keep the locker room chemistry together. If you had Patrick Mahomes come out and say maybe what he wanted to say, his wife Brittany, very accomplished, they're in business together. There's a lot more going on with Mahomes' family than having kids, which by the way, it's wonderful if you want to have kids and be a mom, of course. But I think Patrick Mahomes probably realized if he had come out strongly against his teammate, that would have sent a signal through the locker room that may have been very difficult, not only for right now in the springtime, but heading into the fall as well.",

They saw the NFL, you would have thought, would be the only league that didn't need any more help to have more viewers and TV ratings. And it did. And it was Taylor Swift, a woman, a strong woman, complete opposite of the caricature or the model, so to speak, that Harrison Butker wants for a woman. I mean, you couldn't have someone further than that away from that than Taylor Swift.So I think they're trying to play both sides against the middle.
