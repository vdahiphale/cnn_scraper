Let's listen in.KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think, last night, Donald Trump's event in Madison Square Garden really highlighted a point that I have been making throughout this campaign. He is focused and actually fixated on his grievances, on himself, and on dividing our country. And it is not in any way something that will strengthen the American family, the American worker. It is nothing about what he is saying that is actually going to support the aspirations and the dreams and the ambitions of the American people. It is absolutely something that is intended to and is fanning the fuel of trying to divide our country. And, as I have said many times, I will stay tomorrow night in my speech, there's a big difference between he and I. If you were elected, on day one, he's going to be sitting in the Oval Office working on his enemies list. On day one, if I am elected president of the United States, which I fully intend to be, I will be working on behalf of the American people on my to-do list. I will take any questions, yes.

And that's the work that I'm going to continue to do, not taking anyone for granted, but knowing that I have to earn their support.

It is just more of the same, and maybe more vivid than usual.Donald Trump spends full time trying to have Americans point their finger at each other, fans the fuel of hate and division. And that's why people are exhausted with him. That's why people who formerly have supported Donald Trump, have voted for him are supporting me, voting for me. People are literally ready to turn the page. They're tired of it. In terms of Puerto Rico, I -- even when I was in the United States Senate, I -- knowing that Puerto Rico does not have a United States senator, I was intentional about doing what I could as a United States senator to make sure that, among my priorities, it included paying attention to the needs of the people on that island, including the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. I have announced also my plan that is about my opportunity economy writ large, but a specific target that will include a task force focused on the needs of Puerto Rico, understanding that it has very specific needs in terms of upgrading and repairing its electrical grid, what it needs in terms of investment that will be public-private partnerships. And I'm going to continue to do it. I'm very proud to have the support of folks like Bad Bunny and Jennifer Lopez and others who were supporting me before that nonsense last night at Madison Square Garden and are supporting me because they understand that they want a president of the United States who's about uplifting the people, and not berating, not calling America a garbage can, which is what Donald Trump -- those are the words he has used. So there you go. I will see you later. OK.",

Governor Walker, thanks so much for being with us. We appreciate it. What is your response to what Vice President Harris said just a few moments ago, that this is why people are exhausted with Donald Trump? FMR. GOV. SCOTT WALKER (R-WI):  Well, yesterday, I think most people here in Wisconsin watched the Packers game. And during that game, I think I saw about nine or 10 Harris ads versus maybe one or two Trump ads. And those Harris ads, they were all attack ads against Donald Trump. In comparison, the one ad or two ads that I saw for the Trump campaign were about reminding people that life was better back when he was president. The prices were lower, the border was more secure, so they weren't worrying about fentanyl and other overdose deaths here. The public safety was a better issue. And I think, in the end, that's really what this boils down to and why you see it being such a tight race here in Wisconsin battleground states, even though Vice President Harris' campaign clearly has a financial advantage. I also think it's interesting. We keep hearing the vice president talking about all these horrible things Donald Trump's going to do for the next four years that he didn't do during his first term, like making promises about a to-do list of wonderful things she will do in the next four years if given a chance that she and Joe Biden didn't do. They didn't do the to-do list. And that's why this is such a tight election.",

I think there's a lot of Americans, not just Republicans or conservatives, but independents and even some Democrats like Robert F. Kennedy and others, who feel like they have been ignored by the politicians in Washington by both political parties. I think that's part of the appeal of Donald Trump, even though I think it's important for the media in particular to realize that not everyone who supports Donald Trump for president thinks or talks exactly the same way he does. They're just trying to hire someone to go into Washington and shake things up and put attention back on the issues that they believe are important.
