He is subject to the same restrictions that everybody else who's been prosecuted for misuse of classified information.

Some of his actions are known, some are not known. So somewhere between the end of the year and early next year is what I think that's going to happen.

Former President Trump, he has announced he's running for president again in the midst of multiple investigations here.

Even his base can't defend some of his actions.And courts are telling the people this is a president who's breaking the law, when the 11th Circuit ruled yesterday, where he was using it as a stall tactic, that really is going to play out in the public's mind. Well, he has to be like everybody else like the court says. They're not going to write special rules. So I think that they're getting braced and it's less likely to be chaos that he wants to provoke.
