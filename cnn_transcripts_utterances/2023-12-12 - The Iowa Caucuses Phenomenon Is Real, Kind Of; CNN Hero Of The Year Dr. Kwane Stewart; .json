So against Haley 49, 43 in Georgia. Haley bests Biden. Trump 49, 44. DeSantis here actually -- this is within the margin of error, but he does not perform as well. That sort of damages a bit of his electability argument in the Republican primary in Michigan, which Joe Biden won by a little bit of a healthier margin than he did Georgia in 2020. What you see here, Haley trouncing Biden, 50 to 38. Trump, you showed 50 to 40 against Joe Biden. And again, DeSantis is the one that`s the below 50 here, but he also is besting Joe Biden in Michigan. Underneath the horse race, we look at some attributes. So this in Georgia here, we asked the -- does -- which candidates does not have the attributes you want a president to have when it comes to temperament? OK, that is Donald Trump`s worst score, 58% say he doesn`t have that quality, 47% say that of Biden. But across the other three, understanding people like you, policy positions and sharpness and stamina, which is Joe Biden`s weakest point. You see 66% of Georgia voters say that Biden does not have the sharpness and stamina that they`re looking for in a president. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

If you set New Hampshire, ding, ding, ding, you are correct. New Hampshire`s had the tradition of holding the first U.S. presidential primary since the year 1920. This year, that will happen on January 23rd. All right, now we want to highlight someone doing extraordinary things. Our CNN audience voted that the recipient of this year`s CNN Hero of the Year Award should go to Dr. Kwane Stewart. He cares for the pets of people experiencing homelessness. Dr. Stewart said that he wanted to be a veterinarian ever since he was a kid. Then he started a nonprofit called Project Street Vet more than a decade ago, after helping to examine and treat the dog of a homeless man outside of a 7/11, where he used to get his coffee. The dog owner`s words, thank you for not ignoring me. Well, they inspired Dr. Stewart to help more people in similar situations. He started by setting up small drop-in clinics to provide free medical care to pets whose owners wouldn`t be able to afford otherwise. And since then, Dr. Stewart and his volunteer teams have treated thousands of animals while giving their owners some hope and dignity too. In his award ceremony speech, Dr. Stewart spoke about what it means to him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

KWANE STEWART, 2023 CNN HERO OF THE YEAR: If I, as a child, could dream of doing something that was impactful, then I think I found it, or it found me. And I`m so lucky to be doing what I`m doing. It`s been a wonderful journey, and as I get older, I start thinking about those big questions in life. Why are we here? What defines us? Why are we human? And I think the answer, at least for me, the answer is in the question. What does it mean to be human? And I believe it`s humanity. It`s looking out for each other, believing in each other, helping one another. And all of these people embody that. (CHEERING &amp; APPLAUSE) This part certainly wasn`t planned, but the $100,000, I want to celebrate with all of you. It splits evenly ten ways pretty nicely, so it is my contribution to all of us. I want to say I`m honored to know you and to be a part of this fraternity. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) This part certainly wasn`t planned, but the $100,000, I want to celebrate with all of you. It splits evenly ten ways pretty nicely, so it is my contribution to all of us. I want to say I`m honored to know you and to be a part of this fraternity. (CHEERS &amp; APPLAUSE) I`m here in part because -- I`m here in part because I`ve been willing to share and give throughout my life. There`s no reason to stop doing that tonight. I have one last quick thought. I was in the streets one day, and an unhoused man and his pet, after I delivered care, we got to talking. And he said sort of nonchalant, he hadn`t eaten in almost two days. And I was due for lunch myself. I returned with a sandwich for myself and for him. He tore off -- it was a sub sandwich. He tore off a corner of it, a piece of bread. He ate it, and he gave the rest to his dog. And they`ve taught me a lot, too. I`ll close by saying this. An act of kindness can change your day. Change someone`s day. An act or gesture of kindness can change somebody`s life. Thank you. (CHEERS &amp; APPLAUSE)",
