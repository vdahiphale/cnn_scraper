The U.S. said that Xi's visit provided diplomatic cover for Putin's war.Well, what really came out of the talks? We know what Putin had to gain from such a summit. But what did Xi get out of the trip? And what happens if Taiwan's President Tsai meets Kevin McCarthy in the United States this week, as is being reported? Here to unpack all of this is Cindy Yu. Cindy is an editor at \"The Spectator, \"and she hosts the magazine's podcast \"Chinese Whispers.\" Cindy, welcome. So, first tell me that the answer to that question I posed. What is Xi Jinping getting out of this? It's a fairly remarkable show of support at a critical time for Putin. CINDY YU, HOST, \"CHINESE WHISPERS\" PODCAST: Yes, absolutely. But China is playing a very long game here. So, I know, Russian relations haven't been this good really since the fall of the USSR. And we've got to bear in mind China's long term foreign policy aims when it comes to Russia. They share a very long border, a border that is not militarized at the moment because of the friendly relations, something that Xi Jinping doesn't have to think about on his northern border at the moment. China's also thinking about its energy security. Russia has huge natural resources include vast weights of natural gas. All of that, instead of going to Europe right now is going to go to China. So, we're talking about these pipelines that will be built connecting Russia and China increasingly in the future. And China is also thinking about the geopolitical wide game going on at the moment. You know, why should China's support the West against Russia when the West is increasingly hostile against China? So, they're thinking about how to prop up the Putin regime and make sure that it gets everything that it wants from this supposed neutrality.",

From Moscow's perspective, I don't think they have very much choice if they want to continue this war in Ukraine, which I don't think they can end anytime soon anyway. But from Beijing's perspective, you know, Xi Jinping holds many more cards than Putin does at the moment. And I think the reason that Xi is trying to say that he has been neutral on this war is because, yes, he wants to be friends with Russia. He wants Russia supporting any coming great power rivalry. At the same time, China's trade with the U.S. and the E.U. and other western powers is 10 times as much as that of its trade with Russia, even with the increase that we're talking about here.So, China is not going to want to (INAUDIBLE) as the Chinese say when it comes to relations with the West. So, it's trying to kind of triangulate both sides while not angering either side. And I think so far this balancing act over this first year of the war has worked out relatively well. The question is how long China can continue on this -- on this precipice because pressure is growing and as the war grows, dynamics will change.",

When it comes to Taiwan, the fundamental reality is that the People's Liberation Army is not ready to take Taiwan successfully or quickly.So, we're talking about a joint operation here, which would involve land, sea and air. And I think that's a fundamental here. The PLA is not ready. At the same time, if China thinks that peaceful reunification is not going to happen, or that outside forces are going to be taking Taiwan further and further away -- I was interviewing a senior colonel of the People's Liberation Army on my podcast just this week, who said this that these are the thresholds where if -- let's say America triggers Taiwan to move ever further away from the People's Republic of China or if Taiwan declares independence then those will be the red lines for Beijing really to take military action. Now on this visit, I think Presidents Tsai was very shrewd in saying to Kevin McCarthy, please don't come to Taiwan. Don't do a Nancy Pelosi. I'll come to you instead. And I think that does take some of the sting out of the meat. But that's not to say that China wouldn't throw some something of a small tantrum anyway. But I think for now we don't have any smoking gun as it were that China is planning an imminent invasion.",

Why was this decision so closely watched? It's because ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the Fed is caught between two competing mandates. One is to lower inflation by raising interest rates, making it harder for consumers and businesses to borrow and therefore spend. The other is to keep banks stable, and many banks are seeing their holdings lose value amid rising interest rates.The Fed hopes to do both, but it won't be easy. What can history tell us about what course the Fed is likely to take and what will happen to the global economy as a result? My next guest is the economic historian Niall Ferguson, the author of \"The Ascent of Money, A Financial History of the World\" and many, many other great books. Welcome, Niall. Let me first ask you, do you think that the Fed has so far handled this banking crisis appropriately? NIALL FERGUSON, SENIOR FELLOW, STANFORD UNIVERSITY'S HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, one of the things we discover when we go into financial history is that when a situation like this arises, whether you're a dove or a hawk, you have to do something because if you do nothing, and you get a generalized bank run, then you face a very dangerous situation indeed. So, I think in the short run, the Fed had to do something. And the thing that it had to do was to reassure uninsured depositors, people with deposits in above the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's insurance maximum that they'd be OK. But if you take a step back, it's a disastrous situation to have got into. The Fed shouldn't have had to do this. The FDIC shouldn't have had to do this. Something went terribly wrong in the oversight of not only that bank but other banks that got themselves into this situation.",

But now, in order to solve this crisis, it has to kind of do the opposite.Talk -- tell us a little bit about historically how do you resolve these two tensions? To explain to people, in the past when you've had crisis it has been a little easier because the Fed could always cut the interest rates as a way of solving the banking crisis. But now they're in this position where they're fighting inflation at the same time that they have to provide easy money for the banks.",

      "sentences": "What it doesn't want to have a generalist banking crisis. The problem is that if it wants to reassure all those uninsured depositors with large deposits at medium sized banks it needs Congress to give it a green light. Because under the new regulatory arrangements, post financial crisis it is not up to the Fed and the FDIC to make up a new rule that basically covers all bank deposits. So, it's not actually easy for the government to fix this problem.The other difficulty I think the Fed has is that it really doesn't know how much more in the way of rate hiking it can risk before this banking crisis intensifies. I think this is not just a job for Jay Powell. It's also a job for Janet Yellen. And last week, Janet Yellen really alarmed investors by seeming to suggest the decisions about uninsured deposits would be made on an ad hoc basis. So, it will kind of decide if your bank is going to be systemically important when there is a run on its deposits. That's just not consistent and credible position. So, I think it's as much the treasury as the Fed that really needs to get its act together here, communicating clearly what it's going to do to avoid a banking crisis and to avoid, of course, a much more severe recession than most people were expecting. Just a few weeks ago when the talk was all of non landings or soft landings, these sorts of Goldilocks scenarios look less and less plausible because of mistakes that have been made by both the financial, fiscal and the monetary authorities.",
