Appreciate your company.We begin once again in Morocco, a nation in shock and grieving after it was ravaged by its deadliest earthquake in decades. More than 2,000 people have died and thousands more are injured, many of them in critical condition. Emergency teams have been desperately combing through the rubble of flattened homes using picks, shovels and their bare hands to search for any signs of life. Those who did not survive the disaster are already being laid to rest as it tradition. And to honor them, the government says Morocco will observe three days of mourning. The World Health Organization says the disaster has affected more than 300,000 people in Marrakech and surrounding areas. Locals say they city's world heritage, old city and Medina has seen extensive damage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We get more details now from CNN's Sam Kiley in Marrakech.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Morocco's king, Mohammed, has declared three days of national mourning here in Marrakech, and that is because his country has been completely devastated by an extraordinary earthquake, totally unexpected in cities like this, Marrakech. This has been the scene here in the Medina, the most ancient part of this ancient city. Here, a building clearly ripped away by this earthquake, but the scenes have been even worse in the interior of the country where one woman who was trapped for some 12 hours was pulled from rubble in a remote village. Now, there are 13 people dead here in Marrakech. Across the country, more than 1,300 people have died and the authorities here expect those numbers to climb with some rapidity. The problem though is getting out into the areas that are worst affected. The epicenter is about 45 miles of south of Marrakech, but the areas that have been really badly devastated, according to the local authorities, have been villages in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. These are villages that aerial photographs have already showed have been completely flattened, with one or two houses remaining, looking as if they've been built on scree. Now, that scree, that rubble, was once villages, and it is in those areas where the authorities are most concerned that the numbers of casualties of the dead and injured will climb. But, of course, the other problem for the authorities is the getting to these locations is really going to be very, very difficult because they're saying large numbers of the roads, the communication networks have been severed by this earthquake, which was completely unanticipated. No locals I've spoken to here in Marrakech can remember any history of earthquakes here. Elsewhere in the country, yes, but, here, they say they've never experienced, and no tale, no history, they say, of any kind of earthquake. But this is the result. Bedsteads, bedding, carpets left hanging over the edge of walls that have been utterly sliced away as this ancient city has been rebuilt over the last few decades. Enormous amount of effort has been put into the reconstruction of Marrakech, particularly here in the Medina, one of the prides of Morocco. Very much a tourist destination but also a location of one of the king's major palaces, it is very much the cultural center for many Moroccans, and this is what this latest earthquake has done. Sam Kiley, CNN, in Marrakech. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it's pretty was rare. Since 1900, only nine earthquakes of a magnitude five or higher have occurred. So, a lot people felt very strong shaking. Almost 3 million people felt strong shaking and almost half a million people felt either very strong to severe shaking with this particular earthquake. So, aftershocks of 5.8. There's normally an average of, one, could see up to 100 earthquakes at a magnitude of 3.8 or greater in the coming days and even weeks after the initial quake. So, that's significant, especially because a lot of buildings, the structures are already compromised from the initial quake. And so, any additional quakes could cause further damage, and that's the big fear. Another thing to consider is the weather moving forward with recovery efforts. It's going to be brutally hot over the next couple of days. It is going to stay dry, but high temperatures are going to be in the low 90s with lows in the mid-60s.",

Now, they don't necessarily describe these efforts as related to China. They think that this is about American influence abroad and trying to make things better for these countries themselves, but, really, you can't look at this without kind of seeing this attempt, this chess game in this region to try and expand American influence at a time when China's military and economic aggressions are causing so much concern in this region, Michael.",

In its latest update, Turkey's caving federation says Dickey is currently being transported by a stretcher through the passages of the cave.

The actual ascent is said to be divided into seven paths, according to the European Cave Rescue Association, with each segment being overseen by different rescue teams.

He's also putting on their -- around their necks a khadi scarf.

The message going out is that this is something that Narendra Modi has been pushing for to put India on the global stage.
