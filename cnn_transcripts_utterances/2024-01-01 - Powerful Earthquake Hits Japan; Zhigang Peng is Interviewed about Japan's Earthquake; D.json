You see them there, hiding under the tables as everything really shakes around them. Some buildings have collapsed and people are said to be trapped in the rubble.A hospital in the area says that they're receiving injured patients, but some doctors haven't been able to get to the hospital because roads are damaged, and several highways are closed. We're hearing that at one hospital people are being treated in the parking lot. There have been more than a dozen aftershocks, and that could continue for days. We have team coverage for you. CNN's Hanako Montgomery is in Tokyo and Derek Van Dam is at the CNN Weather Center. Hanako, we want to start with you. And I understand you have some new reporting on the damages. What are you learning? HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Rahel. Yes, so we've heard from NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, that there have been at least two people who are experiencing cardiac arrest. We also know that 33,000 homes in Ishikawa prefecture are experiencing blackouts. We also know that bullet trains, train lines are being suspended and that there are just so many cracks in the road that it's difficult for emergency personnel to get to Ishikawa prefecture, like you said. We also know that 1,000 self-defense force personnel have been dispatched to the area. On top of that, 1,700 personnel from Japan's firefighters have been dispatched to help with emergency response. Twenty aircrafts within the self-defense force are also just monitoring the area, trying to assess what kind of damage has been caused by this earthquake, by the tsunami. We're also seeing really just scary footage of just fires roaring in Ishikawa prefecture as people try to escape their homes. And I just want to take a moment and kind of contextualize this as well because today is New Year's Day in Japan. We don't really celebrate Thanksgiving or Christmas here, so New Year's Day is really a time when many people celebrate with their families, with their friends in their homes. And, suddenly, right, this earthquake hit at 4:10 p.m. local time, which really just shocked many people. But also the western coast of Japan isn't really associated with very big, natural disasters. Of course we saw the 2011 triple disaster, and that was on the eastern coast of Japan. So really this has been a shocking moment and a very terrifying moment for many people on the western coast of Japan, Rahel.",

      "sentences": "Derek Van Dam, watching the tsunami threat for us. Derek, thank you very much.Just to give people a sense of the geography here, what we're talking about, this is the Ishikawa prefecture right here. This was the epicenter of the earthquake. Tokyo, across the island, about 180 miles away, the earthquake absolutely was felt in Tokyo by tens of millions of people. But the epicenter here, the Ishikawa prefecture here, the population there is much lower. It's a prefecture with a population of about one million people right here. The major city has fewer than half a million people. Still, there are tens of thousands of people inside the extreme danger zone. Let's talk more about the threats they're seeing, particularly the tsunami threat. This is the area of greatest concern right there. With us now is Dr. Zhigang Peng, professor of geophysics at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Professor, thank you so much for being with us. What are you watching most closely this morning? DR. ZHIGANG PENG, PROFESSOR OF GEOPHYSICS, GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY: Well, you have already talked about a tsunami. That's definitely one of the things we have to be really watching out. But another thing I should point out is that because of the event of this size, that we expect lots of aftershocks. And as you probably know, houses in Japan they're not very strong. They're mostly wooden building structures. So they can withstand some of the shaking. But if you have continuous vibration, mostly aftershocks, then that could cause some damages. And as you've already pointed out, that sometimes if it cause fires, that cause - that get -- become another problem. So, those are primarily two things that I think, you know, people at the epicenter region, you know, really have to watch out.",

This, obviously, makes it difficult to get aid and to get rescue operations underway if they're in any way needed. Obviously, there is more shaking and whatnot in other places as well.And I'm glad you brought up aftershocks because I think in some ways the very term diminishes the threat. These are earthquakes. They may not be as powerful as the initial earthquake, but the repetition in and of itself can be very dangerous. Can you explain that?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. So, one of the things that we know, and I can point out, is typically (INAUDIBLE) the people think that aftershocks are smaller than the main event, but there's always a very small percentage, we talk about maybe like 5 percent or 10 percent chance that an aftershock could be larger than the initial event. And in that case, of course, we call the aftershock as the main event and we call the previous event as the main shock. So, things like that could happen. But it's a very small probability. But it's not zero. So, that's one thing I like to point out to your audiences is that the sequence is still unfolding. It's not over yet.",

      "timeStamp": "09:10:04",
      "speaker": "PENG",
      "sentences": "Right. I think when you talk about this, you know, earthquake, the size matters. So, the event that occurred in 2011 is definitely much larger and, of course, is mostly offshore and triggered a much larger tsunami. So, for now, I think with the event of this size, you know, the tsunami probably is almost over or will probably lingering for a while. So, that probably won't be a concern.One of the concerns, of course, obviously, which is hard to tell at this case, as time is, whether or not there will be something bigger happen. So, that will be probably one of the main concern. I want to actually point out, as I was checking with my colleagues in Japan, is that this region apparently is a region that had an ongoing earthquake swarm that had been lasting for several years. And so when you say earthquake swarm, that means a lot of events that actually happening in a very short time period, but in this case lasts already for several years. In addition to this event, the 7.5 event, actually we also have a magnitude 4 - 4 shock that occurred about five minutes or eight minutes before. So, this is -- what we're seeing here, of course, is a larger event, but we should look at in a larger context. In this region there are ongoing earthquake activities that have already lasting for several years and here comes the big one. So, I think that's one thing to watch out is what's going to happen next.",

The disaster for Donald Trump would be, say, if Ron DeSantis slips up and gets pretty close to him in Iowa, or somehow ties him or overtakes him, and then Nikki Haley does the same thing to him in New Hampshire. That would be a nightmare for him. But a dream scenario for Trump, and it's within his grasp, is to win by a record amount in Iowa and then turn around and fend off a harder state for him, New Hampshire, where you've got Haley, and as was mentioned in Eva's piece, Chris Christie dragging her down there as well.",

So, hats off to Chris Christie.I don't think it's enough, honestly. I know that Governor Sununu and Chris Christie and even Nikki Haley are putting their hats on New Hampshire. However, respectfully, Donald Trump's up by 60 points in South Carolina. So, even with a decent showing in New Hampshire, it's already game, set, match.

I mean in some ways these guys are magnets for each other and they both have glaring weaknesses. And, obviously, independent voters are not happy with the current president. But in the last midterm, we saw independent voters not happy with the current president and they still voted for his party anyway. Are they going to do that again?So, there's a lot of unknowns, I hesitate even to hazard a prediction on how this is going to turn out because I don't - I just don't really know. I think the American people don't want this choice, they don't want this rematch and there is some nostalgia for Donald Trump's economic policies, but there's probably not any nostalgia for some of the other things that he did or stands for and the way he left office.
