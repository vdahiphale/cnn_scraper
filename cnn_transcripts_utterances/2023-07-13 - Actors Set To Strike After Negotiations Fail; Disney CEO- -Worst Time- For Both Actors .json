And the guild of 160,000 actors had previously authorized a strike if not no deal was reached.Now they're waiting for the national board of SAG-AFTRA to formalize a vote. And we'll hear about that result at noon in Los Angeles. The sticking points have to do with a few major things, compensation, residuals when it comes to streaming and artificial intelligence. In what SAG-AFTRA has been telling the public, they have said that there are enormous shifts in the industry and economy that have been detrimental to their workforce. As you can imagine, we live in a world where we stream all of our content now and the residual payments, they say, have not really caught up with that. Of course, you can imagine A.I. is a concern when you think about that technology taking the digital likeness of an actor. So there have been opinions on this, of course. And today, we heard from Disney CEO Bob Iger commenting on the strike as well. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I completely respect that. I've been around long enough to understand that dynamic and to appreciate it. But you also have to be realistic about it, the business environment and what this business can deliver. It has been great business for all of these people and it will continue to be even through disruptive times. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Is concerned.And they said they're disappointed that SAG-AFTRA made the decision to stop negotiating, saying that this potential strike here causes further financial hardship for the thousands that depend on the industry for their livelihood. Now in speaking to anybody in this town, they would agree that there is a lot of financial hardship already with writers on strike for more than 70 days. Now with the actors potentially joining them ,this is about to get worse for a lot of people even outside of the film and TV industry who serve these productions -- Brianna?",

This Opill, it is as you mentioned, a daily oral contraceptive. So this is not meant to be an emergency contraceptive. And it contains the hormone progestin. And we have seen this type of oral contraceptive used with prescription. Now it's available without a prescription.

They did not say who the operator of the drone was. They don't know what the origin of the drone was. Or at least they're not saying. Lieutenant Colonel Bivens said there could be a very innocent explanation for that or it could be connected to the escape, he said. And another quote from him in describing this was, quote, \"I'm not a big believer in coincidence.\" Now another person who has spoken to the media is Tim Ryan. I caught up to him yesterday. He owns a cabin in the Allegheny National Forest not far from here. He knows the terrain very well. He hikes there all the time. I asked him what Michael Burham and his pursuers are up against if they hit some of the most severe terrain in the Alleghany National Forest? Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
