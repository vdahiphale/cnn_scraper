I'm Julia Chatterley in New York.And we begin with a warning from the United Nations, which says that we are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East. The U.N. secretary general is calling on Hamas to immediately release the hostages it has been holding since it's terror attacks in Israel on October 7th, which more than 1,400 people were killed, according to the IDF. In retaliation, Israel's military says they're preparing for combined and coordinated strikes from air, sea, and land. But we still have no word on exactly when that defensive may begin. The U.N. is also calling for immediate humanitarian access in Gaza, which has been under intense airstrikes over the past week. Palestinian health authorities say the death toll has now passed 2,600 lives as tens of thousands of people moved south to safety. Diplomats are now racing to stop this crisis from getting worse. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has made visits to Egypt, to Saudi Arabia, and to Jordan. After meetings in Cairo, he promised that the crucial Rafah border crossing will be open soon, and that progress is being made. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I had very good conversations, both with the crown prince in Saudi Arabia and here in Egypt with President El-Sisi. I also heard a lot of good ideas from some of the things that we need to do moving forward, including practical ideas and giving assistance to Palestinians in Gaza who are in need, but also good and important conversations about the future, and where we hope ultimately, together, we can bring this in a much more positive way.

The ministry also calling on the world to send medical teams as it accuses Israel of targeting medical staff and their families. One of the most critical issues is access to clean water, which Israel closed off and response to Hamas attacks. Israel told CNN that water has now been restored to southern Gaza, but the director of the water authority there said he could not be sure it was true, because electricity remains switched off. Speaking to the British prime minister, Jordan's king said denying food, water, and electricity to innocent civilians in Gaza is a war crime. Israel insists it is now working with the U.N. to establish a humanitarian zone in Gaza. (BEGIN VDIEO CLIP) MICHAEL HERZOG, ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO U.S.: We are in the process of establishing a humanitarian zone, a big humanitarian zone in the southern part of Gaza with the U.N. We are working very closely with the U.N. agency so that they would go there and be in that humanitarian zone. They will get all of the essential provisions, like water, medicine, food, things like that. We are in that process. We have no desire for to rule over the lives of over 2 million Palestinians, and certainly, we want people to go back to their homes. We're talking about innocence civilians and we are doing everything we can to keep them out of harm's way, while Hamas is doing everything it can to keep them in harm's way. That's the situation we are in. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She joins us from Ashkelon. Clarissa, great to have you with us. Let's talk about the humanitarian crisis.

That breaks down roughly to give you a sense, one Palestinian killed every five minutes, since Hamas's bloody attacks.So, there is a real fear as well but this could escalate if another front in the war opens. There have been a lot of activities today relatively speaking, on the border with southern Lebanon. The fear is that if Hezbollah potentially gets involved in a more meaningful way, that could also have drastic implications.

There are many Israelis who, honestly right now, they feel such shock, so horrified, and they are so angered by what happened last Saturday that they do want revenge. They want to completely stomp out Hamas once in for all.The issue becomes, how are you actually go a debate that happened? Will a ground invasion actually result in Hamas being eviscerated? If so, what comes in Hamas's place? President Biden just told \"60 Minutes\" that he doesn't think that Israel should try to re-occupy Gaza. Israel's president also reiterated that to Wolf Blitzer in an interview earlier, saying that they did not have -- the Israelis do not have any interest in the occupying Gaza. I would say that there are also Israelis that feel like their government bears some responsibility in this in terms of the intelligence failures, and in terms of the nature of this coalition here in Israel. Primarily, I think the many people are really focused on the issue of the hostages, and desperately wanting to see some kind of a resolution on that front, some kind of release of those hostages. That, of course, would be very complicated by any kind of a ground offensive. But again, it's important to underscore, Julia, that Israel is a democracy.

And that's hard. As your correspondent Clarissa and others have indicated, even if you do get a mass movement of people from northern Gaza to southern Gaza, taking care of them and providing them with all their needs is a humongous task.I think the issue of Egypt is off the table. It means that you are talking about 1 million additional people are more in an area that simply can't sustain them. On the other hand, I think that much of the world community has basically looked in the mirror and said, what would we do if a circumstance presented itself such as Hamas' attack is a massacre of civilians, you know, it goes beyond terrorism. Terrorism is designed to achieve political goals. This was simply mass murder. I think that's what's behind the kind of uncertainty on the part of the international community with regard to whether or not they can put any pressure on Israel. I don't think the pressure is going to come right away. I think Israel understands it has to moderate its activities.",

One is the people and Gaza, many of whom are refugees from 1948 really don't want to leave Gaza because they're afraid they will never be allowed to come back. Egypt recognizes that. They don't want to be burdened by becoming a host of people who don't want to have left their homes.So, it's a much more complicated issues and putting some pressure on Egypt. There are additional factors, it were not thinking about it. Egypt has faced a bit of its own security issue in the over the last ten years. There is an insurrection. That insurrection has been fueled in part by the same people who have been providing arms and training to Hamas.

It seems the only feasible route to get aid in and people out of Gaza, and that includes Americans, too.We're also hearing from the United Nations now. It seems no one was hurt after a rocket hit its peacekeepers headquarters in southern Lebanon. The U.N. officials say there are still trying to determine where the rocket was launched from. There was an intense exchange of fire on Lebanon's border with Israel earlier. We're also getting an update from the Israeli defense forces. The IDF says its fighter jet hit Hezbollah military infrastructure in Lebanon earlier Sunday. An uptick in clashes with Hezbollah is also raising fears that the conflict could spread further. It's important to remember that human tragedy at the center of the war between Israel and Hamas. Israeli newspapers are doing just that, by featuring pictures of children on its front page. They are believed to be missing or held hostage in Gaza. The headline reads: This is how hell feels. CNN cannot independently verify the fate of each child featured. And around the world, people are taking to the streets to show support for both the Israelis and the Palestinians. Jewish communities in the United States have held rallies in solidarity with Israel and several western nations have stepped up security at synagogues and Jewish schools. At this gathering in Sydney, Australia, there were calls for peace and justice and condemnation of Israel's military action against Gaza. In other countries like France, pro-Palestinian demonstrations have been banned. I want to get to Melissa Bell in Paris.
