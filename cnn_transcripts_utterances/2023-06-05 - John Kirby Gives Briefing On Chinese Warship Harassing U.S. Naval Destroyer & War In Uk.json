I will let them speak to that.What I can say, Kelly, and we've said this before, we don't encourage, we don't enable, and we don't support strikes or attacks inside Russia. Our effort -- and we've been competingly plain about this with Ukraine. Our effort is to support them in their self-defense, in defending their territory, their sovereignty. That's what's been violated by Mr. Putin and Russia. That's what we're helping them get back, their independence, their territorial integrity. And that's where the focus is. And I'm not telling you anything that we haven't said pride privately to the Ukrainians in terms of expressing our concerns about that. They know our concerns. They have provided us, all the way up to President Zelenskyy, assurances they will respect those concerns.",

The plane was a Cessna Citation.Just before Sunday's crash, F-16 fighter jets intercepted the Cessna over Washington, D.C., airspace. It was headed from Tennessee to Long Island, New York, but instead of landing, it actually turned around and started flying south, entering D.C.'s restricted air space, and it crashed soon afterward. The plane's erratic path had authorities putting the Capitol Complex on elevated alert. Fighter jets were scrambled. They were authorized to hit supersonic speeds, causing a massive sonic boom heard over the region. Officials said they tried to make contact but the pilot of the Cessna was unresponsive. Listen.

It's several miles into the terrain behind us.This is very steep terrain, very drastic terrain, extremely different to get to a crash site. It takes several hours to get in and back out. We may not get an update for several hours or possibly even until tomorrow after the FAA and NTSB investigators get back from the site. What we have been told is that, from first responders, when they got to the site last night -- and again it took hours and several of them almost got injured getting there. That's how difficult the trek is. When they got there, they spotted what was four or five recognizable pieces of a plane, but one of these told me, quote, \"It was no bigger than your arm.\" There were also human remains at the site, they said. They said the plane left a sizable crater in the ground. From what they saw, that crater, the contours and everything else there, they believe the plane impacted the mountains at a very steep angle, Boris. A very dramatic and horrible scene deep into the mountains where NTSB investigators are liking at that site now. One thing they were looking for is to see whether the plane had any black box, cockpit voice recorder or flight recorder. We are told this particular private jet was not required to have black boxes, so it may not have anything in there. But some of these planes are outfitted with the boxes nonetheless and they'll look to see if they can pull some of those out if they're there -- Boris?",

The protocol when an aircraft, any aircraft, an incapacitated pilot situation or just a pilot who is confused, on the wrong path, or someone intending ill intent, that's what the United States and other countries have been trained to do.They try to make contact with the pilot. But also, they can get close enough to literally look in and see, what's the condition of the pilots? Are they slumped over? Are the windows fogged over with ice, et cetera? In other cases, they can see into the cabin windows to see the condition of the passengers on board. The scrambled fighter jets play an important role, sometimes, in the case of sleeping pilots. There were two flights last year, commercial aviation flights, where both pilots fell asleep. One was an Ethiopian airline; one was over Italy. In Italy, there were met with fighter jets and they woke them up. So it's an important role for these fighter jets. And in this case, they did exactly what they were supposed to do.",

We hear the stories over and over again with cancer drugs and other medicines.This is called Cisplatin, and it's incredibly important for chemotherapy regiments for a number of cancers, from lung cancer to bladder cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer and testicular cancer, where it can be curative for many patients. The National Cancer Institute estimates it's used in between 10 percent to 20 percent of all cancer patients. So the fact this was in shortage since February, it has caused a ton of problems for doctors and patients. They've to delay treatments, substitute other medicines and, in some cases, ration care for the people most likely to be cured. So it's a terrible situation. The FDA is now saying it will allow the temporary importation of a version of this drug from a Chinese drug maker. The FDA commissioner tweeting on late Friday night, quote, \"The agency recognizes the importance of a stable, safe supply of critical drugs used in oncology, especially those in potentially curative or life- extending situations.\" They say they have taken steps for temporary application of certain approved versions of Cisplatin products from FDA-registered facilities.
