We are live on the ground as he continues his tour of the island. Then fresh fears in Russia of the new mobilization wave as parliament approves a law which tightens military conscription rules. Plus, two more boats arrive in Italy carrying hundreds of migrants following a rescue operation. I'll be speaking to one of the groups involved in the search efforts about this very crisis. But first, U.S. President Joe Biden is in the Republic of Ireland after making historic visit, of course, to Northern Ireland, marking the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Peace Agreement. The peace plan was brokered by the U.S. back in 1998, ending three decades of conflict in Northern Ireland. Mr. Biden spoke at a university in Belfast, urging local leaders to resolve the ongoing political crisis as well as keep the peace. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Our team is on the ground, Donie O'Sullivan is following the very latest for us, Nic Robertson standing by in Belfast in Northern Ireland. But first to Donie, at the president, not just political, Donie, but also a part of a pilgrim -- pilgrimage, I should say, a kind of home coming. Tell us what you're seeing. DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Exactly, so we're here in Dundalk County Louth, which is just south of the border with Northern Ireland. And there's a lot of excitement here because the president is about to arrive any minute. There are hundreds of people lining the streets here, and the scenes are quite reminiscent of 60 years ago when President John F. Kennedy, the first Irish Catholic president visited Ireland and kind of began this tradition as you say, this pilgrimage almost of Irish-American presidents coming to the country and tracing their roots. You know, you mentioned that he gave speech in Northern Ireland today, and there are many formal political events on his itinerary. But this is very much a very personal trip. He's spending most of the rest of the evening with family, friends or relatives here and also doing the same here. He'll be traveling to the west coast of Ireland on Friday, where he's got more relatives and will be delivering a speech there.",

But people have been waiting here in the rain for hours, and it's difficult to say from here. There's certainly hundreds of people here, but possibly thousands. Everybody is hoping that he will get out of the vehicle and shake hands. He's known to do that. So folks here are certainly hopeful for that.

That's Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. That's the party that at the moment refuses to go into the power-sharing government. And President Biden laid out how other than just bringing peace to real big achievement of the Good Friday Agreement was to establish this power-sharing government, and it is this power-sharing government at Stormont that the Democratic Unionist Party doesn't want to join right now. They've got issues with Brexit, and the leader of the party afterwards, spoke and said, look, what President Biden has said does not change the political dynamic. He said I agree with President Biden that revitalizing and improving the economy in Northern Ireland is the way forward. But he said, I see it a different way, he said. I see it that Northern Ireland at least, be able to have complete, free and unfettered access to the U.K. mainland market, and that's his point. And I think -- so I said on the surface, it hasn't moved the needle, but I think what the expectation is certainly among politicians who are very close to this process and diplomats, is that after the local elections here in May, Jeffrey Donaldson may then try to move his party back into that power- sharing government. It's not clear if he will, but it would be too sensitive, a decision for him to take. That's the assessment for him to take right now. And we actually heard that from the Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin, and then there's been a political space created for Donaldson essentially to do this.",

The rain has stopped, thankfully. But you can see how loved he is, Donie. O'SULLIVAN:  Yes, exactly, and he's a little further up the line here. He's going to be making his way down here through the center of Dundalk, and he's actually going to a bar called the Windsor. So take from that what you will, given conversations about the Windsor framework as Nic was talking about. But look, this is a -- you know, this is a trip that has been a very long- time coming for President Biden. He has visited here as vice president. He actually came here as a private citizen after he -- after he finished the vice presidency. And we've been speaking to a lot of his relatives. He has many cousins here in Ireland or people who at least claim to be his cousin, but he does have a connection with a lot of them. You know, we spoke to some cousins who visited him this St. Patrick's Day in the White House. So there is that genuine connection there, they also told us when he was a private citizen, essentially showed up in Ballymena, his other ancestral home on the west coast of Ireland here incognito and was walking around, folks didn't realize it was the then former vice president of the United States.",

We learned from his lawyer yesterday, that an ambulance was called to the Penal Colony on the night from Friday to Saturday. We also learned that he lost 8 kilos over the last two weeks. And we believe that his health is in serious condition. It's something related to stomach pain. He has never had stomach problems.

This is a recycled plastic facility basically behind me. And it is plastic that is burning for the most part. It's, as we understand, the state fire marshal here in Indiana has said that what is billowing out of there is definitely toxic. I'm going to give you a little bit of a better view so you can see, even with this amount of smoke coming out, it is vastly better than it was this morning, when the thick clouds were really billowing up past these trees, almost to the point you couldn't even see the structure of any sort of building that was burning itself. As we understand the fire started in a truck trailer that contained plastics. That fire then spread to debris that was littered around the property, plastic debris. And then the compound began getting engulfed. Now the good news is we've had some Environmental Protection Agency officials here on the ground, conducting some air quality tests. And what they have told us is that at the ground level what most people are breathing, the air quality does not contain toxins, which is good. However, they did see traces of basically smoke particles. And that's part of why we're wearing this mask, the N-95 mask, because it helps filter out some of that. But even though smoke particles can be the very, very troublesome for people with respiratory issues and so that is why they're urging everybody within a certain amount of radius from this spot to evacuate. About 2,000 people or so that have gotten that order. As for the cause of this specifically, we do not know. However, the mayor says they've had issues with this property before, citing them for potential fire hazards multiple times, as the mayor's described it. And so as officials thought about this place, for them it was more of a matter of when this would happen as opposed to if this would happen and here we are. It has happened and we are left dealing with the aftermath.",

On Tuesday, the junta attacked a town if youremember in Sakine region of the country. A spokesperson for the junta says he was targeting armed terrorists and explosives at the site caused the blast and many of the deaths. A U.N. official says the military is losing control and getting desperate. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) THOMAS ANDREWS, U.N. SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON MYANMAR:  They're losing control of the country. They're losing ground. Things are much more unstable on the ground than they've ever been and they continue to become more and more unstable. So there are soldiers, who they have put on the ground, are finding themselves to be subject to attacks, to ordnance of various kinds, guerilla attacks by people in these areas and villages that are very strongly opposed to the military junta. So as a result of that, they're using airpower more and more and, of course, as they do so, more and more civilians are being killed because of that ordnance being dropped from the air does not distinguish between its targets.

Now he broke out of a facility run by the private company last May after faking his own death in a fire. He was arrested in Tanzania on Friday, along with two others. Lawmakers want to know how Bester was able to flee from one of South Africa's most secure facilities. Three employees at the prison were dismissed following his escape. CNN's Larry Maduro joins now from Nairobi with more. And, Larry, this sounds like something out of a movie. How exactly did he manage to escape here?",

I justreturned from South Africa and the entire nation is captivated by this. How did Thabo Bester, a 35 year old who was serving a life sentence for rape and murder, finally manage to escape from maximum security prison? He had applied to be moved to solitary confinement just three days before this fire in the prison, where he faked his own death. And they somehow planted a body in his cell and he left the prison and was living with his girlfriend, Dr. Nandipha Magudumana, a celebrity doctor and entrepreneur that's very well known in South Africa. She has more than 100,000 followers on Instagram, very glamorous. And this happened in May. But it's only until earlier this year when a local investigative outlet started to ask questions that DNA analysis revealed that he did not die in the fire. It was believed that he was actually on the loose. A manhunt was launched and he somehow managed to flee South Africa, go through three or four countries. It was in Tanzania, where he was arrested with the doctor and another accomplice. They were said to be just 10 kilometers from crossing over here into Kenya. So officials are now in Tanzania trying to get them deported back into South Africa so that they can face charges. He will be sent right back to prison. But officials were hard pressed to explain to parliament exactly how something this brazen could have happened. Listen.",

But he was running what is called amultibillion dollar business inside that prison, multibillion rand business. In fact, one of the more outrageous things is he appeared to speak at a conference from inside prison. The guests were told he was speaking from New York. They even sang him happy birthday. This man was in prison, a maximum security prison in South Africa. And maybe the most audacious, Isa, is that he organized a women in media conference in South Africa that had big celebrity names advertised, including Halle Berry and Taraji P. Henson. This only unraveled when both celebrities said we don't know about this. We're not booked for this.",
