On Tuesday, he made a surprise visit to the frontline city of Bakhmut, which has been at the epicenter of one of the biggest battles of the war so far, explosions could be heard at a distance as he met with Ukrainian troops.A month ago, just days after Ukrainian forces retook the city of Kherson, Zelenskyy was there attending a flag raising ceremony. And CNN is reporting the Ukrainian president is now on his first international trip since the war began. He's expected to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House later on Wednesday. One U.S. official telling CNN this visit is about a lot more than symbolism and displays of defiance. With Zelenskyy in Washington, the U.S. president is expected to announce another huge military aid package for Ukraine worth almost $2 billion. And for the first time, military assistance to Ukraine from the U.S. will include Patriot defense missiles, the most advanced air defense system in the world. And during their visit to Bakhmut, President Zelenskyy seemed to hint about his trip to D.C. while also making it known what he will be asking for once he arrives. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): It is a complicated situation, the enemy increases the number of its troops. Our boys are braver and we need more sophisticated weapons. We will pass on gratitude from our boys to the U.S. Congress and the U.S. president for their support. But it is not enough.

And when they lost that legal battle last month, it seems it's only a matter of time before they'll be public. On Tuesday, the Democrat controlled House Ways and Means Committee voted to release six years of Trump's tax records from 2015 to 2020. The committee has found the IRS, the Internal Revenue Service failed to follow its own procedures and did not audit Trump during his first two years as president. We have more now from CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Now, it's been years since House Democrats after they came to power in 2019 demanded Donald Trump's tax return went through a court fight that Donald Trump took all the way to the Supreme Court to try to shield those tax returns from becoming public. He lost that fight. Ultimately, those returns turned over to Democrats just a matter of weeks ago. But in a party line vote, the House Democrats in their final days in power, the Ways and Means Committee voted to release those tax returns from six years -- six recent years, as well as not just his individual returns, but his business returns as well. That vote 24 to 16 along party lines to release both report from the committee investigating this as well as all of those returns. Now, first, on the report, there were two that were released late on Tuesday night, one of which is a committee's investigation that found that the mandatory presidential audit system or that the IRS employs for all sitting presidents, they say that it was dormant during the Trump years. They say that is an essential program because they need to ensure that the president is not compromised in any way in signing legislation into law. But they said he was not essentially in use until April of 2019. That is when Richard Neal, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, a Democrat started to inquire about Donald Trump's tax returns. They say at that point, that's when the IRS audit program kicked into gear and they said it never was completed over the six years of returns that they ultimately obtained. Now, there's a separate report by the Joint Committee on Taxation analyzing those returns, it raises some questions about some of the deductions that Donald Trump took, suggested that perhaps more investigation might be warranted. It did not make a judgment one way or the other but it got into the numbers of his deductions, his losses in the income that he reported, but we expect a lot more including all details of those tax returns in the days ahead. Right now, the committee is trying to redact some of the sensitive security information, some of the confidential information like social security numbers and the like. Once that is done, they will be released and it will come out before Democrats are no longer in power in the House. January 3rd is when Republicans take over. Republicans attacking Democrats for misusing their power and releasing Donald Trump's returns. Donald Trump spokesperson also attacking committee Democrats but nevertheless, they are moving forward and also moving forward on legislation to mandate how presidents are audited under the -- by the IRS. That is something Nancy Pelosi in her final days of speaker plans to bring to the floor. Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But now, not only has Dongxing (ph) lifted its lockdown, the government announced on primetime television that people who have COVID, as long as they are only mildly sick or asymptomatic, well, they can return to work. But people are still scared to go out. Restaurants and shopping malls in the city barely have any customers. Subways across major cities are eerily empty. But none of this is stopping Chinese state media from hailing the country's COVID strategy as victory after victory. As the Chinese people feel they are suddenly left to fend for themselves.
