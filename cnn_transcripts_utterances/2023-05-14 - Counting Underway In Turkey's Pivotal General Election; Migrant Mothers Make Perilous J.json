I'm Alex Marquardt, in today for Fredricka Whitfield.We begin this hour with the votes being counted in Turkey's high stakes presidential election. The race could have global repercussions by reshaping the country's domestic and foreign relationships. Right now current president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is facing the greatest challenge yet to his 20-year rule. At the moment it would be 60 million plus votes still being counted. The election is too close to call. Both Erdogan and his main opposition claim to be leading. For the very latest, let's check in with CNN's Jomana Karadsheh in Istanbul. And it is live where you are, Jomana.",

Vote counting is continuing and we expect in the coming hours to get the preliminary results of this presidential vote.We've got the whole country right now is anxiously awaiting the results. And we will find out what the Turks decided to vote today. Did they decide to vote for President Erdogan, for more of the same, for the promise that he is going to continue on the same path for this country, or are they -- did they decide to go for the opposition that has promised them change, to reverse the past few years of President Erdogan's rule, and they say a return to real democracy? Or is this divided, polarized nation headed towards a run-off in two weeks' time? We'll have to wait and see in the coming hours. We can tell you today we were at polling centers speaking to people and supporters of the president say they want him to continue to lead this country. They say they trust no one other than him to lead Turkey. And then you speak to others who say they've had enough. They want change, they want real democracy, freedoms, rights. There's just much on people's minds. The state of the economy. They're very unhappy with the government's response to that disastrous earthquake in February. Almost everyone you spoke to will tell you that they felt that this is such a critical election for their country.

The sanctions would be better enforced. Ukrainian grain would be able to leave port more easily. All the things that Erdogan has been playing a little bit -- you know, has been playing both sides would be less true.Remember, there's the other huge issue on which Erdogan has played extraordinary politics, which is the refugees. Erdogan has kept threatening Europe with sending a stream of refugees from the Middle East essentially mostly fleeing the Syrian civil war. And in return for that, it's essentially blackmail. In return for him not doing that, the Europeans keep sending him money. So there are so many areas where Erdogan has put his personal stamp on policies that are quite unusual, and a departure for Turkey. The Ukraine war, you're absolutely right, is the most urgent and most critical one where an Erdogan loss could mean a big shift in policy.",

He wanted to join the European Union.But the Erdogan of the last seven or eight years has become increasingly anti-Western, increasingly illiberal, increasingly authoritarian. He's shut down a lot of independent media. He's shut down independent bureaucracy. He's taken a very tough line on the Kurds, all areas where he had been much more accommodating and progressive early in his presidency. So there's a story here about power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely.

And to be clear, they are still at or near capacity. So what has been qualified by the DHS secretary as a 50 percent decrease in apprehensions, it's at least given the system an opportunity to essentially catch up.But back to your earlier point, the human element in all of this, you know, we had an opportunity to visit one of these shelters and to hear from some of these migrants, many of them single mothers coming from countries where they've already celebrated Mother's Day, but today they still have a reason to hang on to hope despite their very complicated situation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SANDOVAL (voice-over): Step inside this shelter in the heart of El Paso, Texas, and you'll find people waiting in limbo. They're migrant families. Some single mothers who told us they were recently processed and released by border authorities. While some children visibly exhausted nap inside, others play in the courtyard. The young minds spared the anguish of moms and dads trying to figure out when or even if they can continue the rest of the journey in what can easily become a hopeless space. It seems the migrant mothers keep hope alive here. Conny Barahona keeps it to together for Daniella, her 9-year-old. She says two of her older daughters ages 18 and 20 remain in federal detention. It will be a sad Mother's Day, she tells me. My daughters won't be by my side. In the last three days Barahona turned down coveted opportunities to travel to Houston, refusing to go anywhere without all her daughters. We left Honduras together and that's how we must remain until God allows, the single mother says. She forged a friendship with fellow migrant mom, Yesika Gonzalez (PH), who've left South America three months ago with her partner and their son Jason. We found another motherly bond in this corner of the shelter where (INAUDIBLE) Falcon receives help when caring for baby Yeremy just 2 weeks old. His mom tells me she carried him from Venezuela to Texas where she went into labor immediately after stepping on to U.S. soil. All of the migrant mothers we spoke to say maternal instinct to provide for their children is what drove them to make the perilous journey in the first place. A parent will do anything to see their children safe, says Barahona. A hug from Daniella seems to ease any of mom's sorrows. We asked her what she wants to be when she grows up. A seamstress like mom. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

As this is a dynamic system and as it kind of sorts out what is going on and what are the likelihood of remaining in the United States, if encountered, right?So should a migrant seek detection, which is what we've seen over the course of the last several years where migrants aren't trying to sneak into the country? They're trying to be apprehended to start the asylum process. Or is the system telling them that they need to evade detection? That that other option is no longer there?

We have an asylum system that doesn't work and hasn't worked for quite some time. That needs fixing, that needs more resources. These alternative pathways that were mentioned in terms of where the Biden administration has opened ways for people to get into the United States in an orderly fashion, to reunify with family if they need protection much closer to home, that needs to be codified into law. Right now it's being done by executive action. Executive action is constantly being challenged in court. We need more resources for the border itself and we need more resources to support Latin American and Caribbean countries that are actually hosting the vast majority of folks who have been displaced in recent years. There's 20 million displaced individuals in Latin America and the Caribbean today. The vast, vast, vast majority of those folks aren't seeking to come to the United States. Rather they're being absorbed by communities in Latin America and the Caribbean that are struggling with COVID fallout, the Ukraine-Russia economic impacts, interest rate hikes, accelerating climate problems, and then the kind of traditional drivers of migration.

Of course, Ukraine would like to go all the way through Crimea, but Ukrainian officials privately tell European officials they know that this is possibly, you know, unlikely to happen. But, you know, they would have to shoot for the maximum and get what they can get. This is probably going to be the only offensive that Ukraine can do this year that starts in the next month or so because pretty soon you got winter coming and what you have happening is that they want to take advantage of the fact that Russian troops seem to be on their back foot as U.S. intelligence has said. They would need to have another call up of forces back in Russia to make up for the battlefield losses. So, this is a chance to use all the new weapons, all the Ukrainian troops that have been trained overseas and seized as much territory and as much momentum as possible and drive the Russians as far out as they can before winter sets in.
