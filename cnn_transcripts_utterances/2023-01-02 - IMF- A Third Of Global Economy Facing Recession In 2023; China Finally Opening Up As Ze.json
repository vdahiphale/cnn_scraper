How will things go in 2023? Well, we've already got one prediction. The IMF Chief is predicting one-third of the world's economy will be in recession during the year. Will Lula da Silva succeed in reducing poverty in Brazil? Inflation could easily get in the way. And Croatia at the start of a New Year joins the Euro. Predictions and forecasts from the Central Bank Chief of Croatia, in a moment. We are live in New York on Monday, it's January the 2nd. It's a bit murky in this ball. I'll polish it up to see that we get clear predictions. I am Richard Quest, as we start a New Year together, we mean business. Good evening. We begin with a sobering warning from the IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva says 2023 will be even tougher than last year, and she is predicting a third of the global economy will enter a recession during the year. It will be severe, more severe in Europe, the energy crunch is going to plunge half of European economies into recession. And Georgieva says the world's biggest three -- US, EU, China -- are all slowing down simultaneously, and that has consequences as she discussed on CBS \"Face the Nation.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In the United States, what the Fed wants to do is create some slack in labor markets, that is create some unemployment so that wages don't move up as strongly, and that means it will keep, you know, rates high until it sees that happen. And that's probably not going to be till it sees some inkling of at least a significant slowdown if not a mild recession. So that's the US. Europe is high energy prices, eating into consumer budgets, and they don't, you know, increasingly have the money to spend on everything else. And so there it's a supply driven constraint. Of course, the ECB is doing its job. But there, it is not strong demand, it is supply constraints and energy prices, which are causing the slowdown. In China, of course, it's a mix of COVID which is creating a severe problem right now, but also the previous problems they had which is the private sector as well as the property sector.",

Now, on the other side, it is true interest rates are high, which gives you some cushion if the economy slows down considerably. You know, Central Banks can cut rates. That medicine takes time to work also. So ideally, you wouldn't want to slow down the economy so much that you have to now reinvigorate it, but they have the medicine.

But so many EMs are saddled with dollar denominated debt, and we know the World Bank is but -- well, the World Bank is involved, and obviously the IMF as well. How worried do you think we should be of an EM debt crisis? Well, it's always something you have to keep at the back of your mind, after such a long period of easy policy and low interest rates, which have led to a significant debt buildup in many emerging markets and developing countries, I would say more developing countries this time, the poorer countries rather than emerging markets. Many emerging markets have sort of learned the lesson of the past and limited the amount of borrowing, not all. Sri Lanka is an example of a country that has borrowed a lot. Now going forward, I think there are three things they have to worry about. One is, of course, the prices of food and fuel, which are important inputs to their people's well-being. The second of course, is interest rates. And the last element which people are paying less attention to is liquidity. One of the nice things about the last 10 years is the plentiful liquidity. Of course, as Central Banks shrink their balance sheets, liquidity is also going to start drying up, and that will be another factor to keep in mind as we look at the debts of emerging markets and developing countries, harder to rollover, when liquidity is tight.",

But that said, what, as you said, Central Banks want to do is bring it close enough to their target range that they can say, okay, we've done most of the job and now a momentum, we will take the inflation rate within the target range. We can, at this point, certainly not just pause, but maybe even cut rates. When will that come? Probably not for many Central Banks during the course of next year, much of next year is going to be to get it closer to the target range. The Fed is going to probably be able to get it to three, three and a half by the end of the year. But remember, it wants to go down to two and that last mile is often the hardest because that is when, you know, all the easy stuff is done and you have to really get people's expectations down.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  People in China will take any opportunity to celebrate. The country is finally opening up after years of lockdowns, abandoning its Zero-COVID Policy. There is hope that 2023 will look more like that. This year, China even managed to pull off the Beijing Winter Olympics. WANG (on camera):  Here we go. We're taking off. WANG (on camera):  I flew into Beijing for my previous posting in Tokyo to cover the games in January. WANG (voice over):  The first thing I saw walking off the airplane is a sea of hazmat suits. With literal walls separating us from the rest of China. WANG (on camera):  They said the police will take me if I were to walk out of the gate. WANG (voice over):  In 2022, China became a giant sanitized bubble under constant high tech surveillance. The country growing more isolated, as ties fray with the West and grow tighter with Russia, military tensions rise over Taiwan. While the man who is calling the shots, Xi Jinping stepped into an unprecedented third term as China's Supreme Leader this year, his goal is to make China great again and turn it into a technological superpower. And not just on Earth, this year, China's successfully launched crewed missions to its new space station, fueling national pride. 2022 also marked a milestone for China's national animal, 15 panda cubs were born at Chengdu Panda Research Base alone. And next year, China is preparing to host the Asian Games, an event that people hope will boost the COVID-battered economy and morale. There is relief and joy that people have their freedom back. Finally in 2023, there is hope people in China can party and travel without fear, just like they used to. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Basically, the exchange rate was aligned also with the euro as we were pegging to euro, and the interest rates were also on the path of joining the Eurozone, the Maastricht criteria. But the fiscal was basically the one that was needed to be tackled, and the government has then done huge reduction in the public debt in order to get us into the Eurozone. I think this is in addition to the good thing we have --- we came down from 84 percent of our debt to GDP ratio down to 71 before the pandemic broke out, and then in 2022, the public debt went up to 86 percent again, and we expect it at the end of the 2022 to be again below the 70 percent, 69 percent.",

This is by -- almost certainly the deadliest Ukrainian attack on Russian forces since the beginning of this war. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice over): A Russian army barracks reduced to rubble. In the first hours of 2023, Ukraine's army delivered one of the world's deadliest strikes, killing scores of Russian conscripts stationed in the occupied city of Makiivka in Eastern Donetsk. Moscow said 63 died here, but the Ukrainians claimed the death toll is much higher. Some military bloggers in Russia are outraged, asking why troops were allegedly housed next to a stash of ammunition which exploded under fire. A daring the assault came after Russian missiles hit the Ukrainian capital at the start of the New Year holiday. Kyiv's mayor said that two people were killed and many others wounded Saturday when rockets hit a hotel and residential neighborhoods. A new reminder if needed that this war threatens Ukrainian lives far from the front line. Many in Kyiv spent the last day of 2022 sheltering in metro stations and underpasses. Others put on a brave face to venture out. I guess this is how they congratulate us with the New Year, Veronica Kulahina (ph) said. We were very close to where the first explosion happened. It was very frightening. (INAUDIBLE) shelling people on this day is nothing but villainous. They're just animals. Russian shelling continued Sunday hitting a children's hospital in the southern city of Kherson according to local officials. In Monday, Kyiv faced its third straight day of attacks, as more than three dozen drones were launched overnight at the Capitol. The Ukrainian military says they intercepted 39 of them but the falling debris causing damage and injury. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We start the year with the Dow down nine percent. The S&amp;P down 20 percent and the NASDAQ down 34 percent. But there is reason to be optimistic. So, the crystal ball and in 2023 These are some of the reasons. Firstly, the momentum from an historic jobs recovery could help the U.S. skirt a recession. That's why the IMF didn't say the U.S. would be. Inflation may have peaked and seems to be cooling the latest numbers suggesting that. Gas prices considerably lower from last year's highs. But then of course, you've got the problem of Ukraine. Real wages are growing faster than consumer prices. That's good at one level more power. But of course, that boosts inflation as well.
