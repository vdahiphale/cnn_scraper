      "sentences": "Petitioner, however, claims that a former president has permanent criminal immunity for his official acts, unless he was first impeached and convicted.His novel theory would immunize former presidents for criminal liability for bribery, treason, sedition, murder, and, here, conspiring to use fraud to overturn the results of an election and perpetuate himself in power. Such presidential immunity has no foundation in the Constitution. The framers knew too well the dangers of a king who could do no wrong. They, therefore, devised a system to check abuses of power, especially the use of official power for private gain. Here, the executive branch is enforcing congressional statutes and seeking accountability for petitioner's alleged misuse of official power to subvert democracy. That is a compelling public interest. In response, petitioner raises concerns about potential abuses, but established legal safeguards provide layers of protections, with the Article 3 courts providing the ultimate check. The existing system is a carefully balanced framework. It protects the president, but not at the high constitutional cost of blanket criminal immunity. That has been the understanding of every president from the framing through Watergate and up to today. This court should preserve it. I welcome the court's questions. CLARENCE THOMAS, U.S. SUPREME COURT ASSOCIATE JUSTICE:  Mr. Dreeben, does the president have immunity -- are -- are you saying that there's no immunity, presidential immunity, even for official acts?",

That is the constitutional doctrine that currently governs the separation of powers. What petitioner is asking for is a broad, blanket immunity that would protect the president, a former president, from any criminal exposure, absent impeachment and conviction, which has never happened in our history. And we submit that is not necessary in order to assure that the president can perform all of the important tasks that the Constitution reposes in him.",

And reliance on the faith -- good faith of the prosecutor may not be enough in the -- some cases. I'm not suggesting here. So, if it's tautological, and those are the only protections that the Court of Appeals below gave, and that is no longer your position, you're not defending that position, why shouldn't we either send it back to the Court of Appeals or issue an opinion making clear that that's not the law?",

The president -- the former president can make a motion to dismiss and may cite OLC opinions. And the district court may say, well, that's fine. I'm not bound by OLC and I interpret it differently, so let's go to trial. And then there has to be a trial. And that may involve great expense, and it may take up a lot of time. And during the trial, the former president may be unable to engage in other activities that the former president would want to engage in. And then the outcome is dependent on the jury, the instructions to the jury, and how the jury returns a verdict. And then it has to be taken up on appeal. So the protection is greatly diluted if you take the form -- if it takes the form that you have proposed. Now, why is that better?",

Those are political remedies that are extremely difficult to achieve. In a case where the conduct, misconduct occurs close to the end of a president's term, Congress is unlikely to crank up the machinery to do it.
