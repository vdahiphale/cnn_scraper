One of three mass shootings, in the State, since Saturday, leaving 19 dead, and California's Governor tonight, with harsh words, for Washington, and Republican lawmakers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): Federal government needs to do its job. But let's call it out: You have one party that are obstructionists. I am damn sick and tired of this stuff. I'm sick of this. I don't want to ever see this again. I don't want to see you again, in this condition. I'm serious. I'm not making this up, about all these damn notes. How many of these governors have you seen doing the same damn dance we're doing here today? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You hear the anger there, from Governor Newsom, understandably. And, as you know, California has some of the strongest gun laws, in the country. What more, in your opinion, can be, should be, done? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Well, the problem is guns don't pay much attention to state boundaries. California can have strong laws. Connecticut can have strong laws. But weapons cross state lines. And so, these assault-style weapons that are used in these mass shootings, you can't buy them in California and Connecticut. But you can buy them in Texas, and Georgia, and easily transport them into our states. Same things with the crime guns that get used in Hartford and Los Angeles, the illegal gun trade, those, guns move from states, with very loose background checks, where criminals and gun traffickers can easily buy guns, into states with more rigorous background checks. So, until we have a federal law, banning these mass murder assault weapons, and requiring everybody, to go through a background check, before they buy a gun, the State laws are of limited efficacy. And I think that's the frustration, the deserved frustration, you're hearing, from Gavin, tonight.",

But only a month before Uvalde, people would have never guessed that we would have been able to close the boyfriend loophole, fund red flag laws, put more rigorous background checks on younger buyers. All of that was made possible because the people of this country rose up, and told the Republicans that they were going to be voted out of office, if they didn't do something. And so, I still have hope that the voters of this country are going to command Republicans, to step up, and do the right thing. Now, I'd love to ban assault weapons. I know that during the 10 years that we didn't allow them, to be sold, commercially, in this country, we had a dramatic decrease, in the number of mass shootings. As soon as that ban expired, the mass shootings started going upward again. But if we can't ban assault weapons, then let's look at raising the age to 21, before you can buy a weapon. Let's require background checks, at the very least, for these military-style rifles. There are things that we can do short of a ban that I hope Congress will look at, if we can't get the ban done.",

That's not the environment that is conducive to making us healthier individuals. So, to me, yes, we got to invest in some level of new security, in public spaces.

But it looks like Vice President Pence approached this, the same way that President Biden did, which was, once he found out that he had taken these documents, that they were in his house, he immediately alerted the authorities. Very different than President Trump, who essentially was being pulled over for speeding, and led the cops, on a high-speed chase, for a couple weeks.

Mary Ellen, when you heard more, about the details of the shooting, in Half Moon Bay, California, yesterday, did it strike you that there were certain similarities, to the shooting, that had just happened, days earlier, in Monterey Park, certainly the age or the race of the gunman? MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, RETIRED FBI SPECIAL AGENT - PROFILER, DIRECTOR, FORENSIC SCIENCE PROGRAM AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY: I thought it was very striking. And I'll tell you why. Because the age of both gunmen, 67 -- 68 and 72? Those are tremendous outliers, because the average age of the shooters -- of shooters, we see nowadays, is the early 30s. So, you look at it this way. So for 67 years, 68 years, 72 years, in the Monterey Park case, these two men were able to navigate their way, through life, handle stressors, maybe not particularly well, handle being upset, maybe angry at the workplace, but they did have coping behaviors. And then, now, all of a sudden, those coping behaviors are not what they should be, or they're not relying on them. So, I found it really very interesting, when both of these were back- to-back. And it also made me wonder about the copycat, or the contagion effect, in these shootings that we see in younger shooters. COOPER: Andrew, in your experience, from a law enforcement perspective, and looking at the data, do mass shootings often come in sort of waves of tragedy, like that, whether it is the copycat effect or not?",

What was some of the key findings?ELLEN O'TOOLE: Well, one of the key findings was that there was a copycat effect, when these cases occurred, which meant that after once shooting occurred, then the level of violence increased. There were more threats of violence, and then more additional shootings. And then, as the shootings got more sensational, then prior shooters became, like Andy said, they're inspirational. They become folk heroes. And new shooters aspire to be like Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. And so, there is that influence of people that are involved in this kind of behavior. We first saw, we really first studied, copycat effect, following the suicide of Marilyn Monroe. But that wasn't the first time that blocks of human behavior influenced other humans to do the same thing. And so, it's not unusual that this copycat behavior is part of what we see, with these mass shootings. And it still continues. It's just that when you have older men, 67, 68, and 72, peer influence is not nearly as important as if you're 20 or 21, where what other people think of you is really important. So that's, again, another reason why these two shooters were, really, outliers to me.",

SANDY SMITH, STEPHEN SMITH'S MOTHER: I believe he was beaten to death KAYE (voice-over): The Murdaughs haven't said anything publicly, about this case. But it's not just Stephen's family, who has doubts, about what really happened to him. Audio, in the case file, from the lead investigator, at the time, shows he didn't believe this was just a hit-and-run. South Carolina State Trooper, Todd Proctor.",

In September 2021, Murdaugh admitted to authorities, he'd arranged for the man, to shoot him, as part of a fraud scheme, so his only surviving son, Buster, could collect an insurance payout, according to a court affidavit. As a result of that, Murdaugh was charged with insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, and filing a false police report. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Thank you.Want to get perspective, from criminal defense attorney, Mark O'Mara; and criminal trial lawyer, Sara Azari, whose new series \"Death by Fame,\" can be found on Investigation Discovery, which is part of our Warner Brothers/Discovery Company. So Mark, you heard the report, from Randi, laying out the gross tonnage of accusations, against Murdaugh. I mean, it's extraordinary what he's being accused of, over a lengthy period of time. Would that all be relevant, or admissible, in this trial? I mean, obviously, evidence pertaining directly to the murder of his wife and son would be. But a lot of the financial stuff goes way back. And would that be able to get into this trial? MARK O'MARA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, the prosecution may try and get into that, because they're going to suggest as part of his motive, which was he was going through all of this, he's going to try and defer blame, to somebody else, or just some sympathy. I think the State needs to be extraordinarily careful, bringing in what we call that much bad act evidence, and which is going to, I think, sort of overwhelm the jury, if you start talking about all of that. And that's really grounds for appeal. I think the State needs to be much more careful, do a very tight case, get him on circumstantial evidence, they have. Be very careful with any type of junk science evidence, and just get him as cleanly as they can.",

BELL (voice-over): Complete with photographs, as well as work contracts, patient records, and references, to prove her identity, to French authorities. She also brought documents she thought the West might be interested in. DMITRIEVA (through translator): I brought photos, audio and video recordings, which confirms, that the majority of the Russian army, is against some of the policies, of the current leaders. At my own peril and risk, I was able to smuggle my phone, into the FSB building, twice, and was able to make some records. BELL (voice-over): She also brought recordings of conversations, with senior officials, she says, to hand to French Intelligence, currency, as she sought political asylum. Dmitrieva is one of a flood of senior Russians, from soldiers, to Wagner mercenaries, and FSB employees, now arriving in Europe. So many, that Putin promised, in December, to promptly identify traitors, spies and saboteurs, even as Europe has been expelling senior Russians, 600, in 2022, including 400 spies, according to the head of the British intelligence agency, MI5.",

Now, in the FSB, it's every man for himself. Everyone wants to escape from Russia. Every second, FSB officer wants to run away. Now already, they understand that Russia will never win this war. Of course, I am afraid. I know how they work. History says that in any case, I will be killed.

And there have been so many examples, across Europe, but also in other countries, neighboring Russia, of people, who fled, claiming to be seeking genuine asylum, who have turned out to be still working for the FSB.In fact, Vladimir Osechkin that you saw there, in that report, was tricked by one, only a few months ago, a man claiming to need his help, who turned out to have been sent, by Moscow, simply to try and get closer to him. And because of that, what you're seeing is more and more of those neighboring countries, and European countries, simply deciding that they're not going to be giving visas, to those trying to flee. Now, that leaves many Russians, who are trying to get out, in a very difficult position. Now, you might say, why have any sympathy for the people, who've been working inside the regime of Vladimir Putin? But that suspicion also affects so many other Russians, Russians, who come from much lower down the ladder. Journalists, for instance, who tried to get out since the war began, simply because their lives are going to get so much harder, as a result of it. And what they find themselves is in positions where they manage -- if they managed to get to Europe? They have no more access, to their families, who've been left behind, and might well be in danger; no access to their bank accounts; facing that deep-seated suspicion, about who they are, and what they're doing, and why they may be in Europe, with very little prospect of getting asylum, and, of course, the fear that they'll simply be sent back, to a country, where they will not be treated tenderly.",
