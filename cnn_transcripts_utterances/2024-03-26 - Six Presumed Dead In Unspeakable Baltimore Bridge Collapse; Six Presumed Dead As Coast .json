That's tonight on a special two-hour edition of Laura Coates Live.Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Coates. And the words presumed dead are now breaking hearts all across this nation. Tonight, authorities say the six individuals unaccounted for who were on the bridge that collapsed outside of Baltimore are likely no longer alive. This is a tragic development from the already stomach-turning scenes from an American disaster. Now, that's the moment of impact that you're seeing right now, when a powerless ship slammed bow first into the Francis Scott Key Bridge and brought it plummeting down into the Patapsco River. Now, they say that it looks like an accident, according to officials set in motion, a furious, day-long scramble to try to piece together how things went so wrong, and save lives that were caught in a once- in-a-decade calamity.

FREDERICK JOHN NICOLL, FORMER MERCHANT MARINE, NAVAL OFFICER: I'm seeing they lost power and the lights went out when you lose power, and they probably lost propulsion. At that time, they had a couple minutes went by and I see the lights come back on. So, they have emergency generator going on and possibly still had steering with the emergency generator, but they had no power. So, when you lose your propeller that goes to your rudder, you lose your steerage, your rudder is only 10 percent effective compared to when you get a wash coming from the propeller.

And I used to say it was two-tiered, one for rich white people, one for everybody else, but it actually seems to be three tiers, one for everybody else, one for rich white people, like Sam Bankman Fried, and then one whole different level for Donald Trump, where he's never held accountable for his actions.

Now, if you just look for a second, Elie, at how Manhattan voted in the 2020 election, I think it was close to, what, 87 percent for Biden. But in Staten Island, Trump won by 15 points.

If he did, that would be a good reason to move it to Staten Island. But he didn't, his alleged crimes happened in Manhattan. So, he will be tried in Manhattan, just like, again, any other person who was accused of crimes in Manhattan. But the jury summons, he well could get some people from Staten Island on the voir dire.

And I'm wondering, you know, from your perspective, you're an attorney, you've been following this very closely, as well. What was your takeaway from these arguments and the justices' questions? SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D) MINNESOTA: Well, I think your viewers first need to know of the impact of this. This is unbelievable. This is a drug that is safe and effective, approved for 25 years, and yet this case is before the Supreme Court. The majority of women seeking abortions use Mifepristone. They use this drug. Yet this Texas court basically said, hey, no, it's not okay to do it by mail, not okay. And so, that's why this is before the Supreme Court. So, what did I take from the court argument this morning? Well, the first thing was the judges across the board, the justices, seemed deeply skeptical that this case should be brought. Why? Not because of their ideological views. We know it was these very Trump-appointed judges that got us to this point with the Dobbs decision, just simply because they don't think it meets the muster of what we call standing. You know, they shouldn't be -- they're bringing this case when they can't actually show harm the people in this case. Justice Kagan said it best when she said, so who is the person? Who is the person that was harmed? And as Ketanji Brown-Jackson pointed out, you balance that against the great harm to all these women seeking to get this care. So, this is a -- almost a predictable outcome of this disastrous decision that the Trump-appointed judges made in the Dobbs case.

People from the Twin Cities area, like myself, like you, are hearkening back to what happened on that 35W Bridge collapse in Minneapolis, August of 2007.I remember I was living in Minnesota still at the time, I was still practicing law there, and hearing about what had happened, seeing the tragedy that fell upon those who were most impacted.

That bridge, over a dozen people died, their cars submerged in the water. They didn't have that Mayday warning sign that you had in Baltimore. But one thing both collapses had in common was the heroic deeds of the first responders.In this case, the wherewithal to actually stop traffic going on the bridge in Baltimore, diving into dangerous waters, the Coast Guard and the like and firefighters to try to rescue people. And we have the tragic news now that they are not going to be able to -- they've not established that people are alive and they are presumed dead. Very, very sad. And I'll say that, President, coming out front on this, I saw my colleagues Senator Cardin and Van Hollen talk to Cardin today. They are focused on rebuilding. The governor, who was on your network earlier, talking about the fact that this is a major economic artery, today mourning the loss, respecting the rescue efforts, but knowing that right now, in the middle of that river, there is literally a huge shipping barge filled with containers the size of a building with a bridge on top of it. So, that is why it is really important that they figure out immediately, as Secretary Buttigieg has committed to do, to get that bridge out of the way and get the barge into another area so that the ships can start going, because people's livelihood depends on that, as well as rebuilding the bridge, something we did, as you know, in Minnesota with federal funds in 13 months. You know, speaking of the federal funds, I mean, you are right to focus on the human tragedy and the toll that it has taken, and also thinking about the prospective rebuild of this major artery. But I was surprised, I have to tell you, even though I'm certainly not politically naive, I was surprised at the pace in which this became political, that there were members of Congress who were already focusing on this as a failure, somehow, of the Biden administration. I want to get your take, frankly, on an argument that was made by Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace. Listen to what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NANCY MACE (R) SOUTH CAROLINA: Look at the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that was done a couple of years ago that the left hails as this massive success, but it was mostly Green New Deal, actually, in that bill -- $110 billion went to surface transportation, which is roads and bridges, and of that $110 billion, $70 billion went to public transportation, leaving only $40 billion for traditional roads and bridges, what you and I think about. And if you live along the coast or you live near water, you know that our bridges are rusting out. You know that we have many, many bridges that have to be replaced and upgraded. And you know it's probably about a billion dollars a bridge every time. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We know that.There was a Mayday. There was an alert. The ship was not under control.
