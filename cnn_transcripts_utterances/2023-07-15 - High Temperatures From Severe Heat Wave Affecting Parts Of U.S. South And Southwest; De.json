We saw Republicans insist on a defense package that is normally overwhelmingly bipartisan, have a number of extreme amendments that got added, turning this into a culture war partisan exercise. Some of the amendments that Republicans insisted get added to this bill included reversing longstanding abortion access policy, eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in personnel, and restricting health care for transgender individuals in the military.So this put moderates on both the right and the left in a really tough spot. And while conservatives argue that this eliminated what is called wokeism from the military, this just shows again, Rahel and Victor, how members of the right flank of the Republican conference are pulling House Republicans to the right and turning what is normally bipartisan legislation into a partisan exercise. Now, this is going to head to the Senate, where we're told this is basically dead on arrival. I mean, this, remember, the Senate is controlled by Democrats, and they don't want to take up this legislation that includes all of these rightwing amendments in it. So we're going to have to see if the two sides come together, because remember, both sides have to come to an agreement for this important defense package to become law. Right now, though, Rahel and Victor, it's unclear how that is going to happen.",

The first one said that there was limited evidence for the cancer-causing potential of aspartame, while the other one didn't change any of the recommendations for the daily suggested intake of aspartame.So of course, this is a sweetener that's found in thousands of different items, from diet sodas to tabletop sweeteners to even breakfast cereals, chewing gums, even things like cough drops and chewable vitamins. So this is in a lot of different products. The WHO's director of the Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, Dr. Francesco Branca, saying in a statement that, quote, \"While safety is not a major concern at the doses which are commonly used, potential effects have been described that need to be investigated by more and better studies.\" And the issue really here is that all of the studies that suggest any potential link really are not strong enough to say that there is an actual causative effect of aspartame in terms of cancer risk. And so what they're trying to do here is to spur better research. But just to put this into some context, they are putting this into a group which is really the third lowest of four in terms of potential cancer risk to humans. That group includes other things like aloe vera, occupational exposure to dry cleaning, gasoline engine exhaust, and traditional Asian pickled vegetables. And to compare that with the list of the highest risk of cancer to humans, that highest group one includes cigarettes and asbestos. And so this is really not in that category. In terms of how much diet soda is in the limits recommended by the World Health Organization, it you think about the amount of aspartame in a can of soda, the industry has given us a suggested limit here of about 100 milligrams. For a person who is 180 pounds, they have to drink 33 cans of diet soda a day to hit that limit of suggested aspartame intake per day by the WHO's guidelines which are not changing as a result of this. And that's obviously, probably a lot more than most people are consuming. However, of course, that is a weight-based recommendation, so it is lower for children who are smaller. Now, of course, the World Health Organization is not recommending, a, that people drink that much diet soda or that they switch to regular soda. They said there is a third option, and they would suggest water. Of course, there has been a strong reaction to this from the beverage industry, as well. American Beverage, the industry group, telling us, quote, \"there is a broad consensus in the scientific and regulatory community that aspartame is safe. It's a conclusion reached time and time again by the food safety agencies around the world.\" So of course, there is a lot of consternation coming out of this, but no actual recommendations to change behavior on a large basis.
