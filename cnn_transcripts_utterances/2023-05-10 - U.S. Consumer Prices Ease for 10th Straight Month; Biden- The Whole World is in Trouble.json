The NASDAQ is up around one percent. Dow is down 0.4 percent. Well, those are the markets and these are the main events US inflation continues its gradual slowdown in new April data. Former Fox host, Tucker Carlson says he will relaunch his show on Twitter. And Airbnb shares tumble on concerns customers are tightening their belts. Live from Dubai, it is Wednesday, May 10th. I am Eleni Giokos, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Well, a very good evening. Great to have you join us. And tonight, the medicine is working just not fast enough for some investors. The Dow has been lower most of the day despite the latest sign the Feds' rate rises are cooling off inflation. Now, consumer prices rose just 4.9 percent over the 12 months ending in April. That is the lowest headline rates since April 2021. Now it is a bit less than economists had expected, but there are concerns that the hardest part of the inflation fight lies ahead as price of things like shelter, food, and new cars rise sharply. That is in the report. We've got Matt Egan to break down all the numbers. I mean, there are a few bright spots where you're seeing, you know inflation taming. But you've also got significant rises on important elements like we've said shelter that was up just over eight percent. Major concern not so much on gas, and fuel but more so on energy supply. It is really interesting to see sort of the juxtaposition of what is coming up and what is actually able to take off the heat on the inflation front.",

This is miles away from the peak last summer over nine percent, but some of this improvement has really started to slow down. It has kind of leveled out on an annual basis and it has leveled out, as you can see on the chart well above the two percent level that the Fed is targeting. On a month-over-month basis, it has been pretty choppy. We actually saw inflation heat up between March and April, although a lot of that was driven by a spike in used car prices and that spike is not expected to continue. Investors and economist, they're focused on the fact that shelter while shelter costs are still going up on a monthly basis, we have actually seen the smallest increase for shelter in a year. That's very important because shelter is a huge part of people's budgets. You know, digging further into the report. There were some other positives, we saw record annual drop for major appliances, for health insurance. The other hand, car insurance is going up very dramatically and this one is painful to me as a parent, the price of day care and preschool that is increasing at the fastest rate since the government's been tracking.",

Another question, though is, could the Fed actually cut interest rates, and at last check,the market is pricing in now a 44 percent chance of a rate cut in July. But, you know, we're still not anywhere near the two percent target for inflation, and I talked to billionaire investor David Rubenstein, and he said he thinks it would be very premature for the Fed to start cutting the interest rates. He said that the Fed would actually look \"silly\" if they started cutting interest rates at inflation at these levels, because it could actually end up fanning the flames of inflation by making investors think that it's going to come back. So yes, a pause could still happen. One other point, though, here, Eleni. We still have another inflation report and one more jobs report coming out before the Fed meets on June 14th, and so a lot can change before that.",

Now, for the first time since the Fed began its crusade against inflation, the pace of price rises has dipped below the central bank's target interest rates after 10 consecutive rate hikes in just over a year. Take a look at this graph. As much as mentioned, the Fed is widely expected to take a breather, but speaking on Tuesday, the chairman of the New York Fed said it could take time for high interest rates to take effect, and more rate rises might be necessary to get inflation back down to that two percent targets. Tiffany Wilding is a North America economist at PIMCO, she joins me from Newport Beach, California. Great to have you on. That was a really interesting graph. I mean, finally, seeing that inflation and what we're seeing on the interest rate front converging, you're not sitting in negative real interest rates anymore.

So from nine percent, to I think five-and-a-half percent on a year over year basis. Today, you know, what I would actually argue that that had very little to do with the five percent increase in the Fed funds rate over the last, you know, call it a year-and-a-half and that is because monetary policy works through long and variable lags, and you know, and we did have, you know, pandemic-related supply constraints, as well as just, you know, the pandemic-related response, the fiscal policy response, which was a one-off event. You know, those were kind of one off factors that were reducing inflation. Those have more recently gone away, and I would argue, that's the reason why inflation has come down. More recently, and we haven't seen the full effects yet of monetary policy because of those long lags. You know, so as we continue to see inflation, or we expect to continue to see inflation coming down, that is really going to be more about monetary policy. And so I think that's why you hear Jay Powell talk about the uncertainty, you know, we could need to do more if inflation doesn't come down as much, or we could we made -- you know, we may need to be cutting as the market suggests, because we did too much already. And that's something that's going to -- that's a debate that's going to play out.",

You know, and again, that's just because of the amount of monetary policy tightening that we've seen to date. And, of course, that has had, you know, an impact on the banking sector. You know, we've seen a rising cost of capital for banks, stock price declined, I think, 30 percent on average across the banking sector. That's going to make it more difficult for them to make loans. And that's going to -- that's going to ultimately cool off the economy and bring down inflation in our view. But nevertheless, inflation is still elevated today, it's probably going to still be elevated in July.

They have suggested that some of the rockets, 65 or so rockets that have fallen short of Gaza Strip, could be a contributing factor. They do acknowledge, at least, in that initial strike that killed those three Islamic Jihad commanders, that there were civilians, including family members of those commanders killed as a result.
