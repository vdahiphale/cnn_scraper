      "sentences": "Hello everyone, I'm Zain Asher and this is ONE WORLD. There's cautious hope today after sonar equipment pickedup banging sounds from the remote waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. International crews are scouring the area for missing tourist submersible with five people on board. Stockton Rush, the CEO of the expedition company OceanGate is among the missing. French diver Paul-Henry Nargeolet, British businessman Hamish Harding and Pakistani billionaire Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood are also on the vessel, as well. Time is running out to find them. Experts say the sub may have less than a day's worth of breathable air left. It's not entirely clear if the sounds picked up on Tuesday are coming from the submersible and obviously that is the hope. But the U.S., Canada and France have relocated resources to determine the source of the noise. Let's get the very latest for our Miguel Marquez in St. John's in Newfoundland, Canada. Miguel, thank you so much for being with us. So, just in terms of the sounds that were heard here, just explain to us how that is allowing rescue crews to really try to narrow the search area? MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so Poseidon plane is the sub-hunting plane, dropped buoys into the water yesterday. They picked up for it for about a period of four hours or so. They picked up every half hour, that banging sound. So, it's a regular sound, it caught their attention. They hoped that they were on to something. Another plane dropped buoys in a different location, also picked up sounds. Eventually the banging stopped, they heard other sounds, they couldn't tell quite what they were. But, that gave them enough information to move surface ships over to the area where they were hearing those sounds. They put a remote operated vehicle down to where they thought the sounds were coming from and they came up with nothing, sadly. But they are, they have done a couple of things. They have given the U.S. Navy that data, the sonar data, so that they can study it and try to figure out perhaps what exactly it was. There are -- there is a lot of shipping and other things happening in that area. And then they have moved even more ships into the area. There are three ships now doing side sonar. So, sending sonar signals down to the bottom of the ocean, and trying to get a visual sense of what is down there, so they can see whether or not that capsule, the sub, the Titan, is on the bottom there and they can get a better fix on its location. Meanwhile there is just a ton of gear, both in the air, and by the sea. There's eight ships either on the way or already in the area. So, if they can find that capsule, they can get, hopefully, rescue gear down to it and pull it up. Hopefully, hopefully, save the people who are on it. Zain.",

I don't have an exact count on it, but numerous people, and particular people who know about this business have raised concerns. The fundamental question being raised by these industry groups out there, and from some people who work for this company, was that they felt the company might be bypassing a lot of the basic standards and testing for safety. Here's an example of what we're talking about. For engineering, there are standards for the qualification of a vessel that would go this low in the water. And those standards are going to not say, you need to test it to withstand that pressure. You would most likely have to test it, I don't know the exact specs for this, but probably three to four, to five, to six times as much pressure as it's going to encounter. You don't just test it for where it's going, you test it for much, much more. And after you have done that, you then have to really, strongly refurbish the tested vessel to make sure there was not damage from all of that. Or, you have to entirely rebuild it, following the same specs, and then test it to your regular pressure, to make sure everything is working. These concerns, raised by the industry suggest that some version of that was not happening or may not have been happening, or was not being publicized to people outside. The result is, I think, these are gonna be some of the really key questions that are asked, whether this is found or not. How did this go wrong? Was there something fundamentally wrong with the operation or the construction of this submersible? And did that lead us to where we are right now? Zain.",

A new cycle ofdeadly violence is erupting in the occupied West Bank as tensions soar between Israelis and the Palestinians. The Palestinian Health Ministry says one man was killed today, and hundreds of Israeli settlers set fire to cars and homes. The village mayor says that many were masked, and carried guns. Overnight, Israeli settlers attacked several Palestinian towns, burning farm fields and vehicles, injuring dozens of villages. The violence was sparked by West Bank attack that left four Israeli settlers dead on Tuesday. Two gunman later claimed by the militant group Hamas carried out the attack. It came one day after Israeli forces raided Jenin in search of two wanted suspects. Several Palestinians were killed. Hadas Gold joins us live now from Jerusalem. So, Hadas, of course, we had the Jenin raid earlier this week. We then had the four Israelis that were killed, and now settlers who are setting fire to cars, and homes. It's been quite a week.

And then the Israeli military using an Apache helicopter for the first time in decades to provide gun cover for their soldiers while they're being extracted from disabled army vehicles. And the attack that left those four Israelis dead, and four others injured outside of an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank, at a gas station sort of restaurant, that was claimed by Hamas militants, who said that was in direct response to what happened in Jenin. And then we had hundreds of settlers going through Palestinian villages, which is again being seen as sort of revenge attacks to what happened at the restaurant, and at the gas station. We are hearing from police, just in the last few minutes, that actually that man that was killed today, the Israeli Police say that it was one of their officers who shot and killed that man. They claim that the man was with a group who were shooting things like fireworks towards police, and firefighters who were working in the area as the settlers were rampaging through these villages. We actually visited the site today of the attack where those four Israelis were killed. And just up the road, from just a minute or two up the road, we went and saw just dozens of vehicles that had been completely burned to a crisp, as well as Palestinian villagers' homes that had been attacked by settlers.

Villagers were talking to here saying they haven't seen violence like this against their property, against their homes since the days of the Second Intifada and that they now live in fear of what can come. There's now a big push, especially on the right wing of the Israeli political spectrum and the right wing of this current government for a much bigger and broader military operation in the occupied West Bank than what we've seen in the past. That could lead people here fear to even more violence. (END VIDEOTAPE) GOLD (on-camera): Now, excuse me, in a statement, the IDF said that they condemn the serious incidents of violence and destruction of property. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, also saying that all citizens of Israel are obligated to obey the law and that they will not allow disturbances. But the big question now is whether the pressure from the right flank of this government and whether the pressure from some in this security establishment for a much broader and bigger Israeli military operation, whether that will be carried out. Because right now, although we are seeing pretty daily Israeli military raid, they are pretty confined usually to one sort of area. But now, there are calls from people like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Ghivir for something much bigger and much broader. Zain.",

CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins us live now from Kyiv. So, Fred, we always knew that that this counteroffensive was going to be slow, it was going to be incremental. But were the Ukrainians prepared for the level of fierce resistance that we are seeing from the Russians right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think that the Ukrainians were prepared to face some pretty stiff resistance fromthe Russians, but they do acknowledge that the resistance that they are facing is one that's making it very tough for them to move forward. And I think that there are certain elements about it that really make it hard for the Ukrainians to make good on some of that ground. One of the things they've been trying to do, Zain, over the past couple of weeks really, but especially over the past couple of days, is punch holes into those rich, big Russian defense lines, especially in the south of the country. And that's something that's proven to be very difficult. So, one of the things that you're seeing there right now is the Ukrainians making less progress at the moment than they had for instance, it's been a couple of days ago. Nevertheless, the Ukrainians are saying that they are having partial success. They say that they are entrenching the positions that they have won back because, of course, some of the places that the Ukrainians took from the Russians, the Russians would then blanket with artillery and try to move back in there. So, the Ukrainians are trained saying that they're trying to solidify some of those gains as they're also trying to move forward and trying to move forward towards the South, towards the Sea of Azov which is their ultimate goal to be able to cut the Russians off from their land corridor to Crimea. One of the things that we've learned, Zain, that is extremely difficult for the Ukrainians and which we hear on the battlefield, but we hear also when we're here in Kyiv, as well, is Russian air power. They say that Russian air power around the frontlines is very strong. It's often keeping the jets of the Ukrainians, which are much older than the ones from the Russians, from actually operating in those areas because the Russians have interceptor planes that can shoot very far. They have very powerful missiles, very powerful radars, as well, but also on the front lines. The Russians are using attack helicopters right now fairly efficiently and then also using drones to spot Ukrainian formations and then trying to take those out with artillery. So, all of that is making it extremely difficult for the Ukrainians. But what we've seen on the front lines is the Ukrainians still in very good spirits. The Ukrainians still saying they believe that this counter- offensive is something that can be a success and that they are going to continue to take ground. And so, one of the things that we also looked at, which you just mentioned, I think is very important is Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of this country, coming out today in that same interview with the BBC and saying, look, these are people at work here. This is not some sort of Hollywood movie and therefore, the Ukrainians are saying they are not going to be pressured into moving any faster. And certainly by the looks of it, if you look at some of the comments that have been coming in from the U.S. but of other countries, as well, it certainly doesn't look like the international partners are trying to pressure the Ukrainians. The Russians, for their part, however, are saying that they've been successfully repelling the counteroffensive by the Ukrainians. In fact, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, he came out earlier today, and he said that he sees a sort of lull, if you will, in the offensive operations from the Ukrainians because they've been taking such high losses. So, certainly different perspectives, depending on where people stand in this war. But right now, the Ukrainians, while they're going, is pretty tough. They still seem to be in pretty good spirits.

And it turned out to be not true, but so then I thought I would poke into this and find out how credible this report was and it's very credible. So, I'm hoping that they've already located the rough area where the sounds are coming from. And then they probably can't analyze what they are, but where they are to begin with, and then start moving equipment in that direction, assuming that is, in fact, the sub because there's no time right now to sit back and think about is it or isn't it.

That's roughly where it is. Right now, it's all we need at the moment is, roughly, what are we talking about. And then the second part is to get instruments over there that can get into the water and get down there and start looking for the origin of the -- of the sounds.
