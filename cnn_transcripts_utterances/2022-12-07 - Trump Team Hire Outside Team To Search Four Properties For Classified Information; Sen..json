There always seems to be another shoe to drop. In this case, additional documents with classified markings on top of the ones recovered from the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago in August, which in turn were on top of other documents handed over before that. Now remember, prior to the FBI's search in August, the former President's legal team had told the government there was nothing more to find, which was not true. And this time, investigators suspected as much. That said, this time around, neither the FBI nor any official body had a role in finding these documents. CNN's Sara Murray joins us now with the latest. So, what do we know about these property searches and what was found?",

They searched Bedminster, they searched Trump Tower, they searched the Florida office, and a Florida storage unit. And through this, they were looking for government documents with classified markings. You know, still getting back to this subpoena that they originally got from the Feds. The Feds have been concerned that Trump had not provided everything.And what they found in looking through these four properties were two documents with classified markings that were in the storage unit. And sources are telling me, as well as Kaitlan Collins that that was all. That was all they found with classification markings.

So even though you know Trump may have handled these things haphazardly when he left the White House, it does sound like now that they are trying to do these subsequent searches, they are trying to handle these documents with care, even though you know, there are certainly plenty on the Trump team who will try to make the argument to at least reporters that they still believe Trump declassified everything.",

Here is what a campaign adviser of one of Walker's Republican primary opponents told \"The Atlanta Journal- Constitution\" today, quoting now: \"Herschel was like a plane crash into a train wreck that rolled into a dumpster fire and an orphanage then an animal shelter. You kind of had to watch it squinting through one eye between your fingers.\" Candidate quality, in a nutshell. Some Republicans would say and have said before and after his defeat, and it certainly will be part of the case that next time should be different. This time might have ended differently, have the GOP fielded a better slate. The argument that a so-called generic Republican might have defeated Raphael Warnock, then again, it is also worth remembering that in 2020 in the runoff, admittedly under far different circumstances, Warnock defeated not just a generic Republican, but a specific one without Herschel Walker's baggage, Kelly Loeffler, a sitting US senator, which raises a whole other set of questions for Republicans and their prospects in Georgia in the next election. Let's get perspective now from two CNN political commentators Alyssa Farah Griffin, who served as White House Director of Communications in the prior administration; also, former South Carolina Democratic State lawmaker, Bakari Sellers.

That goes without saying, it has become a cliche at this point, but the kind of circular finger pointing within the Republican Party is going to continue.Hands down, Donald Trump was the biggest drag on Republicans this cycle like you ran through it, but that's only a fraction of the races. There's House races, there are Secretary of State races, that he also dragged down Republicans in. But the party is not ready to say that yet. Some people are going to say it, but you know, people are calling for Ronna McDaniel's head, which fine, a fair discussion to have, they're blaming Rick Scott or they're blaming Mitch McConnell. But there is hands down one person most responsible for Republicans not winning more Senate seats and not performing better in the House and it's Donald Trump.

This has been the most unsuccessful duo of individuals who led a major party in American history. I don't think you've seen anyone since 2017 not win a singular cycle and that's failure. That's not Donald Trump's brand of winning. That's absolute abject failure, and that's what we see. But this isn't the first time -- candidate quality is not anything new, Anderson. You remember back to 2010 and 2012, where you had Murdock, you had Engel, you had Christine O'Donnell, you had Todd Aiken. You had individuals who just did not meet the character test or the quality of candidate necessary to win these seats, and you see that replicated again 10 years later.

What's going to make him strong is because he's had the worst six months in American political history, but what's going to make him stronger as soon as he has an opponent, or if he has four or five, six, dare I say, 10 opponents. I call them the cluster of one percent. When you have Mike Rogers, Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, these individuals who will not necessarily be formidable contenders against him, he is going to be able to then rise again from the ashes because he only needs 25 to 30 percent of the Republican primary vote, and that is what the Republican Party has a problem with.

His actions that day have so far avoided the same level of scrutiny of other top officers, one of whom was fired and another who retired before he could be fired.

He said that really some of the family members had asked for the return of some of these items, items that hold fond memories, items that perhaps these parents had given to their children. So the items were boxed up in this house where these kids lived, where they died, where they were murdered, and they will be given back to their families.But as I say, the chief adamant that this is still an active crime scene and also adamant, you know, in the face of quite a lot of criticism that at least the public progress of this investigation seems to have been very slow. He is adamant we are making progress in this case. This is still a very active case. And listen, we don't know what they are doing behind closed doors because as I say, they are playing this very close to the vest. And that is why this appeal today for the occupants of that car or anybody who knows them to come forward, that could potentially, Anderson, be a significant move.",

She lived with him for a while. He gave her a home because she had obviously moved out of her parent's home and didn't have anywhere to go after leaving jail. So she did work with him for a little bit, and then she went out on her own.In terms of why she's speaking out now, though, Anderson, she said it's because she's had some time to cope with the law. She's been through some therapy. She also said that she's speaking out now to honor her daughter and to make her proud. That's what she said in the docu-series. But, Anderson, the takeaway here is really that we still don't know what happened to Caylee Anthony. There was no DNA found on her skeletal remains, so it's very hard to connect her physically to her killer. And then we also know from investigators that there were some items at the crime scene that they believe have some connection back to the Anthony home. There was duct tape found on her, as I said, and it was a very unique brand and that same brand was found at the Anthony home. And also that laundry bag that Caylee Anthony was found, it was part of a pair investigator set and the other one was actually found at the Anthony home. But, Anderson, all these years later given all that evidence we still don't know what happened to that little girl or why.",
