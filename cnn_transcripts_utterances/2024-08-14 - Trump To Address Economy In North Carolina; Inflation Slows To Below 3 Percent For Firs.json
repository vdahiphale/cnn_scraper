Vice President Harris is also expected to roll out her economic plan in North Carolina, but on Friday. Let's take you now live to Asheville, North Carolina with CNN's Kristen Holmes.

One of the things that the campaign believes is that fundamentally, at the end of the day, they can use the same talking points they used against President Joe Biden when they're running against Vice President Kamala Harris. The main talking points being immigration, inflation, the economy and crime.He is expected today to talk about the economy. He's expected today to talk about crime. Now, of course, the problem is that Donald Trump often doesn't stay on message. So what they have done is they've created a series of events, starting here in Asheville, North Carolina, that's going to be smaller. It is not a rally. There's no standing room. Everyone is seated in an auditorium, and it is being billed completely as a speech that focuses around the economy. When they look at the polling against President Joe Biden, they see that Donald Trump pulled ahead of Biden on the economy. They believe he could pull ahead of Kamala Harris, but he just has to actually talk about the economy. Instead, he has spent the last several weeks maybe mentioning the economy here and there, but instead dabbling in fringe theories, attacking members of his own party and we'll see what he does today, because I can tell you this from speaking to a number of his allies, advisors, people who talk to him on a regular basis, they have stressed to him over and over again for the last several weeks, particularly the last two weeks, he has to stay on message. That is the only way that he could potentially win this race in November. Of course, Boris, it's Donald Trump. He's going to say what he wants to do when he gets into this room. You see the crowd cheering for him. It is likely he's going to say what he wants to say. We'll see if he can take their warnings and take their messaging seriously.",

But I'm curious what your thought is, because Trump and Harris can propose all of these policies they want, but unless they have congressional control in their party as well, and, you know, there's also the Fed, there's a lot of levers they can't pull by themselves, right?DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM: Yes. There's no question about that. So campaigns are full of promises, some of which aren't particularly realistic and voters have to sift through that. I think the place where they differ, and the hard thing for Vice President Harris will be that, you know, she inherits the 43-month record of the Biden administration, where inflation over those 43 months has averaged 5.4 percent, and wages haven't grown that fast. And so people have been at work, and they've been falling further behind while they worked, and they're mad about it. And voters typically make up their mind about six months out from an election, we're in that window. And so she has a very difficult job. I mean, she has to somehow pivot away from that record. It's not popular. It's been polling underwater for a long time. She can't go back to 2019 and the progressive agenda of that primary. So what does she do between now and Friday, and will voters be - will they be convinced? You know, that's the counter to the Trump proposals, which are not uniformly popular. I mean, people are skeptical of a 10-percent tariff. And so it's a really interesting moment in the campaign, but it's really biased against the Harris campaign because she owns the record, and the record's not a good one.",

I mean, it's true and we should all be quite pleased. The inflation's taking a terrible toll on the U.S. economy. This gives the Fed some freedom to move, and I think all of that's good news. But the reality is still that when you go to the grocery store and the groceries are $30 more than they were at the beginning of 2021, you don't have the 30 bucks to pay for it.

      "sentences": "Look, I think the broader context to remember is this time in 2016 when Trump was running for election, look, I think the broader context to remember is this time in 2016 when Trump was running for election, he said he was going to implement a fiscal agenda that would eliminate the government's debt within four years. That was his promise to us, that it would eliminate government debt.He then proceeded to have massive tax cuts, which went almost exclusively to the rich. And I know this won't surprise anyone, but when you cut taxes, it turns out you cause the government debt to rise. And what we're seeing right now is exactly the same sort of nonsense. And I think part of the problem is that people are never quite sure how seriously to take the president or his running mate. But if you look at some of the things he said recently, it's really very, very worrying. So yes, he likes to talk about tax cuts, but he forgets to mention that what he has at 10 percent across the board tariff. Another word for tariff is tax hike. It'll be every imported good you buy will be 10 percent more expensive. And if it comes from China, it'll be up to 60 percent more expensive. That's a massive tax hike and the sort of thing that's really going to cause inflation to skyrocket. But beyond that, the other day, he was just in a funny mood and he said, well, why don't we get rid of tax on Social Security? It turns out if you're a retired person on Social Security, your tax bill's already zero. But if you're a retired person on Social Security, who's also earning extra income, that is to say you're relatively wealthy and old, then you're paying tax. So really what he's just said is, I want to cut the taxes of the wealthiest seniors, but not most seniors. And the thing is, when you do that, the wealthy is where the money is. And so it really starts to add up and that government debt's just going to go up and up and up and up.",

I just want to go back to that for a second because it is - it was always a Democratic priority. They couldn't - it was in during COVID and then it got reduced. They couldn't get it put back in. Were you surprised to hear the Republican - one of the Republicans in this race being a proponent of that, supporting that?HOLTZ-EAKIN: Not entirely. As you well know, Republicans aren't what they used to be and there's no longer the unanimity on where you want to land, especially on pro-family tax policies and the child credit's in there. Republicans did expand it in the 2017 act and this would be an even bigger expansion. But I just want to echo what Justin has said, which is, you can talk about not taxing Social Security, you can talk about not taxing tips. These are silly, quite frankly, campaign proposals. The real issue is what do you do next year when if there is no action, we get a $4.2 trillion tax increase, including those making less than 400,000. Everyone's campaign pledges get violated and this child tax credit gets smaller, not larger. As you just said, Jessica, you have to control the Congress somehow. I've heard neither side come up with any kind of a realistic plan for how they're going to deal with next year's challenge and that is the issue.",

The Harris campaign saying just the federal income tax for tip workers would be eliminated. Is that realistic at all? Do you think all these sort of promises of tax cuts are only - the expiration date for them, let's say, is January 20th, whenever the next president is inaugurated? HOLTZ-EAKIN: I honestly do not think of these as real tax proposals. There's no merit to not taxing tips. You know, labor income, you shouldn't choose how it comes. You provide distortions, you provide more tips. There's no particular targeting to low-income people. There's nothing especially meritorious on wage-twisting, waiting - versus janitorial services. I don't know what the rationale would be for this. It would cost some revenue. How much, we don't know. Many people aren't paying taxes on their tips. This is a sideshow. Campaigns often have them. I was on a campaign that featured a gas tax holiday. I don't think that's going to go down in history as a great idea. So, yes, they've made these proposals, but it's time to put that aside. They need to put that on the board and get serious about the real issues that face the broader economy and especially the federal budget going forward.",

In the Middle East, Israel bracing for a possible Iranian attack just a day ahead of high-level negotiations with Hamas on a potential ceasefire deal in Gaza. But a diplomatic source telling CNN Hamas will not be a part of the talks tomorrow in Qatar. Instead, the group is willing to meet with mediators afterward.And new developments now on Russia's war on Ukraine. Russia's military struggling to hold down its front line more than a week after Ukraine's cross-border assault. A Ukrainian military commander saying Moscow has pulled its troops out of key battleground regions in an effort to block Ukraine's advances. Meantime, Ukraine launched a new round of attacks against Russia using drones to conduct what a security source calls the biggest attack on Russian airfields since the war began. For more perspective on all of this, we are joined now by CNN Global Affairs Analyst Kim Dozier and retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Steve Anderson. Great to have both of you here with just so many things unfolding in both of these regions. General Anderson, I want to talk first with you. According to Ukraine, Russia is moving some of its troops from the front line up to this incursion site that's hundreds of miles away. What do you make of that initial impact on the battlefield? How might that impact things? BRIG. GEN. STEVE ANDERSON, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, thank you, Jessica. I mean, that's exactly what they intended to do when they conducted this offensive. They want to distract the Russians from what they're doing elsewhere and make them move forces to that position. But, you know, kudos to the Ukrainians for pulling this off. I mean, this is incredible. Nobody saw this coming eight days ago. Now, U.S. doctrine would be to exploit success. So hopefully they'll continue to do that and they'll continue to reinforce the success they have achieved. But they got to be careful. They don't want to go too far in and outrun their supply lines and get cut off - be in danger and cut off. But they've been able to distract the Russians. They've been able to give a tremendous morale boost to the Ukrainians who have been now fighting for two and a half years and they caused a major embarrassment to Vladimir Putin back at home. And now the Russian people are saying, hey, Vladimir, look what you've gotten us into now. I mean, now they're attacking us on our home field. This is a tremendous development. And so I applaud the Ukrainians for being able to pull this off.",

You see the triangles that have been painted on the Ukrainian tanks, et cetera.And originally, that blue piece looked like a triangle. But now, like an inkblot, it's spreading. They seem to be taking advantage of the success in that. According to reporters on the ground, they've been watching all sorts of supplies go over the border into Kursk, like a field hospital, and all the types of things that you'd need to dig in and defend your positions, like barbed wire, concrete barriers, things to build the same kind of fortifications that they have in the east trying to hold the Russians off. So it looks like they've stolen a march on the Russians. Instead of attacking them in the static places in Ukraine or in the east where nothing was moving, they've gone to an unguarded area, and they're seizing territory.

I think what they wanted to do was exploit the success, show, you know, give Vladimir Putin a black eye and essentially create a buffer zone. Because that area had been responsible for about 2,000 attacks on Ukraine over the last couple of months, now they've eliminated that threat, gotten rid of all the artillery launching facilities and missiles and whatnot. And by the way, they've made 120,000 Russians displaced. So they've really delivered a hurt to the Russian people. And hopefully that will apply a lot of pressure to Vladimir Putin. Because when you get right down to it, he's really the center of gravity. This war is going to last as long as Vladimir Putin is either in power or he wants to continue this war and they need to attack that center of gravity, Vladimir Putin, and somehow create the political pressure internally within Russia to remove him.",
