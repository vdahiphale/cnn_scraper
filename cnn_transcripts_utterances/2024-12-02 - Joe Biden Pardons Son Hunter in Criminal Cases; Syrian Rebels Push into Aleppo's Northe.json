He will not pardon Hunter Biden. But there was a feeling among not only close White House advisers, but among the family in a wider way that, when it really came down to it -- and, of course, we're in this countdown period of Biden's presidency until -- from now until January 20th, that he would eventually pardon Hunter Biden. In making this pardon, Biden said that, once he made the decision to pardon Hunter Biden, he figured why not just do it right away? There's no need to drag it out and get to it. But it is this reversal, and it puts him now in a position where it is obvious that Donald Trump will point to this for any decisions that he makes. (END VIDEOTAPE) KINKADE: Donald Trump's team has issued a statement on Hunter Biden's pardon, saying in part, \"The failed witch hunts against President Trump have proven that the Democrat-controlled DOJ and other radical prosecutors are guilty of weaponizing the justice system. That system of justice must be fixed, and due process must be restored for all Americans, which is exactly what President Trump will do.\" Republican lawmakers are also seizing the moment to rail against President Biden and his decision. House Republican James Comer posted on social media, saying in part, quote, \"Joe Biden has lied from the start to finish about his family's corrupt influence peddling activities. It's unfortunate that, rather than come clean about their decades of wrongdoing, President Biden and his family continue to do everything they can to avoid accountability.\" Senate Republican Ron Johnson also weighed in, posting, quote, \"Just confirming that under Democratic governance there truly is a dual system of justice. One that protects Democrats and another weaponized against their political opponents.\" I want to discuss this now with Ron Brownstein, a CNN senior political analyst and senior editor at \"The Atlantic.\" He joins us from Los Angeles.

BROWNSTEINBut, I mean, this is a -- this is a substantial period of time. And as I said, look, I mean, you know, Trump could not have been more explicit on either side of the line. First, you know, you have the precedents from his first term: pardoning Roger Stone, pardoning Paul Manafort, pardoning Jared Kushner's father. Now kind of really turning the screw by saying he's going to name him to one of the most prominent ambassadorships that are out there. And at the same time, saying that he wants to use the machinery of the federal government to prosecute those he views as his opponents. And, as you say, putting in place people who are going to go along with that. You know, remember the story that Bill Barr, who was his attorney general in the first term, you know, basically said, over my dead body, about the idea of putting Kash Patel at the FBI. That's not what you're going to hear from Pam Bondi. That's not what you're going to hear from anybody in the cabinet room in this second term. And so, you know, the risks for anyone that Trump views as -- as a critic or an opponent are obviously, I think, much greater than they were in the first term. And as I say, the idea that Democrats could kind of shame Republicans into upholding these norms by, you know, exercising self -- the kind of self-restraint we saw from Merrick Garland, whatever else you think about Garland's decision, the idea that it would influence Republican behavior has clearly been shown to be nonsensical.",

So, this group has morphed in several different ways. But the current HTS is an outgrowth of Jabhat al-Nusra that basically was created in 2017. And it has tried to localize its efforts. Instead of concentrating on doing things outside of Syria or Iraq or the Middle East, it is concentrating on doing things in Syria.

There's a highway called the M-5 that connects Aleppo, through Homs and Hama, all the way down to Damascus.
