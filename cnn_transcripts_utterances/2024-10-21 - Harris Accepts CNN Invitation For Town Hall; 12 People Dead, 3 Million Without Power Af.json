We've told you all about him, Robert Robertson, the man at the center of a shaken baby syndrome case. He was supposed to testify today before a bipartisan group of lawmakers, but his chair was empty. So what happens next in this case?Plus, voters consistently rank the cost of living as one of their biggest concerns headed into the election, so we're digging into both the Harris and Trump plans for making life for you more affordable, to see if they would, in fact, save you any money. We're going to start this hour, however, in two key battleground states where Vice President Harris and former President Trump are making closing arguments of sorts to voters today. For Trump, it's three stops in North Carolina. For Harris, it's a series of town halls with former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney in three swing counties and three battleground states. Let's go straight to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, who's following the Harris campaign. She's in Brookfield, Wisconsin. And Kristen Holmes is following the Trump campaign in Concord, North Carolina. Priscilla, let me start with you. How exactly would you describe Harris in terms of how she is utilizing Liz Cheney as they try to appeal to independents and Republicans in these three must-win battleground states?",

Those Republicans you talked about those moderate Republicans, Republicans who are turned off by former President Donald Trump.And what they are doing over the course of these conversations is trying to appeal to those voters in these key suburban areas. The vice president starting in Pennsylvania with Liz Cheney, now in Michigan, where she had this message for those in the crowd. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Part of this is he says they need to swamp the vote by getting as many people as possible.We just heard a video playing behind me at the stage at Concord about how they wanted to get people out there to vote, giving them the rules of early voting. But another way that Donald Trump appears to be trying to push people out there to vote and to vote early is by using fear tactics, essentially claiming without evidence at his last stop the Democrats were trying to cheat in the 2024 election, even in deep blue California.

Despite all that cash, Democrats are far from celebrating. Instead, there's a lot of hand wringing.New Quinnipiac polls in three blue wall states show Harris and Trump still deadlocked in a tight race with no clear leader. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Harris is slightly ahead of Trump, 49 percent to 46 percent within the margin of error. In Michigan, it's the former president who holds the edge over Harris. Trump also narrowly leads Harris in battleground Wisconsin, all of those states, all of those polls within the margin of error, indicating it's basically a tie. Here now to discuss our political panel, we have talked a lot about how both campaigns have been trying to appeal to white men. One Democrat is concerned there isn't being enough done by the Harris campaign to win over black male voters, specifically in Michigan. Jamal Simmons, who we all know, he's a panelist, quite often, a former communications director for Vice President Harris. He told Politico, quote, I am worried about turnout in Detroit. Do they have the machine to turn people out? There are concerns and they're not insignificant. Karen --",

And we were told that there was some equipment malfunction. Now, we do not know exactly what part of the equipment malfunctioned here. But they say this is not a mine that collapse. So, keep that in mind this is not an active mine. Again, this is a place where people go for tours and to really learn about the evolution of mining. And so when you look at the website of this mine, what they say is this about an hour long tour. And in that tour you go down essentially what -- it's like an elevator, they call it a shaft, right, that goes down in two minutes. And they say it goes down about 500 stories every single minute. After you get off that elevator, what happens then is that you ride this tram air locomotive. So again, we do not know what part of the equipment malfunctioned. But we do know that at least 10 people are underground and are now being -- trying to figure out exactly what to do or how to get them out. We do know that about 11 people were already rescued and there is, again, all these resources trying to get everything out. This is seasonal. This only opens in the summer.
