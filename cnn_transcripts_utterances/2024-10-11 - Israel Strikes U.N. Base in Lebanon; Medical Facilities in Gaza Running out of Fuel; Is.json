Peaceful persistence. The Nobel Peace Prize is won by a group of Japanese atomic bomb survivors trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons. And Mario magic. Gaming giant Nintendo opening its first museum in Japan. We'll take you there. But first, we do begin in the Middle East and Israel acknowledging that it struck a U.N. peacekeeping base in Southern Lebanon. A U.N. spokesperson says one peacekeeper was badly hurt in Friday's explosion. It's actually the second time the headquarters near the Israeli border have been hit this week. Israel's military says it's been trying to attack Hezbollah forces operating, quote, \"near the peacekeepers' positions.\" Meanwhile, U.N. officials are also warning about deteriorating conditions in Gaza. They say no food has entered northern Gaza for 10 days. One million people are at risk of starvation, according to estimates by the World Food Programme. With more on this, Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv. For us, Nic, good to have you with us. What are the Israelis saying about the fact that no food has entered in 10 days?

We know the United States doesn't want Israel to strike the nuclear power facilities and the nuclear enrichment sites and doesn't want them to strike Iran's oil refineries either. But what does that leave on the table? Proportionality, military sites, the Iranians struck military sites here. So, will Israel limit itself to that? It doesn't seem as if they will. They want deterrence. So, they want a big strike. So, where do we stand on that? You know, I think the population here is well expecting a response by Israel and would be expecting potentially another response back from Iran. But the pressure that Iran is trying to exert in the region implying that if their oil facilities are targeted, then they will target the facilities, oil facilities of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, other oil producers in the region, all of this to try to get those countries to put more pressure on the United States going into an election cycle, doesn't want to see a big hit in the -- it doesn't want to see an inflamement in the region and certainly, doesn't want to see a hit on gas prices so close to the election.

To find this many states that were this close to Election Day, and it's largely because we are seeing offsetting movements, right? I mean, we are seeing improvements, continued improvements, what we've seen really for the last 30 years, continued improvements for Democrats among college educated white voters, suburban voters, very strong performance for Republicans, for Trump among a non-college white voters, the blue collar whites who used to be the foundation of the Democratic coalition from the '30s to the '60s, FDR to LBJ. And then these inroads among black and Latino men and to some extent, among Latino women as well for Trump. And, you know -- and when you add them up, they kind of offset and leave you in a situation where particularly the three big rust belt swing states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, they've been leaning toward her. The first two might be slightly still leaning toward her, but there's no question that Trump is making up ground with his kind of cultural offensive on Harris, soft on crime, soft on the border, too committed to transgender rights. And then, the Sun Belt battlegrounds all also staying very close. If those Wall Street Journal polls were correct, they were done by a bipartisan team, includes Trump's pollster and Harris' pollster, which is kind of unusual, if they all were accurate, Harris would win. But no one on either side feels very confident right now. Although, I do think Democrats are worried that Trump is driving more of the narrative and Harris has to figure out a way to respond, take it back another notch in this final stretch.",

You can actually see some of the organization members crying tears of joy, just unable to believe that they've won such a prestigious award. Now, a bit about this organization. It is a grassroots organization that's comprised of atomic bomb survivors, also known as Hibakusha in Japanese. Their main purpose is to eliminate nuclear weapons around the globe, and their win actually comes at a very important time, not just for Japan, but also for the entire world. After decades of nuclear anxiety during the Cold War, nuclear weapons are once again causing a lot of unease, especially amid the wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned the west that it could use nuclear weapons if the United States and its allies get too involved in the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Israel, which is widely believed to have its own nuclear weapons, is trading fire with Iran, another country that is believed to have the capabilities of developing its own nuclear weapons. Even Japan's neighbors, like North Korea, are rapidly developing their nuclear arsenal. So, the work of Nihon Hidankyo and organizations like it are extremely relevant, especially as they speak from experience. Japan is the only country to have ever been bombed with atomic bombs during wartime, and it's believed more than 200,000 people were killed. They can say firsthand how devastating nuclear weapons actually are. How these atomic bombs decimated entire neighborhoods, towns, people's homes, and their families. And even though many of these hibakusha are getting old and are dying, they hope that their message of nuclear disarmament doesn't die with them. Hanako Montgomery, CNN, Tokyo. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

At their first meeting together, Russian PresidentVladimir Putin said he and his Iranian counterpart share a very close world view. President Putin and Masoud Pezeshkian met at a regional summit in the capital of Turkmenistan. Putin said Russia is working together with Iran in the international arena. Any clue could help solve one of Mt. Everest's great mysteries. A boot and sock with the name label A.C. Irvine were discovered on the mountain sticking out of a melting glacier. It likely belonged to Andrew Irvine, a British climber who disappeared with George Mallory back in 1924. It's unknown whether the two ever reached the summit of Everest. If they did, that would make them the first mountaineers to accomplish the feat. A key piece of evidence still missing is the camera they were carrying on their ascent. Pyongyang is accusing South Korea of flying drones filled with propaganda over the city and is threatening to retaliate. North Korean state media shared these images showing an alleged South Korean drone along with leaflets it was reportedly carrying. Seoul isn't confirming nor denying the claims. Mike Valerio is standing by with more details. Mike, the question is this real? And do we know if indeed it is real, who was behind it?",

But my next guest is hands down committed to using robots to disrupt the spa sector. Aescape provides fully automated self-service device, which uses two robotic arms to ease away aches and pains. A touchscreen controls the process and you choose how hard it should feel. I'm told it's physically impossible for it to hurt you. The company's machines are already in selected Equinox gyms in New York City at a cost of $60 for 30 minutes. This month, the company's installing them also in Four Seasons Resorts. Now, founder and CEO Eric Litman has suffered in the past from chronic back pain and had the idea to automate the massage process. And Eric joins us now. Eric, fantastic to have you with us. So, it was born in many respects out of personal need, but just explain how the technology works and how it differs from a human masseuse or massage therapist.",

Some of the things that sort of occurred to me as I was even watching was, I don't see how it gets to some of the smaller muscles, perhaps, and you are limited to being facedown. You don't reverse at this stage, at least, and get sort of the top part of your arms, for example, or the tops of your legs massaged.

We're just about to launch hamstrings and they feel great. That's coming up just this week. And then, we'll be working on the other parts of the body. Now, if you look at what's at the end of the robot arms there, what we call our air points, they have seven different surfaces on them capable of applying force to you in different ways. Meaning, we can turn them onto the different surfaces and get really specific. So, if there's a broad stroke that feels really good for relieving tension in the lower back, we can do that with a broad area. But if there's that little muscle right in between your shoulder blades, it just has a knot and needs to get worked out, we can do that with the fine point too.",
