Much more to protect the civilian lives. Let's begin our coverage this hour with Rafael Romo, who joins us live in Tel Aviv. And you know the desperation there to just try to get the aid in.

We've just been hearing that an extra 24 trucks have gone in. That takes the total to 218. Still, though, Poppy, nowhere near enough. Still no fuel and basic supplies now in such short supply. And the people so desperate that it is to looting, as you just heard, that they turned. And aid agencies have been warning for some time that the next step in this was the breakdown in any kind of social order, the tearing apart of the fabric of society. And these are the first steps, they say, in that process. And when you add to that the fact that people are having to go in and take flour and wheat, basic hygiene supplies, just to survive, it paints a very grim picture. That is even before you take into account the effects of the bombings day and night. So far, we're approaching, according to the Palestinian health ministry's figures, 8,000 killed. Of those, 116 healthcare workers. And again, last night, Poppy, was one of the major hospitals in Gaza hit by Israeli strikes. The Al Quds Hospital, the second biggest. Now, this is not just a hospital in which the wounded were being treated. There are, according to the Palestinian Red Cross, 12,000 people sheltering inside to try and seek refuge from that bombing. It was, you know, the night the director of the hospital says deliberately calling it a war crime. We reached out to the IDF to try and get some response. For the time being, we haven't heard. But you have to remember, Poppy, that it is that kind of bombing of the very places where people are seeking shelter that's making the situation so much more desperate than it was already.",
