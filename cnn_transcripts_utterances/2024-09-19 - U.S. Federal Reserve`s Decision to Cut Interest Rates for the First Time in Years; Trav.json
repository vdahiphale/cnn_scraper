Out through theouter heliosheath, across a heliopause, and as far into interstellar space as we can make that data last. Because we can see the changes in the data, changes in the environment as we travel further and further away. They were identical at launch. Different things have failed on the spacecraft differently. So if you think of twins, one has lost its hearing and needs some hearing aids and another one has lost a bit of some sense of touch. But for aging spacecraft, 46 years now, they`re actually very healthy.",

The highest quality of plastic is transformed into bracelets, which are sold to help finance their operations, while other materials get made into different products or upcycled into building materials. They`ve even been able to turn some of the plastic waste into energy. While an ocean free of plastic is the ultimate goal, there`s very much a human element to what they`re doing as well. JOSH LIBERMAN, CREATIVE DIRECTOR, 4OCEAN: It`s extremely important that we engage and empower local communities to do these cleanups. In Java, in Bali, in Guatemala. A lot of times these are fishermen, fisherwomen, whose livelihoods have been taken away because there`s so much plastic in the water.
