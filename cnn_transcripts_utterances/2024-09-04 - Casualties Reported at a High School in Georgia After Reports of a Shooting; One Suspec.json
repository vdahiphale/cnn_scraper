But they believe it has had some effect. Where does this go from here, from a policy perspective? It's mental health on one side, it's gun laws and the Second Amendment on another side. The Second Amendment exists. That's the reality. We don't know what happened here.",

Certainly on the Democratic side that Molly was referring to, gun violence protection groups have a long list of ideas and policy proposals of what could still be done, and a good chunk of those were enacted during the Biden Administration, including the creation of a Gun Violence Protection Office at the White House, which Vice President Harris leads. She also talks about it on the campaign trail.She's talks with disgust about the number of students that she has spoken to who raised their hands when she has asked how many of you have had to prepare for a potential shooting at your school. And surely, if they had a Democratic Congress fully in 2025, I think -- and Harris were to win, there would be more policy proposals that they would seek to get done. But the truth is, it's been a stalemate politically for a long, long time. I grew up in Littleton, Colorado. The fabric of our community there, as well as the fabric of our country, are tinged by these repeated school shootings that have just been happening for decades now.",

When you -- you are numbers guy, you know kind of where voters are and what they're thinking in any given moment.

This is taking place in one of the most contested states in the election. So this is going to be on the screens terribly, tragically, for Georgia voters to be looking at for quite some time here, no doubt. And we do see the issue sort of raising the consciousness of voters when that happens. And then it fades again as headlines move on. I don't know that it never fades obviously for those that are impacted.Just looking at the picture, every one of those kids you see out there is going to go home tonight, like rattled and even if they were not directly in the moment, this will impact them, their families that -- their community at, large like that kind of effect no doubt will take place here. When you were getting the news from Nick, Phil, and you said one of the things that we don't know yet is the scale of this. I mean, that's what we've come to in this regularity thing of this happening in America, is that the question now that we are waiting to learn is, well, what is the scale of this? It's not suggesting -- I'm not -- (inaudible) it's not the right question. It's just such a perverse question that we have to ask as we look at these incidents, because they have becomes so regular.",

Two to three blocks out, we saw a line of cars, of parents parking their vehicles off to the side of the road and then just rushing out of their cars, obviously trying to make their way up to school. I could see their faces just going past them, clearly worried, understandably in shock at what's going on here. We know from the Barrow County sheriff's office that casualties have been reported here at Apalachee High School and that one suspect is in custody. And I don't know if you can hear this, Phil, behind me but there's so much going on. So many police vehicles, fire and rescue here too.We've seen a helicopter overhead, multiple law enforcement agencies. We know from a source at a local hospital tell CNN that received with gunshot wounds related to this incident. And over at Grady Memorial Hospital, that's a level-one trauma center, they have received one gunshot wound victim. And of course, what about the students here? This incredibly scary situation that's just becoming a real concern in America is that the parents (inaudible) you don't ever want to see your child go through something like this. We saw earlier in the day, students gathered at the football field here. But we have been told by the school system that the students have been cleared to be picked up. Their parents have been notified. We did see in an instance from a helicopter footage the students appearing to be praying at one moment. The system, the school system has not said what exactly happened that led to this situation, but Phil, a very, very scary situation. We are asking the questions, trying to figure out what happened out here.",

      "sentences": "So, there's two different pieces going on now. The good news is, is that family unification is happening. That means the threat is gone. We know that. That also means that there's a least enough stability over the physical site that they have comfort family members going there. A lot of times, you know, you just you want to keep family away because of ongoing concerns about maybe they don't know how much damage there is. It seems like they now understand what kind of incident it was, how many potential -- how many casualties have occurred and that parents can come to the school.That's the most important thing. You want to get parents with their students. It's relatively the beginning of the school year, so there might be new parents, definitely new students who'd simply want to get out of there for now until they figure out what happened. So the first piece and that's the good news in this world of bad news in school shootings. The second is now the investigation, as Josh was laying out so clearly, this investigation will now look to both the physical side of it, how was entry -- how did entry happened? Was this unknown assailant? Was this a student, faculty, staff, parent? We don't know. Where he -- assuming, he -- where he went and why he went there? That is very key. If you have a low casualty or fatality count, there might be a more specific reason for the shooting as compared to something where you might see a greater harm. So we are just -- they're just looking at that to see sort of access points and why would they choose these particular people to shoot at? Or was it completely random? This is a relatively sophisticated state police. So as we know, these suburban or even more than suburban districts, often the state police are sort of the lead can these investigations and we should, I hope, hear from them soon more formally, so that people can know the extent of the damage. The larger debate about guns and guns and school, this particular American nightmare that we encounter every few weeks now, or every few weeks now, we'll then -- we'll find out what kind of gun he has and how he accessed that.",

I don't call them boys; these are men. Sometimes even younger. We have a problem in this country of isolation or radicalization. I don't -- I'm not saying the motive is political, but just radicalization to the extent that you would use guns for this kind of violence. And the sense that disagreements, concerns, depression, everything else will get worked out through gun violence.So you have that pool of men just -- I'm just talking statistically. We don't know if this is the case, right? So that pool of men, young men, and then access to guns. So that's why you're seeing a lot of -- on the policy side. So now, stepping back, I understand this is a tragedy, but it's also a policy tragedy. That's why you're seeing focus in some states around access to certain guns for certain ages. And so -- and that might be a legitimate issue. So you've got the gender with the isolation or radicalization or whatever is happening, not always mental disability, and then the access issue. That's what makes the United States unique in terms of shootings. Lots of countries have issues of men and violence and depression or isolation. But it's the access issue that makes the carnage of school shootings so unique. And so, we'll get to the motive. We'll get to the access issue. The vast majority of these are males. I caught myself, we don't know that for a fact, but I would be -- let's put it this way. I would be surprised if it were a female.",

Josh, we are talking throughout the course of the hour about kind of the breaking news, what is happening on the ground, but also the reality here, which is this keeps happening over and over again, and it does not happen in other places.
