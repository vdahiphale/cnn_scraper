As we enter the final hours of the six-day truce agreement between Israel and Hamas, there is new hope that new optimism is coming just this morning from a Qatari official.The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, which has been key in brokering these deals between Israel and Hamas, tells CNN that they are hopeful that they could announce another extension in just the next couple of hours. If not, Israel has made clear that they will resume military operations against Hamas in Gaza. We are expecting another group of hostages to be released today, even before any talk of an extension. Their families have been notified. And with that, we have learned that the Bibas family is not among this group. Ten-month-old Kfir is the youngest of all of the hostages. They do not know where he is.",

There are the faces though of the 81 Israeli hostages that have been freed since Friday, with ten new releases as you just heard late last night, but still many, many more are being held in Gaza. Israel believes there are 161 hostages still in captivity and the majority of them are Israeli.Israel's Prime Minister's office released a breakdown this morning of the vulnerable age groups within the 161 people being held, 4 hostages under the age of 18, just children, 4 more are between 18 and 19, which makes them legally children under the United Nations definition. Additionally, 10 more hostages are 75 years or older. CNN's Kaitlan Collins is with us now. Kaitlan, you spoke with the Qataris officials this morning about the state of these negotiations as they are trying to extend this truce for just a little bit longer, this ceasefire. What are you learning?",

This is initially supposed to be a four-day deal. But when we got close to the end of day four, they announced it would go on for 48 more hours, and now we are nearing that midnight deadline when that deal would therefore theoretically be expired.But right now, officials have been working behind the scenes to try to extend it, because right now the terms of the deal are women and children. We have seen women and children coming out. There are still many more women and children, though, who are in Hamas captivity, who are still being held in Gaza. And that's the whole point of why they're trying to extend these talks. And so we spoke to the spokesperson for the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They have been at the center of these talks, including just yesterday, with the CIA director in Doha. He said they are hopeful that when the sixth group of hostages gets released in just any moment now, that then they will be able to announce that there is going to be an extension to this temporary truce. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. MAJED AL-ANSARI, ADVISER TO QATAR PRIME MINISTER:  We are hopeful that within a couple of hours we would have the release of the final batch, but also we would be able to announce an extension. We are working on an extension that would be guaranteed by the same provision that guaranteed the previous two days, which is that every day we'd have to include at least 10 hostages coming out and 30 hostages -- 30, sorry, prisoners from the Israeli prisons.  And we are very optimistic that we would have good news to share today.",

We haven't gotten indications that it has started yet, but, crucially, we also haven't heard that the deal is in danger of falling apart in the last 24 hours of the deal as it currently stands. So, we do expect some time in the next little bit here we should begin to see the process of transferring the hostages from Hamas to the Red Cross and then into Israel either directly or through Egypt.Crucially, we're certainly not see anything like we saw yesterday with both sides accusing each other of initiating an exchange of fire, the most serious violation of the truce agreement, and yet even then it didn't fall apart. The real question here how much can this deal be extended, because at some point, it runs into the cold hard math that there are only a certain number of women and children who remain in Gaza. As we pointed out at the beginning of the show, the Israeli government estimates 161 hostages there, 35 are women, not all necessarily can fall under the agreement of women and children because some might be soldiers, and yet there is a massive effort to make sure the women and children part goes as long as it can and they find terms or a separate agreement or a new part of the agreement to extend the truce as long as possible. Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked about that at NATO today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, what they do when they go in with these bulldozers, they basically plow up all the roads inside the camp, and they go inside looking for these militants. They oftentimes take over people's houses. They lock the residents in one of the rooms or keep them under guard as they use higher positions to shoot down into the streets. Now, we understand that two people died because the Israeli forces were barring access to the hospital, and another two boys, one aged 9 and one aged 14, were shot dead by Israeli forces.

This is a chronic disease that goes severe when he's getting in a stress situation.It's horrible to describe it and is in very danger of his life if he's not getting his medicine and if he's not getting a medical aid. I don't see the Red Cross is going inside Gaza to actually to be on his part of the deal that was being with and I don't know what's going on. The lists are going up and downs but we have to take the sick people and the wounded people out. We saw a few days ago that Alma Abraham, an old lady, that she suffers from illness, she didn't get the right treatment and she got to the hospital in the worst case. So, I'm very concerned and I'm very worried about my son that he is not in a good condition. So, we have to take the sick people and the wounded out. We have to take everyone out.

But some of the things that stick out to you get more to this warning or what could have been the lost opportunities for Republicans to stop Donald Trump, like her conversation with Mitch McConnell, and let me read a bit of what Mitch McConnell said. She says that she doesn't see -- when she says she doesn't seem -- she says that she thought Mitch McConnell was going to support pushing Donald Trump out. But then she says she doesn't know why it almost, but that he seems to lose his resolve. What's left for me in this, and I have not yet seen the pages, though, was the why.

One of the things these excerpts show is the profound degree of cowardice, the hypocrisy, knowing that Donald Trump is lying to supporters, but being effectively afraid of him. One member of Congress telling Liz Cheney that he's afraid of his family, for his family's safety if he does what he believes is the right thing constitutionally and votes for impeachment. And Mitch McConnell sets which would have been a tipping point, Trump would be barred from office at this point.

We're not the party Bush, we're not the party of Cheney. This is about -- we're almost 250 years old, one of the longest- lasting democracies in the world. We have faced a lot of challenges, including a civil war. We've never had a leading party candidate campaign as a would-be autocrat. And that is what Liz Cheney is warning is happening within her party as a result of cowardice on the part of people who don't have the spine to stand up to what they know is wrong, including the lies that attempt to overturn our election. So, yes, this is a time for choosing. We have seen Republicans lose their spine at critical moments, like with the impeachment. What Cheney is doing, is saying, I will be that voice, but we need to build a broader coalition. It requires other people to have as much spine as she does, even a quarter of it.
