Herschel Walker with 49%, Raphael Warnock with 49%.Normally, we don't include libertarian candidates, but I have here Chase Oliver at 2%. Why? Because the rules in Georgia basically stipulate that if the leading candidate does not, in fact, get a majority of the vote on election day in November, they will, in fact, be a runoff come December. And right now, the forecast suggests that neither Herschel Walker nor Raphael Warnock will, in fact, reach that majority of the vote. I just want to point out how important Georgia is in terms of winning control of the United States Senate. If Herschel Walker wins, the Democrats' chance of retaining control of the Senate is just 26%. If Raphael Warnock wins, look at that, it jumps up to 76%. So, whoever wins Georgia has a pretty good shot of controlling the Senate overall. And here is the only other thing I will sort of point out. The fact that Georgia is so close -- look at all of these races right now. Arizona, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada all within three points. Democrats must win probably three of these four races.

In 2017, if you all remember, Donald Trump had the opportunity to be a transformational president on comprehensive immigration reform.
