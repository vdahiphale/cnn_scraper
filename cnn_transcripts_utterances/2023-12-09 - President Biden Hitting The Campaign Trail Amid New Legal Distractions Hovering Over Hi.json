      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield in New York today.So, with just weeks before voters head to the polls at key 2024 election contests, President Biden is hitting the campaign trail amid new legal distractions hovering over his son. On Friday, the president kicked off a campaign swing out west just hours after his son Hunter's latest indictment. Hunter Biden is now facing new federal tax evasion charges. Prosecutors accuse him of a four-year tax evasion scheme and spending millions of dollars on things like drugs, escorts, and exotic cars. If convicted on all nine criminal counts, he could face up to 17 years in prison. CNN Senior White House Reporter Kevin Liptak is in Los Angeles where the president is fundraising. Kevin, has the president said anything about these indictments?",

      "sentences": "No, he hasn't, Fredericka. He's been asked a few times but the president fairly tight lipped on this. What the White House says is that the president loves his son, that he supports him, but they're otherwise. not all that eager to weigh in on this.And it really is one of the most sensitive issues inside the White House, not something that many aides raise with the president. And when you talk to them, it's not something that many really have a firsthand knowledge of how the president is processing all of this. But it is certainly true that these Hunter Biden's legal issues do weigh heavily on his father. They have over the last year or so, and this one is no different, in particular because of how personal and somewhat embarrassing the details in that indictment were. And so, this is a political headache for President Biden as he heads in to next year's election. You've already seen Republicans try and conflate Hunter Biden's legal issues with those that President Trump is facing. They are vastly different circumstances. President Trump was president and is running to be president again. Hunter Biden has not been president and won't be president, so they are very different. And when you talk to people around President Biden, they don't believe that voters will necessarily factor Hunter Biden's legal issues into their decision-making next year, but it certainly will be a challenge for President Biden as he looks to ramp up this contrast with former President Trump, his most likely challenger in the 2024 election. You heard President Biden do that yesterday in Las Vegas, where he was announcing some new investments in passenger rail, and he went after President Trump by name. Listen to what he said.

Certainly, this will be a lucrative stretch for the president. I was talking yesterday to Jeffrey Katzenberg. He's a film mogul, but also the co-chair of the Biden re- election campaign, he said this will be the most lucrative 36 hours of President Biden's campaign since he announced his re-election effort back in the spring.

That's so important because those voters, evangelical voters, they make up a significant amount of Iowa caucus goers.So, Congressman Randy Feenstra represents a very conservative part of this state, holding this forum, giving them the opportunity to talk about how faith and family informs their policy vision. But the elephant in the room, the person who was not there, Former President Donald Trump, that is the big issue that they have to contend with because Trump still holds a significant lead in the polling. And they have to argue to voters that they can make up this 20 percent deficit. Here is how Ambassador Haley, Governor DeSantis, are talking about Trump on the trail. Oh, it sounds like we don't have that soundbite, but basically, Ambassador Haley, she said that wherever, rightly or wrongly, that the former president, he's always followed by chaos. Governor DeSantis argued that if Trump is the general election candidate, that Democrats will pile on on a way that will essentially make him too toxic to most voters, arguing that he would be a better general election candidate. Also, we're going to hear much more of that. Ambassador Haley will make her way here to Spirit Lake, Iowa, to continue to speak with voters. We're talking to voters as well. They say that a range of issues are on their minds. It's the future of social security in this country, healthcare, immigration. So, all these candidates will have the opportunity to speak to these voters time and time again. Haley even telling Iowans that not before long they will get sick of seeing her face. Fred.",

And of course, as the Biden campaign has continued to see the president struggle in recent polls, and most recently \"The Wall Street Journal\" poll with a hypothetical matchup between him and Donald Trump.",

Families who deal with family members who have addictions don't always make the best decisions in the world. And, you know, Hunter Biden has actually talked about it in his memoir. And when we talked to one of our legal analysts today, he helped remind everyone that Hunter Biden did actually eventually pay all of the taxes, the penalties, et cetera. And so, this case is revealing a lot about what Hunter Biden went through. But I wonder if that's going to be a calculus that the White House uses because they can't get away from it.

And so, even though these candidates are really working hard and crisscrossing the state and trying to earn the of these Iowa caucus goers in the Iowa caucus is very different.

So, she says complications from her pregnancy have created problems for her in terms of her health now and also, her health in the future, specifically her fertility.And so, she sued the State of Texas to ask for permission to get a legal abortion in that state. A Texas judge granted that and allowed her to do that, which was very significant because this specifically sort of defines medical exemptions in a state that has some of the most restrictive abortion laws. There's a six-week ban in place in the State of Texas. Now, the attorney general did not agree with that ruling from that Texas judge and asked for the Supreme Court of the state to interfere. And that's exactly what the Texas Supreme Court did, essentially putting a temporary block in place. And so, they froze lower court's decision and look at the case. It's unclear when they will do that because there is no timeline in terms of that blockage that court put in place. But what that means is that she cannot get that legal abortion at the moment and her attorney saying they're still very hopeful, but also saying that this is an urgent medical matter. And she said, you know, this is why people shouldn't beg for health care from a court of law. That was from her attorney. Ken Paxton, on the other hand, is saying that Kate Cox failed to prove why this would be life-threatening or why she would be at risk of death. So, those are sort of his reasons for opposing that Texas judge's ruling. And why he went to the Supreme Court. So, again, we'll have to wait and see what the Texas Supreme Court decides. But in the meantime, Kate Cox, through her lawsuit, is saying, look, if the baby is born, it's likely not going to live for more than a couple of days. And she says her health here is at risk and the future of her fertility as well. Fred.",
