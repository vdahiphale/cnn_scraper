Some of the things that are going on, on the battlefield, as well.The Ukrainians are saying that these massive strikes that started in the early morning hours of today, targeting civilian infrastructure but also targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, as well. And that's something that is absolutely significant, because the Ukrainians say that they haven't seen strikes on this scale here in this country on the energy infrastructure in the past six months. And it comes as the weather is getting colder in Ukraine and we're moving towards the heating season. So the Ukrainians say the Russians could be setting up for massive attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure right as the heart of winter approaches here in this country. Obviously, devastating for the civilian population. The Ukrainians say that there were ten strategic bombers, that the Russians launched and fired 43 cruise missiles towards the territory of Ukraine. The Ukrainians said, with the air defenses that they have, they were able to shoot down 36 of those cruise missiles. But obviously, some of them came through, hitting targets, first and foremost, in the West of the country and in the central part of the country. There were big powder [SIC] -- power outages in those parts of the country. And also one hotel was hit, wounding a lot of people. And that's where we get to President Zelenskyy's visit to Washington, D.C., today. Of course, one of the things that Zelenskyy has talked about, that the Ukrainians say they need is more air defense. They say that especially the U.S. systems that are around here in Ukraine, have been performing really well. The Patriot systems, the NASAMS systems. The Ukrainians just saying they need more of that. And certainly, today is definitely a case in point for them, where they say they definitely need more protection of their skies to be more successful on the battlefield, but also to prevent things that we saw this morning, guys.",

Only this time, the political landscape in Washington has shifted. REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): The first thing I'll tell you is, there's no money in the House right now for Ukraine. It's not a good time for him to be here, quite frankly. That's just the reality. FOX (voice-over): While there is still broad bipartisan support to fund that war effort in Ukraine, Republicans in the House are bitterly divided as they debate a path forward to avert a government shutdown. Cracks in the conference have been building for months. In July, 70 House Republicans voted to strip Ukraine of all U.S. military aid as part of the debate on the defense bill. While Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell has been a dogged supporter of funding the war -- SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): These people in Ukraine who are fighting for their independence are taking on one of the two big adversaries we have, Russia and China. It seems to me we ought to be helping. FOX (voice-over): McCarthy, facing growing rebellion in his right flank, has been more circumspect. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Is Zelenskyy elected to Congress? Is he our president? I don't think I have to commit anything. I have questions for him. Where's the accountability in the money we already spent? What is the plan for victory? FOX (voice-over): The skepticism reflects a shift in public opinion. A CNN poll in August found most Americans are now opposed to more Ukraine funding. Among Republicans, that number is higher, at 71 percent. REP. SCOTT PERRY (R-PA): Our people can't afford their electric bills, their gas bills or their food bills, and before we send blank checks to some other country, we need to take care of our people. FOX (voice-over): Today, Zelenskyy will make his case to bipartisan leaders, including McCarthy, who will ultimately decide if he'll cross his hardliners to put Ukraine aid to a vote. REP. ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-VA): If he lives in this constant fear that one member on his far right is going to take the action of motioning to vacate the chair, thereby, you know, removing him from the speakership, I mean, we are making day-to-day decisions, or not making day-to-day decisions, because one guy wants to keep his job. FOX (voice-over): But as the war in Ukraine rages on, even Republicans who may back the effort say they want more accountability. REP. GARRET GRAVES (R-LA): This administration has both accountability and transparency issues they've got to address before they deserve another penny.

Now, this is already on top of about 2,500 National Guard who are already working there. You also have 24,000 CBP agents and other non-uniformed agents and law enforcement personnel, all that are currently dealing with what has been an uptick in border crossings. Just earlier in the week, there were figures of that there were more than 8,000 migrants who had been coming to the U.S.-Mexico border. That's akin to the numbers that we saw before the lifting of Title 42. And in the city of Eagle Pass, Texas, the mayor there has declared -- or issued an emergency declaration due to this increase. A source had told us there are about approximately 3,000 migrants who were processed there just yesterday. The fact that the White House, the Department of Defense, will be deploying additional personnel down there, it's not unprecedented, but it does show how they are trying to get an additional handle on this emerging situation.",

And it's expected, DHS says, to apply to about 472,000 Venezuelans. Of course, there had already been TPS extended to them back in May of 2021, to those who had arrived before then. But what this will do is that it will prevent their removal from the country. And it will also issue some work authorizations for them, forgoing some -- the oftentimes months-long processes that it takes in order to get work authorization. Now, this is something that some Democrats have been calling for, including New York City Mayor Eric Adams. They have been dealing with a large population of Venezuelans coming into their city. And you've heard some Democrats from New York overnight, praising the administration for this decision.

Hutchinson worked for Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows and provided crucial testimony to the House January 6th Committee. This was the scene on that day, right near the Capitol where Trump and Giuliani both spoke before a large crowd of Trump supporters, telling them to, quote, \"fight like hell\" before rioters stormed the Capitol, delaying the certification of the 2020 presidential election. Backstage, Hutchinson says Giuliani approached her with a stack of papers in his hand, claiming to have evidence of voter fraud. And then she says this happened. Quote, \"Rudy wraps one arm around my body, closing the space that was separating us. I feel his stack of documents press into the small of my back. I lower my eyes and watch his hand, his free hand, reach for the hem of my blazer.\" Hutchison says she felt, quote, \"his frozen fingers trail up my thigh. He tilts his chin up. The whites of his eyes look jaundiced. My eyes dart to John Eastman, who flashes a leering grin.\" Hutchinson further writes, \"I fight against the tension in my muscles and recoil from Rudy's grip. Filled with rage, I storm through the tent on yet another quest for Mark.\" A clear reference to her then- boss, Mark Meadows. Two of her former colleagues in the Trump White House, they're backing her up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

On the other hand, he was trying to do it while saying absolutely nothing. And he's hamstrung necessarily. Because as the A.G., you cannot go into details of pending investigations. To do that would jeopardize those investigations. It would jeopardize the rights of the people being investigated. I do think Merrick Garland succeeded on one count and sort of did not succeed on the other count. I think he successfully and clearly explained that the decision to charge Donald Trump was made by Jack Smith. That Joe Biden, the president, had nothing to do with that, notwithstanding Trump's constant refrain of the, quote, \"Biden indictments.\" That I think Garland was crystal-clear on. There's no evidence to the contrary. The Hunter Biden issue, I think there's many questions that remain that Merrick Garland did not adequately explain. And again, to an extent he can't. He can't say, Let me explain to you exactly what's happening behind the scenes, why we've made this decision, why we've charged him thus far with gun crimes. Here's what may come. So I think there's still plenty of questions about Hunter Biden and we'll see some of that picked up next week, perhaps, in the impeachment inquiry, when that kicks off.",

It's not just Republicans that are upset with him. It's actually people in the White House, as well.Because they essentially think Merrick Garland, in an attempt to placate people like Jim Jordan, who people in the White House and allies of the White House think are operating in bad faith; you're never going to placate him. And in an effort to do that, he's essentially outsourced every difficult political decision to special counsels. And so now, you have this case where the most politically-fraught cases, the documents case against Joe Biden, the Hunter Biden case, and the cases against Donald Trump, are all now outsourced to special counsels. The A.G. has promised to give them independence. So he has no control. And we're going to an election where all -- where the A.G. does not have control of the most politically sensitive cases. And this is what has really frustrated some folks in the White House, and Biden allies, as well.",
