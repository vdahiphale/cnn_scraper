Prime Minister Netanyahu's plans to curtail the power of Israel's judiciary. I will ask former prime minister Ehud Barak and former foreign minister Tzipi Livni about what is happening on the ground and in the Knesset.Also, China's new foreign minister said this week that there would surely be conflict and confrontation with the U.S. if the American government continues to speed down the wrong path. I'll dig in deep on the moods in both Beijing and Washington with Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister of Australia who is about to be sworn in as Australia's new ambassador to the United States. Also, should Silicon Valley's tech giants finally pay up for serving news content. They've already squared off with Australia over this and Canada is next up. But it all may be too little, too late in the age of AI. I will explain. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

You say that, if these laws get passed, you believe that Israel should engage in massive civil unrest, nonviolent protest, on the scale of, you know, the kind of American civil rights movement. Explain what do think -- what are the stakes here? EHUD BARAK, FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAELbasically, as Tzipi described it, it's an attack on the very soul and nature of our democracy, about independence of the supreme court and about the values of the declaration of independence, which is our kind of, so to speak, equivalent of a constitution. So once a government, using the tools of democracy, in order to destroy it from within, and ends up acting in a blatantly illegitimate manner, it is not just the right of citizens; it's the, in my judgment, obligation of citizens to turn, unfortunately, towards civil disobedience, nonviolent, but nonviolent civil disobedience. We might still be two weeks or three weeks from completion of this legislation, but once it is completed, you know, the supreme court will stand in the way. I hope that the gatekeepers, the head of the Secret Service, the head of the police, the chief of the IDF, they always stand. But if they want, or if the government will try to impose this package of laws, there will be no way for citizens to resist but through nonviolent civil disobedience.",

They will not let Israel to turn into a combination of theocracy or autocracy, and that this is why you see all these people in the streets. People are fighting.And this is the good news. Because a kind of a camp, people, liberal democrats within Israel, well, in a way were not activists until now. And what you see now is a creation of a new camp in Israel that is fighting for Israel's democracy. And this is good news. And I think I know that it took Netanyahu and his government by surprise. They look at the opposition and they say, OK, they are weak. You know, they're too weak. They are not going to fight for it. We can do whatever we want. And they discovered that they can't. What they are trying to do is to take the Jewishness of the state, from a religious perspective, to cover the nature and the values of Israel in democracy, and people are objecting. So I think that, to speak about the future like this is a done deal, I'm not willing to do so. We are fighting now. There is hope. It took the government by surprise. And I hope that they will understand that they cannot move forward like this because the prices, not only the political prices that they are paying now but the prices for the state of Israel are unacceptable.",

Because if you look at the demographic trends, the part of the population that is growing is the ultra-Orthodox, it is the Haredi. And they don't seem that committed to liberal democracy. Am I right?

So, leave aside for a moment the long-term tendencies, and we arefocused on fighting. If democracy will win, as myself and Tzipi believe and act for, there will be enough time to deal. The ultra- Orthodox, our Jews, they're our brothers, and there are many things to be done in regard to taking politics -- taking religion out of Israeli politics. But that's for the future. First of all, we have to make sure that this package of laws that turn Israel into a dictatorship, not Russia or Turkey, but something like Hungary or Poland, with much wealth, neighborhood kind of situation.

And then, of course, the foreign minister went one step further by saying, if the United States continues its current posture in particular on Taiwan, inevitably this will result in conflict. I've never heard that from a Chinese foreign minister before.So, I think two things are at play here. I think both Xi Jinping and his team are under considerable domestic economic pressure at present from a very slow economy. And this has been an opportunity for Xi Jinping to say, we know you're going through a hard time domestically, growth has been down, unemployment has been up, prices are a problem in certain areas, but the United States and its allies have been making life impossible for us by the pressure they've brought to bear on us domestically. So, I think that is one of the rationales. But, you know, when a Chinese president says something as definitive as this it also has its own intrinsic foreign security policy significance. And I do believe it further accelerates China's preparedness militarily for a future action over Taiwan if and when Xi Jinping so chooses.",

China was becoming more powerful but the acceleration of the gap, or should I say the narrowing of the gap between China and the U.S. and military capabilities but also in aggregate economic size has actually caused China to conclude it has an ability now to project its own interests and values in a way in which it didn't see as possible before.The second big change, however, I think is Xi Jinping himself. In the dynamic of Xi's leadership is a changed driver in itself. Ideologically he's a Marxist-Leninists. He's a much more dedicated advocate of an assertive foreign security policy. And you see him pushing the trajectory and accelerating the velocity of China's shall we say moment in the global sun. And then, third, the United States has pushed back.",

China is at risk of shredding its international reputation by being too close to Putin's invasion of Ukraine, not insufficiently independent, et cetera.If you look at this relationship, however, through the Beijing lens or through the Xi Jinping lens, it is really important to see this, from his strategic view having Russia on side with China for the long-term is a fundamental importance. For most of their 400 year history as you know as a student of this, it has been a heavily armed border no longer have to do -- there's no longer 18 Soviet divisions on the other side of the border. China can focus all of its military activity and resources and planning to the maritime theater, its principal future adversary to the United States. I think the other thing in Xi Jinping's calculus is the Russians from time to time will provide rolling strategic distractions for the United States and other theaters. Syria, some time ago, and now, of course, in Ukraine. Again causing the United States to be focusing in multiple directions at once. China has one direction to focus on.",

In terms of where China is at present, unless they were to concluding internally that there was a danger of Putin actually losing and actually coming under massive pressure in terms of his own position back home, I do not see that it is in China's interest now to cross that line either directly through providing military material directly to the Russians, or cleverly through third parties as it has often been suggested.",

We've been in the trenches with the United States in I think all of America's major wars in the 20th century and into the 21st century, even some of the crazy ones. And so working closely with the administration and the guidance of the government in Canberra is about dealing with the granularity of deterrence, dealing with the granularity of mechanisms to reduce the risk of crisis, conflict and war by accident as well as the roles and responsibility of allies. So, of course as an ambassador I'm promoting the Australia national interest in business and security and defense and all that. And I'll be doing that happily as well.
