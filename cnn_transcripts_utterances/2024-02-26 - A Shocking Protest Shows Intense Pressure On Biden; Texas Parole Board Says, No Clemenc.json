      "sentences": "Is Joe Biden facing a Vietnam moment in the war in Gaza? That's tonight on NewsNight.Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. And tonight, a soldier's final act and his last words add to the unprecedented pressure on President Biden. Aaron Bushnell was an active duty Air Force member, just 25 years old. He took his own life on Saturday in a shocking protest. He lit himself on fire in front of the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. We're not going to show you the actual video of those final moments. It's too gruesome. But this is a still that was taken from a video that he recorded. In it, Bushnell explains why he felt that he had to do what he did. He talked to the camera for nearly a minute, and he said this, I will no longer be complicit in genocide. I'm about to engage in an extreme act of protest. You can see Bushnell standing, U.S. flag visible on his uniform, the embassy gate there behind him. His last words were words that he shouted until he collapsed from the fatal fire that he set, free Palestine. Now, there have been other moments like this in modern history. The awful violence of the act is intended to jolt the conscience. I want to warn you, some of what we're about to see and discuss is difficult to watch. Some of it, you may well remember, a Buddhist monk in Saigon aflame in 1963 to protest the American-backed regime in South Vietnam, a Quaker, Norman Morrison, at the Pentagon in 1965 to demand a stop to violence in Vietnam. Here, you're looking at the vigil that was held after his death, a fruit vendor who ignited the Arab Spring, which led to the downfall of dictators across the Middle East. Now, the fact that Israel's war in Gaza has provoked this kind of response from really anyone marks a new and stunning chapter in this country's stark divisions over this war. Biden is clearly feeling the pressure and, privately, he's expressing his frustration with the Netanyahu government and its refusal to moderate the bombing campaign. But right now, here's where the numbers stand domestically. 50 percent of Americans say that Israel's campaign has gone too far. That includes 63 percent of Democrats and that number has been building. Recent events, they've also highlighted how limited Biden's increasingly frank warnings to Netanyahu have been and exerting pressure on a U.S. ally. He, for example, warned Netanyahu not to plan for an invasion into the densely populated refuge for civilians, Rafah. Netanyahu says he has a plan to do just that. And tomorrow, we'll see a test of just how frustrated the voters are. There's been a vocal campaign in the state of Michigan to get Democrats to vote uncommitted as a message directly to the president of the United States. Now, whether President Biden hears that message or if he can do anything at this point to make Israel hear that message, well, that remains to be seen. Tonight, progressive anger at the President is mounting. Joining me now is someone who's been a key progressive for a very long time, Democratic Congresswoman from California Barbara Lee. She's a former chair of the Progressive Caucus. She's also running for Senate. Now, Lee was also the only member of Congress from either party to vote against the 2001 authorization of military force that sent American troops into Afghanistan for what turned out to be two decades of war. Congresswoman, thank you for joining us tonight. As you saw there, a service member self-immolating outside of the Israeli embassy, it's really a horrifying thing to watch. When you saw that, what went through your mind? REP. BARBARA LEE (D-CA): It's tragic, first of all. Secondly, I thought about his family, his friends, how they must be devastated. And, of course, my first thought was to send condolences and give me a chance to do that to his family and to his friends. You know, I've always supported our First Amendment rights, peaceful protesting, but peaceful is the operative way to protest. [22:05:06] So, in this instance, this turned out, as in many respects, it looks like it could be a suicide. But it's very sad. And I hope those who are protesting continue to protest peacefully, because violence should not be an option on any front and any protest for any reason.",

I called for a cease-fire early. We had to get a political and diplomatic solution so that the hostages can be released, so this terrible death and destruction and violence can stop. And I am concerned about an escalation into a regional war with the United States embroiled in it. And so, of course, it's in our national security interests also.

Finally, I'll just say a week before last I met with King Abdullah from Jordan and what he raised in our meeting was very scary to me. But also he gave some hope that there are certain issues on the table that could lead to a peace plan. But, remember, the United States has supported and continues to support a two-state solution.

He was convicted of murdering his cousin and the cousin's fiance some 23 years ago. His lawyers asked for a delay after new evidence surfaced in the case. But just a short time ago, the Texas Parole Board recommended the request be denied, leaving Cantu's fate in the hands of Governor Greg Abbott. Now, this comes as the head of the jury that decided Cantu should die is asking Abbott for that delay. In an op-ed, Jeff Calhoun writes in part, simply put, we the jurors did not hear the truth you assume you would hear from a person under oath. Bottom line, I feel like I was fooled.

Duff says testimony from the two key witnesses is riddled with falsehoods.Cantu's girlfriend, Amy Boettcher, testified Cantu committed the murders around midnight on November 3rd, but Cantu's legal team says two forensic pathologists say the victims were actually killed hours later on the morning of the next day. She also testified Cantu took a Rolex watch from his cousin. The Rolex, it turns out, was never missing and returned to the victim's family after the murders. Amy Boettcher also testified she threw the bloody jeans with the victim's DNA in their apartment trash can. But the jeans don't have Cantu's DNA and are two sizes too large. In court filings Cantu also says two days before the victims' bodies were discovered, a man in a pizza delivery uniform came to his apartment and said his cousin owed money, then fired a gunshot into Cantu's apartment. That bullet matched bullets in the victims. The pizza man story was dismissed, but Matt Duff says they've identified the person and he matches the description of one of his cousin's drug supplier. Amy Boettcher's brother Jeff also testified that Cantu told him he planned to kill his cousin. Amy Boettcher died in 2021 and shortly after Jeff Boettcher called the prosecutor's office and recanted his testimony. Prosecutors say Jeff Boettcher's interview has been misconstrued and that, ultimately, the concerns about his testimony were alleviated.
