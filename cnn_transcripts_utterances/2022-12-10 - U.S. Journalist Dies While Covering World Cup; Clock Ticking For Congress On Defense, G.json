On the screen you see the defense spending number, it eliminates the military COVID vaccine mandate. We were just talking about strips special immigration visa provisions authorizes up to 10 billion to boost Taiwan military. So, this is a must pass bill that needs to get made into law by the end of the year. So, it made it past the House.
