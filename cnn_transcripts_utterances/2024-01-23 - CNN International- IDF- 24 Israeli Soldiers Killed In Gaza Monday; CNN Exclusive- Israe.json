Meanwhile, the IDF says it has Khan Younis in southern Gaza surrounded. We'll have the very latest on that.Then voting's underway in the New Hampshire primary. Former U.S. President Donald Trump is hoping victory there, could knock out his only remaining Republican opponent. That's Nikki Haley, of course. And then we'll be live in Los Angeles, where Hollywood is preparing for the 2024 Oscars nomination. Well, Israel's Prime Minister calls Monday one of the most difficult days of the war. 21 Israeli soldiers were killed in a single incident in Gaza when two buildings collapsed on them following an explosion. Three others were killed separately. It was the deadliest day for Israeli forces since the start of the war against Hamas. Meanwhile, in southern Gaza, the IDF says its troops have Khan Younis surrounded. The Hamas controlled health ministry says nearly 200 people were killed in just the past day. The U.N. Special Rapporteur warns that Israel is destroying Gaza's food system, letting an entire civilian population go hungry. Jeremy Diamond joins us from Tel Aviv. Just take us through these IDF soldiers that were lost, Jeremy.",

These 21 soldiers were told by the Israeli military, they were operating in central Gaza, about 600 meters away from the border with Israel, conducting clearing operations, demolishing buildings and clearing Hamas infrastructure in order to make it safer for people across the border in Israel to return to their homes. At about 4:00 p.m., the Israeli military says that an RPG was fired towards a tank in that area. And at the same time, an explosion was set off, resulting in the collapse of two story buildings with soldiers inside. Now, it's not exactly clear whether that RPG set off that explosion, but it appears that the soldiers were in the process of placing explosives inside those buildings, rigging them for demolition. And at some point it exploded with those soldiers inside. Israeli military search and rescue forces quickly rushed in to try and rescue people and altogether, finding 21 casualties from this single incident. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that this is one of the most difficult days since the outbreak of the war. And it's also very important to understand that here in Israel, such a small country where there is a required military conscription, reserve duty, you know, this is being felt very hardly, very harshly by people in Israel. It is affecting them personally and every single Israeli soldier lost is very much deeply felt in the reverberations are very wide in the Israeli population.",

Thank you so much for that.We're going to go to a CNN exclusive now, because we've learned that Israel's spy chief has proposed Hamas leaders leave Gaza as part of a wider ceasefire talk. The proposal would give the senior leaders safe passage out of Gaza, weakening the group's hold on the enclave. This runs counter though to Israel's stated goal of destroying Hamas. And Hamas itself is not likely to accept it either. CNN's Alex Marquardt joins us live with details. It does sound like an extraordinary deal considering, you know, the words that really started this war and how Hamas was going to be destroyed. Release them doesn't seem to tie in with that.",

      "sentences": "No, it doesn't, Max. We've heard time and time again from Prime Minister Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials that their goal in this war is complete victory over Hamas, to eradicate Hamas. Instead, what I've learned is that there has been a proposal raised by Israel for Hamas leaders to leave the Gaza Strip, essentially allowing them to walk away from this war zone.It is an incredible prospect to think about, that the architects, the orchestrators, the planners of the deadliest day in Israeli history would essentially be allowed to walk away. Now, Max, from Israel's perspective, it could benefit Israel. It would weaken Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It would essentially draw those leaders out of the tunnels where they're believed to be hiding. Israel has said that they plan to mount operations around the world to target Hamas leaders so they could essentially kill them elsewhere. We saw a senior Hamas commander killed in Beirut earlier this month. But I think, Max, it really does speak to the pressure that Netanyahu and the government is under to get to a ceasefire to get the hostages home. It also speaks to the fact that Israel has made relatively little inroads when it comes to taking out the most senior members of Hamas. They haven't managed to capture or kill any of the senior leaders. I'm talking specifically about Yahya Sinwar, who is the top Hamas official in Gaza as well as Mohammed Deif, who is the head of the military wing. And at the same time, according to Israel's own estimates, Max, around 70 percent of the Hamas fighters remain on the battlefield. Now this proposal was raised by Israel's intelligence chief, I'm told at a meeting with the CIA director last month in Warsaw, as well as the Qatari prime minister. It was discussed again in Doha earlier this month with the Qatari prime minister and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Blinken was told that this proposal, this idea, will never happen. And Max, that's what I'm also told by international and U.S. officials, that it is highly unlikely leaders like Sinwar and Deif would rather go down fighting against their sworn enemy than simply leave the Gaza Strip.

And they said that the U.S. and U.K. strikes will not go unpunished, and that retaliation is inevitable. Now, I was reading actually that the United States hasn't really been paying much attention to what's going on in Yemen. They sort of woke up just after the attacks in -- on by Hamas on the 7th of October. And certainly since November, when the Houthis have started striking ships in the Red Sea, more than two dozen strikes since November. But the question is, how effective are these strikes going to be? Keep in mind that Yemen is sort of like the Afghanistan of the Middle East, desperately poor. But the people are tough as nails and they have defied all those who have tried to crush them in the past. Going back to the Egyptians and the Saudi Arabians in the 1960s, the war in Yemen between the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia on the one hand, and their Yemeni allies against the Houthis between 2015 and 2022. All we've seen with the Houthis is that despite endless strikes by the Saudis and the Emiratis, they only got stronger. And the problem is that these strikes may symbolically be pleasing to the United States, the U.K. and others. There's no guarantee that this is going to, in any way, stop the Houthis from what they're doing. The Houthis say they are targeting shipping going towards Israel. These of course strikes began once the war in Gaza began. And, of course, one way to stop those strikes on navigation in the Red Sea might be for the United States to put some pressure on Israel for a ceasefire, but it doesn't seem willing to do that.

I was really excited that she got in there. Leonardo DiCaprio was snubbed for \"Killers of the Flower Moon\". His character is bizarre because he's kind of -- he loves his wife and yet he's killing her family. It was hard really for them to make sense of that character, other than maybe he's a simpleton.
