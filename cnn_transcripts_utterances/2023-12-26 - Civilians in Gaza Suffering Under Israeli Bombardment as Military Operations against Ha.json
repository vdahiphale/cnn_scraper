And in another case, they can make an arrest. But you have to take them seriously. Look at judge Esther Salas in New Jersey who had an individual show up at her home shoot her husband, killed her teenage son. Look at Judge Roemer in Juneau, Wisconsin, who had an individual in one of his cases came to his home after the fact and killed him. Threats against judges in this country have skyrocketed between 2016, and I think 2018, they doubled last year for federal judges, just federal judges, that's 2.700 federal judges.

But when you're in these message boards, and you're using a handle or a screen name, that's not your true name, and the conversation gets going. And I saw this in the first criminal indictment in Manhattan, where they started threatening the prosecutor, the Manhattan DA, where they started threatening the judge. But beyond that, the gasoline on the fire is when you have Donald Trump, a former president of the United States, making vivid, vitriolic personal attacks on prosecutors, on judges, calling them names that adds gasoline to the fire in these chat rooms and people feel they're being called on. The problem is for authorities is sorting out the noise from who the real player is going to be who might show up and do something. I mean, you look at the Nancy Pelosi case where an individual showed up at her home in San Francisco, a home invasion, assaulted her husband, someone who was not on the radar screen and comes out of the woodwork.
