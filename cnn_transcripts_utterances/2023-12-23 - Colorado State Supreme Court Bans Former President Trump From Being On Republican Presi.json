And I think there's going to be a big push not just on hiking taxes on enormous endowments, but also looking at administrator student ratios. Harvard, for example, has as many administrators on staff as it does undergraduate students.

And it is wonderful. It is exuberant and joyful. There has been some controversy about it from some of your former colleagues included, but a number of rightwing media personalities because they think it's too woke and anti- American, or something. I would point out the original nutcracker was Russian. Whatever. I think it's lovely. It's so charming, and everyone should go watch it.",
