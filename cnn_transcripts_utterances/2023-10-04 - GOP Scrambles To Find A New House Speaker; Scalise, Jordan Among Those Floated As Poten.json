I mean, more to the point, who would want the job? Now, this is Washington so there are several people who do. Steve Scalise, the number-two Republican in House leadership, has already started reaching out to members. One told CNN he's getting good support already. Scalise is battling blood cancer but he told reporters he's up to the job. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's ask our distinguished panelists Rina Shah, Maria Cardona, and Matt Mowers. And joining us here outside the Capitol is Akayla Gardner, the White House correspondent for Bloomberg News. I'm very grateful to all of you for being here. Rina, let me start with you. For our viewers who maybe aren't familiar with your background, you worked here as a Republican inside the House leadership. You know these men well. House Speaker Boehner who, of course, resigned in the face of a mutiny from these folks -- just didn't want to deal with it. Paul Ryan ultimately left as well. Kevin McCarthy now thrown out by them.

And I want to push back on that because you have to be somebody that understands compromise. Somebody that's willing to reach across the aisle.And that's one thing that I've seen in the aftermath of Hakeem Jeffries taking the leadership post for Democrats -- do really well for the Democrats. That's really served them well. Hakeem Jeffries looks like a steady hand at the wheel. He's been able to unify his caucus in a way that I did not see coming. And so, the Republicans really need that. And when you look at the choices, like Scalise and Jordan, you don't see moderates, right? But you do see people that could have wide appeal. And I think Scalise far more than Jordan because Jordan really represents what could be considered the fringe of the party. And we've seen the empirical evidence that shows that MAGA is a faction of today's Republican Party is dwindling in influence.

They said they didn't want to -- or in the president's words, he didn't want to have a vote in the matter. He said that this weekend. But whoever it is, like you mentioned, they need to work with him. And that is something that Biden was able to do with McCarthy. They were able to reach this debt limit deal. They were also able to reach this deal to avert a government shutdown, obviously, this week. Whoever it is, they want that person to be able to build coalitions. That is huge for President Biden.

I do think behind the scenes, although they're not showing publicly that they're necessarily gleeful or happy about this oust of Kevin McCarthy, but one of Biden's biggest pitches to America is this threat to democracy. And what better example than a vacant speakership for them to illustrate that?And I think Democrats have really enjoyed over the last years showing this unification against this backdrop of really deep divisions in the Republican Party. He has been talking about that for months. We just saw him do a big speech on democracy in Arizona. So for him, this is just a way to illustrate that point and really drive that home for voters who care about democracy.",

And that's now how this thing ought to be done.So I think, again, you've got to look back at the trust issues within this caucus. You've got to look at what the caucus really wants to talk about.

So we are dealing with a lot of people who don't believe in real democracy, to Akayla's point. But for these eight that ousted McCarthy, they are completely against any kind of compromise.

He has divided this party for cycle after cycle since 2018 because of people who are extremely loyal to him and more moderate members. The White House is definitely exploiting that.
