I'm Paula Newton.Ahead here on CNN Newsroom, we are a day away from Iowa's high-stakes Republican caucuses. And as one candidate closes in on frontrunner Donald Trump, dangerous temperatures threaten to derail their momentum. Thousands take to the streets in Tel Aviv marking 100 days of war with Hamas calling for the release of hostages. We'll look at where things stand in a live report. And as Russia ramps up attacks on Ukraine, the U.S. explores how to send billions of dollars in seized Russian assets to the war-ravaged nation. It is the final countdown to Monday's Iowa Republican caucuses, the first nominating contest of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. And a new poll shows Donald Trump holding a commanding lead. A De Moines Register/NBC News media com poll of likely GOP caucus-goers shows Trump support at an incredible 48 percent. Nikki Haley trails with 20 percent followed by Ron DeSantis at 16 percent. But Haley and DeSantis are still, of course, right now working to build momentum. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They have seen the polls that show that Donald Trump is up by a 30- point margin. And talking to senior advisers, they don't believe the margins are that big. So, they want to set the expectation.Now, they continue to say that anything over 12 points would still be a historic win. And you have to remember that they are not looking to just win. They are looking to set momentum going to into New Hampshire and really offset any momentum of his GOP rivals, particularly Nikki Haley. And it was clear that Haley was still on the mind of Donald Trump during a tele-rally event. Take a listen to what he said.

They are spending $4.5 billion between the campaign and super PAC advertising against Haley already on immigration. Again, the big point here is to try to get a win that is large enough to set the momentum and offset anything that she has going into New Hampshire. The other complication here, they worry that those big poll numbers will keep people turning out who might just say, oh, look, Donald Trump, he already has enough support anyway.

And certainly some of the people we spoke to there at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, in the center of Tel Aviv, saying that this should be the number one priority. Bringing the hostages home should be the number one priority and should be done whatever the cost, even if it means stopping fighting and not destroying Hamas militarily. And I suppose it's understandable that with their loved ones, 100 days, probably deep inside Hamas' tunnel network, we've heard from the hostages that have been released, eyewitness testimony to the lack of food, the lack of medication, female hostages being sexually abused as well. So -- the perspective that they have. And if you actually look at the data, opinion polls, there was one put out by the Israel Democracy Institute published on January the 2nd, just over half of Israelis think that the intensive fighting should continue and that it should be left to the IDF to rescue those hostages, whereas about a quarter think that all Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails should be free in exchange for those hostages, even if it means an end to the fighting. From the government's perspective, and Prime Minister Netanyahu has been consistent in this, he has said that it is the military pressure itself which will ultimately lead to the release of those hostages or push Hamas to come back to the negotiating table to get another truce, which, of course, we saw for a week, ending on November the 1st. And there have been comments and talks about maybe talks happening, which happened around about the New Year, but they don't seem to be going anywhere right now. And so we are in this situation where 100 days on, there's no sign of the war ending and no sign of those hostages being released. And it's worth also noting, Paula, that in that 100 days of conflict, Israel has only succeeded in rescuing one hostage, a female soldier. It's tried numerous times to free other hostages. It has failed to do so. So, it does seem that the truce is likely to be the only way to get those hostages back, but as I say, no sign of that coming to fruition anytime soon.",

It certainly has resources, first of all, militarily. We've seen these exercises, these drills before in the waters over the Taiwan Strait. That's something that certainly China could exercise. It also has some tools along diplomatic and economic realms. But China also has to face a question.

No injuries were reported. Ukraine's Air Force says it destroyed eight missiles, but Russia claims it achieved its goal by hitting military industrial facilities.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that the country still lacks comprehensive air defenses. Mr. Zelenskyy says he discussed Ukraine's defense needs while meeting with the new French foreign minister on Saturday. They also talked about joint production of weapons and strengthening air defenses. It was Stephane Sejourne's first trip to Kyiv since he was appointed. He promised that France will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes and will also push other European countries for more support. Now, top U.S. officials are trying to figure out how to divert about $300 billion in frozen Russian money to cash-starved Ukraine. They say Russia should be on the hook and pay for all of the damage that it's caused. The funds are assets of the Russian Central Bank locked away in the west since Moscow invaded. To unlock that cash, U.S. allies in the G-7 need to buy in, all of them, and a bill in the U.S. Congress called the Repo Act would have to be adopted. The U.S. says the proposal has been discussed among senior G-7 leaders and will be reviewed again at their meeting in February. Joining me now is Nate Sibley.

It started this war. It has a responsibility to pay for this stuff. In terms of the actual seizure of those assets by western governments, though, they will likely rely on something called the principle of countermeasures, which is that a third party can take temporary and proportionate measures to compel another state to comply with its legal obligations. It's very wordy jargon. But under that justification, governments, including the U.S. and across the E.U., would then look to move from freezing assets, which is what sanctions does, it simply means they can't be accessed or moved. It doesn't actually change their legal ownership. They would move from freezing assets to seizing assets so that they would be seized. Their legal ownership would transfer to the government that was seizing them. From where I'm sitting, that would be the United States government. And they would then be transferred for use for supporting Ukraine. All countries have very different approaches and systems to be able to do this. Some are more developed. The U.S., for example, honed its ability to seize assets through the war on drugs, the war on terror, where it went after criminal adversaries' assets very aggressively. Many European countries don't have anything in the way of this, so they're having to -- much as they did when sanctions rolled in after Putin invaded Ukraine, they had to create new sanctions regimes overnight.

The first is that Russia would retaliate, as it has said it will do, by seizing western companies' assets. It's actually already done that. There was a presidential decree last April, I think it was, that empowered Putin to seize western companies from countries that were perceived to now be hostile to Russia, and he has already exercised that power. So, it is Russia that has set the precedent of seizing other countries' assets.The other consideration there is that these western companies that are inside Russia, they've been there for a long time. They know the nature of the regime. They bear some responsibility for their continued presence there and any loss of profit. And, again, you have to balance those considerations against the risks of doing nothing. And I don't think we talk enough about the risks of doing nothing. We're in a new era now. And if we want to avoid resorting to open warfare with regimes that want to see our way of life come to an end, we need new tools to degrade their abilities and hold them accountable. So, I think seizing Russia's assets, viewed through that lens, is not only proportionate, it's absolutely necessary.
