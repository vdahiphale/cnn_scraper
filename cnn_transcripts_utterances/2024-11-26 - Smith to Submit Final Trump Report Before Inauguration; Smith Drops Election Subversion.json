But that's correct in the same sense that the New York Jets technically could make it to the Super Bowl this year. They're not mathematically eliminated.That's not going to happen for a lot of reasons. First of all, four years from now is an eternity. Whoever the next president is in 2029, next attorney general is going to have no appetite for bringing this case back. And you're right, Jim, there are moves Donald Trump's DOJ can make. They can go back to the court and say, OK, we want to switch this from without prejudice to with prejudice, meaning that it cannot be brought back. Who knows? Donald Trump may try to issue himself apart and something we've never seen before. So, I wouldn't hold out any expectation that this case ever gets charged in 2029.",

How much of this comes down to Attorney General Merrick Garland whether he simply waited too long to select a special counsel to investigate Trump?I mean, we are looking at -- we are now looking at the prospect of a president-elect who tried to overturn the election results in 2020. There are allegations of criminal behavior, and it's just all going to go away. And I think there are just a great number of Americans who are just astounded by that.",

Merrick Garland becomes A.G. in March of 2021, a month and a half after the Biden administration comes into office, and he doesn't name Jack Smith as special counsel until November of 2022. He lets almost two full years go by between -- before he even names Jack Smith as special counsel. All told, it takes DOJ over two and a half years to charge these cases, until the summer of 2023. There's just no way that you're going to go from an indictment in the summer of 2023 to a trial before November of 2024 in a year and change.And I said it to you, Jim, at the time when you were doing weekends and I was on with you, I was saying, it's already too late. He's already let too much time go by, if the goal was to try these cases before the 2024 election. And here we are. And look, I think I fully understand why people feel this way. These charges were very serious. As Jack Smith made a point of noting in his papers yesterday. This has nothing to do with the strength or the merits of the case, this is all because the clock ran out and because DOJ policy does not permit the prosecution of the sitting president.",

That one had been dismissed by the judge, Judge Cannon, federal judge down in Florida, who found that the entire special counsel regime was unconstitutional on its face. And interestingly, I would have loved to see how this played out, because Jack Smith was in the process of appealing that and it was before the 11th Circuit. I actually think the 11th Circuit probably would have reversed and reinstated that case.But alas, Jack Smith understands that he can't follow through on either of these prosecutions and he moved yesterday to dismiss both of them.

So, it seems -- it strikes me that the prime minister wants to make sure, as Nic suggested, that at least he has a bloc of support among his own Likud members.There may be an outstanding issue or two over the U.S. side letter of assurances or maybe over the monitoring committee. The Israelis had objected to French participation because of Macron's comments on the ICC arrest warrants for the prime minister. But I suspect, whether it's today or tomorrow, that there's enough urgency in the part of Israel and Hezbollah and enough push from the Biden administration that you probably will see the security cabinet at some point say yes in principle.",

I don't think this is a -- I think it's significant if, in fact, it's -- it is agreed to and it endures. But remember, it's a 60-day clock here, and in that 60-day period you're going to see the Lebanese Armed Forces deployed, beefed up presence from UNIFIL, Israel's withdrawal. There are a lot of vulnerabilities in that 60-day clock.And I think one of the irony of ironies is that 60 days, if in fact the agreement was reached today or tomorrow, that puts you after January 20. So, it may well be that if things don't go well, that this agreement should it be concluded, you know, could easily crater on the, you know, president-elect's watch as well. So, important to keep your eye on, but remember, transactional arrangement, Jim, not transformation. Hezbollah's not going away. They're still north of Litani.

And one of the claims they looked into was Epshteyn allegedly trying to get Scott Bessent, who was Donald Trump's pick for treasury secretary, before he was picked, to pay Epshteyn to essentially, you know, promote his name with Donald Trump, promote his name around Mar-a-Lago. Bessent refused to pay. This led to a confrontation between the two men, Bessent and Epshteyn, last week at Mar-a-Lago. Things got a little bit heated. But look, the attorneys are looking into several similar allegations and their conclusion was that Epshteyn should be removed from Donald Trump's orbit, that he should not be paid by Trump or his entities because his behavior is problematic. Of course, we asked Boris Epshteyn about these allegations, and he said these fake claims are false and defamatory and will not distract us from making America great again. So, he's denying it.",

One of the problems here, Jim, is that there really is no transition here in any meaningful sense of the word. I mean, there's -- Trump is flying around on Trump Force One with Don Jr. and Epshteyn and Elon Musk and essentially spit balling all of these appointments. I think there's this sort of mythology out there that Trump having served one term before and having done all this planning through Project '25 and everything else that he's going to be able to somehow hit the ground running. I don't see any evidence that's the case. And as you know, they haven't even signed a memorandum of understanding to start this transition. Briefings aren't happening.

I think everybody feels that she speaks for him. But there's a big difference between campaigning and governing.And when the president goes rogue on the campaign trail, he may say outrageous things and lose some votes. When he goes rogue in the Oval Office, and it'll be Susie Wiles's job to try to prevent that lives are lost.
