Well, look, I think we should level set a little bit, which is to say, if you look at the scope of polling that's come out since the debate, the bottom has actually not fallen out from under Joe Biden. I would not argue the status quo is great for him either. I mean, you see him consistently within one or two points in swing states that he needs to win.So, you know, I'm not arguing that the landscape looks terrific for him right now, but it is also true that the bottom has not fallen out since the debate. So I think that should be the point of discussion. You know, that should be where we start this discussion in part because swapping out the nominee is not a light task. It is not something that would be easy. You know, the person who takes that mantle is then going to be in the, you know, in the firing line and is going to see their numbers start to drop as they necessarily become the focus. So I think we should disabuse ourselves of the idea that there is like a magic fix here. You know, that being said, I think the conversations that are happening right now reflect genuine concern. They reflect a respect for the president, respect for what Joe Biden's accomplished, and the fact that nobody wants to see him struggle and or see him diminished. You know, I think what Democrats are doing is looking at how can we get to a place where we can best defeat Donald Trump, who we believe represents an existential threat to our country and to our democracy. And I think the thing that -- the task that Biden has now is he has got to be out there aggressively trying to assuage these concerns. People need to see him. They need to see him being his best self. I believe he's capable of that, but I do think he needs to be out there doing it. And he needs to be bringing the narrative back to Trump. He's the focus. He's got to move the focus off of him. Get it back to Trump. The fact that you have somebody who's been convicted of 34 felonies, who's running for President of the United States, somebody who has stated that he will not accept the results of this election, that's where the conversation needs to be, because that's the real threat here.",

And the way I think of it is imagine going 60 miles per hour down the highway, then immediately shifting in neutral. It's jarring.There's a human side of this I think we often undercut. And when a lot of candidates who live in a bubble to say nothing of the president states, just candidates running for president or office live in such a bubble. When that bubble is rapidly pierce, it is jarring and it takes time for them to kind of sort out. And I think this being said yesterday, when we look back on this, when all is said and done, no matter what, yesterday was such a pivot point. There was a window, a four or five day window where, as Alex is right, it could have been -- could have went on TV, news conference, some new visual to say nothing of the fact reaching out to Pelosi, Clyburn, Schumer, Jeffries, which I'm shocked that didn't happen.

I think that the first four or five days after the debate, I do think there have been missed opportunities. I do. I think the fact that we are still essentially solely focused on this now, what, six days after the debate, that's not great for Biden, and he has had opportunities to come out and try to change the narrative and reassure people who are concerned.But also to the point I was making earlier, I think even more critically push the narrative back to Trump. I mean, that's the other, you know, the overarching message objective of this campaign is to make this a referendum on the guy who was I would argue a disastrous president for four years and remind people of what the stakes are here. So the fact that that has not happened more aggressively I think is also what is driving concern. It's less about the state of the race, although, yes, there is absolutely concern about that amongst Democrats, because, you know, again, if you look at the swing state polling, you know, you have to have eyes, right? But I do think that the fact that there has not been a more aggressive push over the last few days is also what is turning people up. The one thing I will say, though, is that that means if the president does engage, get out there, if people feel like they see him and can say, OK, you know what? That wasn't a great night, but it was one night. And now I've seen him out there. I think he has the opportunity to change the narrative, but I think he's got to do it.",

And all those three things have led a lot of the Biden team to be like, we can't let her be the nominee, because if we step aside, she's almost likely to be the nominee. And she can't do it, or she's not ready. I am -- I believe it was Chris Whipple's book that said -- that quoted Joe Biden as saying that she's not quite ready for prime time or something along those lines.
