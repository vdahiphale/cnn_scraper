Quote, some - the people that were, quote, \"really out of control\" he may not actually give pardons to. But he is anticipating that he will swiftly move to pardon those who were non-violent on that day.And then he also spoke and was asked about vaccinations because he has Robert F. Kennedy Jr. now joining his administration and whether or not he believes Robert F. Kennedy should go through with some of his proposals on eliminating vaccines. And he was asked, \"if RFK Jr. moves to end childhood vaccination programs, would you sign off on that?\" And here's what Trump said. He said, \"we're going to have a big discussion.

Federal prosecutors say Tal and Oren Alexander ran a sex trafficking scheme, along with their brother, Alon, that goes back more than 20 years to when they were in high school. According to court filings, the brothers would plot assault well in advance, allegedly working with party promoters to find victims and pooling their resources to pay for the women's travel expenses. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAMIAN WILLIAMS, U.S. ATTORNEY: The Alexander brothers' sex trafficking agreement went beyond the planned trips and events. On numerous occasions, one or more of the defendants drugged and raped or sexually assaulted women they encountered by chance at bars, at nightclubs, social events and dating apps. These assaults allegedly had many of the same hallmarks as the rapes that occurred at group events, isolated locations, drugged victims, force and physical restraint. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It appears that women have been making reports about sexual assault and clearly making allegations in civil suits involving these brothers. We don't know what has transpired with respect to the investigation. Maybe women weren't comfortable coming forward talking to law enforcement. We know that historically it's been very difficult for women to make these kinds of allegations against high profile, wealthy men, like these three brothers.But the good news in this case is that there is accountability, finally, because there are allegations, Sara, that they were bragging about running, quote/unquote, a train against women, even in their high school yearbook.

And the real estate company, Douglas Elliman, acknowledged, per the report, that an incident had been raised casually and confidentially to a chief executive, without specifying who may have been involved. But rather than - in the form of an official HR complaint, a company spokesman went on to say this, quote, that they had any such - \"had any such complaints been received, those complaints would have been thoroughly investigated.\"What do you glean from the statement from the company that they once worked at, where there was something that was said to a CEO, but there was no official complaint with HR?",

Obviously, this has the potential of involving lots of individuals, including perhaps executives at that company, if not in terms of criminal charges, civil charges. Because if someone is working for you and there's a complaint about their conduct, sexual misconduct, there could be liability, civil liability on the part of supervisors, executives and owners of this company. So, clearly, anyone involved with these brothers at this point, we should expect to see them trying to shield themselves from civil liability, as well as the potential of criminal accountability. SIDNERwritten out, and, you know, have it remind you of another case that's been going on where you're talking about lavish parties, where they're accused of - of drugging their alleged victims, raping them.

And I mean - what I mean by season is the season to come forward, to demonstrate bravery and courage to make these claims, to be heard, to be believed.I remember just a decade ago, when women would make claims like this against powerful men, whether it was a powerful record executive like Sean Combs or, in this case, real estate executives, it was very difficult. Oftentimes the women would be maligned. They would be, you know, not believed and oftentimes prosecutors were reluctant to file charges against powerful men. Since the Me Too movement, we've seen a seismic shift in the way these cases are treated. We've seen more women willing to come forward to tell their stories. And we've seen more prosecutors willing to prosecute these cases. And we've seen convictions. So, we've actually seen these cases tried in courts and convictions obtained by prosecutors. So, I'm encouraged by this as a civil rights lawyer, as someone who's done this work for decades, to see this moment where victims are being believed and where they are able to hold predators accountable, even if those predators are rich, if they're famous, and if they are typically thought of as being untouchable.",
