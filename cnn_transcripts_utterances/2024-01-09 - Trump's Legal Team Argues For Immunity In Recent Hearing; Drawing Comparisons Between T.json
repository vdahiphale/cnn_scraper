He could just say, forget it. Calling off the election.There's been too much fraud. You know, the entire Republican Party is a national security threat. I'm imprisoning and executing every Republican official. And so long as there's no one to impeach and convict them, he's immune from prosecution.

The thing that I think most lawyers would see with that list is these are things that were clearly done in that president's official duties and their official capacity. These are the kinds of decisions that immunity and protections were designed to insulate presidents from future prosecution. The difference here is we're talking about allegations about subverting an election. That, the special counsel would argue, and most legal experts, that's not part of your official job as president. And that is the difference. That is why this doesn't open a Pandora's box. In fact, one of the special counsel's lawyers specifically said this. They said, look, this isn't going to create a tit-for-tat vindictive streak of prosecutions against political rivals because the reason charges were brought here is because this was unprecedented conduct. The allegation that he was trying to subvert an election. He said that is unprecedented and why there are charges here, but they're not worried about charges being brought for everything.

The parallels are that both are presidents who tried to invoke immunity for actions that they took while they were in the White House, but these were different types of immunity that they tried to invoke. In 1974, Richard Nixon tried to invoke what's known as limited presidential immunity over judicial orders when he tried to avoid handing over his secret White House tapes to the special counsel investigating the Watergate scandal.But even then, the Supreme Court swept his arguments aside and said that he had to hand over the tapes. He did hand over the tapes, and soon after that, he was implicated in the Watergate cover-up and he had to resign. But it's important to point out that Richard Nixon did not try to invoke immunity over being criminally prosecuted. He was doing it over judicial orders. It was a very limited immunity, and that's according to legal experts and historians who we spoke to on this issue. Now, Boris referenced Nixon's comment. That was three years after he left the presidency in 1977 when Richard Nixon did those iconic interviews with British journalist David Frost when he seemed to imply that he was above the law at that time. Here's a clip of an exchange between Nixon and Frost in 1977. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He said that Nixon at the time was referring to just a narrow band of national security and domestic security operations, which for a period of time in the United States could be done by a president and not be illegal.But Naftali points out that later on after that, the courts and Congress swept away that type of immunity. And also, he points out that Nixon was not referring to absolute immunity. Again, he was referring to the type of immunity that was in the United States. He was referring to immunity on judicial orders there when he tried to invoke that immunity in the first place.

Well, if you know anything about New Hampshire, if you know anything about northern New England politics, you know that moderates play a key role up there. And what do we see? We see Nikki Haley crushing with moderates. Look at that, getting 55 percent of the vote. Chris Christie in a distance, second place at just 26 percent among conservatives, who, of course, make up the bulk of Republican voters nationwide. She is in a distant second place, 40 points behind Donald Trump.But the fact is, moderates make up a much larger share of the New Hampshire electorate than they do nationally or in Iowa, where, of course, Nikki Haley is also struggling. Now, here's the question. Could she, in fact, continue to close that gap? I want to give you an idea of why I think that she could. If you ask these voters, the supporters of these voters, are they definitely decided? What do we see? We see Donald Trump's voters are very much in his camp. Look, 80 percent of them said they've definitely decided on their vote. Now, Nikki Haley has weaker support at 54 percent. So, you might say, OK, Haley could fall down as well. That's true. But you could also pick up support from the other candidates. Look at that. 45 percent of voters who say they're supporting someone not named Donald Trump or Nikki Haley say they're definitely decided on their vote. So, there is that chunk of voters. And I'm specifically looking at the Chris Christie supporters. Who at this particular point are overwhelmingly saying that Nikki Haley is their second choice. They could flow over to Nikki Haley. So, at this point, it's a seven-point margin, but it's closing. And it wouldn't shock me, Boris and Brianna, if that gap closes even further. But we'll just have to wait and see.
