What this means for tensions in the region. Plus, an unlikely household item is causing a commotion in Russia as President Putin registers his candidacy for the 2024 election. And the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs are set to meet again in their second Super Bowl rematch in just four years. We will take you live to Detroit for more. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching \"One World\". \"We shall respond.\" Those are the words coming from U.S. President Joe Biden after a drone attack took the lives of three U.S. soldiers and injured dozens more. It happened at an outpost in Jordan near the border with Syria on Sunday. The U.S. has blamed Iran-backed militant groups in the region. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, SPOKESMAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: We don't seek a war with Iran. We're not looking for a wider conflict in the Middle East. In fact, every action the President has taken has been designed to de- escalate, to try to bring the tensions down. And obviously, this attack, very, very serious, certainly escalatory on the behalf of these militia groups. We have to take that seriously and we will. But I'm not going to get ahead of the President's decision space one way or the other. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All of that is being evaluated by the chain of command. But it's also somewhat irrelevant because the point is this is a policy coming from Iran that the United States has to respond to. We've responded by saying we don't want escalation. We've responded with minimum retaliation. We're trying in Yemen to prevent each individual strike on a ship. Okay, but enough's enough.

You want a disproportionate escalation to cap this off. It's -- Aaron says it exactly right. The Iranians are willing to tolerate a certain degree of risk, but not too much risk because they want their nuclear program. And they're also sitting on a hot -- seething hotbed of resentment from their own populace. So, their control of Iran is maintained essentially by repression and force. So, a lot of Iranians, they're looking to see a strong U.S. response as a signal that the West understands the repressive nature of the Iranian regime and would support an effort to overturn that regime. And that's just as clear and simple as it can be. I talk to Iranians and they tell me every day -- so, this is the Biden administration has sort of been complicit with the Iranians.

And we, particularly in an election year, it seems to me, we're going to be, at least the administration is going to be much more risk-averse than it is risk-ready. Because what Hamas has demonstrated, sadly and tragically, I mean, it's profoundly disturbing that the asymmetry of power is a -- extremely useful tool. The information war, which Hamas frankly, I'm sorry to say, seems to be winning, creates major problems for powers that have a mastery and a domination of force. The Israelis are now operating in Gaza. In February 7th will be the fifth month of the war. Yes, they've dealt Hamas a grave blow and degraded it, but they have failed to kill its senior leadership and or redeem the hostages. I'm afraid, Bianna, General Clark has a lot of experience in this area, that we're like, in some respects, Gulliver, wandering around in a part of the world that in many respects we don't understand, tied up by adversaries and even some of our partners, Saudi Arabia in particular, I might add, whose interests, they're not coincidentally across the board our own. We're going to have to find a way to manage and cope. But I would turn to one basic point. We have this strategic problem with Iran, a punitive nuclear weapon state that uses its proxies.

CNN's Gloria Pazmino has the story.

Robinson Bata says he shares this pot of rice with fellow migrants on the island, home to one of New York City's sprawling tent facilities built with capacity to house 3000 men and women. Robinson, 31 years old, is from Colombia. Just one of the more than 170,000 migrants who have arrived here New York City since the spring of last year. More than 68,000 of them are still in the care of the city and space is running out. For now, Robinson counts himself among the lucky ones. He says he's at a shelter in the Bronx that's safe, a hotel where there are cameras and security. But it's different here on Randall's Island. The massive facility has security but no metal detectors. Two weeks ago, a 24- year-old man was stabbed in the neck during a fight that resulted in 18 arrests, according to police. And earlier this month, a man was stabbed and killed after a fight broke out inside the tent cafeteria.",

I just feel so heartbroken for this city's Lions fans that have waited theirentire lives for this moment and they're going to have to wait a little while longer. That watch party you mentioned there at Ford Field here in Motor City was full throttle. Fans hiked up, operated on all cylinders as the Lions leaped out to a huge lead, 24 to seven at halftime. But then it was like someone ripped their magic carpet right out from under them, Bianna. The 49ers overcoming the largest half-time deficit in conference championship history. They scored 27 unanswered points in the second half, led by Christian McCaffrey and Brock Purdy, the so-called \"Mr. Irrelevant\", the last player taken two drafts ago. They rallied from 17 points down. They won 34 to 31 back in the Super Bowl with a chance at a record-tying sixth Super Bowl title. The Lions fans, after the game, they couldn't believe what they'd just seen, and they told us afterwards about how they were feeling after this historic collapse. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
