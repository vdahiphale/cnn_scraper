But remember, it's been down all day. This is a sort of a sentiment, if you will, that goes back to events earlier in the week. The market is down, we are here and the events of the day that we are following. The global selloff continues, and this is because investors are bracing for a difficult interest rate high year ahead. Twitter has suspended prominent tech journalists and the move has sparked international backlash. And on this program tonight, not only the General Manager, the Managing Director here at the Plaza. But we're going to build a bear with the Chief Executive of Build-a-Bear on its sales and the Holiday season. We are live at The Plaza in New York. It's Friday, it's December the 16th. I'm Richard Quest and yes, at the Plaza, I mean business. Good evening. We've been out and about all through the year and we decided that with this being my last program before Christmas, where better than the Plaza Hotel, who kindly allowed me to interlope and take over parts of the lobby. It is one of the most famous hotels, of course, in the world. It is at the corner of two important landmarks, Fifth Avenue and Central Park, and you'll hear more about that as the program moves on as we look to the iconic Holiday season. Unfortunately, whatever the welcome and the warmth here, the markets are not nearly so pretty. The stock slide that we talked about yesterday is continuing today. The Dow is off more than one percent. The reason is really simple. Rates are going higher, economies are slowing, recessions are more likely. I've summed it up in a nutshell. You can see Goldman Sachs says that it is going to -- it is down 1.3 percent. It is reporting a perhaps workforce cut of eight percent. Look at the triple sack, all the indices are down. Interestingly, they're pretty much all the same. We're not seeing a tech heavy selloff, but we've also got options expiring, not triple, but $2.6 trillion worth tonight that creates volatility. Europe is very similar. It just misery, basically, as everybody saw what was happening in Europe, and you'll see that the FTSE is down one-and-a- quarter percent, the worst of the markets. Matt Egan in New York. And Matt, we know the reasons why. I guess there is an element of the sort of the settling in for the long, hard slog.",

But you know, that statement was unchanged, even though inflation has cooled off substantially in recent months. The Fed press conference was interpreted as pretty tough sounding, and then we had these weaker than expected economic reports -- manufacturing, retail sales -- all of them suggesting that this real economy is showing some real weakness that cracks are forming, and so put that together and you do have a situation where markets are pricing in a greater risk of a recession. But Richard, I would note that you know, some of the investors I'm talking to they think that this selloff, may be getting out of hand. I talked to Art Hogan, the veteran market strategist and he said that he thinks it is just too early to be sounding the recession alarm and he thinks that the market could end up bouncing back next week.",

And so to COVID and China. Well, now China is canceling vacation for health workers, for the very simple reason that since they've started to open up the country, the number of COVID cases has gone through the roof and we don't really know exactly how many. The resurgence of COVID was arguably inevitable once restrictions had been taken off. There isn't the same level of vaccination. The vaccine that's being used is not as efficacious. But as Selina Wang now reports from Beijing, it is creating a monumental problem in China. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Propaganda has taken a complete U-turn from declaring an all-out people's war on COVID to suddenly now telling people your health is in your own hands. There is a lot of state media headlines like this. In \"The People's Daily,\" the headline reads: \"Start by wearing a mask and be the first person responsible for your own health.\" In Xinhua, the headline reads: \"In the fight against the epidemic, everyone is the first person responsible for their own health.\" Other articles are praising the last three years of Zero COVID and hailing this pivot as an achievement, including this commentary from \"The People's Daily\" that has gone viral. The key lines are: \"The virus has weakened, but we have become stronger. Chairman Xi's insightful judgment, scientific and firm decisions shows his reliability as a people's leader. It pointed out and provided crucial guidance for us to win this people's battle, total battle, and precise battle against COVID.\" A lot of people online, they are furious over that article. Some are calling it a lie that completely ignores the devastating impact of zero COVID over the last three years, the trauma and pain that people faced during lockdowns. No apology or no admitting that the government has ever made a mistake. State media has instead focused on how the government is responding. The government said it will train volunteers and retired health workers to boost manpower. The government is increasing the number of fever clinics. This social media video shows people waiting inside a Beijing stadium that's been converted into a makeshift fever clinic. You can see some lines forming and people waiting on benches. We're already seeing hospitals under strain here in the capital, but the really big concern is what happens when people go back home for the upcoming Chinese New Year and COVID starts to spread more rapidly in the rural parts of China with weaker health infrastructure.

It's also multiple regional airports that have been shut down and it's not hard to figure out why. A group of protesters tried to violently take the airport in the city of Ayacucho. On Thursday, they clashed with police and at least seven people died according to authorities. The death toll as you mentioned before now stands at 20 after more than a week of violent protest. Authorities there are at least 40 injured but the figure has been steadily increasing in spite of the fact that a state of emergency was declared Wednesday. And now eight regions are under curfew.
