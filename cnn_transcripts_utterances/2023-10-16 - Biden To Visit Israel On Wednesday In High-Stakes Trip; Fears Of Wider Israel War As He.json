There are now more concerns, however, including Hezbollah, the Islamist militant group, also deemed a terrorist organization by the U.S., it's far more deadly and powerful men Hamas, potentially, they're attempting to infiltrate from Lebanon, in the north. Meanwhile in Syria, Israel has struck Hamas- friendly targets there. And Iran, which backs and funds Hamas, is warning that a wider conflict may be inevitable if Israel continues its retaliatory strikes.Now, the urgent questions tonight, would a multi-front assault on Israel force the United States to get even more involved? Would Iran follow through on its threat? And what happens to the fate of the dozens of hostages, and, of course, the millions of civilians who are caught in this crossfire? Joining me now is CNN's Anderson Cooper, who is on the ground in Tel Aviv. Anderson, the news tonight that President Biden will visit Israel this week, what does that mean for both the U.S. and Israel, and how is that being received over there?",

His mother says that he was stationed at a base in Zakeem, which is in southern Israel, not far from Gaza, when the attacks began. Yanai and his colleagues sheltered new recruits and then moved to the front lines. Defending their base, Yanai and five officers were killed, but they did save more than 90 others and succeeded in stopping Hamas militants from attacking a nearby kibbutz. Yanai's mother, Elana Kaminka, joins me tonight. Elana, thank you so much for joining me, and I have to offer my condolences to you for the loss of your son.

Is it wise for Israel to go in and then find itself in an occupying situation there? Look, I think that's always hard. And I think they have to make the decision about How much damage can they inflict to the terrorists in Gaza without having to own, occupying, and running Gaza? And that's going to be a military decision and an intelligence decision that the Israeli government should make. I think President Biden is wise to say, be careful about the idea of occupying Gaza City because getting in is much easier than getting out. But the Israelis need to decide for themselves about how they can eliminate the terrorist threat to their country and their people. And they got to make that call.
