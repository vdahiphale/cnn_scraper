It's Tuesday, September 10th, 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in Philadelphia where Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will meet face to face for the first time later today when the two take to the debate stage in what has the potential to be an election-defining moment.The Democratic presidential nominee arrived in Philadelphia on the eve of the debate after days of preparation for the high-stakes showdown. Sources say the Harris campaign has been preparing her for possible insults and name-calling from Trump, while Trump's team is previewing attack lines and even claiming that Harris has really been the one in charge of the country, not Biden. The debate will take place in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, which the candidates are hoping to sway voters who are still undecided. Harris and Trump have both been talking about what they expect to come from the confrontation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He plays with this really old and tired playbook, right, where he, there's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go, and we should be prepared for that. He tends to fight for himself, not for the American people, and I think that's going to come out during the course of the debate. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Oh, they're waiting for the debate. You know, if I destroy her in the debate, they'll say, Trump suffered a humiliating defeat tonight, no matter what. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Look, for Harris, this is a really pivotal moment in the campaign.She is still new to the campaign trail, really only taking over the reins of the Democratic Party a couple of weeks ago. She has to introduce herself to a broad swath of the American people. She got that homecoming for Democrats at the Democratic National Convention last month. But those are partisan affairs. The debate will be her first, best, and potentially last opportunity to speak to upwards of 60, 70, 80 million voters who are undecided, who are more moderate, who are less partisan than the DNC audience, and set the terms of that introduction for herself rather than letting Trump define her instead. For the former president, he's got to show that he's still up to the task. He has had a rough couple of weeks since Joe Biden dropped out and Kamala Harris replaced him at the top of the ticket. He's got to show that he can still control the narrative. This has been the longest stretch of the campaign pretty much since he came down that escalator in 2015, where he has not been the center of attention. And that's an uncomfortable place for him. So look for him to try and seize the spotlight back tonight in Pennsylvania.",

President Biden was unable to prosecute any sort of case against Trump, even when he was handed layups, easy opportunities to state attack lines against Trump to bring up issues like abortion. He just wasn't able to direct the attention in the way that I think a lot of his party wanted him to do.So by virtue of simply being 20 years younger, I think Harris is going to have an easier time than Biden did, despite the fact that those mics will be off when they're not supposed to be speaking. But the other thing I think is that these debates can be very free- flowing. And regardless of whether the mics are off or not, I think both candidates are not going to feel like they have to rein themselves in if they get frustrated or they want to make their case to the American people.

A desperate search for survivors is underway, but Gaza civil defense says crews are facing great difficulty in retrieving victims due to the lack of resources. Israel says it was striking Hamas terrorists operating a command center embedded in the humanitarian zone, and it took steps to prevent harm to civilians. But a Gaza civil defense spokesperson says there was no advance warning of the strike. Hamas denies its fighters were present in the area. For more, let's go to CNN's Paula Hancocks, who's tracking developments. And Paula, it's very difficult to verify Israel's claim that it took steps to prevent harm to civilians.

Some 97 percent of its population identifies as Catholic. That is the highest proportion outside of Vatican City. And as you can see, these live images on your screen, they are out en masse in East Timor to celebrate the Pope and his message. Earlier this morning in East Timor, Pope Francis visited children with disabilities. He also met with religious leaders in the country. And when he arrived at the cathedral for that meeting earlier in the day, he was greeted by throngs of well-wishers who filled the streets and chanted, Long live Pope Francis. Now, East Timor has very deep ties to the church, which has been influential in its brutal struggle and fight for independence.
