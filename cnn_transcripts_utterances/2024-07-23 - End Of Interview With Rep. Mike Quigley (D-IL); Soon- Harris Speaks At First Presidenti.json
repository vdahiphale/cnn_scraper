And what we see is this tends to be something that has only said about people of color or people who are not men. I wonder what the effect is in your mind of some Republicans talking like that. But with also a nod to the fact that there are people within your own party who, while they think that Harris' background should be a benefit to her, the perspective that she brings and the representation that she brings, they also worry that some voters might not see it that way. What do you say?",

And it's not the DEI labor -- label or past history that they're worried about with her. It's the fact that she was a prosecutor and their candidate is a convicted felon. This is a rich diverse country. We'd like to think of that as a strength, not a weakness. And why not be represented by someone who represents so much of that fabric that we treasure?",

Now this is her burden. This is her case. And often, when the vice president has been out there -- I've been at several of her rallies -- she's been talking about the Affordable Care Act, the infrastructure fund. She's been selling the administration's programs, but not in a political speech like this. So look, the race to define Vice President Kamala Harris is on. She is locked in this race. Obviously, she's trying to define herself as a prosecutor. And the Republicans are also trying to define her. But in this key moment here, right out of the gate, it was just striking to watch. I mean, she said it's 105 days to Election Day. Yes. We have work to do. We have an election to win. She's not saying that she has this. But Democrats just feel a breath of fresh air, a chance that they can actually be competitive in this race. But just judging her stamina, her energy and her acuity at taking the --- on Donald Trump. We're in an entirely different race now.",
