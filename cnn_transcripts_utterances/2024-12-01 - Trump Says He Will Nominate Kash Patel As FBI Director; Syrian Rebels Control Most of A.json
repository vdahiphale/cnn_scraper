And, you know, as an organization, we know what that looks like. This country has been there before, right? The pre-Watergate FBI, the J. Edgar Hoover FBI struck fear in the hearts of Americans across the spectrum of politicians, people in entertainment, people in the civil rights community because the director operated at the direction of presidents to collect political intelligence and to utilize the legal authorities, the investigative authorities of the FBI to terrorize and intimidate Americans. So, the question is, is that where we're going back to with this nomination? I would argue that Kash Patel would be the perfect person for Donald Trump to nominate if that's, in fact, his intent for the FBI. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Trump called him a tremendous business leader and philanthropist. Kushner is a real estate developer. He served time in federal prison after pleading guilty to tax evasion, retaliating against a federal witness, and lying to the Federal Election Commission. Trump pardoned him in 2020.The President-elect also announced a new tariff proposal on Saturday. This one targets the BRICS nations, the group of emerging economies backed by China and Russia. Trump says he will require them to promise they won't try to create a new currency or face tariffs of 100%. Now, in 2023, Brazil's president proposed the creation of a common currency to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar, but the chances that it will actually happen are considered to be slim due to economic and political differences among group members. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had dinner with Trump at Mar-a- Lago on Friday. It was an apparent effort to influence Trump, who has called for 25% tariffs on all imports from the country. No resolution of the issue was announced, and Trudeau didn't say much about the meeting afterward, but he thanked Trump in a post on X and said he looked forward to working together. Now, the President-elect has vowed to impose on his first day in office a 25% tariff on all imports from both Canada and Mexico, plus an additional 10% tariffs on goods from China. We're hearing from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the first time since rebel forces launched a surprise offensive this week in calls with the Iraqi Prime Minister and the president of the United Arab Emirates. Assad vowed that Syria will continue to, quote, \"defend its stability and territorial integrity in the face of all terrorists and their supporters.\" Now, rebels took control of the eastern entrance to Aleppo on Sunday, further consolidating their control over the country's second largest city. The spokesperson for the Rebel Alliance says they've also taken over the feed artillery and the military academy, and some people returning to Aleppo are celebrating the rebel offensive.

He's also spoken with the leader of the United Arab Emirates, saying that with the support of regional leaders and allies, Syria will be able to take down any rebel forces or any rebel movements in the north.But this has also been a huge point of concern, of course, for members of the Astana framework, which, of course, has been such a focal point in the past with regards to mediating any sort of peace agreements in Syria. So Russia, of course, has been key in this. Iran and Turkey, we've heard from the Iranian Foreign Minister there holding calls with his Turkish and Russian counterparts. Russia, of course, has long time been a key backer of the Assad regime, supporting them with airstrikes in the past. The concern is that this could again escalate, as we have seen in the past. There has been calls from regional leaders for calm, for this to be de- escalated. It remains to be seen whether that pressure will lead to any sort of movement on the negotiation table.",

But even for these areas, this is more than they would usually get, especially this time of year. That's the other thing to note. Some of these temperatures we're seeing are more normal for, say, mid to late January, not necessarily the first of December.Look at this video behind me. This is Harrisburg, New York. Again, you can see it on top of cars, homes obviously on the ground, but even on top of the cars, it's several feet of snow built up on top of some of these cars. And the thing is, it's still snowing. It's still expected to come down most of the day today and really even into early portions of Monday, not just up by the Great Lakes, but we also have this secondary, completely independent system that brought record snowfall to St. Louis yesterday, now sliding into portions of Kentucky, Tennessee, and even into West Virginia. But the heaviest snow is certainly going to be focused around the Great Lakes, especially Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. You get those wind-driven bands that are going to come through, and some of them are expected to be very intense. You could have snowfall rates of 2 to 4 inches an hour. And then the wind may shift, shifting it to places that maybe haven't gotten such high totals so far yet, and today may be the day for them. When you look at overall, again, most of these areas farther south, it was about 3 to 5 inches in a lot of these areas, but farther north, now we're measuring 3 to 5 feet, especially when this is all said and done. Some of those areas are looking at substantial snowfall totals. Take a look at this. We've already had nearly 4 feet of snowfall in Barnes Corners, New York, at 45 inches, but Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan also looking at those totals at least above 30 inches, and some of them continuing to grow because it's not done yet. You're still going to get additional snowfall. Here's a look. Again, you can see those bands continue to slide through throughout the day today, but then the wind is going to shift, and some of the areas that have gotten a ton may get a little bit of a break, but other areas may see it more funneled. And looking at pretty intense bands of lake effect snow all the way through the early portion of Monday. Now, one thing to note, tonight the Buffalo Bills play at home, and there is already 16 inches of snow on the ground in Orchard Park where they play, but we've got more snow expected today and more snow during the game tonight, so it's going to be interesting to see what they end up topping out with by the time the game begins. Temperature-wise, too, those are also dropping. Seven degrees right now in Minneapolis, but it feels like minus nine with the windchill, but that cold spreads pretty far widespread areas all the way down to the Gulf Coast, which is where we have several frost and freeze alerts, and yes, Kim, that even includes places in Florida.",

Or is al-Assad's regime actually in jeopardy here?AL-SAIF: The region is not where it was in the past year. And there is certainly an opportunity to change the rules of engagement and the deterrence lines around this conflict. Now, it serves us best to reinforce a quiet and stability in the region, because having Islamist groups on the ground is not certainly a welcome development. The Syrian regime is also connected to a lot of the atrocities in place. I think what we need to do is think of other new actors that can come in and inject some peace and quiet.
