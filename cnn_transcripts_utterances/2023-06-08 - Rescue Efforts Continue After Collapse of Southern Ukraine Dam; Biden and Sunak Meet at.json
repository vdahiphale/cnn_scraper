Two days after the catastrophic collapse of a critical dam insouthern Ukraine, rescue efforts continue, with dramatic scenes like this taking place as the scope of the devastation becomes increasingly clear as each hour passes. But it's not just rising waters posing a challenge to residents in Kherson. Homelessness, threat of disease, and floating landmines are all adding to the increased safety risks. In addition to the fighting, Ukrainian officials are accusing Russian forces of shelling evacuation areas and injuring nine civilians, one, by the way, critically. Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the region earlier, and he called for a clear and quick global response to the disaster. Meantime, U.S. officials tell CNN that Ukrainian forces are being met with stiff resistance as they try to break through Russian lines in the eastern part of the country. CNN's Sam Kylie joins us live now from Kyiv. So, the fact that Ukrainian soldiers are being met with stiff resistance, Sam, what does that tell us about the pending counteroffensive and how hard it will be?",

First of all, that there have been these probing attacks along the front line in Zaporizhzhia, which has involved Ukrainian troops that have been using some of the NATO-supplied equipment. Now, this was always going to be an extremely well-defended front line. And a lot of the evidence, particularly on social media, is that the Ukrainian troops are meeting resistance in that area. At the same time though, they are now reporting some significant advances over three and a half kilometers albeit down a fairly narrow corridor south of the city of Bakhmut. Then are those advances being reported by Ukraine's third assault brigade. This is what some of it looked like. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KILEY (voice-over): Ukraine's third assault brigade is in action near Bakhmut, and they claim they're making advances around the city. But their attack is dependent on Soviet-era weapons. Modern equipment from the USA and NATO is apparently being held in reserve for a Ukrainian offensive. Do you have a name for your grad?

And we just did catch a little glimpse of them in the Oval Office talking about, as you said, the special relationship, the partnership on Ukraine. And they did both mention sort of the evolving economic outlook in the world. And that is something that Rishi Sunak did come to this meeting at the top of his agenda was sort of a discussion of what he calls economic interoperability, ensuring that the and that the UK are aligned as the global economy does enter sort of an uncertain period. But it is, of course, Ukraine that is top of mind. They will, of course, discuss developments in regard to that dam that recently collapsed as Ukraine prepares for this counteroffensive, trying to ensure that the Western alliance is providing Ukraine what it needs, including the potential for fighter jets. And the UK has said that it will train Ukrainian pilots on its type of fighter jets as they prepare for this potential shipment but really, you know, the importance of this relationship is difficult to understate. Now, these two leaders, when they did sit down, they both referenced Churchill and Roosevelt. And the importance of these two offices communicating and coordinating, at the same time, I don't think there's any question that this is not Churchill and Roosevelt. It's not Reagan and Thatcher. It's not even Barack Obama and David Cameron. These two men are really sort of still getting to know each other. They have obvious ideological and political differences. President Biden more on the liberal side. Rishi Sunak on the conservative side. They're also, you know, of quite different generations. Sunak 43, the youngest member of the G7. President Biden at 80 is the oldest, but they have developed a warmth over the last six months or so. And I think from an American perspective, there is a real, you know, celebration that there is a stable figure in Downing Street after that tumultuous period over the summer where the Brits were seeming to go through a prime minister every month or so, they do value this level of pragmatism, and they do feel like they're able to coordinate better going forward. This is the first time Sunak has been at the White House since he entered office. It did take a little while for President Biden to invite him here. But, you know, I was talking to a British official earlier this week who made the point, President Biden doesn't always invite leaders to stay at the Blair House, which is the guest house across the street from the White House. He doesn't always have a press conference with his foreign guests, and both of those are happening this time. So, certainly, there is, you know, a celebration that this visit is now happening and now underway. It's not the most formal visit that President Biden could offer, but it is an important moment for these two leaders to get aligned and get on the same page on this whole host of issues that they are confronting, Zain.",

And we're watching very, very closely for activity in this case right now, because this is no ordinary case. This is a case that is being investigated by a special counsel's office, so a special appointee at the Justice Department to look into this. It is a case about national security. The handling of records outside of the hands, the secure holding of the federal government in the hands of Donald Trump after he left the presidency. And you know, this has also been an extraordinary moment in that over the past week. We had been so expecting to see much of the activity out of the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., the nation's capital, where this investigation was based out of, where we saw many witnesses go in and out of that courthouse to testify to that grand jury, where Donald Trump's defense attorney on this case, Evan Corcoran was forced to share his notes, to share his recollections of his conversations with his client Donald Trump. But then, just in recent days, we have learned that there is grand jury activity also happening in the federal courthouse here in Miami, Florida. And that activity included a witness coming in yesterday, some other witnesses testifying in recent days. And then today we have spotted some prosecutors, at least one prosecutor working with the Special Counsel's office on this particular classified records obstruction of justice case here in Florida, here at the courthouse complex. And so, all of this is coming together at a time where Donald Trump has also just been told, notified, from the Justice Department through his attorneys that he is the target of a federal probe. That is something, Zain, that does not happen until the Justice Department has a lot of their ducks in the row that they have heard from an abundance of witnesses, gathered many, many pieces of evidence, and are nearing very much a conclusion on a charging decision whether or not Donald Trump will be charged with a federal offense.

There's still ice on the lakes in the very northern part of our countries, and yet we're still seeing forest fires. So, it is a very dire situation. And the projection from our scientists are that we will have very hot and dry conditions all the way through the end of June, July, most likely August, as well.

And in some cases, people or families have been evacuated more than once, twice up to three times because the fires have progressed so rapidly and so aggressively across their region. So, there is --Red Cross is obviously supporting many of those families, the federal government. We have disaster assistance funds that are available for municipalities, for our provinces. And one of this fund is an $8 billion fund, which is a lot of money in Canadian terms, that's been around since 1970 for the specific purpose of supporting people in case of extreme weather events. The most unbelievable thing about this fund is that we've spent 75 percent of it in the last six years. So, there is a clear increase in the severity, intensity of natural catastrophes.

In the last year, we've had in Canada's history, so we're heading into the worst summer for forest fires. We have had the worst hurricane on our Atlantic coast, just last year a few months ago. We had record level atmospheric rivers which you've also seen in California. We had that in British Columbia last year.

He's been -- had been held at that Lima prison. And at 7 o'clock this morning, Interpol came and took them into their custody. We do understand that they had doctors with them that performed several medical tests, including a COVID test. It was Interpol that then transferred him to Lima's Air Force Base and at that air force bases, when the United States FBI took them into custody, we were also learning that the FBI has a doctor with them. About three and a half hours ago, they were airborne, on their way to Birmingham, Alabama. Why Birmingham? It is because Natalie Holloway, whose hometown was here in Birmingham, was last seen with Joran van der Sloot in 2010 when she was on a high school graduation party in Aruba. She has since been declared dead. He has never been charged with her murder. But in 2010, her mother -- and according to prosecutors, van der Sloot extorted thousands of dollars from Natalie's mother because he promised to tell her where the remains of Natalie were.

And they were shelling back and forth, fighting, electricity was disrupted, water was disrupted. And so, what happens? These children get ill, they don't have access to medical services. We think, essentially, you know, they were so malnourished that they died. And as you said, estimates are around 60 children. That's very -- we're never quite sure until we know at the end of the day what things look like. But in any case, terrible situation for children. Now, we were able, through our partners, ICRC and others, to help get these children moved to a better location, and we're taking care of them there. But I think this example really illustrates how terrible war is for children in any circumstance. I was at conference over the weekend where we were talking about how 400 million children around the world are impacted by conflict and it's an astounding number and it means children are either being killed directly, being maimed, being abducted, being sexually assaulted.

I mean the reaction is absolutely seismic. We knew he was on the move, he finished up at Paris Saint Germain just a few days ago. Saudi Arabia was the favorite destination but he said if he wanted to make a move that was all about money, that's where he'd have gone. He's chosen differently. To paraphrase LeBron James, he is taking his talents to South Beach. And the reaction in the United States is just off the charts. It's been absolutely fascinating watching the social media accounts, the follower numbers on the Inter Miami Instagram page go from one million to five million. That is more than any NFL team, baseball team, NHL team here. And it's also been fascinating looking at the ticket prices for the games upcoming this season, where Messi, we now imagine, will be playing. So, for example, Inter Miami, they're going to be playing Atlanta United later this year. That's the team that's right next door to this studio here in Atlanta. I was surrounded by fans in the office yesterday who were all wondering whether they should sell their tickets or obviously whether they'd rather be there to watch the game in person. But tickets that would have been going for about 300 bucks for that game are now going for 3,000, which I think just tells you everything you need to know about the excitement surrounding Messi's move here to the United States and it's huge for Major League Soccer.",

      "sentences": "\"The Little Mermaid\" is dramatically underperforming in China and South Korea amid racist critiques. Likeactress Halle Bailey has been praised for her star-making turn as the main character Ariel, but apparently it's not enough to win over certain would- be viewers in China and South Korea who can't get over the fact that Disney cast her in the role. The film has found success in many countries around the world. According to Comscore, the film has made $327 million globally, but China, the world's second box office has contributed a paltry amount. According to NData, this is the Chinese box office tracker, in mainland China, the film made only $2.7 million in its first five days. And compare that to Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse, which brought in nearly $20 million in the first five days of opening. Now, some in mainland China have shared their objections online. One that is in on Maoyan, it's a Chinese box office platform, said that the fairy tale that I grew up with has changed beyond recognition. And Chinese state media has encouraged such reactions. In fact, an op-ed published right before the film's debut in China in the Global Times said this, quote, the controversy surrounding Disney's forced inclusion of minorities in classic films is not about racism, but it's lazy and irresponsible storytelling strategy, unquote. Disney declined to comment. Similar reaction has been found online in South Korea, with one user saying the movie had been, quote, ruined, along with the hashtag, not my Ariel. According to the Korean Film Council in South Korea, \"The Little Mermaid\" attracted some 472,000 viewers in its first week and compared that to the near 643,000 fans that showed up for the latest Fast and Furious sequel over the same period.
