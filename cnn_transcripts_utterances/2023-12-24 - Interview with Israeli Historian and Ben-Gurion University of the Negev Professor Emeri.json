It was a decision to accept a Palestinian State on the areas occupied in 1967 in East Jerusalem the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. Oslo was not particularly popular amongst the Palestinians. On the ground, in the West Bank, it was very well received. But amongst the Palestinians as a whole, the imbalance was evident. The Israelis were not offering a state. The Israelis in Oslo were not offering a state. The Israelis were simply offering an interim period. In the Israeli concept of Oslo, everything was reversible.

Final status agreement was set out in Oslo. It included borders, settlements, Jerusalem, security as the main -- these were the main items -- and water. These were the main items that they had to decide on in the so-called Final States Agreement. He didn't want to, in his opinion, waste political capital on small steps. The consequence of that, of course, was to add to the Palestinian suspicions about what he actually was up to. And instead, he wanted to solve the 75-year-old conflict in one go, in one pressure cooker, in a short period of time. And from Arafat's point of view, he's being put in the position of take it or leave it. He was also told by Clinton, by the way, two things.

I don't see this happening.We have 750,000 settlers now on the West Bank. The Israelis have made it absolutely, absolutely clear that there will be no military withdrawal from any area, including now Gaza, by the way. That they will maintain security control over the whole of the West Bank. There'll be no Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem. There'll be no return of refugees. There'll be no return to the 1967 borders or anything equivalent. The Israeli public has shifted to the right. The extreme right now is in control. On the other hand, if you look at what the Palestinians still, I think, are ready to go for, which is a state in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, some kind of a land swap that is based on equivalence, some -- the basics of contiguity and sovereignty, freedom from occupation and end of military -- Israeli military rule, I don't think these are unreasonable demands.

Well, Israel's prospects for peace took an unexpected turn during the Trump administration, when the White House brokered a series of agreements between Israel and some Arab nations. Before this, the widely held expectation was that the bulk of the Arab world would keep its back turned-on Israel until the Palestinian issue was solved.But on September 15, 2020, in a scene reminiscent of the Oslo Accords, the UAE and Bahrain recognized Israel and normalized diplomatic relations with it when they signed the Abraham Accords. Morocco and Sudan followed. And this year, the biggest prize of them all, Saudi Arabia, seemed possible too. President Biden connected the dots after the October 7th attack, saying that one of the reasons Hamas attacked Israel was because they knew Biden was about to sit down with the Saudis, who Biden said, wanted to recognize Israel and unite the Middle East. Let me bring in Former U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian to talk about this and more broadly, America's role in the quest for peace. Djerejian has been working on diplomacy in the Middle East for more than 50 years. He's been U.S. Ambassador to Israel, U.S. Ambassador to Syria and the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs. It's a pleasure to have you on. EDWARD DJEREJIAN, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL AND SENIOR FELLOW, HARVARD'S BELFER CENTER:  It's good to see you again, Fareed.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think, first of all, American diplomacy needs a deep understanding and appreciation of the basic facts on the ground in the Middle East and where the parties are coming from. You know, the art of diplomacy is very, very central to understanding your interlocutor's interests almost as well as he or she understands it, displaying that you understand where they're coming from, and then presenting your principle, your interests, and determining if there's any common ground. That we have to do much more.Second, we have to have a spine in our diplomacy. We have to be tough on both sides, or else nothing will happen. You know, we started off in 67 Israeli settlements. In U.S. government proclamations, Israeli settlements are illegal under international law, the Geneva Conventions of '49. You've seen over the years how the verbiage is that, oh, they're an obstacle to peace, or they're a problem. No, they're illegal. And we took a stand in the Bush 41 administration on the housing loan guarantees. $10 billion of housing loan guarantees to Israel that we stopped. Because they were not true to their word in stopping settlement activity, and that was the other part of the bargain with us, and that caused a furor, but the United States stood tall on principle, and we have to do that with both sides. We were tough on the Arabs. We were tough on the Israelis. You have to be skillful in your diplomacy also.",

And you have to kind of admit that. And the unwillingness to admit that is -- and, you know, the worry that if you admit that you will be assassinated or you'll get outflanked by Hamas, that that's been at the core of it, that there isn't somebody who's willing to speak honestly to the Palestinians and say, look, this is all we can get?",

      "sentences": "The glimmer of hope is that I really do feel that October 7th is so consequential, akin to Yom Kippur in '73. That the political landscape has changed. I hope one of the major lessons that everyone learns is that you cannot shunt the Palestinian issue aside and make it a secondary or tertiary issue, that you can make economic peace or peace for peace. We have to focus on land for peace.And let's make the hard decision to go for it. There's a lot of diplomatic history in the archives on settlements, on territorial compromises, on Jerusalem, on refugees. There's a body of negotiations that can be built on. Let's get the leadership to get it done.",
