And I believe that Vladimir Putin is responsible for Alexey's murder, and the fact that his body will not be released to his family for two weeks. And there's already actually don't even try to find a different explanation for this. They're saying that they're conducting a chemical analysis. Meanwhile, the two causes put forward by the Russian authorities, the two causes of Alexey's death were the sudden death syndrome and thrombosis, which according to Alexey's doctors, was unlikely because Alexey was not suffering from any condition that would make it likely. So, this was obviously a murder and they themselves are not giving out the body to the family. But, you know, had they done this, wouldn't be a great opportunity for them to prove that they had nothing to do with Alexey's death, had they allowed the family to conduct an independent expertise to find the blood clot that they claim was there and caused Alexey's death would not be the best option for them?

Fani Willis and GBI, FBI and others, we have had a third highest drop in violent crime across the nation, a 21 percent reduction in homicides.
