It's been an all out free-for-all since Jim Jordan became the second Republican to step aside amid this paralyzed House and the inability of Jordan and before him, Steve Scalise, to get the 217 votes they needed to be elected speaker. Can any of these nine do just that?There has been a furious effort behind the scenes to try to lock up the vote, commitments before a secret election will take place tomorrow morning to nominate the next speaker of the House. The front- runner is viewed as Tom Emmer, the House Republican whip. But he is by no means to lock this race up given the fact it's incredibly crowded. I talked to one of them just earlier today, Congressman Don Meuser. He's a Republican of Pennsylvania. His task, he says, is try to unify this badly divided Republican conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAN MEUSER (R-PA): McCarthy was taken out unfairly. Those people took him out, most of them, maybe all of them are my friends. But as I said, I respect each and every one of them. That's got to be the case moving forward. The American people want us to stop this dysfunction and get on with it.",

So, even once the speaker is elected, Dana, I expect a huge fight over these consequential huge issues but they can't even act upon it until a speaker is elected.",

You've been walking the halls, working the members along with Manu. What are you hearing? What's your sense? LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Echoing Manu's reporting, it's going to be really difficult for anyone to find 217 votes. They have nine candidates right now, a contested race. Divisions are running deep. Feelings are hurt. Revenge sometimes top of mind. And so it's going to be extremely problematic and difficult. They're going to try. Tom Emmer is the front-runner. But Trump team is working to make sure that he is not elected. I just confirmed a few minutes ago that Trump, who was going to stay out of the race, has now directed his allies to take down Emmer.",

They're the only ones who supported, voted to certify the election, which is where Tom Emmer will go sideways with Donald Trump.Also, Ukraine aid, they support that and they support the debt ceiling. They supported the debt ceiling deal. So those are the first two who actually align with Senate Republicans and frankly, the White House, particularly on Ukraine.",

Are donors or party elders to the extent there are any anymore, are they weighing in and saying guys, enough is enough? So, I'm not sure if any of these nine are different than the three. Some have much less baggage, obviously, but the reality is that no one is going to line up perfectly. So, I think it's going to take an outside force or someone coming to their senses internally. One of these nine maybe has better relationships with some of these members. That's what we're about to find out. But it's not necessarily their act role in all of these votes. It's going to take an outside force to say guys, finally, it's over.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, Jake, from the outset of this crisis, we have seen countries across the Middle East preparing aid, getting that aid sent to the El-Arish Air Base near Sinai in Egypt, of course, waiting for the opportunity for the aid to make it across the Rafah border crossing. But as you know, the amount of aid that is getting in through the Rafah border crossing is a trickle of aid compared to what is needed inside Gaza. Less than 1 percent of the aid they typically would have received over two weeks has entered the Gaza Strip and that is a huge concern given the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe we are seeing.But that aid is continuing to be stockpiled by Middle Eastern countries. Also, of course, there are intense efforts on the diplomatic front. We saw over the weekend the Cairo peace summit, leaders from across the world, but also particularly from the Arab world gathering together, focusing on trying to eliminate the humanitarian catastrophe but also to bring an end to ongoing and intensifying conflict. No resolution was reached at the peace summit but we did hear vocal words of condemnation from the likes of King Abdullah of Jordan, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. And, of course, we've heard from King Abdullah condemning the violence in Gaza, condemning the violence in the West Bank, as well as condemning violence seen in Israel. He has called for an immediate cease fire as well as efforts to mediate some sort of peace agreement on the basis, he said on Saturday, of a two-state solution. Now, of course, we have heard concerns being expressed by Arab leaders over the prospect of an evacuation process, of more Palestinians being made refugees. King Abdullah has described this as a war crime and a red line for Jordan.",

You know, my colleague, Representative Omar, has voted against Iron Dome which is a missile defense system that protects Israeli civilians from relentless rocket fire. If it were not for Iron Dome interceptions, there would be far more dead Israelis, far more, by orders of magnitude.
