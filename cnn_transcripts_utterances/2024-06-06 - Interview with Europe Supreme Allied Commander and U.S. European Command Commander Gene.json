Plus, \"The Braves.\" How Sculptor Anilore Banon immortalizes the heroes of Normandy in art. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in Normandy, where 80 years ago today, on June 6, 1944, just after sunrise, the Allied forces landed on the Omaha Beach, breaking through the Nazi's Atlantic Wall. At huge cost, they turned the tide of World War II and began the liberation of Europe, a moment in time forever immortalized as D-Day. (MUSIC PLAYING) Americans, British, Canadians landed on a total of five beaches. Today, U.S. President Joe Biden and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, led the 80th anniversary commemorations and stood beside those world leaders. Were the soldiers past and present, including members of that greatest generation who fought on the beaches here all those years ago. President Biden paid tribute to those heroes. And in a powerful speech pointed to Russia's invasion of Ukraine saying today's leaders must pick up the baton from veterans of the past by standing with Kyiv. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  The allied forces of D-Day did their duty. Now the question for us is, in our hour of trial, will we do ours? We're living in a time when democracy is more at risk across the world than any point since the end of World War II, since these beaches were stormed in 1944. Now, we have to ask ourselves, will we stand against tyranny? Against evil? Against crushing brutality? Of the iron fist? Will we stand for freedom? We defend democracy. We stand together. My answer is yes and it only can be yes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think -- you know, look, I'm a lay historian and I'm as opinionated as any knothead that you're ever going to come across. But there was this thought that America -- particularly America, was lazy, was divided, was undisciplined, that couldn't get its act together, wouldn't -- that would never band together in order just to do the right thing by choice. And when I'm here, I think of a bunch of kids. It was a young force that came here. They were somewhere between -- if you were 25 years old, they called you pops or they called you the old man. And they -- and they were - - they left absolute all of the comforts of a very comfortable America, safe America on the other side of the ocean. And they put themselves here for what? Because it was the right thing to do. And they were not defending the status quo. They were not gaining territory. They were not here for riches. They were not here to conquer anything. They were really here in order to mend the future, if I can coin a word that has just come out in a book that I read not too long ago. There was an article, I want to say in the Bedford newspaper, in which, on the 6th June, because of the time lag made, it possible for the 6th of June to have this be the headlines in United States of America. And it said the next 50 years of European history is being decided right now in the fields and beaches of Normandy. It was not about everything that had happened prior to 1944. It was actually about what was going to happen in 1954 and '64. I was born in 1956. Had D-Day not happened -- and that's not hard to imagine here, you can look around and we can see the evasion in our minds, we can see that day, but we can also imagine with a little bit of turn of frame, what if it had not happened, if this had stayed as it had been, a conquered territory by one of the most murderous regimes -- there we go, as a FedEx is delivering my Uber lunch right now.

One of the things that happened was that special effects guys would come up. And all over the beach were these little red flags. They said, hey, be careful where the little red flags are, because there's explosive charges underneath there. It's going to throw some stuff off. And whatever you do, don't step over there, because that's a whole air ram that's going to throw a guy up in the air. And a guy down there is going to be lit on fire, so try to stay away from him. And you put that together and see, well, this is a pretty glamorous day of work, isn't it? What time's lunch? But then it begins. And the first thing they did was remove all those red flags, and I realized that, you know, if something goes on. Now, we are not in any danger at all whatsoever. But the verisimilitude, if I dare use that word, does put it in a different sort of form. There is a moment when, of course, as actors, we're just pretending. But there comes a moment where the reason we're there is to capture the truth as the film rolls, and to be cold, wet, scared, and have it be awfully noisy for an awful long time. I remember when we were shooting -- and by the way, this is one of the reasons Steven Spielberg wanted to make the movie. He said, finally, I'll be able to do with film technology. I'll actually be able to capture what happened on Omaha Beach, and here's why I'm going to do it. First, it's going to take three weeks. And secondly, it's going to be every single day. And third, we're going to have all kinds of stuff going off. And fourth, in between there, we'll make some sort of movie. At the same time, we're trying to load it up with as much authentic, and I wanted to use the word again, verisimilitude, as we can. OK, that's our job as filmmakers.
