And we're not just talking about public schools. We're going elementary school all the way up through universities.Within just the past few days, the president of Texas A&amp;M University resigned following controversy over the school's failed attempt to hire a new professor to lead its journalism program. There was backlash of the professor's hiring because of her work on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom just brought a $1.5 million fine against a school district after it refused to carry a textbook which references the first out gay politician elected in that state, the late Harvey Milk. A school board member there called Milk a pedophile earlier this year. It is really important to note, there are no credible accusations of pedophilia against Milk. And then, of course, there's Florida. Vice President Kamala Harris flew down herself to bash Republicans for their new state standards for teaching black history, including one new rule which would require that middle school students be taught, quote, how slaves developed skills which in some instances could be applied for their personal benefit. Florida governor, and 2024 presidential candidate, Ron DeSantis was asked to clarify that standard on Friday. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL) AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I mean, I didn't do it. I wasn't involved in it. But I think - I think what they're doing is I think that they're probably going to show some of the folks that eventually parlayed, you know, being a blacksmith into - into doing things later - later in life.

And I think Will Hurd perhaps put it really well when he said in a tweet -- and I think we can call it up here -- basically saying, I can't believe I have to say this, but slavery wasn't a jobs program that taught beneficial skills. It was literally dehumanizing and subjugated people as property because they lacked any rights or freedoms. When you look at this, Joe, especially as a Republican strategist, when you look at this, how is it that this is where Ron DeSantis is going? He is doubling down on this.

So, issue by issue, I think the actual issues confronting black people in many ways on a day-to-database get lost because of the insanity on the far fringes, when in reality you're looking at California, where we have 70 -- over 70 percent of juniors who are not reading at proficient levels. You look at Florida, you see those numbers, much the same way for black students. So, those are the real issues. Those are the real stakes.The civil rights issue of our time.

This judicial overhaul was one of those potential reasons why.Now, we did hear from President Biden saying that they do - and from the White House saying that they do expect Netanyahu and Biden to meet sometime in the U.S. soon. Now the question will be, this legislation has passed. There was no compromised negotiation. Will that invitation still stand? How will this affect U.S.-Israel relationships?

It was released on the same day, of course, as director Christopher Nolan's historical epic \"Oppenheimer,\" which inspired what we haven't seen in some time, a double feature weekend.Joining us now, new editor at \"Variety,\" Jordan Moreau. Good to have you here. We should note, obviously, \"Barbie,\" made by our parent company Warner Brothers, which is part of our parent company Discovery. But what a weekend. And it did not disappoint. It exceeded not only the money expectations but I think -- you saw it -- viewer expectations.",
