I was just reading through the detention letter that they filed with the court, and they lay out a number of reasons, including Combs' history of violence. They report, according to their allegations, that he has kicked, shoved, abused women for years. They also say that he is a flight risk because of his access to money and planes. They also note a number of weapons that they recovered in the search of his homes in L.A. and Miami earlier this year, including some serious weapons that they included pictures of at that press conference, saying that he has access to weapons, both himself and through his security staff, noting that some of his security staff are criminals, in fact. They also say that another reason why Diddy should be detained is because he has tried to obstruct this very investigation, saying that he has tried to tamper with witnesses, had reached out to a number of witnesses in this investigation, asking them to create what he said was -- what the U.S. attorney's office said was a false narrative, and some of those conversations were actually recorded on the phone of one of the co-conspirators, according to the U.S. attorney's office -- Wolf.",
