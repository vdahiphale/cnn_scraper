But I think the key word there in that little sound bite you played, Kim, is gradual. Because indeed what we're seeing from Ukrainian forces on the ground months into this counteroffensive is absolutely not some lightning bolt strategy, some upend on the ground. It is gradual. It is step by step in what is very much a ground war that is being one inch by inch, Ukraine says. The focus of course right now is the South, South of Zaporizhzhya, where a counteroffensive has been heating up.The latest that Ukrainian commanders have claimed is taking the village of Verbov again to the South of Zaporizhzhya earlier this month. They claimed the village of Robotyne. All of these again, very small gains, very small wins on the way to that larger goal of cutting off the land bridge between Crimea and those Russian forces all along those occupied regions, but they're still very far from obtaining that goal, Kim. The next iteration of this, according to Ukrainian commanders, is to try to claim the city, the town of Tukmak rather, that is a strategic hub for Russia. But I emphasize just how many lines of Russian defense Ukrainian forces have to cross. We're talking about land mines, ditches, anti-tank systems. And then of course, there is the air superiority from Russia and the days are numbered here. We are looking at the weather, heading into winter soon. That's gonna make it much more difficult. But again, that vote of confidence from the NATO secretary general is so important for Ukraine's government, for President Zelenskyy, when he's facing some serious questions about his progress, particularly in D.C. from Republican lawmakers.",

I Appreciate it.The Kremlin is trying to dispel rumors that one of its major allies in the war is seriously ill. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov is facing a string of accusations of human rights abuses both inside and outside of Chechnya. His troops are fighting in Ukraine. As Matthew Chance reports, Moscow released a new video on Thursday suggesting he's doing just fine. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Behind the daily strikes, an information war is raging. Fueling speculations about key Russian figures forcing the Kremlin to dispel the rumors. Like those swirling around hardline Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, now shown on state TV meeting President Putin after rumors he's gravely ill. Rumors spread by Ukrainian intelligence and that Kadyrov has denied on social media. I strongly advise all those who can't tell the difference between truth and lies on the internet to go for a walk in the fresh air and put their thoughts in order, he wrote. In recent weeks, Russia has been busy denying Ukrainian claims that a strike on its Black Sea fleet headquarters in Sevastopol killed dozens of Russian naval officers, including the overall commander. But Admiral Viktor Sokolov soon appeared in an undated video call with Russian defense officials. His stiff appearance, though only fueled speculation about his condition. Finally, the admiral is shown handing out medals to the Russian Navy soccer team, answering questions, apparently, on the attack, although CNN can't verify when the event took place. UNKNOWN (through translator): Could you please tell us in a few words what happened to reassure Sevastopol residents? ADM. VIKTOR SOKOLOV, RUSSIAN NAVY (through translator): Nothing happened to us. Life goes on. The Black Sea fleet is carrying out the tasks assigned to it by the command. CHANCE (voice-over): But prominent Russians do have a tendency to occasionally drop from view. General Sergei Surovikin, a senior Russian commander linked with Wagner, disappeared after recording a statement calling for the mercenary group to abandon its rebellion back in June. Months later in September, this image was circulated purporting to show Surovikin and his wife out and about in Moscow in a bid to dispel rumors of his arrest. And even Russia's defense minister, shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, vanished from view for over a week, eventually popping back up on a video conference call with Putin, a sign perhaps he was back in favor.

Now scientists believe they've found a way to not only preserve the vulnerable environment, but also improve the island's economy, CNN's Patrick Oppmann explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Porpoises swim off the coast of Cuba. The waters here may seem pristine, but like seemingly everywhere else, this Caribbean island nation is grappling with the threats from a rapidly changing climate. Now in the first research expedition of its kind, 24 Cuban scientists and crew circumnavigated the entire island to carry out what they say is the most comprehensive study ever done on climate change and the impact it's had on Cuba. Researchers dive from coral reef to coral reef and say what they have found is even more dire than they expected. We've seen a bleaching of corals, which is something that is worrying and that is massive. She says, the majority of coral is bleached and this is because of the high temperatures. The scientists say it's not too late to reverse the damage, but that we have to dramatically reduce human-caused pollution that is heating oceans to record levels, killing off coral reefs and filling the seas with microplastics. With this study, these scientists say they will be able to measure much more accurately how much harm is being inflicted on Cuba's unique natural environments. We are going to have a baseline, she says. We hope to identify the spots along the coast where the pollution is and how concentrated it is. For two months, the scientists carried out dozens of dives, taking hundreds of samples from the bottom of the ocean. Scientists are barely out of their wetsuits before running tests in their makeshift laboratory. They hope what they learn can change how resources on this island are used. (on-camera): Scientists say they're making the case to government officials here that the country needs to transition from commercial fishing to have a greater focus on marine tourism. As they say, a shark can only be caught and eaten one time. Whereas that same shark can be enjoyed by tourists on a dive excursion again and again. Something that's not only better for this country's environment, but also its economy. (voice-over): The change will not come easy, but for Cubans who depend on mangroves to protect them from hurricanes and beaches to attract tourists, experts say there is no other choice. It's not a luxury, it's a necessity, he says. Even with so many difficulties, we can't stop learning about coral reefs. They protect the beaches, they protect us from extreme weather, they give us sand and fish and the things we eat.
