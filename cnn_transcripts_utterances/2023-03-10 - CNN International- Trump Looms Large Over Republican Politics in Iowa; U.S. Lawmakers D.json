But this quote, unquote event on Friday is still very symbolically significant because now he's been given a third term in all of his most important titles. Even though the presidency is largely ceremonial, he's now basically able to further cement his iron grip over the party, the state and the entire nation. Allowing him to drive forward this agenda of reasserting the Communist Party's dominance of every aspect of Chinese life. Not just politics and military affairs, but also the economic, social and cultural affairs. That has major global implications. Because obviously he does run the world's second largest economy at a time when tensions are rising between China and the U.S. That's something he actually touched on himself just a few days ago telling delegates that the U.S.-led West has been trying to contain and suppress China in a comprehensive way and vowing to fight back. So, tensions are really unlikely to subside anytime soon.
