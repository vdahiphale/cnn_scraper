I'm Laila Harrak.Republicans already raising concerns over the agreement in principle on the debt ceiling, as both President Biden and House Speaker McCarthy race to seal the deal with their allies in Congress. The GOP turns on one of its own in Texas in an unprecedented move to impeach the state's attorney general. Details and how that official is reacting. And we're live for you in Istanbul as voting there gets under way for Turkey's presidential runoff election. We begin in Washington, where Congress is drafting new legislation on the U.S. debt limit hours after officials reached a deal to try to avoid a disastrous default. While, the White House and Republicans say they agreed in principle to raise the U.S. Debt ceiling and cap government spending, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says lawmakers are now expected to vote on that agreement this Wednesday. But before it can move forward, he must convince hardliners that it's worth it. Here's how he characterized the deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): After weeks of negotiations, we have come to an agreement in principle. We still have a lot of work to do, but I believe this is an agreement in principle that's worthy of the American people. It has historic reductions in spending, consequential reforms that will lift people out of poverty into the workforce, rein in government overreach. There are no new taxes, no new government programs. There's a lot more within the bill. We still have more work to do tonight to finish all the writing of it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

President Joe Biden addressed some of the concerns saying, quote, the agreement represents a compromise, which means not everyone gets what they want. That's the responsibility of governing.And this agreement is good news for the American people because it prevents what could have been a catastrophic default and would have led to an economic recession. Retirement accounts devastated millions of jobs lost, while the deal has still a long way to go to get the approval of Congress.

You know, we thought we were going to go right down to the wire here, whether that was going to be June 1st or, as Treasury suggested a day or two ago, closer to June 5th, and that everybody would be right on the edge of default. This is just an agreement in principle, so there's a possibility you could see votes melt away once they see the specifics. But the fact of the matter is that the agreement in principle itself is a significant accomplishment.And remember that for foreign nations that were looking at the American domestic politics of this year, they didn't really care about the details. They cared about the United States not becoming a source of financial and fiscal instability, and thus of political instability. And it's been a remarkable thing in the past few months, but the biggest risk factor to the world economy has been what happens here in Washington. That's not usually the case. We usually, in Washington, think that other nations are the bigger risk. We were it and this may avert it.",

The most incisive question they asked me was, why do you do this to yourselves? The United States didn't have a debt limit vote a number of decades ago. It was a self-created facility, something that Congress itself required. And it was kind of backwards, right? You spend the money and then you take another vote about whether you're going to pay off your bills.Now, we all love that in our personal lives, but it doesn't make any sense. And it's only there as leverage for the future. Now, the Republicans will probably think at this point, this leverage worked. Because what they got out of this at the end, Laila, was an agreement from President Biden to freeze non-military spending, and that would essentially keep the programs that he cares about the most from growing. The fact of the matter is, he wasn't going to get those through this Congress anyway. So, to his argument would be that it keeps in place the significant programs and accomplishments that he believes he had in the first term until he lost control of the House.",

These violations of the public trust are alarming and show a systemic pattern of behavior that every member of our committee felt needed to be addressed in a public forum.Now, this vote is already historic because Ken Paxton is the first attorney general in the state of Texas to ever be impeached. Now, there was another bombshell during the hours-long debate leading up to this historic vote, and that was when several members said in open forum that members of the House had received calls from Ken Paxton threatening them that if they voted yes, there would be political consequences. There was concern about this, so much so that one of the House members took to Twitter saying in part, quote, I will be submitting a journal statement to amend charging documents to include abuse of power, intimidation of House members and Senate jury tampering in light of Charlie Geren's statements that A.G. Paxton called and threatened House and Senate members. Now, I asked Paxton's office about this, and I did not hear back. But Ken Paxton did take to Twitter in response to his impeachment saying in part, quote, I am beyond grateful to have the support of millions of Texans who recognize that what we just witnessed is illegal, unethical and profoundly unjust. I look forward to a quick resolution in the Texas Senate, where I have full confidence the process will be fair and just. So, what happens in the Texas House?

      "sentences": "Well, Laila, polls opened just over two hours ago. And I have to say the weather is not great. It has been raining a bit. But despite that, we have seen voters streaming into this polling station, casting their ballots, this all-important runoff election today in Turkey.We've been seeing some of these voters coming in, many of them including families with young children, some members of the elderly community being supported by loved ones as they come in to make their voice heard in this election. We've been speaking to some of those voters. For those, of course, casting their vote for President Erdogan, the incumbent who has now been in power for over two decades, this is a vote for political stability at a time when the country is facing several crises, it has to be said. But for others, hopeful for a win for Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the six-party coalition alliance. This is a vote for change. And we were speaking to some of those supporters of the opposition, they say this is an opportunity for the Turkish people to bring in and usher in a new era for the country, particularly when there are so many challenges ahead, not least the economy, that is certainly at the forefront of voters' minds. The country is facing a deepening cost of living crisis. We've seen inflation soaring, largely in part due to President Erdogan's unorthodox monetary policies, and we've seen the weakening of the lira. So, this is of huge concern for voters. Some believe President Erdogan, in his vision, that this will offer stability over the next five years, others believe it is time for change. And then, of course, there is the question of the government's response to February's devastating earthquake, which left more than 50,000 people killed, millions more displaced, still homeless, living in temporary camps across the country's southeast. Now, the government has faced real criticism over its chaotic and somewhat delayed response. And in turn, there has been criticism over the government's preparation for a disaster of that sort. Now, President Erdogan has pledged a lightning-speed rebuilding effort in the southeast. We've already seen construction under way, in part, of the region. But, again, Kemal Kilicdaroglu's opposition party has criticized the government for its response. They say they are the ones that will be able to bring about a change and offer support to those impacted. Now, over the last two decades, President Erdogan has cemented Turkey's place on the global stage. It is a key NATO ally, an influential regional power broker. And, of course, he has a lot of support here in turkey. They secured 49.5 percent of the vote two weeks ago in that first round, the opposition securing just under 45 percent of the vote. It has been a closely fought battle over the last two weeks. We've seen campaigning up until the very last minute. But all eyes will be waiting for the results to be announced this evening. Many, of course, will be gathering at party headquarters on both sides, waiting for news of who the country's next president will be. Laila?",

But a pivotal moment Saturday afternoon when President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy connected over the phone and that, we are told, is when they were able to reach an agreement in principle. Now, of course over the next several hours, both sides will be working on the text of this agreement and the devil will be in the details. That is where Republicans as well as Democrats will learn more about what exactly this agreement looks like. And they're up against a very tight deadline. Not only was it important for both sides to reach an agreement, but then too, it is what this legislative text will say showing that to members of Congress, and then later, a vote on the House floor, and then it has to go through the Senate.

You get to know yourself and what makes you tick and what the best strategy is for you.And so yesterday, I thought I had everything under control.
