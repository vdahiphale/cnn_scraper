      "sentences": "Yeah, Boeing's got to be breathing a big sigh of relief. NASA, too. I mean, you still got to get the recovery crews on the ground to make sure everything looks OK.But I think it's almost safe to say, you know, if Butch and Suni had been inside Starliner on this return to Earth, they almost certainly would have been OK. But, you know, NASA is saying with all those issues with the thrusters and the helium leaks, it just was not a risk that they were willing to take when they had a backup vehicle ready to go. But so now the big question is going to be, does Starliner need another crewed test flight or perhaps another uncrewed test flight before it can be certified and be a fully functioning part of NASA's commercial crew program? You've got Boeing and SpaceX who were doled out these contracts in 2014 to ferry NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station. So far, only SpaceX has been able to do it. So what happens now? Because this landing and reentry appears to be successful, does Boeing have to do another one of these test flights before it's certified? A lot of money is on the line, Laura. I mean, remember this program over a billion dollars over budget already, years behind schedule. So that's really what Boeing and NASA are going to be focused on now. But first, you got to deal with the recovery. So what you're going to be seeing in just a few minutes are all these recovery crews, Boeing and NASA recovery crews that have been stationed at a nearby staging facility at White Sands, New Mexico. They're going to slowly converge on the capsule, do some checks, make sure it's safe before they proceed and officially end this mission. But a successful landing, certainly --",

But as a crew member riding home in one of these vehicles, that's what you're trained to expect. So Kristin's absolutely correct. I mean, this is definitely a measure of vindication for a very hard-working team of Boeing engineers and operations folks that brought Starliner home. But there are open questions. And I think we're very anxious to -- to get to the day where we're flying people in Starliner again. I know both Cady and I have good friends that are signed up to be. And the next crew that's supposed to be in Starliner.

One of the big questions that they've wrestled with the whole time has been they've tested the thrusters in white sands. But then how does that compare to how we expect them to perform in orbit?And so now -- now that the capsule is back and they'll be able to take a look at the thrusters and understand more of that. And I think that that idea of, you know, at NASA, we're always simulating, but it's never exactly, you know, the same. And but it's been a really big question. If we understand this down here, do we understand it up there? And I think they're going to get a lot of valuable data to be able to do that. But that will be the question to answer.",

And so was it the safest option for bringing them home? No, it wasn't.So I don't think anyone is shocked to see the -- the successful landing here. And I think it was disappointing for them not to be able to climb in. And knowing they'd probably be safe on the ground, but it wasn't the right thing to do. So I'm sure there's a lot of mixed feelings up there in terms of actually just being in space and spending longer. I can't see Garrett's face, but I think if you ask Garrett and I, we'd be up there. And, you know, they've been -- they've been the shepherds of this spacecraft for a long time, for a couple of years now and not going on flights. And then they were going to come up for eight days. And now they get to spend months. They're a fully trained crew. They're so good on orbit. And in these past two months with having so many people up there, it's literally a different space station with that to do list like knocked out of the way. So I think it's -- there's mixed feelings both on the ground and up in space. But we're always learning.",

And now for 10 years later, for SpaceX to have to fly up and bring Butch and Suni back eventually because NASA didn't feel Starliner was safe enough for its crew, that is really a devastating blow to Boeing and its position in spaceflight.

Then they have some big thrusters that fire and slow the capsule down by a few hundred miles an hour. And then it comes back and lands.But before it comes back to Earth, it separates. So this is called the CM or command module. And the crew is in here with the parachutes. And that's what we saw the landing. This service module where those small rockets that they had the problems with, it also de-orbits itself, but it burns up in the atmosphere. And so they're never going to get those jets back that they had the problems with. They got lots and lots of data. They've done a lot of tests. They've had it up there for months. But this is the part that comes back with the crew in it. This part burns up. And so they're never going to actually get to physically test the rockets that they had problems with. KINKADE: It's good to see that model and that explanation. Of course, you said this is the craft that the astronauts come back in. That didn't happen.

You're starting to see an awareness that there should be some parental supervision. And that's what we saw in the first case that was tried. And there was a conviction in a sentence of some length of time recently. And that is that there was a -- the parents should have known around the time that it happened. There was this issue about access to the weapon. They had some advanced knowledge about what the child was going through at the time and whether or not there would be problems at the school.You have some of those same factors in this case. You don't necessarily have the exact timeline, but you do have somebody who knew, who was reckless, who was sort of wanton and unreasonable in their conduct.

He said they're down, which tells me they're probably kept in a closet in the corner of a bedroom, something like that. They're not locked up in a safe.And then to know that potentially these threats have been made, or these comments have been made by his child earlier, and then to go buy this weapon and to apparently leave it accessible to the child, it was accessible because he got it and used it at the school the other day. This is going to be sort of the theme of the prosecutor's case and provides that element that the prosecutor's going to have to show, and that is, is there some knowledge on the part of this parent about the child's propensity to do some harm, and then a willingness to provide him a weapon, you know, where he could take advantage of that and carry out the shooting.

Long guns have long been protected by the legislature, and that is because they consider them to be hunting weapons, sporting weapons. You know, they don't want to criminalize a father giving his son, you know, a gun to shoot at the range or to take out a deer hunt or whatever it is they're going to do.But there is some laws that provide the sense that a parent can't act grossly negligent. You can't have criminal negligence that causes the death of another. And by making this gun accessible, by giving it to a minor child, knowing that this child was suffering from other factors, whether he was diagnosed by a health care professional, mental health professional, whatever, the parent was obviously aware of it because of the law enforcement intervention earlier, you know, that's in fact fits the statutes in this state. And I think that's why you saw a fairly quick decision by the prosecutor to bring charges of the case. It's going to be unusual, and frankly, remember, he's presumed innocent. He'll have to have a jury convict him of these things, and that can vary, frankly, from county to county, because you're going to have some places where, you know, they consider themselves very pro-gun.",

Good to have you with us Miles up late at this hour, after seeing the Starliner land. How would you describe that landing? Was it a textbook landing? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AEROSPACE ANALYST: Well, Lynda, yeah, it was a textbook landing. One detail, no passengers aboard which of course blemishes that good landing by quite a bit. Everything seemed to work according to plan of course, they'll be further data that will be revealed as time goes on here, but the thrusters clearly fired as they should. The Spacecraft was able to thread the needle and re-enter the atmosphere not too hot, not to -- not skipping off the atmosphere. Parachutes deployed, airbags deployed and they landed pretty much on target right there in White Sands, New Mexico. So you could say all's well that ends well. But that would not be right in this case because now begins a very thorough investigation as to what went wrong with this spacecraft Months ago as it approached the International Space Station and several of those thrusters which seemed to work OK tonight failed and those answers are still open.",

Because this was a mission that was years behind schedule, more than a billion dollars over budget, what does this say about Boeing's future relationship with NASA in space?O'BRIEN: Yeah, I mean Boeing has been there, Lynda, since the beginning if you look at the company and all the companies it has acquired over the years. It's been involved in every program that NASA has flown including the space station itself. But this one was different in the sense that it was a fixed price contract previously Boeing has operated with NASA, with defense style contracts, cost plus as it is called. And there's not a different set of incentives there. When you have a fixed price and you have to deliver a certain thing any -- any overruns those costs are borne by the contractor itself. And in this case, Boeing perhaps in the space division wasn't able to adapt to this different kind of doing business in space. What that means for the future is -- is very uncertain that the company has a lot of other problems certainly on the civilian airliners side, the space portion of it is a separate division. But it might be a scenario where if it is determined a huge redesign is required of this spacecraft. It might not be cost-effective for Boeing to march forward. So lots of questions that remain open here.",

The thrusters in question didn't make it home. They were part of a service module portion of the spacecraft which gets jettisoned right before it re- enters the atmosphere. And so the smoking gun evidence is gone, which is too bad. Now, there's been a lot of data that they've developed while it was on orbit these months as they tested various aspects of how it would fire and so forth. But I think, you know, there is a lesson here on -- from NASA's perspective on how much it can safely afford to have a hands- off approach to building spacecraft. It has had great success doing the same type of contracting with SpaceX. But SpaceX comes at it as a much more nimble completely vertically integrated organization. They build everything themselves. Boeing a more traditional contractor with subcontractors in this case the thrusters built by Rocketdyne and perhaps not able to manage the -- the contract, the fixed-price contract in the same way. So maybe they need to think a little differently about how they supervise these programs. KINKADE: Yeah, exactly. Great insight as always. Miles O'Brien, pleasure having you on the show.
