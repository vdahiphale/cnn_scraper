I'm Christiane Amanpour in London alongside my colleague Alex Marquardt in Washington.Now this morning, Israel remains on high alert after Iran launched and unprecedented five-hour attack on Israel. The IDF says more than 300 missiles and drones were fired. The majority were fired from Iran. Some were launched from Iraq and Yemen, they say. Only a few were able to pierce Israel's defenses hitting an airbase in the southern part of the country causing minor damage. And there are no reports of injuries suffered directly from the strikes.",

This morning, Tehran is saying that the matter has concluded and warns the U.S. and Israel against future attacks. But as we speak now, Israel's forces do remain on high alert.",

CNN's Kevin Liptak and Kylie Atwood are standing by in Washington. But we begin with Jeremy Diamond in northern Israel. So, Jeremy, you're up there. It's the border with Lebanon.

That is according, at least, to a fragmentary commentary that we've already had from Israeli officials.Now, you been up there and you've, obviously, been covering this since the heightened tensions since October 7. One of the areas of great concern for America is Israel potentially getting into a war with Hezbollah. Let's leave Iran aside for a moment. And I covered the 2006 war which they didn't win.

Now, one thing that's unclear is the extent to which Hezbollah was acting in coordination with Iran. Obviously, they closely coordinate their military operations in general, but overnight as Hezbollah appears to have launched dozens of rockets at northern Israel and the Golan Heights, they claimed that their attacks were in support of the Palestinian people, framing it in that vein, rather than as part of this large-scale attack with Iran. So, look, Israel in these latest strikes early this morning in northern Lebanon those are rare. It has happened before, however. So, it remains to be seen to what extent this could escalate further from here.",

Certainly, President Biden hoping to avoid a wider regional escalation, and he has made clear, including in his phone call with Prime Minister Netanyahu, that the U.S. will not participate in any offensive operations against Iran.I just want to read to you a little bit of the president's statement last night. He said, \"I've just spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu to reaffirm America's ironclad commitment to the security of Israel.\" The president goes on to say, \"I told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks, sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel.\" And I think reading between the lines of that statement and also in talking to American officials, the president's message here is take the win to Netanyahu. You have been successful in intercepting these hundreds of missiles and drones launched towards Israel. They did not strike anything of significance, most of them were shot down. Effectively saying that this was a success. And the president certainly trying to avoid this conflict from exploding into a wider regional conflagration. That is something that he had been trying to do since the start of this conflict. Certainly now, tensions are at among their highest point. The president, in his talks with Netanyahu, trying to emphasize the importance of not letting this spiral out any further. And certainly, today as President Biden returns to the situation room to discuss the conflict with the leaders of the G7, his message will be on the diplomatic front, to try and find ways to coordinate against Iran without turning this into a regional war. Now, we know yesterday President Biden returned urgently from his beach house in Rehoboth for these crisis meetings in the situation room. He's able to watch in real time as this unfolded. Now certainly the focus here at the White House is on how Israel respond and what that response might look like, Christiane.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. What we learned overnight from U.S. officials was that the U.S. was heavily involved in the response, the defense of Israel, alongside Israel, over the course of these five hours. With U.S. officials telling CNN that 70 drones and at least three ballistic missiles were intercepted by the U.S. over the course of this attack.And we should also note that according to President Biden in that statement, there were not any U.S. personnel or U.S. facilities that were struck at all, and that is significant. It obviously contributes, the defense that the U.S. was able to put up, the defense that Israel was able to put up to the U.S. assessment that this was a largely unsuccessful attack by Iran. And of course, the U.S., U.S. officials, President Biden himself, have reiterated that the U.S. support for Israel, U.S. defense of Israel, remains ironclad. But of course, it is important to point out that in that phone call between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Biden, according to reporting from our colleague MJ Lee, President Biden said very clearly that the U.S. would not participate in offensive operations against Iran. So, the U.S. is standing on Israel's side here, but also essentially saying, we're not going to go with you if you decide any counterattack is necessary here. The U.S. is pushing in conversations with allies in the region as they have been doing over the course of the last a week or so to try and de-escalate this situation. The secretary of state put out in a statement last night, of course, condemning this attack by Iran, but also saying that he would be in touch with his partners in the region and around the world as the U.S. is pushing not to escalate this conversation. And it's also worth noting that today all eyes will be on that diplomatic response. As you guys were saying, the G7 will be meeting today. And we'll watch to see what the White House says out of that.",

And Lebanon is where we find our senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman, who joins me now from Beirut.

And we understand that the Israelis are getting impatient. The government -- Benjamin Netanyahu is under intense pressure from the tens of thousands of Israelis who have fled their homes in the northern part of the country. And therefore increasingly, there are messages being sent that Israel's tolerance is wearing thin and that they could launch some sort of operation in the southern part of the country to try to drive Hezbollah out. But if we go back to history in 2006 there was a more than month-long war between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel was -- really failed in achieving its objective of destroying Hezbollah.

It is like the focus has shifted significantly.Now, of course, as you say, there are still hundreds of thousands of people on the brink of famine in Gaza. Northern Gaza is still an utter catastrophe when it comes to innocent civilians there with no food, no water, and no shelter. You have countries like Jordan, for example. They have been integral in trying to get airdrops of food and water into northern Gaza. They've been working with many countries around the region, around the world, including the United States, to make that happen. And yet overnight they were embroiled in what was happening with these Iranian strikes. They say that they had to work to shoot down what they call some foreign objects flying into their airspace.

We have seen Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu throughout the course of this war in Gaza time and time again ignore the pleas and the urging of the Biden Administration primarily around the question of aid getting into Gaza as well as avoiding Palestinian casualties.
