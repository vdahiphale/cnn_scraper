I'm Kim Brunhuber, live in Atlanta.We're following the latest developments in the Middle East, following the Israeli airstrike in Lebanon that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Now, the Israeli strikes have been going on for days now, and they're showing no signs of letting up, despite new fears of wider war in the region. Have a look here. We have new video from Lebanon showing some of the damage from today's Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon. Lebanon's state news agency says the Sunday strikes have killed at least 10 people. Meanwhile, we've just heard from the IDF that a number of projectiles have been fired from Lebanon into Israel. Now, all this is happening as the U.S. says Israel is moving troops to the border with Lebanon, a possible sign of preparations for a cross-border incursion. Israel says a ground operation is only one of the options it's considering. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESPERSON: We need to understand there's a huge amount of different tools that we have in our toolbox. Ground operations is one of them. We are preparing for that, if it is required, if we receive the instructions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This one, Nabil Qaouk, is head of the Preventative Security Unit. According to the IDF, they say that he is close to the top of the leadership in Hezbollah.So just another example of how many of these commanders the Israeli military is targeting at this point. Now, it comes, of course, just two days after Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, was targeted as well. And there have been commanders of different parts of this group being assassinated over recent weeks, which the Israeli military says is weakening and has severely weakened Hezbollah itself. Now, at this point, we do understand that there is activity on both sides of the border. We know that Israel has been targeting, it says, a number of infrastructure facilities, also a number of launches and also, they say, weapons caches. And there have been a number of missiles coming from the Lebanese side as well, so from Hezbollah. Even with this aerial bombardment by Israel, we are still seeing Hezbollah firing these missiles into northern Israel. In fact, a little earlier today, Hezbollah did say that they had fired a long- range missile towards the Jerusalem area, the Israeli military confirming that they had, in fact, taken down and intercepted something in that area. So a reminder that Hezbollah does have these long-range missiles as well. Well, the big question, though, of course, is whether or not the Israeli military is going to carry out a ground invasion to follow up on this aerial bombardment that we have been seeing over recent days. Let's listen to the IDF. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm delighted that he joins us now from Jerusalem. And thank you for joining us this Sunday morning. As Israel reserves the right to go into Lebanon with troops on the ground, that is only one of a number of operational options. Meantime, information coming in that another key Hezbollah asset has been assassinated in Lebanon. Also news that Hezbollah has been involved in further strikes on Israel. What's your perspective on what has been achieved to date? AVI MAYER, FORMER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, JERUSALEM POST: Well, Becky, it's important to realize that Hezbollah is not in fact Iran's last line of defense, rather its first line of offense against the state of Israel. For the past 11 and a half, nearly 12 months, Hezbollah has subjected northern Israel to a constant bombardment, forcing 1% of Israel's entire population to flee, essentially depopulating that area. And so there's a great deal of relief in Israel, but also around the region. The elimination of Hassan Nasrallah. Of course, we've seen celebrations in Syria, where Hezbollah was actively involved in the Assad regime's campaign of oppression and elimination in that country. And so I think what you're seeing now is the possibility for a new beginning. I know Israeli officials are talking about some kind of a new arrangement on the northern border in accordance with U.N. Resolution 1701 that would push Hezbollah up past Litani River, where it's supposed to be, and replace it with the Lebanese army, asserting that country's sovereignty in that region. One can only hope that that's what will happen at this point.",

It enables Israel to decompress in the north, perhaps enabling it to refocus on the south and focusing on exactly what it is that Israel wants as an endgame.I would look past the rhetoric being heard from some Arab leaders at this time. I think, as you said earlier, there's widespread relief across the region at the elimination of Hezbollah, which, of course, was a key asset, remains, to some extent, a key asset of Iran, but has been significantly weakened. I think that does open the door towards more moderate influences in this region, hopefully towards some kind of de-escalation and a ceasefire agreement between Israel, Hamas, and other players in the region.",

And you saw these dueling sentiments reflected in the President's statement that was released almost 24 hours after that operation in Beirut, the President saying that \"his death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians.\" The President says, \"Hassan Nasrallah and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror.\" But the President also goes on to say that, \"ultimately our aim is to de-escalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means. It's time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability.\" And it was interesting to hear from President Biden on Saturday as he was leaving church in Delaware describing his ultimate goal for the region.

There's no greater act of disloyalty than to extinguish the sovereignty of your own nation right through your border. No matter what lies she tells, Kamala Harris, can never be forgiven for her erasing our border, and she must never be allowed to become president of the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Adams pleaded not guilty to five federal corruption charges Friday, and he says he has no plans to resign, but the decision may be out of his hands. New York Governor Kathy Hochul may make the decision for him. We got details from CNN's Gloria Pazmino. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT The Mayor kept a pretty low profile here in New York City on Saturday. He went to church when he was entering church. He was asked whether or not he would resign. The Mayor did not answer the question. But we know from his comments in the past few days that he has no intention of stepping down and that he is going to fight these charges. At least he has said that he has every intention to do so. And we got a chance to listen and learn a little bit about what the defense in this case might look like. The Mayor was arraigned on Friday. He declared himself not guilty. And his lawyer spoke to a reporter outside of the federal courthouse, saying that the gifts and the luxury travel and the airline upgrades that are outlined in the indictment were nothing more than that, just gifts and free upgrades. He said that the political donations that the Mayor received were secured by staffers who did not tell the Mayor that they were taking donations from foreign nationals. So we're starting to see just how the Mayor may potentially be defending himself in this case. I want you to take a listen to Alex Spiro, who is representing Eric Adams, shortly after the arraignment on Friday. Take a listen.",

There are no emails, text messages, or any corroboration whatsoever that the mayor knew about anything having to do with these campaign donations. The entire body of evidence is one staffer. One staffer that says there was a conversation. What you have not learned is that that staffer has lied, and the government is in possession of that lie.(END VIDEO CLIP)",
