Pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets all over the UnitedStates this weekend, as President Biden tried to defend his support for Israel, amid a growing divide in his party over Israel's war against Hamas, which has led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and the death of thousands of civilians in Gaza. The World Health Organization says the Al Shifa Hospital, targeted by Israel as a Hamas headquarters, is now -- quote -- \"a death zone.\" And hours ago, 31 neonatal babies finally were evacuated from inside the hospital. Also in Northern Gaza -- and I want to warn you this footage that I'm about to show you, it's very disturbing. A horrifying new video showed dozens of bodies, including women and children, lying amid wreckage and covered in dust after a blast rocked a U.N. school that was, according to U.N. authorities, being used as a shelter. The U.N. said it did not know who was responsible for the incident. The Israeli military said it was reviewing what happened. On Saturday, President Biden again rejected calls for a cease-fire in the war, President Biden writing in \"The Washington Post\" that -- quote -- \"A cease-fire is not peace.\" He underlined his support for a two-state solution in the long term, as his administration is working hard to strike a deal between Hamas and Israel to release the hundreds of hostages still being held in Gaza in exchange for some form of pause in the hostilities. And joining me now is the U.S. deputy national security adviser, Jon Finer. Jon, thanks for joining us. So what is the state of negotiations as of this morning? Is there a deal imminent? JON FINER, U.S. PRINCIPAL DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  Thanks, Jake. So I think you heard probably the prime minister of Qatar speak to this earlier today. They have been extremely close, obviously, to these negotiations, as we have. The United States has been following this minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour up to the level of the president, for whom this is a major overriding priority, obviously, in part because there are a number of Americans who are in this horrific situation. What I can say about this at this time is, we think that we are closer than we have been perhaps at any point since these negotiations began weeks ago, that there are areas of difference and disagreement that have been narrowed, if not closed out entirely, but that the mantra that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed certainly applies here to such a sensitive negotiation. And there is no deal currently in place. We are going to keep at this intensively over the course of the coming hours and days. We believe it is imperative, given how dangerous the situation is in Gaza, to get these people home as soon as we possibly can, but we are not across the line and we are going to stay on top of it.",

But we do believe that there is a significant number of Americans being held, that those Americans are our highest priority, the president's highest priority. They include, by the way, a 3-year-old girl who is an orphan because her parents were murdered by Hamas on October 7.

What I can say at this point -- and we're also in touch with the Israelis to try to find out what they know about what happened -- is that, if harm was done to innocent civilians sheltering at a U.N. site, that would be totally unacceptable.

The president has raised those concerns directly with the prime minister. So, for us, it is less about a real-time assessment and much more about an ongoing process to try to steer things in the best possible direction, including for whatever combat remains during the course of this conflict.

And, last night, former President Trump urged his supporters in Iowa to help him seal up the nomination in mid-January. But with the fierce battle under way between two of his rivals, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says he is still the one that has the best chance to challenge and defeat Donald Trump. And he says Trump's attacks against him prove it. Joining us now from Iowa is Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida. Thanks so much, Governor. I want to start on Israel. President Biden is out with a new op-ed this week. He calls for a two-state solution, ultimately. Even before the October 7 attacks, you have cast doubt on President Biden's calls for a two-state solution. How do you think this should end, then, for the Palestinians? Do you think Israel should occupy the Gaza Strip? What's your view of what comes after Hamas is defeated?",

And so you don't want a two-state that ends up just being a stepping-stone to the destruction of Israel. I don't think that that should be contingent on any aid that they pursue that. And I would also note, Jake, for many, many decades, people in D.C. said, you're never going to be able to have relations in the Middle East between Israel and any other country unless you had that. And yet we saw under the Trump administration the Abraham Accords, where they were able to make peace with many countries in the Middle East and probably would have ended up being able to do it with Saudi Arabia had we not had the October 7 attack. Now, going forward, I think Israel needs to do what it's going to -- what is best to defend themselves. I would note Gaza was not under Israeli occupation. They pulled out in 2006. They uprooted thousands of their own Israeli citizens and forced them to leave the Gaza Strip. And the idea was, give the Arabs down there an opportunity to make something of it. And, unfortunately, they turned to Hamas. And Hamas used money to build a big terrorist infrastructure and ultimately wage attacks for many years, and then the devastating October 7 attack. Israel cannot allow history to repeat itself.",

And Israel is in a situation where they suffered the biggest attack on Jews since the Holocaust. You have an organization in Hamas that wants to wipe Israel totally off the map. This is not just some minor dispute. This is an existential threat to the survival of the world's only Jewish state.

For example, he said he was going to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. Jake, he didn't build the wall, and Mexico sure didn't pay for it, because you would not have been able to have eight million people come in illegally if we had a fully constructed wall. He also said he would drain the swamp, and yet the swamp is more powerful than ever. So, he didn't do it the first time. I don't know what makes you think he's going to do it this time.

Donald Trump's a high-risk proposition as a nominee, because I think the chance of him getting elected is small.

Joining me now, Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin in Maryland. He was the lead manager of Trump's second impeachment. And, Congressman, I will get to that ruling in a moment. I also want to start -- I want to talk about Israel. But you wanted to weigh in on the interview I just did with Governor DeSantis, specifically about Elon Musk. What did you want to say? REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  Well, the guys running for president, and Elon Musk did that on Wednesday. It's Sunday, so this is four days later. And he has not had the chance to read what Elon Musk wrote? That is very hard for me to believe. In any event, you showed it to him, and he still refused to condemn it. So, if you're serious about condemning and confronting antisemitism and racism and these bigotries which are the gateway to destruction of liberal democracy, you have got to be explicit and open and full- throated about it, and you have got to denounce antisemitism and racism across the board.",
