And it's significant not just because it represents, they say, a significant change in the way that the war is going to be fought in Gaza but also because it comes on the eve of these talks.So it's -- what we're hearing from the IDF perhaps sets a new scene or a new dynamic around those talks tables. We're right now outside of the base -- witness the military trucks -- outside of the 98th Division base. And over my shoulder here, Matthias (ph) might be able to zoom in a little there and see the tanks. And what the IDF is saying at the moment is they withdrawn their ground force from Khan Younis, effectively marking an end of the ground operations in Gaza in their current form. That's significant. That's significant language. Now, we've been along the border today. We've literally been at the fence where the wire opens, where troops come and go from Gaza. We haven't seen big numbers of troops leaving. We haven't seen tanks where you're looking at them right now. And we have seen the sound of Israeli fighter jets and we've witnessed the huge explosions of impacts inside of Gaza in the Khan Younis area. And what the IDF is saying, they leave behind. Even though the 98th is pulling out, they say they leave behind significant forces in the north of Gaza, the Nahal Brigade, the 162nd Division, significant IDF forces in the northern part of Gaza. This, of course, raises many questions. What about the anticipated offensive that the IDF says that they want on Rafah in the south? None of that is clear. So we're here. We're going to be looking around for the movement of those troops, but a significant statement so far from the IDF.",

The rest of the country, Monday is really going to be focused across the area from Texas all the way up to main and whether or not we may have clouds or even rain that could block that viewing of the solar eclipse. Again, we've got severe storm potential on the southern side. This does include the potential for very large hail, possibly up to about tennis ball size, damaging winds and isolated tornadoes. So that could impact some of the areas. The storms themselves are expected to be after the eclipse. But a lot of times you get those clouds that build in ahead of time, but also to as people are leaving, they could encounter some of those strong storms.

This is, you said turbulent, that puts it mildly.This Congress has been at war with each other, Republicans, in particular, in the House, over the direction, over their leadership. Of course, there was an unprecedented ouster of Kevin McCarthy last fall. And this could -- we could see another unprecedented event, an ouster of a second House speaker because of his -- Mike Johnson's handling over keeping the government open last month that caused uprising in the ranks, particularly among Marjorie Taylor Greene. She has the power as any one individual member does to call for a vote seeking his ouster. Now, she has not said when she would do that. She indicated to me last week that she still plans to press ahead. The two have talked. It's uncertain what her plans are. But she has warned Mike Johnson not to move forward on any aid package for Ukraine. But Johnson behind the scenes is trying to cobble together a plan that could win over Republicans and try to get something through, probably not as far as what many Democrats would like, but trying to see if there's a coalition to get this together. And here's the big question, what will Democrats do if Marjorie Taylor Greene does go ahead and tries to push out Mike Johnson from the speakership? Do they come and try to do his defense? They tried to kill the measure to try to oust him and they might decide to side with Johnson depending on how he handles the issue of Ukraine. So such a tricky balancing act for Mike Johnson, who has faced enormous pressure to act on aid for Ukraine along with Israel and Taiwan. Of course, the bipartisan Senate bill that passed earlier this year has been stalled in the house. Johnson's trying to figure out this new approach. But as you can see, the political dynamics are very tricky to say the least. Yes, tricky and tenuous, of course. And on the other side, you have new reporting, Manu, first on CNN, that the Super PAC linked to Hakeem Jeffries is reserving, what, $150 million or so for TV ads across the country for what they're calling trench warfare. This is to win back the House majority in the fall. But the GOP Super PAC is saying that they're not too worried. Walk us through the scope of that money.",
