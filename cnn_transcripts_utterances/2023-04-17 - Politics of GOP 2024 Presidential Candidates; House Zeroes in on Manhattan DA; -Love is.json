Than January 6th committee, which was completely partisan. In spite of all that, I still didn't tell the committee that I wouldn't testify when they asked me.

So, we do see that in 2022 their subscriber base did grow by 4 percent. But, look at this, what we essentially see is the growth is decelerating right back in 2020. It was 22 percent, 9 percent in 2021, just 4 percent this year. So, I think there's some question, right? Will this type of event makes people less likely to want to watch Netflix?And here's the other thing I'll note. You know, regularly live streaming, right? Amazon has NFL games. Apple has MLB games. Netflix, this is really only the second major event that they've live streamed, right? The other one was the Chris Rock stand up special, which I think a lot of people enjoyed. So, I think there's this real question over whether Netflix is actually in the game to actually be able to do live stream and do it successfully.
