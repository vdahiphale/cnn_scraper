      "sentences": "Georgia back in play. The new data backing the vibes as Harris hits the state and gets ready for her first interview right here on CNN. Also, tonight, a political mystery in Florida enters day number 20. Why hasn't Donald Trump revealed his stance on the state's abortion amendment? And a trip down memory lane you won't want to miss, 10 years since the scandal that shook Washington D.C. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"Georgia, Georgia, President Donald Trump cannot win this election unless he wins Georgia. Now, that's not me saying that, as a fact. That's what the top Republican in the state believes. Governor Brian Kemp said the following this very week, saying -- quote -- \"There's no path for former President Trump to win or any Republican to get to 270 without Georgia.\" You know who else might know that? The Harris campaign. They're now stepping on the gas in the battleground state, literally. Vice President Harris and Governor Tim Walz spent today on a bus traveling the southern part of Georgia near Savannah, topping out a high school band practice, a barbecue pit. They're targeting rural parts that tend to vote Republican. And they know they may not win these pockets. I think the thinking goes, if they lose some by less, that could be all the difference in a state that was just won by under 12,000 votes the last time. Now, it is not just the vibes that have Democrats thinking the state is suddenly in play. It's also the numbers. A brand-new Fox News poll out tonight has Harris up 50 to 48. It's within the margin of error, so technically tied. But look at your screen. There is no denying that she has changed the race. When Fox polled Georgia back in April, Trump was up 51 to 45 against President Biden. That's outside that margin of error. So, Harris and Walz tomorrow will keep stepping on the gas in Georgia with the second day of their bus tour. And there will be one very, very important pitstop along the way, their joint interview with my colleague, Dana Bash, that will air right here on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern. It'll be Harris's first interview since becoming the official nominee. Well, Democratic Congresswoman Lucy McBath of the state of Georgia joins me now. She's a member of the House Judiciary Committee and also has endorsed the Harris-Walz ticket. Congresswoman, thank you so much for joining me this evening. And also, as a personal note, I have to tell you, in watching your presentation and your statements at the DNC, I cannot imagine a more poignant moment at any convention to describe your son, to describe the loss that you and the other mothers and parents and a teacher experience, it was truly eye-opening, and I hope that you have received the appreciation from those who want this to never happen again. REP. LUCY MCBATH (D-GA): Thank you so much, Laura. That means a great deal to me and so many survivors like myself. We just want to make sure that our loved ones are never forgotten, but that we do everything in our power that we can to make sure that these tragedies don't happen to anyone else.",

It is going to be absolutely pivotal.Tia made an interesting point earlier today about how the fundamentals in certain cities like Atlanta have completely changed and made the state really more competitive because a lot of people of color are moving there. So, it's not just enough to perform well in the suburbs as a Republican. You really have to turn out, lower those low propensity rural voters who typically don't vote in every single election, some of the gun owners in Georgia who typically don't vote in every single election. So, you're seeing the campaign spend resources there. But I do think they have to become a little bit more judicious. The Harris campaign is in South Georgia for a reason. I'm not necessarily certain that they're expecting to win South Georgia, but strategically speaking, if you can force your opponent to spend resources where they don't want to spend those resources and you have more money to spend in other places where you need to close up that gap, it does make a lot more difficult for Republicans.",

We've seen the vice president attempt to moderate and alter her positions on multiple issues she once believed in when she was a senator, positions that she held when she was a candidate for presidency the first time around, and she has changed on all of those fronts.And so, I think for some of those skeptical voters in places like Pennsylvania, where it's still very close, they want to know what would you do over four years given the opportunity that you could not have done over three and a half years as vice president. That's something that I think Republicans should really be focused more on instead of saying, well, whether or not Walz is with her or not. I think that's a moot point for voters. They want to know, what can you do to improve my lot in life in terms of cost, in terms of immigration, and in terms of foreign policy? Will we find ourselves in an expensive conflict over the next two years, potentially?

I don't think that really is in the best interest of the American people.We were just talking about Amendment 4 and what's Donald Trump's position, but the American people need to hear clearly what are Kamala Harris's positions on many issues that the president of the United States, the next one, is going to have to weigh in on. She has not let us really see any of those issues. So, I think in a debate, muted microphones are the best because both candidates need to be able to project clearly what they're going to do as the commander-in-chief. We've seen these debates in the past where they're more about hot takes and highlight reels as opposed to clear policy positions. And America needs clear decisions, clear policies, and clear leadership. Kamala Harris hasn't stipulated any of that.

So, that's not going to help. And that's not just me saying it. You have economics -- economic -- economists on the right, in the center, in the left, who are all saying that. But to a broader level, Donald Trump has been given interviews day in, day out. So, has J.D. Vance. People know what Donald Trump is going to do because he was already president, and he did it. His positions are on his website very, very clearly. Kamala Harris has not given any specificities, let alone any vision of what she really wants to do from a public policy position, and then you have the flip-flopping that has occurred. The pressure is on her in this debate to demonstrate. I would argue that her support right now is a mile wide, but an inch deep. The support for Donald Trump is rock solid. It is not moving.

Because if one person is in prison for a crime he didn't commit, if there's so many things around that case that says this person didn't do it, then we definitely should not put that person to death.
