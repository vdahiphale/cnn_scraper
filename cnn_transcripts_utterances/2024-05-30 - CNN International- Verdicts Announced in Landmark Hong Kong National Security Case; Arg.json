The 12-person jury met for more than four and a half hours yesterday. During that time, they asked to review four pieces of testimony. Jurors also want to rehear a portion of the judges' instructions. The final results of South Africa's general election are expected on Sunday. A record number of nearly 28 million people registered to vote. And for the first time in three decades, the ruling African National Congress is facing a serious threat to its hold on power. New Delhi sweltering under record heat. India's capital recorded a high of 52 degrees Celsius on Wednesday. Parts of northwestern India are also facing an unprecedented heat wave. But forecasters believe that area could get some relief in the days ahead. In a major blow to Hong Kong's democratic opposition movement, a court has handed down guilty verdicts to 14 of the 16 opposition figures charged with subversion in a landmark national security case. The defendants were amongst 47 arrested in 2021 for organizing an unofficial primary election ahead of Hong Kong's legislative vote. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, 31 had already pleaded guilty to charges of subversion, including the high-profile activist Joshua Wong.Now, 16 had pleaded not guilty. But of the 16, 14 were found to be guilty on charges of subversion today, including the former journalist Gwyneth Ho, as well as the former opposition lawmaker known as \"Long Hair.\" Sentencing will come next. Now, security has been tight. We have been watching hundreds of people pour in to witness the proceedings, including diplomats from the United States, the EU and elsewhere. And then there was that moment in the courtroom when the verdict was read out loud. Some family members of defendants wept and cried openly upon hearing the news that their loved ones could very well be facing life in prison. This has been a long legal ordeal. It all dates back to over three years ago, January of 2021, when 47 pro-democracy figures were arrested in a dawn raid. They were charged with conspiracy to commit subversion, which is a serious crime here in Hong Kong, under the national security law. It's punishable by up to life in prison. They were accused of staging an unofficial primary vote, which was deemed illegal by authorities here. Now, the national security law was imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong in 2020 in the wake of the massive anti-government protests of 2019. Critics say it has dismantled the opposition. It has crushed dissent. Supporters say it restored law and order, with authorities saying it's a matter of national security as they warn against any foreign interference. But observers say that this case is a significant test of Hong Kong's judicial independence. Watch this.",

Officials say North Korea deployed 10 short-range projectiles, which flew about 350 kilometers and landed in the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan. South Korea condemned the launches and also accused the north of jamming GPS radio wave signals for two days straight, but says its military operations were unaffected.Meanwhile, South Korea has issued a sharp warning to North Korea to immediately halt the floating bags of filth that it's been sending over the border. The latest images show a large trash-carrying balloon, really, that landed near Seoul, just one of the more than 260 balloons North Korea has deployed into the south.
