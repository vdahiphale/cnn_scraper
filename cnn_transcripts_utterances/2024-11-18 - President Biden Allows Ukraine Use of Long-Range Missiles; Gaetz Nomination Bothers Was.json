Just ahead, a policy U-turn from the White House as President Biden gives the green light for Ukraine to use long-range Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia. But will it actually be a game changer on the battlefield?Some of Donald Trump's most controversial cabinet picks are coming under more fire in Washington. And Israeli airstrikes pound Beirut killing a Hezbollah spokesperson while talks continue on a possible ceasefire. Good to have you with us. First this hour, a major change in U.S. policy at a critical time in Russia's war on Ukraine. President Joe Biden, for the first time, is allowing Kyiv to use long-range U.S. weapons to strike deeper inside Russia. The decision had been under consideration for months as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed Washington for the green light in hopes of gaining momentum in the war. But U.S. officials have been divided and concerned it could escalate the conflict. The weapons, which are said to have a range of about 190 miles, are expected to be used primarily in Russia's Kursk region for now. That's where Russian forces are looking to take back territory alongside North Korean troops who've joined the Russian offensive. President Zelensky y had this message after news of the U.S. decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, everybody who is an expert in the, you know, military expert is saying probably not. There are some questions, you know, especially about how many weapons there actually are that Ukraine could use. They are very expensive. It takes quite a while to produce them. Ukraine only apparently has a few. Actually, even the United States, some here in the United States, say that the United States could be limited in the amount that it could provide. So, there are questions, but it is no issue here that this is a major decision by Biden and it comes at a critical time. I mean, you have a new incoming U.S. president.

And so that's the debate right now. But there's no question that with just two months to go, it does leave Trump with probably an escalated war.

Patel has no law enforcement experience, but he does check one box that's huge for the incoming president, an eagerness to retaliate against Donald Trump's perceived enemies.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Putting someone like Kash Patel in the position of director of the FBI is I believe, extremely, extremely dangerous because you just alluded to that his resume isn't as traditional.There is nothing on his resume other than three years as a line U.S. attorney at the DOJ. He has no experience leading an organization, no less a Cub Scout pack, to put him in front of the lead law enforcement agency in the United States, and some consider the world to have him in charge of so many employees, and he has clearly stated that he wants to exact revenge upon those that have investigated President Trump and those investigated, those that are around him. He will conduct a massive amount of damage to the interior of the FBI, looking after employees who have put their names on certain documents because they were just working the case. There will be hundreds of employees who will be unjustly fired or have their security clearances removed. Only because he feels that its something he needs to do. So I think he would be very, very dangerous. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

At least 39 cases have been reported across 18 states since early September, and one person has died. The outbreak has been linked to Grimmway Farms, a carrot producer in California, which announced a recall over the weekend. It says the carrots are likely no longer in stores, but may still be in peoples homes. It's urging people to throw them out or return them to the store, and to clean any surfaces the carrots have touched.

So, more than a quarter came back with lead levels above the limit for tap water that are set by the EPA. Now, since then the city has gone back to retest some of these homes. And officials have said that some of the tests were administered erroneously and that the water is safe to drink. But residents in the city remain skeptical and want the city to take action.",

Many of these pipes, pipes are still made of lead. Now, the EPA mandates that when cities find these elevated levels, that they put plans into action, including public education, campaign and making sure that they put a plan in place to replace some of these old pipes. But the city residents want the city to declare a state of emergency. This would allow federal and local funding to be made available so that the replacement projects can happen a lot faster.
