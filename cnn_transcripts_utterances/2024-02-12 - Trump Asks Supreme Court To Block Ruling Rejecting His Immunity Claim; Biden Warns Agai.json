He's attempting to block a lower court ruling that flatly rejected his claim of presidential immunity in the federal election subversion case.Also breaking, President Biden publicly warns Israel against the ground offensive in the Gaza city of Rafah unless there's a credible plan to protect Palestinian civilians, this just hours after deadly airstrikes on Rafah in connection with an Israeli rescue operation that freed two Israeli hostages. And Nikki Haley is slamming Donald Trump tonight, telling CNN his threat to let Russia attack NATO countries is unthinkable. We're following all the new reaction that Trump's incendiary remarks and fears he'd abandon U.S. allies if he's president again. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. And let's get right to the breaking news. Donald Trump is taking his fight for immunity to the U.S. Supreme Court. CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid is here with us. Paula, today was the deadline for this filing. What are Trump's attorneys now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to do?",

Circuit Court of Appeals found that Trump does not have immunity, and we know that the strategy for former President Trump is to delay, delay, delay. They are trying everything they can to push this case back until after the November 2024 election. And they're going to exercise every option they have signaling in this new filing that they intend to appeal formally to the Supreme Court, but also possibly go back down to the Court of Appeals, ask the full court to hear them. Now also interesting, Wolf, in this new filing, they also point to the political calendar. They say, quote, conducting a months-long criminal trial of President Trump at the height of election season will radically disrupt President Trump's ability to campaign against President Biden. Now, Wolf, that is significant. It echoes what we've heard from Trump repeatedly, these accusations that all of the cases against him are, quote, election interference. And I think if you see the fact that this trial is able to go on maybe in weeks or months, that is going to become their new legal argument. It's going to go from just delay, delay to you can't possibly do this because you're interfering with the election.",

Now, you've got Donald Trump, he's like a crazy interior decorator who wants to knock out every post and every pillar to make the house better, he's going to collapse the whole house. And we aren't making the case for these institutions. When he attacks them, he's attacking the basis of American peace, strength and prosperity, and he's not being called on that. We call him reckless. He's going to get you killed. He's going to make you less safe. He's going to collapse the world economy. He's doing stuff that's really reckless because people don't understand the importance of these institutions he's attacking.",

So, there's not that much rearranging of the furniture you can do in a campaign like this where you have basically almost 100 percent name recognition for both candidates. I think the Republican Party has decided that they want to get on the Trump train and see where it goes.But I got to tell you, I'm very proud of Nikki Haley. I say it as a Democrat. Somebody who's sticking up for the basic institutions that our parents and grandparents fought for, the world order that our parents and our grandparents gave blood and treasure for, defending America, defending those ideals, defending those -- and, frankly, as he was saying, defending the lives of our soldiers and Air Force and Marines, and those folks, they deserve somebody stick up for them because Trump is not sticking up for them. He's not sticking up for a dad gum thing that America has achieved in the past 50 years. And it sounds funny, whatever, but this -- screw NATO, that is the defund the police of the right. It sounds good, but if you actually defunded the police, it would be a terrible outcome. Screw NATO, sounds good. If you screw NATO, you're going to be in so many wars, you won't be able to count them. And so it's become fashionable and cute and funny to do all the stuff that Trump does.

Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining us. In its operation to free two Israeli hostages, Israel also launched strikes, killing about 100 Palestinians in Rafah. We're seeing devastating videos. We've showed them to our viewers of bloody children and crowded hospitals. Congresswoman, was this a proportionate use of force? REP. ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-VA): What we know is it is important that Israel work to try and get the hostages home. Director of CIA Burns has been doing extraordinary work negotiating, trying to bring them home. But death of civilians, particularly children, like we are seeing right now in Rafah, has to make everyone just take a deep breath and determine how is it that Israel can achieve the goal of bringing home hostages, but also protect civilian lives, particularly children. And I think the president's statement that it is so imperative to protect civilians, Palestinian civilians, is a clear call, an important statement to make. And, certainly, as we continue to see potential additional efforts to bring hostages home, and as Israel continues to go after the Hamas terrorists who perpetuated the attack in October, it's important, it has always been, and it continues to be important to protect civilians, particularly Palestinian children on the ground in Gaza.",
