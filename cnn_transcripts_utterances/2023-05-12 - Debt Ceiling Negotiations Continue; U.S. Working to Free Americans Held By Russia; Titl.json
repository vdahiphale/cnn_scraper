      "sentences": "Well, listen, what the Biden administration is doing here is casting a really wide net, going to allies around the world, particularly those who have recently arrested Russian spies, because, as you said, Brianna, the United States doesn't have any high-level Russian spies in their custody.And they know that that is what Russia is going to want in terms of a potential prisoner swap for Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. So, their outreach extends to countries including Brazil, Germany, Norway, also a former Soviet bloc state. And we have learned that those discussions are really ongoing right now. In the case of Germany, we know that the United States went to Germany -- it was last summer -- for Vadim Krasikov. He is a Russian spy who is in German custody charged with murder. But, obviously, those efforts didn't really go anywhere, in terms of Germany playing ball to offer him up, because that was essentially more than half-a- year ago. We don't know the status of the conversations with the other countries right now. But it's also important that the administration is also going to allies who don't have Russian spies and essentially trying to see if they have anything that they can offer on the table to give the United States leverage at the negotiating table, to essentially gin up some creative offers to Russia as they try and come up with some deals that could secure the release of these two Americans who are wrongfully detained in Russia -- Brianna.",

      "sentences": "That is such a great question, and I think that really gets at the detail of these ongoing negotiations.We simply don't know what the United States is offering right now. In the case of some of these countries, the United States does have an extradition treaty with these countries. So they have actually requested the extradition of some of these Russian spies to the United States. That is following all legalities, and then they could potentially trade them with the Russians once they're in U.S. custody. But if the countries are willing to play ball before that happens, they don't necessarily have to be extradited to the U.S. for this to actually happen -- Brianna.",

Meanwhile, the clock keeps ticking toward what would be a potentially catastrophic default if they don't reach agreement as early as June 1. That's just 20 days away. Big stakes for the country, for the world, arguably. CNN's Lauren Fox joins us now from Capitol Hill. So, I see delay, and that you could think well -- well, they're not talking to each other that's bad, or that, at lower levels they're trying to work on something before they put the leaders together. So what do we know about why this was delayed?",
