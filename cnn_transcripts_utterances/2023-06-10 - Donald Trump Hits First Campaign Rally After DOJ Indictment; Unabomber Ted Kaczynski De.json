CNN's Kristen Holmes is there while Daniel Dale joins me here on set to fact-check some of Trump's claims that he has just made. Kristen Holmes, I want to go to you first.

He has been warned or at least advised by legal advisers about what he says, to watch what he says, that it could be used against him if there is inevitable trial. However, it doesn't seem to be stopping him from almost saying anything. He spent the first 40 minutes of this speech talking about various legal battles, not just that federal indictment, and also talking about the 2020 rigged election. He said again that this is a joke of indictment. He said all that it's done is raise his polls, his fundraising is through the roof, which of course we won't know until see those filings. He said that in the end they're not coming after me, they're coming after you. and I am just standing in the way. And he went after Jack Smith, calling him deranged, saying he and his wife are Trump haters. And we actually also heard an argument that we've just started hearing from Trump. It's relatively new after that document was unsealed essentially him saying that he couldn't have done anything wrong because the boxes were in plain view when he left the White House. Take a listen.

But they were literally sitting outside of the White House waiting for a truck to come. Then the truck come. It was after a long time. And they put it in and they brought it down to Florida.

First thing you learn is don't put them on the sidewalk in front of the White House.

So what happened with Trump was extraordinary. And number two, this idea that oh, they were just negotiating, and then all of a sudden there was a raid. Remember the \"Seinfeld\" Yada Yada episode?

They could give them to me, they could throw them in the trash, they could set them on fire.What Biden did instead was donate them to his alma mater, the University of Delaware. They're not a secret. They've been there since 2012. The university published an article at that point on its Web site. And another key thing here, Alex, is that President Trump -- he's suggesting there might be classified documents in here. There's no indication of that to date. In fact, President Biden and his legal team consented to two FBI searches at the University of Delaware, and in February a source told CNN's Paula Reid that there was no initial indication there was anything classified in there let alone all 1850 boxes has been classified as has been suggested repeatedly by Trump and his allies.",

She was very harshly criticized by the court of appeals for her rulings which were outside the bounds of what we would expect from a judge.So I think that's a positive development for him. I do think it's even more of an indication that if he wants to, that he's going to be able to delay this case until after the election. But at the same time, you know, it's going to be very challenging and I think the court of appeals ruling is an indication of the fact that that judge is not going to be able to save him necessarily from an indictment. And at the end of the day, you know, there's also the potential she could be replaced on the case.

She, you know, I think exercised poor judgment and obviously the court of appeals agreed including multiple Trump appointees agreed with that assessment.And so I don't want to predict that she's going to suddenly exercise good judgment, although I think that would make a lot of sense here for her to, you know, go out of her way to show that she is in fact fair and that she's going to give him a fair hearing, but nothing more than that.",

It's expected he'll be formally arrested, processed and have his initial appearance in that same building.CNN's Shimon Prokupecz joins us now. Shimon, law enforcement, they have had to scramble to come up with a plan for Tuesday because they didn't get a heads up this was happening. SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: No, they didn't get a heads up. In fact, on Friday, just yesterday, law enforcement officials were meeting to try and come up with this security plan. But you know, the Secret Service, it's not the first time they're doing this. They have already had experience with this in New York City in Manhattan's criminal court when the former president appeared there, was arrested and processed in much the same way that he's going to be processed here. The one thing here is that they're dealing with a much more secure area in Miami. It's a federal courthouse. There are many more restrictions. They have underground capabilities. They want to try and drive the former president underground and bring him up to a courtroom and a processing center all in the same building so that he'll never have be outside. The biggest concern is, what will happen outside? Will supporters gather? Certainly, will anyone try to start any kind of trouble? And a lot of that is because of January 6th. That is very much on the minds of many law enforcement officials as they prepare here for Tuesday.",

They'll put officers in uniform, much like we saw in New York City. Officers are normally on desk duty or in plain clothes, dresswear. They'll be told to wear their uniforms on that day. Then they'll have extra resources just around, not just around the courthouse, but in the area in case they need to mobilize. You also, Alex, have the state police, Florida, here. They'll be assisting. Then federal resources. The FPS, the Federal Protective Services, which provides security for the courthouse, part of the Homeland Security.

What we saw in an ABC/\"Washington Post\" poll was that 54 percent of Americans overall agree that he should be charged, just 38 percent said no. Of course, we have one of these splits where Republicans disagree with the public overall. Just 17 percent of Republicans believe that Trump should be charged with a crime versus the large majority of Republicans, 75 percent, who believe he should not.

Just 15 percent in New York believe he should have been charged with a crime for falsifying business records versus 17 percent federally who believe he should be charged with a crime of mishandling classified documents. So we're seeing this steady Republican base that very few think he should be charged with a crime. Of course, overall, again, there's that clear majority that believes he should be.

They went up. He had 47 percent on average in the Republican primary polls. Today, he's at 53 percent. What we saw of Ron DeSantis was his numbers went down. Trump's lead went from 17 points to 31 points. If we see that type of bump again, I'm not quite sure if anyone can stay completive with Trump in the Republican primary race. I think Republicans would be happy if Trump didn't see his poll numbers move at all. But the idea that they would move down, history does not suggest that that's likely to happen.

Biden had a one-point lead. Basically, a dead heat. Look where we are today. Those numbers did not move. In fact, if anything, there was slight movement in Trump's direction. We stand at a tie today in the national polls, 46 percent to 46 percent. So just because you see the American public believing Trump should be charged down in Miami, do not necessarily expect that Biden will benefit in the polls.
