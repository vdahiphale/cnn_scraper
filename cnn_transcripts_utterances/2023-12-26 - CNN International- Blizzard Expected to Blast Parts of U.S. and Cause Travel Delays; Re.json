CNN's Anna Stewart takes a trip to Silo.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): There are few industries as indulgent as the world of fine dining. You come with an empty stomach. You leave with a lighter wallet. And for a few sumptuous courses, you forget about the world outside. But these days it's hard to ignore the green impact of everything we do, including where we eat. So that's why I'm here in East London where one restaurant wants to change how you think about food.",
