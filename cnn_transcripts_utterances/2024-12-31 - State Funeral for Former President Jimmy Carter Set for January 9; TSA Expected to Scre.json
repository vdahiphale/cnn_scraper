Two others have been charged with supplying Payne with drugs during his hotel stay.

The test of the docking technology is expected to take place in a week. We have some new information on the preparations for former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's funeral. The former president will lie in repose at the Carter Center in Atlanta on January 4th. His remains will then be transferred to the U.S. Capitol, where he'll lie in state. Carter's official funeral service will take place at the National Cathedral in Washington on the 9th, where President Joe Biden will deliver the eulogy.

The Department of Aviation here in the city says that between O'Hare and Midway, which is the other local airport here, they expect to process around 3.6 million passengers between December 20th and January 2nd. That is a big jump from the number that they processed in 2023.Here at O'Hare, for example, they think they're going to process around 3 million passengers, a more than 7 percent increase from the same travel season in 2023. So obviously a very big jump. Throughout the day we have seen big crowds. We've seen thin crowds right now. We're in a bit of a lull here. So you can take a look. You can see it's not exactly shoulder to shoulder. There are, you know, groups of people, but it's definitely not packed. Certainly not as packed as we often see at O'Hare. The good news is security has been running pretty smoothly. I mean, at most we've seen today, you know, five minutes through security, 15 minutes through security. We really haven't seen those security times increase that much. What we know is that nationwide this can look very different depending on where you are. So nationwide, there have been thousands of delays, at least 105 cancellations within the United States, into and out of the United States. So for some people, it is a little bit tricky out there. But for the most part, the people that we've spoken with are keeping good spirits. I mean, we spoke with one family who said that they were on their way to Scottsdale, Arizona. They were delayed, but they said, look, it's vacation and keep a positive attitude no matter what. That's what makes it fun. So good attitudes, certainly making the journey part of the destination. Nationwide, again, another very busy travel season. On December 29th alone, TSA processed about 2.8 million people. So that is a big jump from that same number that they processed, that same date from 2023. So again, December 29th, 2.8 million passengers, a big jump from December 29th, 2023. This has been a record-breaking holiday season, beginning in Thanksgiving, running all the way through New Year's. The hope is that this smooth process, these, you know, pretty minimal cancellations, you know, somewhat minimal to moderate delays, don't extend much farther, because that is the last thing you want is to end your holiday weekend with a major travel delay. But so far, like I said, people we've spoken with are in good spirits. Whitney Wild, CNN, Chicago. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
