We'll be checking with him in just a moment as the Justice Department though winds down its prosecutions of President-Elect Donald Trump. We're learning that Special Counsel Jack Smith intends to step down and leave his post before Trump takes office and gets the chance to fire him. It's something that Trump promised to do in, quote, \"two seconds.\"Joining me now to talk about this defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Shan Wu, CNN legal commentator and former Trump attorney Tim Parlatore, and former Republican congressman and CNN legal commentator -- political commentator, I should say, Adam Kinzinger. Guys thanks very much for being with us this morning. Shan, what do you think about Jack Smith stepping down now? What do you make of that?",

There's been, you know, the filings in the January 6th case with all of the -- you know, the appendix. I think a lot of it, the public has already seen.And so, you know, yes, he is required by the statute to fill out a report and the A.G. will look at it and decide what part of that, if any, to release.

I mean, you served on the January 6th Committee and you heard during this campaign, Trump making promises throughout the campaign to pardon January 6th rioters. I mean, if these pardons happen, what does that say about the rule of law in this country?ADAM KINZINGER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE (R-IL):  Well, look, I mean, first off, by the way the special counsel should release his report and you're going to amazingly see people that were all for transparency under the last administration all of a sudden be against transparency, surprisingly. But look, the -- Donald Trump ran on this. I mean, the one thing you got to say is it's not like pardoning the January 6th folks was something that he kind of hid and he gave, no, he straight up said this at rallies and America elected him, that's America's right to choose. So, yes, I think it's terrible for the rule of law. It basically says, if you break the law on behalf of somebody that's going to come to power or is in power, don't worry about the consequences. I think it's terrible for the rule of law, but the American people made this decision. He didn't hide this. You can't have gone and voted for him and said, gosh, I didn't know. America gets to make the decision in terms of what it looks like. From the January 6th Committee perspective, and to an extent I'm proud because we will be the only basically official record on record to basically talk about what happened January 6th. So, I know that the history books, despite people's momentary anger or whatever, the history books will reflect accurately what happened on January 6th, and I'm proud to be part of that.",

It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated. So, there aren't enough lesbians in San Francisco to man the 82nd Airborne.
