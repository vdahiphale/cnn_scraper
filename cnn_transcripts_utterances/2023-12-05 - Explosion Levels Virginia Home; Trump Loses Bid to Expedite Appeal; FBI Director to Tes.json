Virginia police say they were investigating a man who fired a flare gun dozens of times from the home. A short time after they arrived at the house, authorities said they heard shots fired from inside, and then things took a turn.(VIDEO TAPE)",

      "sentences": "Yes, so, John, I spoke with Arlington police just a little while ago. They still are not confirming whether or not this man who was inside that home, believed to be inside the home when it exploded, survived. But, of course, you can tell from the video just how extreme that blast was.If you look behind me, that's what's left of the house right there across this park. You can see the debris still smoldering this morning. There is debris up in the trees. A burnt-out car it looks like right outside of the house. Miraculously, there were several police officers and police vehicles right outside the home when this blast happened just after 8:00 p.m. local time last night. None of them seriously hurt. And it was a massive explosion as you can tell from that video. The home wasn't just leveled. Windows across the neighborhood were blown out. The entire neighborhood was shaking. People five miles down the road in D.C. could feel and hear the blast and see that smoke rising from the area. As I mentioned, that dramatic scene had started hours earlier, four hours earlier, when police came to the area. They say they were dealing with the man who lives inside that home who was barricaded in the house, firing flares into the neighborhood, a flare gun, shooting 30, 40 flares across the neighborhood. [09:35:13] Eventually, police got a search warrant. They said they tried to enter the home. That's when witnesses in the neighborhood said they could hear the man opening fire with a gun into -- toward police. Police retreating. And shortly after that is when the home exploded, John. Now at the scene here we have seen a lot of law enforcement vehicles. The FBI is here, ATF, working with local law enforcement. We are hoping to get an update later this morning as to what pieces they can put together of who this man was inside the house, why all of this unfolded, and hopefully we can get an update on whether or not he did survive the blast, John. But it's obviously grim looking at that video.",

You know, Donald Trump's team has been putting on their defense, calling a number of witnesses to counter these claims by the New York Attorney General's Office that they inflated the value of the properties to get better rates on loans and insurance.So, we have been hearing over the past few weeks various witnesses to support Trump's defense that they -- there are many different ways to value assets and that they didn't violate accounting rules. So, on that theme this week we are expected to hear today from some more real estate experts, people who have an expertise in valuation. One of the experts expected to take the stand today is a person who has said that Mar-a-Lago could be valued anywhere from $1 billion to $1.5 billion. So, the judge has already found that Trump had inflated the value of Mar-a-Lago on his financial statements. But this person is going to testify based on the various factors and potential buyers saying that it could be anyone from a head of state or royalty who could pay that much for Mar-a-Lago. So, this is all part of Trump's defense that they didn't inflate the value of these assets, that there are different ways to value properties. So, this will be a day where we'll hear from several witnesses, including the valuation experts. Then Eric Trump will be on the stand. We think Donald Trump will come to court on Thursday, and he will be the final witness in his case on Monday when he takes the stand to testify again in his defense. Kate.",

These are two countries facing existential threats. And yet this funding is being derailed in a larger negotiation involving the border wall and possibly Taiwan. The Biden administration trying to link them all to create bipartisan win-wins. You've got senators like Langford and Murphy really trying to lead this effort, Tillis and Sinema, to come up with some kind of compromise. You have other senators, like John Corbin, saying this is a negotiation. Give Republicans what they want at the border. The point is, this is all happening in real time. The consequences are real. They are real in terms of war and peace in Ukraine and the Middle East, and they're real in terms of our border and the need to strengthen those defenses as well.
