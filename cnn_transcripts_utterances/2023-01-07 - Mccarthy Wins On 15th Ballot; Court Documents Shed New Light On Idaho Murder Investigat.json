Never in modern times has a leadership contest taken so many votes over so many days to resolve.Out of 222 Republicans in the House, it only took six hardline conservatives, six, to derail McCarthy in the 14th ballot on Friday night. Now a vote he had believed in fact that he had it won, that he had it. But right wing Matt Gaetz, who had sworn to never vote for McCarthy, cast in fact the deciding vote that doomed him on the 14th ballot. Now we get to the 15th ballot and that was the charm. All six including Gaetz voted present, assuring the gavel would go for McCarthy. Here's some of what the new speaker had to say afterwards. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER:  It is time for us to be the voice and worthy of their votes. Let me close with this. I may not know all of you. Some of you are new. But I hope one thing is clear after this vote. I never give up. I make this promise, I'll never give up for you, the American people. And I will never give up on keeping our commitment to America.

He did offer several changes on policy issues as well as giving them more power throughout the legislative process, including giving them the power of one member to call for a vote to oust the sitting speaker and raising questions about how long he may be able to hang onto the job he fought so hard to get. Now the day started off with Kevin McCarthy flipping 15 votes to his side. He had 20, he lost 20. He could only lose four in this narrow House Republican majority. He left the floor after the vote where he had 214 votes, four shy of what he needed. He told me, yes, he did have the votes. He was confident on the following ballot, on the 14th ballot he would get there. When that vote happened, things went awry. Some of the members voted ways that he was not expecting, including at the very end, it all came down to congressman Matt Gaetz who is a fierce opponent. He needed Gaetz to vote yes. Gaetz voted present. That was not enough to secure the speakership. Mike Rogers lunged at Matt Gaetz on the floor. He was restrained by one of his colleagues and things got very, very tense. Ultimately Gaetz at the time wanted the House to adjourn until Monday. The House was about to adjourn until Monday until the deal was struck. Donald Trump called some of the members on the far right block of the conference. And some of those members changed their mind and decided they were going to vote present also. And by voting present it effectively lowered the threshold of the now amount of votes that Kevin McCarthy needed to become speaker, ultimately allowing him to become speaker with 216 votes. And he has secured the job after going through that 15 ballots that stretched from Tuesday until early morning Saturday to finally get the job. Now it will be up to him to put the -- to govern this narrowly divided institution and badly divided Republican conference, put together a policy agenda and go up against the Senate Democrats, who control their chamber across the Capitol, not to mention the Democrat in the White House. They will have the power of the purse as well as the Senate but they also have investigative powers in the House. I expect them to wield subpoenas very early on in their new majority. For Kevin McCarthy, he is relieved that after this very, very tense several days he finally has claimed the Speaker's gavel -- Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And they can -- it basically allows independence to flourish. Independent candidates aren't that good for democracy because they don't have to be part of a party, which is a building block to democracy. They can go and do their own thing. It becomes very much of a free- for-all. If you decide you don't like something one day, then you don't really want to do it. We see with some of the concessions that Kevin McCarthy made with his far right group, that only one person could vacate or file a role to vacate the role of speaker. This means if one person decides they don't like him, they're not getting along with him, they could upend his role as speaker and we need more stability in a democracy.

The affidavit states that one of the students who survived with the initials DM heard crying and opened her door three times. She saw a figure clad in black clothing in a mask that covered the person's mouth and nose, walking towards her. DM described the figure as 5'10\" or taller, male, not very muscular, but athletically built, with bushy eyebrows. The male walked past DM as she stood in a frozen shock phase. The male walked towards the back sliding glass door. DM locked herself in her room after seeing the male. DM did not state that she recognized the male. This turned out to be critical information because on November 25, shortly after the murders, Moscow police asked law enforcement agencies to be on the lookout for a white Hyundai Elantra that had been seen near the murder site.Four days later, police discovered a white Elantra in this parking lot just across the state line in Pullman, Washington. According to the affidavit, it was registered to Kohberger who lived up these stairs in this townhouse complex. Police acquired his driver's license information and they say, according to the affidavit, that it was consistent with DM's description of the man she saw, who was wearing black clothing and a mask. The affidavit does not contain information about motive or if the alleged killer knew any of the victims, but authorities could very well have leads about those topics that are not being publicly released yet.

And the S&amp;P gained more than 2 percent. This is key, the tech heavy Nasdaq rose more than 2 percent, a sign that investors believe inflation is moderating. Now Wall Street's rally came after the U.S. economy capped off a strong year of growth. The country added more than 220,000 jobs in December and that is bringing the unemployment rate down to 3.5 percent.
