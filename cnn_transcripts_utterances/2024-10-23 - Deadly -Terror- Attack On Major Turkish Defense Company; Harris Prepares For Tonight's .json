Thecountry's interior minister says four people were killed, 14 others injured, and he says two attackers, one man and one woman, were killed by Turkish security forces. So far, there has been no claim of responsibility. Now, the attack happened while Turkish President, Erdogan, is in Russia, attending the annual BRICS Summit. Let's get right to CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, who is standing by in London. What more are we learning about this attack, Salma?",

Four people killed and 14 people wounded. We also understand, again from Turkish officials, that two assailants were killed. They say it was a man and a woman. Now, no further clarity on if there are any other individuals that they are pursuing at this time but that begins to answer the question as to how many people were involved. We know at least two people were involved in this attack. You see that active scene on the ground, of course, sirens still going off. You will see police, military, security services, ambulance workers all on the ground right now trying to contain that situation. I also want to show you this social media video that we were able to verify that shows the very moment of this terror attack. You can see in this video there's an explosion. You can see that clear. You hear the sound of it. A plume of smoke goes up into the air. And then there's an individual who's moving through that area with a weapon. This scene will absolutely send shockwaves across Turkey. Turkey is no stranger to terror attacks, but it has been spared these types of attacks in recent years. And there's two things that are significant about this right now. And I have to highlight them which is, first of all, the location that this is taking place. And, secondly, the timing of this. Let's begin with the location. This is an aerospace company that is state owned that manufactures weapons, drones, other military items for Turkey's army. It also is the country's only licensed F-16 manufacturer. Effectively, it is a symbolic of the Turkish military and of the country's defense ministry. So that tells you what the target is here and why you're immediately hearing this reaction from Turkish officials. And then secondly, the timing. The Turkish government, President Erdogan, had been extending an olive branch to Kurdish separatists, to the PKK. This was a massive move. This could potentially have paved the way for talks between what has been long-standing rivalry. This can put all of that into question, especially when we're talking about the timing of this coming just after this olive branch was offered. An investigation, a judicial investigation, has already been launched. So authorities are working to find out more. For now, the focus is, of course, going to be on the scene and on helping those wounded and finding out the fate of any others inside.",

You're looking at a live view there of the set near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and that's where undecided voters in that key state will pose questions to her on the issues that matter most to them. Donald Trump will be spending the evening in Georgia. The battleground state backed him in the 2016 race, but not in 2020. This as Trump's campaign is denying claims made in \"The New York Times.\" The newspaper quotes Trump's former chief of staff John Kelly, who says his former boss frequently made racist comments, even praising Adolf Hitler.

Donald Trump did not, and thus this turned into a town hall for the vice president. What are you hearing from her campaign about what their expectations are for the evening? EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bianna, the vice president's closing argument is really coming into focus here. She is leaning heavily on her personal biography to connect with undecided and persuadable voters on a human level here. Those are the voters that are going to be asking her questions tonight. She also is leaning into perhaps the strongest issue for her, which is reproductive rights. She is running on platform elevating what she describes as the opportunity economy. And then she's also forcefully making the case against former President Donald Trump. We have heard her essentially sound the alarm here, argue that the former president is exhibiting increasingly troublesome behavior over the last several weeks. So that is a mix of what we will hear tonight. It won't be all about Trump.

Alayna Treene and Eva McKend, thank you so much. And you can watch CNN's town hall with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris at 9:00 P.M. Eastern. Turning now to the Middle East, where Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon continue, with several airstrikes on the historic southern port city of Tyre, which is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Earlier, Israel had warned residents there to evacuate. Now, this says the Israeli army said dozens of projectiles were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel today. Israel is also intensifying its assault on Northern Gaza. The U.N. warms in a new report that the impact of the war there could erase over 69 years of progress in the crowded Palestinian enclave. And U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is calling on Israel to turn its military success in Gaza into a strategic success. Secretary of State is now in Saudi Arabia after stopping in Israel. He discussed Gaza and Lebanon with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and other key officials. CNN teams are on this story. Alex Marquardt is in Washington for us. But let's begin with Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv. And, Jeremy, Hezbollah now confirming what the IDF reported yesterday, and that is the death of one of the potential successors to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

One would assume that wouldn't have happened had we not seen the death of Yahya Sinwar last week.

For now, it does not appear that that is close at hand, despite the wishes of many in this Biden administration. So certainly, Blinken is going there with his team to keep the Saudis apprised of his conversations with the Israelis. Of course, the Saudis could play a major role in the so-called a day after plan when it comes to what happens in Gaza following this war between Israel and Hamas. Blinken will go on from Saudi Arabia to the Qatari capital of Doha. Of course, Doha -- the Qataris have been pivotal in the negotiations with Hamas when it comes to a ceasefire. Blinken will then go on to London for further discussions with more leaders from the Middle East. But, Bianna, certainly I think the most important spot -- stop on this trip was the one in Israel, those discussions with Netanyahu and other top ministers. It is not clear that Blinken is walking away with any kind of real achievement or deliverable, as they say in diplomatic speak. I think there were two main goals for the top U.S. diplomat in going to Israel, essentially to convey, as we have heard from President Biden and others, that this is a moment following the death of Yahya Sinwar to end the war in Gaza, to start rebuilding of the Gaza Strip, to move on, and to get those hostages home from inside Gaza. And also, the second priority is to really, at this moment, get more aid into the Gaza Strip, particularly in Northern Gaza. And from what we hear from those traveling with Blinken, Bianna, there was an interesting moment in which the U.S. side said that there is an impression that Israel is carrying out what's being called the general's plan. This has been talked about quite a bit, in which the Israeli army is telling residents of Northern Gaza to get out of that area, so that they could essentially attack anyone who remains and starve anyone who remains. Now, we're told from a senior administration official that Prime Minister Netanyahu and others have denied this, said very firmly this is not their policy. But the U.S. made clear that is the impression and that Israel should come out and deny that publicly. We have not seen any kind of denial from Netanyahu or from others. But what is clear from the U.S. side is they do not believe there is enough aid getting into the Gaza Strip, particularly in Northern Gaza, where Israel has been really focusing their efforts against Hamas in recent days. And it is lost on no one, Bianna, that there is very much this ticking political clock here in the United States less than two weeks before the election. This could be essentially -- it is almost certainly Blinken's last trip to the region before the election. And, of course, in a few months' time, we will have a new administration. So you could imagine that there are many in the region, particularly the Israelis, who might be waiting to see what happens in under two weeks before making any dramatic decisions. Bianna.",

And Blinken raised this thing again with Netanyahu and with his confident Ron Dermer in Israel, but also in his conversations today in Saudi Arabia. And I have to say that at least most of the people I talk to think that there is a very, very low chance that Blinken can pull such a thing off after an election, especially when there's quite a reasonable chance that the next president will be Donald Trump. And if that's the case, why would anybody in the region make any moves before Trump comes into the Oval Office? Therefore, I think while Blinken is still, you know, toying with the idea of presenting something after the election, and maybe he will, there's a very low chance that it would move further than just the presentation of an idea.",

And he told them that maybe as a sort of even like a message to the U.S., he said, when you're going to attack Iran very, very soon, everybody will know what you've been training on, which is that training was something that was mentioned in those leaked documents.

And when you consider, right, that Donald Trump only won Michigan by some 11,000 votes in 2016, Biden won by 150,000 in 2020. So, 100,000, it matters, right, when this is a race that is going to be won by inches, not yards. And so it is a coalition of democratic voters that the Harris team is trying to figure out, and whether that is, you know, suburban women, whether that is the union vote or the Arab-American vote, which is just simply unhappy, frustrated, and angry with what the Biden-Harris administration's response has been so far.",

I think that when we talk to voters atrallies and even Latino voters who are there and ask them about this, a lot of them say that to them, it's this matter of they immigrated here legally, they're documented and there's some divides between what should be done around the border, right? And you need to understand that the Latino vote is not monolithic. This is -- this is a group of voters who are very different and distinct and unique. And we cannot just take all Latino voters as one voting bloc. I know that's really tempting to do and oftentimes we'll say, well, Asian American issues or black issues or Latino issues, but that's not how people work, right? I don't vote the same way as other people just because of my gender or my race or my identity. And I think that's a critical component to this. But I also think that there are -- there are a lot of Latino community members who are really frustrated with the rhetoric around this election and some of the anger and hatred that we're seeing expressed at different rallies and in different ways. And I think that some of this is coming down to also a distrust in the media, right? Can we believe these reports? Do we want to share them? And reaching those voters, just because it's in \"The New York Times\" or just because it's being discussed on CNN or another publication, doesn't necessarily mean that is reaching voters. And if it is, it might even be reaching voters via campaign advertisements. And I know that a lot of voters have already started to tune those out at this point in the election cycle.",
