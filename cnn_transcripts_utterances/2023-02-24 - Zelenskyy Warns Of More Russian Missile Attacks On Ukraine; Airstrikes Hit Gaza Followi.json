It is a war that Western sources estimate has caused at least 150,000 military casualties on each side civilian deaths could be as high as 40,000.This was the same one year ago today as air raid sirens rang out across Kyiv and other cities. The start of what Russian President Vladimir Putin called without a hint of irony, a special military operation. Some families gathered in prayer as Russian forces moved in many people, especially the elderly refusing to leave their homes, others huddled in subway stations and anywhere else underground to hide from Russia's onslaught. More than 8 million people fled the country left altogether, leaving behind homes and lives and loved ones. At least another 5 million have been forced from their homes but remain inside the country. Today, Ukraine carries on as it has for a year now barricades and sandbags lining the streets of the capital, but there were no Russian troops in Kyiv. What there is, is the continued defiance and will to survive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLENA ZELENSKA, UKRAINIAN FIRST LADY (through translator): A year of full scale war is a terrible date. Because it is a year of attack, aggression and murders, a year of hell in which Ukraine found itself because of Russia's invasive actions. Therefore, today, we are not commemorating a year of war. But we are celebrating a year of resistance to aggression, a year of courage, a year of mutual assistance and rescue of each other, a year of humanity and a year of friendship. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There's an awful lot of ethnic Romanians inside Moldova, so Romania being along the border there and being a NATO member, it would come under incredible pressure to not sit back and do nothing if ethnic Romanians are being put at risk inside Moldova.
