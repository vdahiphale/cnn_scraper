With you, we have fulfilled one of the most honorable tasks in the world.Food security, Ukraine traditionally supplies your countries with wheat and other agricultural products. We're glad to welcome the investments of the Arab nations as well as the investments of Qatar in the port infrastructure post the pandemic. And then a more terrible virus the rabies of aggression, hit this and our other normal relationship. And I am more than sure that none of you will agree to surrender a third of your country to the invaders. And I am more than sure that none of you would watch without a fight how for in a still the children of your people. Hundreds of thousands of our children are deported to Russia separated from their relatives and there are in Russia, they are trying to teach our children to hate their natives. And I am more than sure that none of you would admit the military occupation of a nuclear plant to use it to make way of the world with new disaster. Look at how much suffering the long term wars have brought to Libya, Syria, and Yemen. How many lives have been wasted by years of fighting in Sudan and Somalia, in Iraq and Afghanistan? Everyone who -- to suffering by his new aggression and everyone who sues enmity, everyone who was bringing back their old days of invading empires that didn't count with the will of independent nations every aggressor goes against the world, and will be caused by the people. And I greet everyone who is ready to join us on the pass of justice. Ukraine proposed the peace formula to end the war. You can see how it works on the example of food security. One of the points of our formula, even when the war is thrown into our home, we do everything so that the homes of other people's also survive. We managed to launch the Black Sea Grain initiative, and partially live the Russian novel blockade of our ports. These civilized food markets and helped many, including the nations of the Arab League. The implementation of another point of our peace formula will also help many the return home of all captives and deporters. Each of the honorable delegation was given a document in your language with 10 points of the peace formula peace you can choose the point to have that you consider appropriate and I will be grateful to each of you who will choose exactly the direction of rescuing people held in Russian captivity. So I invite all of you who respect peace, to join the implementation of the peace formula, and do to reduce enmity and wars, suffering and evil. Russia is weak, we beat it even when it has more weapons in their hands is aggressiveness doesn't come from strengths, but from the understanding that the time of empires has passed. That's because the time of free independent nations will never end and Ukraine proves it. I wish you peace. I invite you to cooperate directly with our country without any intermediaries. And may our and your -- act in a coordinated manner for the peace and good of people of all nations and please, listen to their Crimean Tatar people listen to the Muslims of Ukraine. May, the almighty protect our soldiers Slava Ukrainian. Thank you.",

It comes as G7 leaders was set to discuss the possibility of fighter jets for Ukraine at their gathering in Hiroshima. Sources telling CNN that the Biden Administration has signaled to European allies that it would allow them to export U.S. made F-16 jets to Kyiv. CNN's International Diplomatic Editor is covering all of these developments live for us from Eastern Ukraine. Nic, these are potentially two very high profile international trips that President's Zelenskyy has decided to make this week. What calculus would be at play in his mind when he's making the choice to leave Ukraine to undertake these meetings?",

But it's also other players who will be a G7 with whom President Zelenskyy will be meeting that will also have an impact on this broader conversation about sanctions and how to assist Zelenskyy and Ukraine.So President Zelenskyy will have some contact with the members of Indonesia, with India, as well as Brazil. These are countries that have maintained some economic relationships with Russia. And it's something that he will certainly want to stress to them needs to be cut off for the sake of democracy. And then of course, this brings up this bigger discussion about sanctions. So one thing that G7 leaders have agreed to, is to provide sanctions, additional sanctions against Russia and places where it really hurts things like construction, manufacturing, business services, anything that can inhibit Russia in its efforts, to not only continue its military effort, but to really try and cripple Russia militarily. So it will have perhaps a funding struggle when you know as this war moves forward, so that is kind of the big headline from today. Also, I just want to add on to Nic Robertson's point, a lot of discussion about F-16 fighter jets. Something that's also coming up for conversation here are anti-missile systems. They've been proven to be very effective used by Ukraine against Russia. That's something that also is expected to come up for discussion here as well, Bianca.",
