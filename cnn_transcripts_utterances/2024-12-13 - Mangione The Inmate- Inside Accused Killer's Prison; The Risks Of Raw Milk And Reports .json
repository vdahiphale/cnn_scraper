      "sentences": "Today, the California Department of Public Health announcing that raw milk is to blame for at least 11 illnesses in the state. Just last month, raw milk and cream products from a California-based dairy, called Raw Farm, were recalled after samples tested positive for bird flu.The U.S. Department of Agriculture has now announced that it will begin testing raw milk stored in dairy silos across the country. Raw milk is milk that has not undergone pasteurization, which is the process of heating milk to remove disease-causing germs, yeasts, molds, and other harmful microbes, according to the CDC. Joining me is Yale associate professor of public health, Dr. F. Perry Wilson. Dr. Wilson, thanks for taking the time to talk with us about this topic that I think, increasingly, people are really interested about. First off, just talk to us about the kinds of illnesses that we are seeing in this particular case. DR. F. PERRY WILSON, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH, YALE UNIVERSITY: Sure, absolutely. And thanks for having me, Brianna. So, you know, milk inside a cows udder is actually sterile. Where these bacteria are coming from is from the skin of the cow, from the machines that take the milk away and store it from the environment that they're in, which is often not clean. And we see diseases like salmonella, E. coli, campylobacter, all bacterial diseases that affect the G.I. tract. And in people who are susceptible, like young children, older adults and people with immune compromising conditions, some of these can be fatal.",

Just a staggering number. And yet, recently, you're seeing the popularity of raw milk and raw dairy products surging. It's got high-profile fans, including President-Elect Trump's choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, RFK Jr. So what benefits of raw milk have people ignoring those risks that you outlined?",

So what do you say to people who, they have distrust in the food industry? And certainly there are examples that I think you might look at and say, OK, I understand why you may be a little skeptical.

It does have vitamins and good fatty acids and things like that.The process of pasteurization, all it is -- this is not -- this is not, you know, ultra processing of food and making, you know, nacho chips. This is heating milk to 161 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes. That's all it is. It's enough to kill the bacteria that's in there. You know, some people say, oh, but what about the good bacteria? Well, first of all, as I mentioned, the milk that comes out of a cow is sterile. There aren't good bacteria either. And if you want those probiotic bacteria, we've got great ways to get them. You can take pasteurized milk and people culture that, using known bacteria. And they make things like yogurt and other forms of cultured milk products from pasteurized milk. And you get all the benefits of healthy milk, plus these probiotics. So there are ways to do this. But, you know, I'm saying that pasteurization is doing anything to decrease the nutritional value of milk is really not based in science.",

And we're all, in the public health field, sort of holding our breaths, waiting to see if this will actually cause significant disease in humans.And so to the extent that humans are consuming raw milk that may be infected with H5N1, that could be a major public health concern. Some raw milk companies report that they are testing their milk for bacteria, which is -- which is great if people want to look for that, but they are not required to and not all farms do that.",

Because they know that they are brothers who have -- are willing to sacrifice everything for this nation. It's incredible bond. But, Brianna, let me just say, on the field on game day, they will be going at it. This is one of the most passionate, heated rivalries in all of sports. And we asked the players and coaches about that. Listen.

It's always -- it's always defined by one or two mistakes. BRYSON DAILY, ARMY BLACK KNIGHTS #13, QUARTERBACK: When you go into service together, after you get to kind of hold that against them and, you know, let them have it, you know, for the rest of your careers, for the rest of the jobs in your careers.

They we're running through the night, through the cold. They started on Wednesday all the way here to the home of the NFL's Washington Commanders in Landover, Maryland. And communities all along the way, they come out, they support them, they cheer them on. And they finish that journey right here at midfield. Just moments ago, handing the ball to Colonel Chad Foster, deputy commandant. I asked them what makes this tradition, this game, one of the greatest rivalries in the world. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSIE OBERTON, ARMY, WEST POINT CLASS OF 2025: Coming in at the end, our captains let me carry the ball in, which was super special. So really appreciative for that moment. COL. CHAD FOSTER, ARMY, WEST POINT CLASS OF 1998: It's amazing to think about the distance that this team ran. You know, about 300 miles, you know, throughout the night across many states. And it's -- its impressive. And to receive it down here, to be the first one that gets to touch the ball here on the field, it's a -- it's a big deal. All the fire and police stations we're stopping by. And the police escorts we have It's -- its super inspirational. So we've got people cheering for us on the side of the road.
