      "sentences": "Michael, where we stand is that we learned on Saturday evening that the IDF had discovered six bodies in the Gaza Strip and we were awaiting identification of those. One of those has now been identified as Hersh Goldberg-Polin, the Israeli- American, who viewers may recall seeing in the wake of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October the 7th with half of his left arm blown off. He subsequently appeared in a Hamas hostage video several months ago. His parents have been incredibly vocal. They appeared at the Democratic National Convention. They've met with President Biden and they've been tireless in their campaign to get not just Hersh released, but also all of the hostages still remaining in the Gaza Strip released as well.The family of Hersh put out a statement saying, \"With broken hearts, the Goldberg family -- the Goldberg-Polin family, excuse me, is devastated to announce the death of their beloved son and brother, Hersh. The family thanks you all for your love and support and asks for privacy at this time.\" President Biden, the White House, put out a statement as well, saying that the President was, in the words of the statement, devastated and outraged. And then we also heard from the Hostages Forum, which represents the families of those who were kidnapped on October the 7th, saying that Netanyahu abandoned the hostages starting tomorrow, i.e. September the 1st, Sunday. The country will tremble. We call on the public to prepare. We will stop the country. We've also subsequently had two of the other bodies have been identified as well, of people who were kidnapped on October the 7th. One is Eden Yerushalmi, who was working as a bartender at the Nova Music Festival, which is where hundreds of Israelis were killed in the most deadliest single incident of those terrorist attacks of October the 7th. And Ori Danino also has been confirmed as being killed, as one of those six bodies that were discovered in this tunnel in Rafah on Saturday. Michael?",

      "sentences": "So the IDF will, you know, have people who can identify forensically the bodies to then be able to inform the families. They will be the first ones to be told. And then sometimes we get statements from the families first, as we did in the case of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, and indeed from Eden Yerushalmi's family and the family of Ori Danino. And then sometimes those statements are put out simultaneously or beforehand by the IDF as well.And it's worth noting, of course, that there are still more than a hundred hostages being held in the Gaza Strip after being kidnapped on October the 7th. Around a third of them are believed to be dead. The Hostages Forum and those with loved ones in Gaza have been urging, ratcheting up the pressure on the government to try to do whatever it can to bring those hostages home, saying they're running out of time, and if a deal isn't done, then they won't be coming home alive. It'll just be their bodies that will be returning. And sadly, that is the case now with these six hostages, three men and three women, we understand. As you say, Michael, we're not revealing the identities of the three that haven't been officially confirmed just yet, but so far we do have confirmation of the death of Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi and Ori Danino, whose bodies were discovered on Saturday. And the families of those who still have loved ones in the Gaza Strip will be even more alarmed and concerned at the fate of their loved ones who are still inside Gaza as we now move into the 11th month of fighting between Israel and Hamas, which led those terrorist attacks and the kidnapping of those Israelis and people of other nationalities as well.",

These people were believed to have been alive just until a few days ago, the six hostages, which as we now know, four of the families have identified their loved ones.You have Hersh Goldberg-Polin, the Israeli-American, Ori Danino, Eden Yerushalmi, now Carmel Gat, a 39-year-old woman who was taken from her home in one of the Kibbutzim along the border, was a yoga instructor. Lots of yoga had been done in her honor and to try to push for her release over the last 11 months. Now it will have to sadly be in her memory by many Israelis. So Israelis are feeling mourning, devastation and the tragedy and they will direct it somewhere. And the feeling is that this could have been avoided, that writing was on the wall with these people who were held in Gaza, the over 100 hostages who are still there, that every day that passes, their lives are at risk and are in peril. And this was told to the security cabinet, which Prime Minister Netanyahu leads and heads. And unfortunately, as members of the negotiating teams here in Israel are now saying to different media, including Barak Ravid earlier, that they could have been saved in the deal. And that deal did not happen. So I think Israelis are going to potentially take to the streets today. We already have one senior politician who's calling on all high school students. Today is September 1st, the beginning of the school year here in Israel. I have kids who are on their way now to school. He is calling on high school students, don't go to school, go to the streets, go protest. So I think that's what we should expect to see later today.",

This government brought upon Israel the greatest disaster almost in its history on October 7th. We've been stuck in a war now for 11 months. So whether you think he's making now the right decisions or the wrong decisions, that sits on him. That's his responsibility and his government's responsibility. The question now is whether this great tragedy can now be diverted, that energy and direction, to reconstruction and rebuilding and recovery that this country still needs. Because no matter what happens, how the war ends one way or the other, Israelis do need to somehow heal after this long period of just pain and suffering of the hostage families and every Israeli who is praying and yearning and just wishing that these people would be able to come home alive. And tragically, they're not. But also, what do we want to see our country look like in the future? And how do we prevent these types of instances from happening once again?",

They are Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. They are from 23 different countries. The youngest hostage is a one-year-old red-headed baby boy, and the oldest is an 86-year-old mustachioed grandpa. Among the hostages are eight American citizens. One of those Americans is our only son. His name is Hersh. JONATHAN POLIN, FATHER OF HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN: This is a political convention.

They're trying to eradicate an ideology and they're also trying to release the hostages and either free them through military means or through negotiation.And in many cases, those are incompatible goals. And you really have to pick one. You can't pick both when you're in a situation like this. And that's the problem. I think they tried to pick both. And I think that is basically a failure. Now, they can recover in some ways by really changing their goals in the military sense and concentrating on getting the remaining hostages released, which would mean a more diplomatic approach.

For one thing, you have an urban terrain that is extremely densely populated, and you have a foe that has means of hiding not only the hostages, but their own installations in many different ways.And as we can see now with the efforts by the IDF over these 11 months, they've often had to retrace their steps over many parts of Gaza. Gaza is a relatively small area, but because of its density, the density of the population, the density of the tunnel network that Hamas has been able to establish, and other factors, it's been very difficult for the Israelis to truly physically eradicate these structures, especially the tunnels. And they've also had difficulty eradicating Hamas' leadership. They've of course achieved some success in that regard on a temporary basis. But as far as a permanent basis is concerned, it's very difficult. So this makes it -- this really an intelligence challenge. And every now and then the Israelis have been successful in getting some of the hostages out because of good intelligence. But it is something that has to be basically a synchronized operation. And sometimes that synchronization seems to not have worked as well as it should have. That is the synchronization between the diplomatic, the military, and the intelligence spheres.",

The first group of babies have now received polio vaccinations in Gaza as a massive U.N. campaign to vaccinate more than 640,000 children gets underway in a war zone. This comes after Israel and Hamas agreed to pauses in fighting in three phases, beginning Sunday through September 12. But Palestinian health officials have stressed a permanent ceasefire is what's needed for the vaccination campaign to truly succeed. Gaza had near universal polio vaccine coverage before the war. That has now dropped. All right, Louise Wateridge is the Senior Communications Officer for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA. She joins me now from Gaza. Thanks so much for doing so. So this plan is phases with pauses, but those pauses are for a few hours at a time.
