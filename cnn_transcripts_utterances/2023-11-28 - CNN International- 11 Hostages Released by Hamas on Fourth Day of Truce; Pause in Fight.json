When it does, Israel's defense minister is warning the military operation will intensify. CNN's Oren Liebmann reports from Tel Aviv.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A nation celebrates once again as more Israeli women and children feel freedom. The fragile truce now extended by 48 hours, sealed with the release of hostages. Already some of the freed hostages, like Margalit Moses, are being discharged from the hospitals, ready to head home.

All of Monday's group from the devastated community of near Nir Oz.The truce agreement now set to be extended by two days. Hamas will release another 20 Israeli women and children, and Israel will release 60 Palestinian women and children from prison. Humanitarian aid will flow into Gaza and the temporary ceasefire will last a bit longer. YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): We will return to fighting. We will apply the same force and more. Therefore, this is the mission now. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): The pause, revealing a hellscape in parts of northern Gaza with barely a building left untouched. A few days of quiet in the devastated Palestinian territory, does not mean any peace. ABDEL QADER MOHAMMED AL-KAHLOUT, DISPLACED PALESTINIAN (through translator): I came from the north. There is nothing left in the north. The north has become a large plain. Nobody knows where their houses are. We don't know what happened to us. Overnight, we became displaced from the north to the south. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): Aid trucks are bottlenecked at the gate to Gaza. Meager relief for the crushing humanitarian crisis beyond the border. In the occupied West Bank, Palestinians have rallied as women and children have been released. But according to the Palestinian Prisoners Society, nearly twice as many have been detained has have been set free since Friday. At best, this remains an uneasy truce between two sides that vowed to keep fighting as the sun sets on the first stage of this agreement. Oren Liebermann, CNN in Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

One of the three students has now been released from the hospital, a source tells CNN. The shooting comes amid a rise in anti-Muslim and anti-Arab incidents ever since the war between Israel and Hamas began. Meanwhile, the suspect 48-year-old Jason Jay Eaton has pleaded not guilty to attempted second degree murder charges and is being held without bail. The uncle of Hisham Awartani, the college student who was most critically injured over the weekend, describes what happened that day.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICH PRICE, HISHAM AWARTANI'S UNCLE: They're our house guests for Thanksgiving. On Saturday, it was our eight-year-old twins' birthday party. These three young men, college juniors, agreed to come to this birthday party with us. Very graciously they play with our boys. We had just come back from the birthday party and they decided to take a stroll around the block to get some fresh air. They were just walking, talking amongst themselves. They were wearing their kufiyahs, which are traditional Palestinian scarves. And this gentleman stepped out of the dark and pulled out a handgun and fired four times. And my nephew, Hisham was struck twice. And -- but all three were struck by bullets. And it's -- it's inconceivable that something like this could happen in our community. And you know, these three young men grew up in Ramallah. They're best friends from growing up. They grew up under military occupation. And who would imagine that they would come to a place like this to celebrate Thanksgiving and this is when their lives would be at risk. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Initially, there were very narrow pipes and there was dry food that was being sent to them. Then there was cooked food that were being sent to them. There was another dedicated pipeline through which oxygen was being supplied to these 41 men. About a couple of days into them being trapped there for the first time, we also saw video of them that emerged and through a megaphone the rescuer spoke to them and assured them that they would be well and fine and they would be pulled out in time to come.I think it's just that they have been very strong and the rescuers have been constantly trying to get to them. This is massive debris they were dealing with, Max. So, we're talking about a mine tunnel with just one exit that was blocked. They've used auger machines. They've also done a lot of manual drilling. And finally, though, there were five options to pull them out. This one option is what perhaps is going to work, which is the horizontal drilling. Now we just have to wait and watch and see when they're out. This could take just, you know, a couple of hours from now or more. But we're just hoping for their safe return to their families. And I think we're really one needs to worry about at this stage, Max, is their mental health condition. Being trapped inside for 17 days isn't easy, and it's going to take a while for rehabilitation for these men who've been so brave and who have been waiting so patiently to be brought out -- Max.",
