She's been spending a lot of that time we're told in a Chicago hotel suite where she's fine tuning the words, the speech she will deliver at the Democratic National Convention tonight. This is her chance to not only accept that nomination from her party but also, of course, to make her case to the millions of American voters who will decide the next president. You can expect a major focus on not only her achievements as a prosecutor and a senator but also a healthy dose of personal anecdotes, information about her life as a stepmother, as the daughter of a single working mother. On Wednesday night, Harris' running mate, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, took the stage to make his case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.

And to make that a broader theme, what the vice president is offering is an America without the conspiracies, the anger, the insults, the threats of autocracy from Donald Trump. She's saying to the country, we do not have to go forward with this. We can choose right now to have a different country. There are going to be tens of millions of voters who are going to vote for Donald Trump in this election. They see him as the avatar of their concerns and their fears. But Trump has never got to 50 percent in any election. He's never got to 50 percent in any of the battleground states in the two general elections that he's taken part in. So there are people out there who are an anti-Trump coalition. This is what Harris is trying to do and to play into America's capacity throughout its history, to invent itself and to allow democracy to turn a new page in history.

They said one of Kyiv's targets was a military airfield in Volgograd. In this footage, you can see black smoke rising close to that airfield, Russia, for its part, says it shot down 28 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory and also that it repelled a new attempt by Ukrainian forces to cross the border, this time in the region of Bryansk, which as you can see, is just an extra course where Ukraine launched. Of course that surprise incursion a little more than two weeks ago. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joining me now from London with more. As Ukraine works to continue to push inside Russia, they are also, at the same time, working to defend their territory in Eastern Ukraine from Russia, advancing any further. Bring us up to speed on where both efforts stand.",

We understand from local authorities that families are hiding their children from mandatory evacuation orders. Families have been given just two weeks to leave their homes. Already, hundreds are leaving per day. That's because Ukrainian officials say Russia is advancing more quickly than they expected, particularly on Pokrovsk. I want you to take a listen to how President Zelenskyy outlined this last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The front line, our positions, primarily in the Pokrovsk direction or Donetsk region, we understand the enemy's moves and we are strengthening our defenses. A review of ammunition supplies has been conducted. It's very important that our partners fully meet their commitments regarding every package and all our agreements. This is fundamental for defense.

That surprise assault that began two weeks ago, that element of surprise now gone, Russian forces have very much been able to redeploy, rearm, reconfigure themselves and are fighting back. Ukrainian officials saying they're facing fierce resistance in that area of Kursk. That Russian troops are not surrendering in the manner that they were before. You also mentioned the possibility that Ukrainian forces have expanded that offensive. Russia claiming that there was an attempt on Bryansk, the neighboring province. Ukraine has yet to comment on that. But we do also know there were cross-border drone attacks overnight on a military airfield in Volgograd. There's footage that shows smoke billowing over that airfield. And these drones go both ways, tit for tat here. So Moscow also firing on Kyiv. Dozens of drones overnight, you have this multi-pronged front line, this multilayered conflict that continues to go on. And while Russian forces redeploy, Moscow figures out where their priorities are. Ukrainian forces are also trying to respond and to continue that push deep into Russian territory.",

In fact, Republican vice presidential candidate senator JD Vance actually sounding off about what he is seeing at the DNC. Telling my colleague Jake Tapper on Wednesday that the warnings Democrats and some Republicans are sharing about a second Donald Trump presidency are at odds with what he says are actually the Democrats' efforts to deliver a joyful convention message.

He's at immigration talking about the border or at least that is how these events are being set up and billed by his campaign.
