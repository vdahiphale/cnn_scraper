Joining us now to discuss, Republican Congressman Mike Johnson of Louisiana. He's on the Judiciary Committee. So, Congressman, let's start with this debate among House Republicans today about exactly what deals Kevin McCarthy made to become speaker. Is there going to be some sort of list of the concessions McCarthy made to his critics to win the gavel? It seems like in the name of the transparency, you and your fellow House Republicans are promising. That would be a no-brainer. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  It would. I think we do have transparency. I will tell you, Jake, the inside baseball is, we had our first big Republican conference, all members meeting this morning. There was a great sense of esprit de corps in the room, very positive vibes all the way around. Everybody understands there is transparency. We're working off the same sheet of music. It was clarified that there is no magical addendum to the rules that we all agreed to. There are lots of discussions, but everything and all the new ideas have to go through regular process. That's one of our great reforms we've just enacted. That means it has to go through the process of many evaluation amendment debate, before it gets to the floor. So, lots of discussions, lots of ideas from across the conference. But I think that it'll be duly considered by everybody.",

His prison sentence is set to begin immediately.

They were infected with his lies about election fraud that is nonexistent.Now, Bolsonaro, who's currently in Florida, tells CNN Brazil that he intends to head back home. But only after he's released from an Orlando hospital, admitted for what he says is discomfort related to an old stab wounds. CNN's Isa Soares is in Brasilia, speaking with one of the 1,500 Bolsonaro supporters who have been arrested. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Pro-Bolsonaro supporters, defiant and on remorseful. Victory is ours, they scream. Our flag will never be red, they chant. A direct reference to President Lula da Silva's left-wing workers party. They leave the federal police academy as free men and women, after being questioned about their alleged role in one of the ugliest days in Brazilian politics. Some of those still inside complain of the conditions. It is awful food, not even dogs eat this, one says. Some authorities have vowed to punish those involved. Those found two had violently played a part in (AUDIO GAP) through the democratic institutions are being accused of terrorism and attempted coup, among other offenses. One senator tells me, the large number of them have been freed, but many are still inside. Authorities are trolling through all the intelligence, all the video, to find out what role they played on that Sunday, as they ran riot through the Capitol. A protester who acknowledges she went inside, but denies being part of any violence, tells me her story. It's chaos here because we don't know anything. They can't say exactly if people are imprisoned, if they're going to get out, she tells me. For 50 days, she says, she was protesting outside the army headquarters in Brasilia, hoping the election that she says was robbed from Jair Bolsonaro would be overturned. For many like her, the issue is Lula, a man who previously served time on corruption charges. Those were later thrown out on a judicial technicality. Our intention, she asks, not agreeing with everything that was happening, she says. The ballot boxes, we keep claiming this all the time, asking for help from the armed forces to help the people, she adds. By ask her if her actions make her a terrorist. I'm not a terrorist. I don't have weapons, she tells me. But those that did carry them left their mark on this country's institution, tearing through the halls of power here with -- and even grenades, according to the justice minister, in an act that can only be described as an attack on Brazilian democracy. Back at the federal police, I asked the same protester if she regrets anything. I don't regret it. I don't regret it, because I wasn't armed, I didn't go with a mask, I didn't go with glasses, I didn't go with a bomb. And this is a challenge for Lula da Silva, who's been on the job for just over a week, uniting a polarized country, a movement that is angry and simply refuses to accept defeat. T defeat (END VIDEOTAPE) SOARES (on camera):  And, Jake, I got off the phone with the federal police here in Brasilia, who tells me the 599 protesters have been released, 527 have been charged, and they can face up to 12 years in prison, depending on the charge, either a coup d'etat, or re-taking part in terrorism, among many other offenses.

So, the impact could be quite significant.Here are a few of the big takeaways from the proposal. So, if you make less than $30,600 per year, you would no longer have to make payments. Compare that annual income with the current of 24,000, so a pretty significant difference there. If you make more than that, and that's for undergraduate loans, that's in an important distinction there. If you make more than 30,600 per year, your payments will be kept at 5 percent due to discretionary income for undergraduate loans. You have graduate loans, that remains at 10 percent of your discretionary income. If you have a mix of undergraduate and graduate, it would be somewhere between 5 percent and 10 percent. And then the big thing also, Jake, is that unpaid monthly interest, the Department of Education saying, it will stop charging unpaid monthly interest. The reason why this is so important is because one of the largest concerns about this program is that you had payments that weren't actually fully making the interest. And so, we are making payments, but it wasn't covering the interest. And so, the principal continued to grow. And it would create what some critics have told me today was a bit of a debt trap. So, this is a pretty significant update there. One borrower group, one nonprofit that represents student loan borrowers, telling me today, borrowers will no longer see their balances grow, and grow, month after month, which is not only emotionally demoralizing, but financially devastating.",
