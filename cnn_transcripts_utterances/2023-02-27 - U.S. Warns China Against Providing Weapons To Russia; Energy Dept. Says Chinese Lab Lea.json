      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, AT THIS HOUR, don't cross the line from the White House to the CIA, the new warnings to China, about helping Russia in Ukraine. Plus, Oklahoma just getting hammered by a series of tornadoes. People there are getting a first look at just how bad these storms were.And a major decision on abortion rights could come today. And the impact could be immediate, and it could be nationwide. This is what we're watching at this hour. Thank you so much for being here. I'm Kate Bolduan. The concern over China and its intentions in Ukraine are growing really by the hour. First, there was the intelligence assessment that China is considering providing lethal support like weapons to Russia for its unprovoked war on Ukraine. Now President Biden's National Security Adviser tells CNN there will be, quote, real costs if Beijing follows through. As the latest U.S. intelligence suggests that China is strongly considering sending drones and ammunition to Russia for its war in Ukraine. But adding also the caveat that a final decision has not yet been made. This comes as Russia is launching new attacks throughout Ukraine. In just last 24 hours, Ukraine says that it is repelled 81 Russian attacks from the air. Let's start with M.J. Lee, who's live at the White House for us at this hour. M.J., what is and isn't the White House saying about this latest assessment? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kate, the administration is openly warning that China is considering providing lethal aid to Russia in its war against Ukraine, we're talking about things like drones and weaponry and ammunition. While China according to U.S. officials has not made a final decision on whether to go down this path. What we're learning is that conversations between China and Russia are ongoing, and that China at this moment in time does appear to be leaning towards going down this path. Now it is not a coincidence that we are hearing U.S. officials sort of publicly making these warnings. And the hope right now is that by doing that, that the U.S. can try to deter Beijing from going down this route. Because of course, going down this route would be hugely consequential not only for us China relations, but also could mark a major escalation in this war on Ukraine. Now, this is what National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN over the weekend about what exactly is at stake if Beijing were to do this. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously just very hard to overstate what a dramatic effect this could potentially have on U.S.-China relations. And again, just on the war in general too, Kate.",

Mr. Chairman, thanks for coming in. I want to ask you about Wuhan, about this new reporting. But first, let's talk about Ukraine. The President's National Security Adviser said on CNN yesterday that if China provides lethal support to Russia, the White House has made clear privately what the consequences would be. Do you know what the consequences would be? REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX): I don't, but they should be very stern, strong consequences. We're talking about now something going from an alliance which was in alliance buying energy to now potentially putting not only drones, but other lethal weapons into the Ukraine conflict. This crosses the red line in my judgment. And I think all options should be on the table. I think sanctions would be an obvious easy one. But I would urge the administration put all the options on there. This is a serious departure from where we've been in this conflict. I've been worried about this for quite some time, because China has been so supportive of Russia in this -- in Ukraine.",

But you have to also take into consideration you're dealing with Russia and you're dealing with China, what could the consequences be beyond sanctions that you think would be appropriate?",

I don't think anybody right now wants to get into a full fledge war with China and Russia. But it just reminds the American people who may think that Communist China is bad, but somehow Putin and Russia get it passed. I think it reminds the American people, they are in this together. And they have been since day one since the Olympics. And in fact, the 2017, Chairman Xi called Putin his best friend. So the idea that they're not in this together is just -- it's just wrong assessment of the situation. We have four nation adversary states now, Russia, China, Iran is in there as well and North Korea. These four are all lined up against the West, and freedom and democracy.

Horrific stuff. Mobile crematoriums taking children from villages and and exporting them to Russia, where they're then indoctrinated in violation of the Geneva Convention, all these crimes against humanity. And I would argue, in some cases, genocide are in fact taking place. And the American people haven't seen it. I think they need to understand what's at stake in Ukraine, and why this is so important that we are facing evil in Ukraine, and evil must be fought and destroyed. And that is Putin, when he's committed these crimes. And Kate, we've only scratched the surface here. Once Mariupol, that's the town more to the south.

You know, is it true we translated into Mandarin and got it through the Chinese firewall into mainland China, it went viral, because they're most concerned about their own people knowing the truth about what is happening. And then I had the foreign minister of China publicly denouncing me in my report. I think they know what happened. And it started all that September before the February announcement that it was international. And I do believe because it was at a level two facility, not level four, level two is very low-grade security, that it did leak out as they're trying to create this monster in the virus with an eye towards creating a vaccine.",

Watch the the impact from debris flying around hitting this windshield. This particular home here essentially shifted by the winds, and that caused everything to kind of collapse. So you see a wall coming out here to this side, the front garage, kind of shifting and falling on itself as well. That is pretty dramatic.But then, you know, as you often see in these types of hurricanes, houses across the street, left basically intact, some roof damage and that sort of thing. But it really is amazing that only through this wicked line of storms that came through Oklahoma Sunday night, were winds in some places are really what we kept seeing over and over. 7,580 mile an hour sustained winds in all of this area that there was more injuries and even fatalities. As you mentioned, 12 people injured, no fatalities been reported. And that obviously goes in long part is the amount of warning that so many people got throughout the day because this line of storms was expected to develop and it really kind of developed the way many of the forecasters were saying it was going to develop. So that really helped people protect themselves. But we spoke with one woman, a 10th grade geometry teacher who said she was home alone when the storm struck. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
