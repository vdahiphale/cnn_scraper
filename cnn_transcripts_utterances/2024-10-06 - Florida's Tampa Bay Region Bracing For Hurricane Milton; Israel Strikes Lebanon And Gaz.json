What we saw was after the strike itself, a variety of explosions and things popping off into the air.So it would appear that there were some sort of ordinance being stored in that particular site. Now, what we've seen in the last 24 hours is certainly Saturday into Sunday, overnight there were many airstrikes, more than 30 according to the official news agency here. And what we saw throughout the day was almost every hour a strike occurring in the southern suburbs to the point where, you know, it got to a point where just the entire southern suburbs was covered in smoke from all the fires caused by those blast there. Now the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli military has put out on Twitter or X a few warnings for four specific buildings in the southern suburbs of Beirut. But oftentimes those warnings don't come. I think it's about one in five there's actually a warning, otherwise, there's nothing. And keep in mind that yes, it's midnight here in Beirut at the moment. Oftentimes, people aren't glued to their phones or their computers to watch these warnings come in on Twitter. We've been to the southern suburbs a variety of times. Many people have left, but oftentimes it's the women, the children, the elderly that leave and find shelter elsewhere. They usually leave behind a male relative just to keep an eye on the property. So there are still many people in that part of Beirut despite these airstrikes.",

The reality is that without U.S. munitions supply and without the U.S. military posture increases in the Middle East supporting Israel's defense, it would be very difficult for Israel to consider more action and whatever the next round of retaliatory response would look like. And for the United States, we have more than 40,000 U.S. forces deployed across the region and aircraft carrier. And we already know that Iran will target U.S. forces just as they target Israel.

I think it's fair to say that the Israeli -- well, first of all, the Israelis could strike at any time, but I don't think they're in any hurry to do that. Look, the center of gravity in terms of what the IDF is trying to achieve is now against Lebanese Hezbollah, not Hamas in Gaza. That's a holding action. That's a requirement that needs to be taken down. But the focus of what the IDF wants to take on, it's Hezbollah. The response against Iran is something that probably is already pre-baked, and they're working around the edges in terms of increased intelligence, what the target list looks like, and where do they want to try to inject the most pain against the regime in Tehran. But I think it's fair to say the fact that he's en route to the United States doesn't necessarily mean that there's going to be a delay, but I think it's a pretty good assumption that there might be in terms of when the IDF chooses to respond.",

Isaac, this has been really a fascinating dynamic from the start, but what are you hearing as we close in on Election Day?EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Yeah, that's right, Jessica. In a story up on our website right now, I've got reporting that gets into what one person called to me the ultimate balancing act here, that Harris, in these last couple of weeks of the campaign, is trying to break through to the people who are still undecided, still wavering, say to them, I'm different from Joe Biden, even though I'm part of the Biden administration. And you see various ways that this is becoming a part of the strategy from when she spoke very bluntly about abortion rights in Georgia two weeks ago to her trip to the southern border, but also some policy proposals that she's been rolling out and will continue to roll out. It's a tricky situation, though, as I said, because when you look at, for example, the situation in the Middle East, Harris is facing political pressure to create some distance from where Biden is on that. On the other hand, she's in the situation, literally at -- in the situation room, literally at his right hand. When she talks about the economy and wanting to say that she knows people are suffering and there's more work to be done, that is, of course, an economy that for the last three and a half years has been overseen by the Biden-Harris administration. So weaving through how to make this break and how to credibly say that she's different from Biden is the challenge that the vice president faces here with 30 days left of this campaign.",

They also don't love the idea of him reminding people of their strong connection.Go back to that debate that Harris had with Trump a couple weeks ago, one of the best received lines that the Harris campaign found in their own research about the voter response to it was when she said, I am not Joe Biden.

We want to go to Tallahassee where Florida officials, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, are holding a news conference on Hurricane Milton and how the state is preparing. Governor DeSantis speaking there. Let's listen in.GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: -- particularly in areas that are very sensitive to storm surge. Just know that the surge is going to be the primary threat to your life and your safety. I'm not saying that you should want to hunker down if there's a -- with major wind speeds, if we had Cat 3, Cat 4, but in Florida, a lot of the buildings can handle it, particularly new, you could potentially do that. The surge is just overwhelming. It's like trying to fight mother nature in a way that you're just not going to be able to win. And we saw that with Helene, places in like Horseshoe Beach that survived with almost no damage, and I'd tell you, which was almost a Cat -- it hit Category 4 then went down to three before it made landfall, and then Helene wiped it out because of the surge. There was just more storm surge and some of these places were just obliterated. So, you're looking at potential major storm surge up and down the West Coast of Florida. And yes, if this -- if the storm, the eye of the storm goes in the southern part of the Western Peninsula, you will no doubt have less surge north of that than you would if that was the eyewall or if the eyewall was north of where you're at. That's just the way these storms work, but we don't have a way to know definitively at this point where on that peninsula the storm is going to make landfall. So, you have time now to do what you need to do. If you're in one of those areas that can get whacked by this storm surge, to make the decision, to make sure you can be safe when the storm does come, as Kevin and Jared both said, I mean, people sometimes wait, and then when you wait till the very end, you get caught on the roads, you get have hazardous conditions. You have today, clearly you have tomorrow for sure. Probably you'll have some time Tuesday, but I think it will start to get more crowded. I think it'll start to become something that presents some risks of its own. And then just finally on evacuations, if you are in one of those areas, you don't have to get on the interstate and drive 200 miles. Anywhere you go inland or any place that's not going to be a threat for the storm surge, you can hunker down there, and then go back when the storm passes. Now there will be a lot of shelters that are open. I don't know if anyone has opened them yet. I don't think so, but that will happen as we get close. There's also going to be shelters open in other parts of the state where they may not be getting an impact if there's demand for that. I know Kevin has talked to people in the Panhandle. Some of those counties may do that. So, you're going to have a lot of options on this, but those people in those sensitive areas, you could potentially have some major, major storm surge. I think a lot of people that just lived through Helene, seeing four, five, six feet in some of those places in the Florida Peninsula on the West Coast, that was major. That caused a lot of damage. This potentially can be more in some of those areas. And so, make sure you're taking appropriate precautions. Okay?

Judge Chutkan actually acknowledged that Jack Smith's request is -- quote -- \"procedurally irregular,\" and then she let him do it anyway. And because of that flipping the ordinary procedure on its head, that's what enabled Jack Smith to put this brief in in October, shortly before the election.

DOJ found later that it was outrageous.The problem, though, with Secretary Clinton's analysis of the Jack Smith case is, respectfully, she's got her facts wrong. First of all, she's confusing the judges here. I think she's thinking of Judge Cannon, who, yes, has ruled almost entirely for Donald Trump, but that's the judge in the other case. The judge here is Judge Chutkan. I get it, similar names. Judge Chutkan has ruled almost entirely against Donald Trump. More to the point, the last thing we just heard Secretary Clinton say was -- quote -- \"there is nothing out of the ordinary.\" But as I described before, the way they flipped this procedure is the opposite of the ordinary. They reversed the actual way that motions are done. You can talk to a hundred former federal prosecutors who've collectively handled 100,000 cases. They will all tell you they never filed their motions first. And I think it begs the question, what was the rush here? Why did Jack Smith have to ask for this, to quote Judge Chutkan, procedurally irregular approach? So, I respectfully disagree with the secretary there.",
