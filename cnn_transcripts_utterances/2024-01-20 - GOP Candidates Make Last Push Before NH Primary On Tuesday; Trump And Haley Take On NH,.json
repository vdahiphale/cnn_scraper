And then there were three, three candidates, three days remaining until the first in the nation primary in New Hampshire. And today the remaining Republicans in the race are speaking to voters in the Granite State and in South Carolina. Former President Donald Trump and his former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley trading barbs on the campaign trail in New Hampshire while Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is taking his message to voters in South Carolina. We have teams tracking all of the campaigns right now. Let's start with CNN, Alayna Treene in Manchester, and New Hampshire, Alayna. Last night we saw South Carolina Senator Tim Scott endorsing former President Trump and now we're hearing another South Carolina lawmaker will campaign with Trump tonight.",

And look, I mean, McMaster is a very fierce ally of the former president. He was one of the first people to endorse him shortly after Trump announced in 2022, that he was going to be launching a third bid for the White House. And really, I mean, his appearance as well as Tim Scott, obviously a major endorsement pickup for Donald Trump last night as well. It's all part of a broader strategy from the Trump campaign to try and hammer Nikki Haley in the final days before New Hampshire's primary on Tuesday. And part of that is, you know, South Carolina is Nikki Haley's home state. She was a former governor herself.And what the Trump campaign is trying to do is theoretically paint her as someone who is not as well liked by people in her own backyard. So you're going to see more other or more people from South Carolina as well, including Congressman Russell Frey, also appearing with Donald Trump on the trail this weekend, really just a full-court press as they continue to attack Nikki Haley. Now speaking of him attacking Nikki Haley, Donald Trump has really been escalating his rhetoric toward her in the past couple of days. Last night, when he was in a different rally in Concord, New Hampshire, he argued that Haley isn't fit to be president and also through cold water on the idea of picking her as a potential running mate. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

She's really been narrowing the gap with Donald Trump here. And part of that is also because of the way that New Hampshire's primary setup independent voters, known as undeclared voters in New Hampshire, are able to participate in the primary, and in poll after poll, Nikki Haley is shown to do very well with those more moderate voters. And that is a concern, according to my conversations with Trump's team, a big concern for them and they do see her as a threat. And that's also why you're seeing Nikki Haley respond to a lot of his attacks and say that she welcomes them, in some sense, because she says it argues that they are afraid of what she might do in New Hampshire.

But it is significant that she is looking at one comment that Trump has made and really trying to use that to gather questions, to bed questions about his mental fitness, not explicitly saying if she thinks he's mentally fit or not, but encouraging voters to look at that seriously as they head out to the polls here in New Hampshire in just a few days. The other thing that the campaign is doing is, as Trump has these lawmakers from South Carolina, as Alayna said, her home state coming up here to New Hampshire, and out on the campaign trail for him, she and her campaign are announcing that they're going to be investing $4 million in a media buy in South Carolina, starting on the same day as the New Hampshire primary. So they've essentially got a month for that investment to take root in the state before the South Carolina primary.And they're trying to downplay these endorsements that Trump is getting, you know, essentially saying they're not a big deal, they won't have much of an impact, and that Nikki Haley is very popular in her own state, also playing up the fact that they've got some money in the bank. They are in the words of Haley's campaign manager loaded to bear when it comes to competing in South Carolina. And they also think that she is going to be capable to continue going on to Super Tuesday and competing in states, particularly where independents are able to play in the primary like they are here in New Hampshire. But of course, the question comes down to how well can she do. How well does she need to do here in New Hampshire? On Tuesday night, Hayley and her campaign resisting any questions to really pin them down on that question and say how well they think they need to do just saying that they expect to do better here than they did in Iowa, where she came in third place, 30 points behind for President Trump.",

She wasn't doing that many events in the first few days. She seemed a little bit shell-shocked after the disappointing third-place finish in Iowa.Now that has changed in recent days. She did at least six publicly advised stops yesterday, she's basically doing the same. She's starting very early in the morning, and she's sharpened his attacks. She's bringing the fight to Trump. And it's interesting that she's doing it on some issues, but not others. You know, some of these racist attacks by Donald Trump about his insinuating that maybe she's not qualified to be president, even though she was born here. But because her parents were immigrants when she was born here. She's not engaging with some of those attacks. She is really trying to focus instead on you know, his mental fitness, the fact that he prays Chinese president Ji 12 times during COVID, you know, she is really trying to try to make it appear that she is the adult in the room. Now, what's unclear is if Republican primary voters want to vote for the adult in the room, or really wants to just bring back the Trump presidency. And, you know, I can tell you that the enthusiasm of Trump events still is a little bit higher than Nikki Haley. But Nikki Haley is hustling in the state.",

I mean, actually, first, let's listen to this soundbite of how Tim Scott threw his endorsement last night towards Donald Trump.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN.

That being said, I'm sort of doubtful that a lot of New Hampshire voters are going to determine their boat like that. That they were on the fence and they were like, well, Tim Scott endorsed Trump, I'm going to change my vote.That being said, I do think it was intended to rattle Ambassador Haley a bit. I reported earlier this week that Nikki Haley privately called Tim Scott on Wednesday, trying to solicit that endorsement, as she knew that Tim Scott was also getting calls from Donald Trump and some of his surrogates like Senator Lindsey Graham encouraging him to endorse. And the fact that she told Fox News earlier today that Tim Scott didn't even call her to give her a heads up before he endorsed.

We don't know how many personnel, we don't know how severe. And this is a joint Air Force base at Iraqi military also there and the Iraqi military say that at least one of their service personnel was injured in this attack.

That's a standard response.But if you're looking for the connective tissue of what Iran does, you have the president of Iran today saying we will, you know, we will take revenge on Israel, and in the same statement, putting the United States side by side with Israel, saying the United States is an enabler of Israel. What we know that was had in Damascus today, five IRGC members. This is the sort of top military Echelon in Iran, and that were killed. And one of those was the head of the Quds Force Intelligence inside Syria. Now, the Quds Forces kind of, if you will, the elite that of the IRGC, as well as the elite of the elite.

Of course, President Biden has long been an advocate of the two-state solution and eventual Palestinian state, but Prime Minister Netanyahu has been increasingly public in his rejection of that idea. And so this call was an important opportunity for the two men to discuss that and get into some of the details of how this would all come about.We heard from President Biden yesterday after the call, saying that he did not think that it was impossible to come up with a two-state solution with Prime Minister Netanyahu still in office, and he raised this idea of a demilitarized Palestinian state, a state without a military as a potential option. And we're told by people familiar with the matter that this is an idea that intrigues President Biden, and it was discussed on that phone call. But then today, we heard from the Prime Minister's office saying that in the conversation with President Biden, he reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed, Israel must retain security control over Gaza. And they said that's a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty. And so this is obviously an important back and forth. And it really gets to the fundamental question of what will happen once this war ends. This is something that President Biden is very staunch in his belief that a Palestinian state must be the result. It's something as Secretary of State has been talking with a number of regional partners with about and so this will be an ongoing dispute between the two men.

I mean, Native Americans were here and they were displaced.But so what she's saying from a historical point of view does not make sense. But from a political view, it makes all the sense in the world to me that she was stolen abundant question because the Republican Party in the magical world, they have a different view of racism. And they have this alternative universe where they look back, and they don't see racism, and we look at the slogan, make America Great again, the assumption in that slogan is that the country was once great. Well, for whom? And when, and when you ask that question, you have to deal with slavery. You have to deal with Jim Crow.

And this is on a 15-year anniversary of President Obama's first inauguration and you wrote, so eloquent on, you know, cnn.com about it. And really the hope and the promise that that moment brought that that campaign brought, but at that moment, and people were, you know, being reflective in America. Does this mean that we're you know, we How far have we come? Are we no longer a racist society? You know, but then here we are having these conversations about many who want to deny the truth, deny the journey of this country, and are failing to or unwilling to be introspective about where we are. So how do you kind of classify this moment that we're in?",

But I actually think of Nikki Haley and Tim Scott looked at Obama's example, they could learn something. Because Obama talked frankly, about this country's racism in the past. But he said that part of loving the country is the ability to be self-critical. And to know that our greatness is not just in the past, but our greatness rests in the future and what we're becoming.And they haven't been able to find the kind of rhetoric to, you know, to go there. But he did that so well. He gave a great speech in Selma, where he talked about that, that part of patriotism is being self- critical. So that's one of the things I wanted to convey in the story about Obama today, but also wanted to convey that people had tremendous hope back then and that you need that type of hope. If you're going to forge ahead with all these problems ahead. I'm really concerned that there's so much cynicism right now that people have given up on this country even becoming a multiracial democracy. So that's part of what I wanted to convey with the story today about Obama.",

And so the Greenland ice sheet is like this massive bathtub of ice that if it all drained out into the ocean, it would raise global sea levels by over 20 feet. And we aren't suggesting that's going to happen anytime soon. But what's what usually holds back the flow of glaciers is that the ice has to travel through these narrow fjords on the way out to the ocean.Well, what our research is finding is that a lot of the ice in these narrow fjords, has been edging away slowly. And when that happens, it's like taking the plug out of the drain. And so what we can expect is accelerated sea level rises, these glaciers speed up and are drained out its notion a little bit faster than they've already been doing.",
