They join a long list of Democratic Party leaders who are giving Harris a boost, including President Biden, Dr. Jill Biden, the Clintons, congressional leaders, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi, the whole lineup.The Obamas had remained on the sidelines until now. Obama had said earlier in the week, he wanted to see how the process played out inside the party, but now, they're ready to put their weight behind Harris. The new statement on the endorsement, they say, quote, at a time when the stakes have never been higher, she gives us all a reason to hope. My panel joins us now, Stephen Neukam, congressional reporter for \"Axios\", and Cheyanne Daniels, race and politics reporter for \"The Hill\". Good morning to both of you. Thank you so much for being here. Stephen, let me start with you. I mean, look, this was expected, right? We didn't expect this to go any other way but it is kind of the button on the end of a rollout of Democratic endorsements that really show the party is united behind her, as I will say some attacks from Republicans say that this is something that Democratic leaders have orchestrated but at the same time, there's no real opposition to Harris at this point. What do you make of the Obamas move here?",

It was a rollout, but it was also sort of breakneck speed from last Sunday when the president dropped out of the race to -- by Tuesday, Wednesday, she was the presumptive nominee, and now she has all of party leadership from Capitol Hill, you know, the donors, former party leaders, who are behind her now.And look, I think this shows that the party is relieved. They were in free fall for about three to four weeks after the debate, trying to figure out what they were going to do at the top of the ticket and the conversations that I've had specifically with Democratic senators, it is a feeling of relief. Senate campaigns are relieved to actually have something to be enthusiastic about, and not have to have this conversation about what are we going to do at the top of the presidential ticket? HUNT:  The five shift is real, shall we say. Cheyanne, one of the places where we've seen a lot of excitement. Karen Finney has been on with us a couple of times this week and she's talked about these calls that she's been on, Zoom calls should -- she said they had 44,000 people on these calls, fundraising calls, and of course, the Obamas have a -- have a critical role to play with these communities as well. What are you hearing in terms of how this may change the game in states that Harris would need if she wants to get to 270 at the end of the day?",

I want to show you what Senator Mark Kelly, who is floating around somewhere near the top of that list right now, it had to say recently about whether or not he would be willing to do the job if asked. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARK KELLY (D-AZ):  I've been a public servant since I was -- even before I was in the Navy. I drove an ambulance when I was in high school. You know, I was an astronaut for 15 years (INAUDIBLE). You know, the job of the United States Senate is, you know, the highest service I've had to my country. And this is not about me.

There's some that is skeptical that the party would take a Democratic extend our out of the Senate with how important that majority is going to be. Yes, there's a Democratic governor who would appoint a Democrat, but you have, you get into a situation with a special election.And then you have the governors. There's a lot of talent and the governors mansions. So I think there's a lot of conversation around Shapiro in Pennsylvania. Locking up Pennsylvania would be huge for the party, the Keystone State. And then there's a question about expanding the map in North Carolina with Roy Cooper. So, all these are options that are on the table. But I think were going to get a decision pretty quickly by the beginning, early August from the Harris campaign.",

      "sentences": "All right. CNN's Max Foster joins us now from London.Max, were learning this from \"Axios\", Barak Ravid, who has really strong winds into the prime minister's office in Israel. They say quote, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was upset by Vice President Kamala Harris's on-camera statement after their meeting and is concerned it will harm negotiations over a Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal. An Israeli official said in a briefing with reporters. Harris's statement after the meeting was much more critical than what she told Netanyahu in the meeting, one Israeli official claimed. What do you make of what she said there? What the Israelis are saying afterward? Honestly, her on-camera statement makes a lot of sense to me in the political context of what she is dealing with here now at the top of the Democratic ticket, where she is trying to unite the Democratic Party that has been very divided by the way President Biden has been handling this war. But what do you see from your vantage point? MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're watching it, won't we, because it's such a profound issue and we need to know where she stands on it. Is she completely in lockstep with Joe Biden, well, largely but there was a difference in tone, I felt to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden on this issue. So, yes, she recognizes Israel's right to defend itself, but then she spent a lot of time saying there are conditions that should be applied to that, how you defend yourself and the amount of civilians that are dying there, and how she will not remain silent. So very clear message as she was quite subtle when she gave it, you know, very tough and I think that was quite telling because there's been a lot of talk in diplomatic circles that she's going to be more sympathetic to Palestinians, you know, an over-simplistic way of looking at it. I think what she was doing there, were saying she's going to have a much more balanced view between Palestinians and Israelis when it comes to this. In terms of the \"Axios\" common, it's going to frustrate Netanyahu because one of his ongoing issues is when other countries criticize -- when they give equivalents to both sides, he feels that isn't equivalence to both sides. I think that was reflected actually in Kamala Harris's speech there. So, for a lot of people, it's quite subtle, but I think the tone was very punchy.",

It is bad PR, a lot of what Netanyahu is doing as far as they're concerned, he's not very popular. He wouldn't win an election according to the polls if he was there now.He does have a bad PR and, you know, getting it done is exactly what many Israelis want. They want an end to this war. Obviously this -- they want a certain end to the war, but they want it done sooner rather than later. We've been talking about this all week, how that so many people think it was inappropriate that Netanyahu was even in America, but it should be focusing on the deal. So I think actually Trump is speaking to what a lot of people think that its get the deal done and consider Israel's brand really on the world stage because it's being -- it's a confused brand at best, isn't it? Because were hearing so many mixed messages from within Israel about what they think about government policy, doesn't feel cohesive. But I had a question for you about the Trump meeting, which was I've been reading about some beef between Biden and Trump because Biden didn't support Trump in a certain election. And -- sorry, Netanyahu and Trump because Netanyahu supported, gave congratulations to Biden, rather went out of that election. So it wasn't very clear on that.
