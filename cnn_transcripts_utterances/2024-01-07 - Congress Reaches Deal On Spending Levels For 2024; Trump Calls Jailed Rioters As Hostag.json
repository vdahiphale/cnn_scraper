It's an important first step in averting a shutdown, but we aren't out of the woods just yet.CNN's Arlette Saenz is with the president at Wilmington of Delaware.

But big questions still remain about whether they can actually get this funding bills written by that next deadline on January 19th.Now, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Mitt -- Chuck Schumer negotiated this agreement, landing on a $1.59 trillion spending level for fiscal year 2024. The breakdown comes to about $806 billion for defense spending and $704 billion for non-defense spending that will also include an additional about $70 billion that was part of a side deal for non-defense spending that was struck between President Biden and then House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last spring. These figures that they've agreed to are pretty in line with what Biden and McCarthy had outlined. But there are still a number of hurdles ahead as they try to meet these upcoming deadlines. There's questions about whether lawmakers will be able to write this type of legislation fast enough before that first January 19th deadline and then the second, February 2nd one. But then there's also some conservatives who want to use this moment as leverage to try to force the administration to make some more stringent immigration and border policy changes. Now, President Biden in his statement praising this agreement said, quote, \"Congressional Republicans must do their job, stop threatening to shut down the government and fulfill their basic responsibility and fund critical domestic and national security priorities, including my supplemental request. It's time for them to act.\" That supplemental request that Biden is referring to is those ongoing negotiations at this time for additional border security, Israel and the Ukraine aid. Really, that has been caught up in those talks relating to border security. White House officials have said they're willing to make some concessions with border security, but so far, Senate negotiators, both Democrats and Republicans, have yet to turn up a deal. So, there's still a number of issues at hand to determine whether they will be able to avert a government shutdown, but they're seriously facing a very real time crunch with that first deadline coming up on January 19th.",

It's not supposed to be a shear pin, but it's a pin that apparently has broken off. It's much shorter than it should be. So, what that indicates to me is that there was something that broke off there, whether it was mis-attached on the other side or not.But finding this door is critical at this point because there's parts of that door that will tell us how it was attached at the time it broke. Now, Chairwoman Homendy also said that they have metallurgists on staff there at the location that'll be looking at the metal. So, if they get that door and they can start looking at the metal, they can see where the sudden fractures were versus a wear and tear type thing where it was slowly done over time.

Two is to figure out if there's some systemic issue with this aircraft with regard to that door.Now, in the bigger picture, the what I call the 50,000-foot view, you have to think about, you know, is this particular incident, is it systemic?

And ever since the Max 8 tragedies, the two aircraft that crashed in the Max 8, Boeing's been under a close eye of scrutiny both from the FAA and from the European authorities as well.
