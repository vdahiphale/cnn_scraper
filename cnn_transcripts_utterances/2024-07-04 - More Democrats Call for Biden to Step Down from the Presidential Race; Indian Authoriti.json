It reaffirmed for many voters one of their deepest concerns about -- about Biden going forward, which is that he's too old for the job. I mean, in that \"New York Times\" poll today, not only did Donald Trump have his biggest lead ever, you know, at any point, I think, since he became a national figure, but 74 percent said they thought Biden was too old to be president. 84 percent of people under 45 said he was too old. Over 80 percent of the people voting for third party candidates, which is presumably his best option for growing the votes or acquiring the votes he needs to overtake Trump.

We are so dug in at this point that full scale collapse is, you know, not really a possibility anymore.What Biden, what the Democratic strategists and elected officials and donors and advocacy group heads who I've talked to in the last few days are concerned about is, as I said, Biden went into this debate trailing. He was the one who needed to shake up the dynamic, needed to change the trajectory of the race. And if he stays in the race, it is hard to see what could allow him to not only overcome the new damage that he's done, but even if he does that, what is now going to give him the boost that the debate was supposed to do to overcome the initial deficit that he faced? Rosemary, I am aware of post-debate polling done by Democratic or liberal groups in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, three states that he almost certainly needs to sweep to win that has him down six to seven points this week.

Now that they're actually facing a potential reality with this, they're trying to figure out what exactly that looks like and whether or not that's a good thing. And not everybody thinks it is. I talked to one GOP pollster who said he'd rather go with the devil he knows than the devil he doesn't know. And along those lines, we know the campaign has spent millions of dollars in modeling, advertisement, as well as data trying to create a campaign that runs against President Joe Biden and no one else. But if you talk to the campaign, they say this is going to be decided on the issues, not on anything else, not on who the candidates are. This was a direct quote from one of the senior advisers. They said the issues are the issues and that's what people care about. Every person on the potential list has been complicit in the decisions of the Biden administration. Obviously, they're saying that whoever is at the top of the ticket, they will try and link to Biden's administration, particularly the economy, inflation, immigration, crime, all things that Donald Trump pulls ahead of Joe Biden. But it is certainly an interesting time. They say they're not going to change any of their strategy in terms of what they do for data modeling or start anything new until they see how this plays out.

Hamas says it dealt with the proposal quote \"positively\" and repeated its demand for a complete ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

And this is what will be happening we understand from an Israeli source over the next few days. The negotiators have been looking at Hamas' proposal or answer to the Israeli proposal and they will decide whether or not they believe that a deal can be done.Now we have been here before of course there have been a number of times when it appeared as though a deal may be close. What we're hearing at this point at least is no immediate rejection from any Israeli officials. We've heard in the past Benjamin Netanyahu calling some of the Hamas responses delusional. So at this point there's been no immediate response. We understand from Mossad as well that they are looking through this counter proposal carefully. From Hamas' point of view they said that they have given their answers to the mediators in Qatar and in Egypt and they are hammering home the point again that what they want is a complete ceasefire, a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip. Now what has changed this time as opposed to previous times when talks have stalled is that the Israeli military has almost completed its operations in Rafah in the south of the Gaza Strip. This has been something that appears to have been hanging over this complete withdrawal of troops and a permanent ceasefire in the past. We've heard Mr. Netanyahu saying that there will not be a complete ceasefire until Hamas is destroyed but we are hearing from the Israeli military certainly that it's not necessarily possible to completely destroy Hamas but that they do believe they are close to ending their operations at least in Rafah. The Prime Minister as well saying that it doesn't mean the end of the war he said but it potentially means the end of the intense fighting. So I think the hope at this point Rosemary is that -- that Israel certainly is in a very different position than when previous counter proposals were suggested by Hamas and we do know as well we've heard from the Hostage Families Forum that they strongly push the government to accept this deal. There have been thousands on the streets of Israel over recent weeks and months and we've heard from the forum themselves saying if the Israeli government does not accept this deal at this point there won't be thousands on the street there will be millions on the street. So certainly we have been here before as I say there will be a lot of caution with this as well but given it had been stalled for many weeks this at least is something happening at this point.

And that's one of my biggest, you know, disappointments with this medication being approved so early. These studies were just one or two year studies. And yes, obesity and the secondary complications of that heart disease, diabetes is probably America's biggest problem.But what I tell these people is we still don't know what may come down the line. Remember Fenfen? Everybody loved Fenfen. You know, you lost weight on Fenfen. Wow. A few years later, you found out that it caused heart issues. So it is good for some things. It is good for people that are morbidly obese and really need to lose weight. But it is not a stopgap. And one thing that I am seeing, there's a certain anorexia, maybe psychological, that develops with people that now see themselves thin, are getting positive reinforcement from everyone around them, and they don't want to let go. This, by all terms, by all definitions, is basically an addiction.",
