They don't use in their language, they don't acknowledge that this plane was owned by the authoritarian president, Nicolas Maduro, as an indictment from the Justice Department reads.However, they say, and I think it's really important to point it out, Brianna, they say that these actions reveal that no country is safe from these type of actions, which, frankly, is exactly the message that the United States is trying to give, Brianna. Because when they filtered this news yesterday to my colleague, Priscilla Alvarez, the message that the White House is trying to point out, not just to Maduro, but to all the allies and to hold the apparatus that sustained the Maduro's government down in Venezuela is that nobody is safe from sanctions or from coercive action from the United States if they're complicit with what the United States are saying are crimes. So this statement, frankly, opens the door to exactly the same sort of narrative, Brianna, Boris, that the White House is trying to project, that they are standing squarely with Edmundo Gonzalez, despite his arrest warrant, with the Venezuelan opposition, saying strongly that they believe they won a popular mandate to be the next leaders in the country, regardless of these potential arrests that we are following very closely -- Boris, Brianna.",

It seems like every couple of months some justice has a book out. But this is different. First of all, in terms of its speed, Justice Jackson has been on the bench only two years. And she pretty quickly after she earned her appointment, she signed this contract. So the speed is one thing. But the other thing is just how intimate it is. She just really shows the day to day nitty gritty of her life and her striving to get to the court. And it's all, of course, against the backdrop of the fact that she was this historic first Black woman on the Supreme Court and all that it took to get there. At one point, she writes: Only one generation after my mother and father had experienced the spirit crushing effects of racial segregation and housing, schooling and transportation while growing up in Florida, their daughter was standing on the threshold of history, the embodiment of our ancestors dreams.
