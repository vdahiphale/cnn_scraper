How could we forget?So, as the U.S. Supreme Court is taking up a major abortion case today about a ban in Idaho, we are also watching Arizona, where Arizona Statehouse lawmakers are expected to clear a major hurdle in the effort to repeal an eight -- that 1800s-era abortion ban we've talked so much about that's really thrown that state into chaos. The move today is something that the Statehouse tried and failed to pull off twice last week. CNN's Natasha Chen is in Phoenix and she's joining us now. Natasha, what has changed this week?

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, a Republican source tells me that since last week's two failed attempts, there is now believed to be enough votes to first, bypass a procedural hurdle and then repeal this law. The Democrats need two Republicans to vote with them for this to happen because of such razor-thin majorities for Republicans actually in both chambers.Now, if this happens, that doesn't mean it's immediately repealed because then it has to go over to the Senate. They have to have a couple of readings on this. And the Senate is expected to pass the repeal, though, at which point then it goes to the governor. So if this all goes to plan this wouldn't be officially repealed until early May. Now, just to remind viewers what the law is, this 1864 -- the law that dates back to 1864 bans nearly all abortions except in the case of saving the pregnant person's life. There is no exception for rape or incest. And this wouldn't go into effect until June 8 at the earliest, even if -- assuming that there's no repeal here in the -- at the state legislature. In the meantime, until June 8, the current law in effect is this 15- week abortion ban that the state passed in 2022. So you can imagine the confusion when you have these two laws side-by-side. That's why the State Supreme Court had to issue this ruling evoking reaction from people like Kari Lake running for Senate here. When the ruling came out, she said this was out of step with Arizonans. But this is what she said to the Idaho Dispatch earlier this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARI LAKE, (R) ARIZONA Senate CANDIDATE:  The Arizona Supreme Court said this is the law of Arizona but unfortunately, the people running our state have said we're not going to enforce it.

Is this the best example of how Republicans are struggling with this issue of abortion as state-by-state starts to sort of crunch down and try to restrict abortion even more? ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, PODCAST HOST, \"HOT MICS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT\":  I would not put Kari Lake out there as an example of how to do a lot of things. But I can say this. Look, the pro-life community and social conservative have fought really hard to overturn Roe v. Wade and those in the pro-life community will continue to do so. The political reality is we understand the reality of this issue now in the post-Roe era. In the post-Roe world, every time abortion is a single issue on a ballot in states, the pro-abortion crowd has won. So what I -- what I recommend, and I think Republicans need to do politically speaking moving forward, is embrace the current situation. And you can be pro-life. You can be anti-abortion. But you can also do everything you can to protect the sanctity of life and understand what kind of legislation -- what kind of laws need to be in place that can be embraced by everyone. And that means protecting the sanctity of life. That means exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. And let's get away from talking about bans and let's talk about abortion limits. Where people can agree that is a reasonable limit on abortions and have that conversation. And I think Nikki Haley also hit it on the head when she said let's make sure and stop demonizing this issue. Stop demonizing people on both sides and let's have rational conversations on what limits can be in place. And that's where Republicans need to go moving forward.",

Hence, why you see Kari Lake -- and this is candidate agnostic -- she may be a bad candidate -- but this is every Republican candidate. They are trying to appease that extremist base that they need while also then flip-flopping constantly to go after those Independents.

We're talking about inflation, the economy, the border, national security. They would much rather be talking about abortion than issues that are top of mind for voters. And look, this will be a galvanizing issue. Politically speaking, I don't blame them. Go out there and rally the base.

But then you go back to your original airline, and they say well, look, we didn't cancel the flight so you're not getting your money back. Now you're out the original airfare and the extra money it cost to get this new ticket. That's just one example of the kind of scenarios that we hear from passengers time and time again. We're putting a stop to it now. From now on, when your flight is canceled for any reason, you are entitled to an automatic cash refund, and it has to be prompt. If you get delayed significantly -- that means three hours domestically, six hours internationally -- of if there's another significant change to your itinerary, like maybe you were going to go into one airport and they actually changed the airport on you, or something like that -- you're going to get your money back. And importantly, you're going to get it without having to ask. Another situation we see a lot is you get a cancelation or a disruption and the airline says we're so sorry, here's 2,000 miles. And maybe that sounds good but that's worth $20.00 when actually you are owed hundreds. So this is all about making it simpler for passengers. And also with this rule, new provisions about the information that you should get upfront so that you know before you buy a ticket what some of the fees are that are connected to that. We're seeing a lot of these hidden fees, junk fees and it's not a free market if you don't know what you're getting or how much you are paying before you make that commitment to purchase a ticket.",

You pay extra to check a bag and the bag doesn't get there, then you ought to get your money back for that. I know that there are a lot of different things we've been adding in since we set out on this mission to expand passengers' rights. So I want to make sure passengers know you can go to flightrights.gov. It's a website with a lot of clear information about what you can expect, what we enforce, and a way to let us know if you have a problem with an airline because we will follow up. So far, just since this administration got here and just since I got this job, we've seen about $3 billion go back into passengers' pockets through refunds and enforcement actions that we've driven, and we're going to have more where that came from. This is about also making sure it's less likely to happen to you in the first place. When an airline knows that anybody on a flight that's going to get canceled is going to get their money back, it gives them more of a reason to make the investments and the realistic schedules to prevent that from happening to you in the first place.",

Nearly 40 percent of people across the United States are living in places that have unhealthy levels of polluted air. That is according to new data from the American Lung Association. The report also shows that number is actually on the rise.Let's get right to CNN's Jacqueline Howard for the details on this. Is there any sense of exactly what is causing this increase? And it's on the rise. It's already bad for 40 percent of the people.",

And if he has crossed the line -- if that's what the judge decides -- what is the penalty going to be?And also, the plot thickens, maybe. There is perhaps another example of Donald Trump violating that gag order in a new interview with CNN affiliate WPBI. It was conducted before yesterday's gag order hearing but aired after it all wrapped up. Donald Trump, once again, going after Michael Cohen -- listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Michael Cohen is a convicted liar and he's got no credibility whatsoever. He was a lawyer, and you rely on your lawyers. But Michael Cohen was a convicted liar. He was a lawyer for many people, not just me, and he got in trouble because of things outside of what he did for me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But you see it on your screen there. And the judge responding at one point, \"You are losing all credibility with the court.\" What do you think could happen now?

And I think what the judge is trying to figure out and trying to draw Blanche into is is this how the lawyer explained it to Trump? And obviously, that's problematic to get into privileged conversations.But Todd is kind of telling the line of saying this is -- what he's done is not a violation of the order, and the judge is trying to figure out well, did his lawyer tell him that? Because if he's complying with his lawyer's interpretation, then maybe the wrong person is my target. And so, is Todd Blanche trying to take fire away from his client? I don't know. But it is definitely a situation that I wouldn't want to be in. I mean, I look at this and I think the only real legitimate defense, as I see it, to this is to -- is something that won't work with this judge is to attack the breadth of the order itself. And I think that there is an argument to be made there but it's not going to work until you get up on an appeal.",
