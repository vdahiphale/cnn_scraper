And some major shipping companies are halting journeys through the Red Sea after a series of attacks. Live from New York, on Friday, it's December 15th. I am Richard Quest, and I mean business. Good evening. The Israeli military says it has accidentally killed three hostages in northern Gaza. The IDF says that three men were shot after being mistakenly identified as a threat. The bodies have been taken back to Israel and were later identified. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has released a statement on X, saying he speaks of his unbearable tragedy. Forgive me if I look down while I read. It's only just come through. Benjamin Netanyahu says, along with all the people of Israel, I bow my head with deep sorrow and mourn the death of three of our dear sons. This is an unbearable tragedy. Alex Marquardt is with me in Tel Aviv. What happened, Alex?",

Alon Shamriz was the third hostage, whose name we did not have until just moments ago when we got it from the Israel Defense Forces. So Alon Shamriz, along with Yotam Haim, 28 years old. The two of them, both of them kidnapped from a kibbutz near the Gaza Strip, Kibbutz Kfar Aza. And then there was a third man Samer Talalka, 25 years old. He was kidnapped from another kibbutz. Richard, this happened in Shejaiya, which is a neighborhood in northeastern Gaza. It is where there has been heavy fighting for the past few weeks. The IDF has been trying to clear out northern Gaza, Shejaiya in particular, along with the Jabalya refugee camp nearby. This incident happened earlier on Friday. We don't know if it was during the day or when it was still dark. But what we understand is that these three men were spotted by IDF troops who mistook them presumably for enemy combatants, fired on them, and killed them. The troops then went over and looked to the bodies, grew suspicious that they might be hostages. The bodies were taken back to Israel, and they were identified and confirmed to be hostages. Now, of course, the IDF tonight, showing incredible remorse and sorrow, but at the same time, they say they still have to investigate. The -- Daniel Hagari, the main spokesman for the IDF, was asked if, for example, the men, when they emerged, if they had their hands up, if they were speaking Hebrew. That's something that he did not have the answer to. Hagari said it was possible that the men had escaped from captivity or that, during the fighting, they had gotten away or gotten left behind, that perhaps the Hamas militants had moved on and simply left them behind. So there are clearly a lot of unanswered questions. But, Richard, until now, there were just over 130 hostages who remained in the Gaza Strip with around 20 of them believed to be dead. So just around 110 or so believed to be alive -- Richard.",

Now they face a winter with an invigorated Russia using everything it possibly can -- drones, prisoners -- to attack their positions, but no longer they feel that pretty much the west, unified, has their back. That's, essentially, the big change that we've seen this week. And I think it's going to slowly deteriorate Ukraine's readiness here.

I am guessing, General, that you're not surprised that this happened. At some point, something like this was going to take place. GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think that's right, Richard. When you're in close combat like this and you are moving and fighting against people in civilian clothes, there's going to be something like this. The way I'm picturing it in my minds eye is, think of a squad of Israeli soldiers, half a dozen guys on the ground, a couple of them with automatic weapons, some rifles. And they're told, they said, we're are going to go around this corner, the building, the building is wrecked. There's much rubble on the street. You're going to -- there is people moving up there, watch out. So, they are on high alert. They go around, sure enough, they are engaged when they go around, they're engaged. And people start shooting at them. They returned fire. There is a group of six or eight guys. They see three or four guys shooting at them. They take them out. Turns out that three of them were hostages, being moved from one location to another by Hamas. That's one conceivable scenario. It is just speculation. We don't know right now. What this comes down to, what are the rules of engagement that you are required to hold fire until you're engaged? Can you -- can you engage when you have positive identification of the enemy, or somebody carrying a rifle at some enemy. Or are there other rules of engagement? And then it is the discipline of the troops, they've got to follow the rules of engagement. So, you can expect that these troops been pulled offline, there will be a lot of talk. It will go right up the chain of command. They will find out what the rules were, where they passed down. Who is in charge? Why didn't happen, and so forth. It is a real tragedy.
