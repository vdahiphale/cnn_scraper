One really interesting thing happened today, and this just speaks to the complexity of this case, and also just how intertwined all of this is. All of this is happening at a courthouse in Washington. And will Russell is before the grand jury. His attorney is this guy, Stan Woodward, who is also representing other people, Walt Nauta, Trump's co-defendant. He was late to a hearing of a verdict reading for someone, a rioter on January 6th. He got in trouble from the judge because he was late to that and he had to tell the judge it was because he was dealing with executive privilege issues for Will Russell over here as he is testifying in front of the grand jury that's hearing evidence on this.",

But if you are investigating other crimes or other people, you absolutely can carry on. You know how prosecutors always say the investigation is ongoing, we say that all the time.

For several days now, investigators have been searching the architect's Long Island home. They've been seen carrying a number of items from the property, including more than 200 firearms in a filing cabinet. Suspect is pleaded not guilty to three murders and is the prime suspect in a fourth. All of them had done sex work.
