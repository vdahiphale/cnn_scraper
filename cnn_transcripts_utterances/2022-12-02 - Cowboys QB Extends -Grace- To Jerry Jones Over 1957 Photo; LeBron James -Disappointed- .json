Coming up this hour, LeBron James wants to know why the media is not making a bigger deal out of that 1957 photo that surfaced last week of the Cowboys owner Jerry Jones at that desegregation protest in Arkansas. The Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott is also weighing in.Plus, this morning, gas prices are going down. Good news, they are now lower than they were when Putin actually attacked Ukraine and started that war that has now been going on for months. Also this morning, the White House investors Don, Poppy, and, Kaitlan, we are awaiting the key November jobs report. We will have it for you in just a few moments.",

Like you actually know the human being. That will be why you would be asked about one and not asked about another.And I do think that there's a larger point that comes up here that when somebody like Jerry Jones gets in one of these things, nobody really wants to be the person to say that the old man is a racist. Like it makes people feel a little uncomfortable. They don't like that. They would prefer to move on. But players, in particular, and often black ones, have to answer for these things and have to answer for each other in these circumstances where owners never have to answer for anything. The interesting thing about Jerry Jones is he's the only one that actually does answer questions and actually does take them. But, no, he's not going to get pressed on this the way athletes generally are. And black athletes, in particular, wind up getting pressed when these sorts of things come up. I do, however, subscribe to the camp that's on this one with, I don't know what you want me to do with something that was 65 years old and to do was a teenager. Like, I personally am not going down that road. I'd much rather focus on the long Washington Post story. Thousands and thousands of words. They use that picture as a metaphor to reflect Jerry's poor record in hiring, which I think is far more important than getting into the, hey, man, what were you doing back in 1957? That doesn't matter that much to me. What happens now or more importantly, what doesn't happen now? That's the one that I lean on.",

After he put out the statement saying, hey, I made mistakes. He then came out and said he was going to stand on his innocence when there were questions asked of him this week about it. He just wants to keep it moving and go talk about something else. I don't think that's really going to work for him, because until you answer for it, people are going to keep asking questions.

Like, this is something that the team is supposed to deal with and so they went from there. With Goodell, they tried and they tried because they just stick their thumb in the way and try to figure out what public opinion says. And public opinion says people think he's nasty.Therefore, they were going to try to do something with him. But the diabolical brilliance of the NFL, when you stop and think about this, he's coming back now. And I believe this is week 13, everybody's deep into the football part of it. If you give a sports media an option, they're always going to talk about the football instead of talking about the other stuff because everybody showed up for the football, only some people showed up for the other stuff. So here we are. This is actually maybe the least interesting game on the NFL slate. Like, if you want people to pay attention to football, this isn't the one. They're playing against a terrible team. The brows themselves aren't actually good. And so, what's going to happen is, he's going to comeback in this tail end of the season and people aren't really going to pay too much attention to him. They're already dealing with the comeback to Houston game. It's going to happen first, whatever it is. They're just getting all of that out of the way right now and hoping that by the time he comes back around next season, they will have moved on and they can get back to talking about football. But nothing I've seen from Watson has demonstrated to me that if he had a problem before, that anything's been done about it. Like, he was asked a question like, hey, what have you done? You know, what have you learned in this process? That's a bit of a legal and a medical thing. They just ask what you learned, man. All people want to hear from him at this point is, yes, I need to change the way that I was doing things. He didn't even really have to get specific about it. He won't even do that.
