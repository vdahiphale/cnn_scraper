Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): For me, Qatar is no different in essence from the U.N., it is no different in essence from the Red Cross, and in a certain sense, it is even worse, more problematic. I was very angry recently and I didn't hide it from the Americans that they renewed the contract on the military base they have with Qatar. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, Qatar says that its relationship with the terror master heads, the Hamas leadership that have been there for years and are still there, is something that can benefit the civilized world. And we say, OK, let's see it. The burden of proof is on them. Boris, you know that there are at least 136 more hostages who are in Gaza right now. Around 100 of them, we believe, are still alive.

You know, we say that what worked back in November is the combination of two things.First, the IDF pressure on the ground, the fact that we are exerting a lot of pressure, hitting Hamas hard, is what created the conditions to reach this framework that saw the release of some of the hostages. Hamas terrorists on the ground, they wanted a breather. And we said that we would agree to a humanitarian pause in the fighting that will facilitate the release of hostages. We still stand by it. As you know, Hamas were the ones that broke the other framework on day eight, if I'm correct. And we are continuing to pursue every possible avenue that would bring the release of more hostages. This is a combination of heavy military pressure. And also, we're working diplomatic avenues behind the scenes. I know that there are a lot of reports out there, allegedly, about offers that are on the table. Not all of them are correct. Most of them are incorrect. But we're not commenting about the nature of these talks, because we believe that it's everything -- everything is so sensitive right now. We're talking about human lives.

So they could send it out to a wide area or a small area and say this crime, this is this suspicious activity. There was a murder, a robbery, an attempted child molestation. And of course, you know, we've seen all those videos of crimes that were caught on camera, people who were caught attempting burglaries, bears on people's porches, lots of things. But police were able to kind of send out these requests and get people to give them the video where they saw suspicious activity. Now, Amazon and Ring have removed that function. They say they've sunsetted it, but they don't say why. Interestingly, a privacy advocacy group called the EFF out of Washington on their website is calling it a major victory from a long fought battle to reduce the network of, you know, police surveillance they say permeates across the country.",

And BioRescue is hoping that they can then do this procedure for their much rarer northern counterparts within two and a half years, which would certainly be very exciting. So joining us now to talk about it is the host of Wildlife Nation,Jeff Corwin. All right, Jeff, I mean, we said it there, just two northern white rhino left. How big of a scientific feat is this? JEFF CORWIN, HOST, \"WILDLIFE NATION\": Well, this is a very exciting moment, but they still have a very long journey ahead before they save this truly eclipsing species. This incredible group of animals, the northern white rhino, are all, in a sense of purposes, they are biologically extinct. We only have two females that are surviving and they are now very old. They're not very productive right now in this stage of the reproductive cycle. So, Brianna, we're relying on the southern white rhino, which has a population of about 15,000, and there we can, through in vitro fertilization, actually implant an embryo that is created from the material, the reproductive material that still exists today. We have about 12 individual specimens from the northern white rhino. But this is the sun setting on this species, and we are literally in a fight to try to save them from extinction.",

So one rhino horn has this tremendous black market value.It's used in medicinal trinkets, and it's used in the creation of like ornamental things for spears and for daggers and stuff. But this greed and this hunger for this endangered species is what drove it to the brink of extinction. I have a personal connection to this species. Back in 2009, in a documentary I did, we were there to help move the five surviving rhinos to their new home. And now to see this species get reduced to only two, it's sort of heartbreaking. But to know that there is hope, but a long journey ahead, that sort of gives me a bit of pause to think that maybe we could pull this off. But there's a long way to go.",
