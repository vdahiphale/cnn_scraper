It was followed by another statement from the former president speaking about himself in the third person. Quoting now: \"As we've been saying from the moment President Trump rode down the golden escalator, the president did nothing wrong.\" So not only did the former president say he didn't do what he was caught on tape doing. According to him, he's never done one single thing wrong since the moment he declared his candidacy in 2015, despite being caught on tape this time and indicted, despite being caught on tape asking Georgia officials to find him 11,780 votes, which he was not entitled to in the 2020 election and facing another possible indictment. And despite having been recorded asking the president of Ukraine for help smearing then candidate Joe Biden in exchange for military aid and being impeached; despite having been found liable for defaming the woman he was also found liable for sexually abusing in the 1990s -- all of that, but to believe the former president and his supporters, there is simply nothing to see here.

And I think that is why you hear Republicans be so hesitant to come out.I mean, there was a Congressman from Tennessee on with Dana earlier today, and he was saying he called it bizarro world that every time something like this happens, for him, his numbers would plummet. But for Trump, you know, his polling, and as we can see the polling, he still does okay. And he was saying just how mystified he is by that, not even in a critical way. But I do think that's how Republicans see this. And as Trump was flying back from New Hampshire today, he has two reporters on the plane with him. One is from Semafor, Shelby Talcott. And he said to her explaining his comments on the audio saying it was bravado in there as he was talking to the people in the room. And it reminded me of \"Access Hollywood\" when he was saying, you know, it's just locker room talk, and it gave Republicans this defense to use and they came out and used it after being a little bit quiet for a bit. And it just -- I think that is part of the mentality in how Republicans stand up for him. They see how he is doing in the polls and they see that he has weathered other scandals.",

But today's decision was a reverberating, resounding victory for America's democracy, but to your specific question, the independent -- so-called independent state legislature theory of constitutional interpretation was the centerpiece of the former president's effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election.And in particular, that aspect of the plan that called for the various legislatures in the swing states to transmit to Congress, for counting fake electoral slates that would vote for Donald Trump over Joe Biden, even though Joe Biden had won the popular vote in those respective states. The former president and his allies had argued for this independent state legislature theory, even before the 2020 presidential election. And in December of 2020, the Supreme Court actually declined to take the case, which would have settled the issue prior to January 6, and I always thought that the court had an obligation to take the case at that time, but it did not, and once it did not, I and other people who follow the Supreme Court knew that the court would take the case sooner rather than later and it took Moore versus Harper sooner and decided that case today.  COOPER: So do you believe or I guess what impact do you think the Supreme Court ruling today could have on the special counsel's investigation for instance of the former president?",
