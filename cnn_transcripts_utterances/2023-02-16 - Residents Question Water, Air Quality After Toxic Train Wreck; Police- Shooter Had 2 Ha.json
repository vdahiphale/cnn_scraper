Now those people who have wells, what they are suggesting is if you have a well, you should still continue drinking bottled water until your well water is tested. I spoke to a woman who lives just downstream from where we are right now. There were dead fish in the stream behind her home. She has a well. She has been drinking bottled water. And she is still waiting at last check for someone to come out and test her well water. So for those people who are in East Palestine who are using well water, private well water, the suggestion is that you continue using bottled water until testing can be completed.",

Bill, good to see you. Some people in the town say that they've had a hard time breathing or they felt burning in their eyes. And obviously we're just seeing pictures. Ohio was confirmed thousands of fish died in the wake of the train wreck. I mean can you tell us and help us understand what's in these chemicals that made this such a disaster?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. It's really a sort of a witch's brew cocktail of at least five different chemicals. Some of them were not initially revealed to the folks there. So that's one big reason for the mistrust you're seeing today. The big one at the top, vinyl chloride, this is what is in PVC piping. As it burns, it turns into both phosgene, which was a World War II or World War I weapon, a respiratory weapon as well as hydrochloric acid.We saw that when the wildfires took down Paradise, California, and those homes burned, the pipes, the PVC pipes that melted, really soiled the water supply there, tainted that as well. Benzene, these are carcinogens in long term exposure. These here, the butyl acrylate and the ethylhexyl acrylate, isobutylene, testing my chemistry classes here, the warnings on these are aquatic life, nausea, breathing problems in the near term, aquatic life a long term. And you talked about the fish kill, the 3,000 or 3,500 fish that were mentioned, they believe that's in a plume that's moving down the Ohio River. So they can sort of track that as well. And there's no new source of this chemical that's like a pipeline a spill or rupture that's continuingly pumping chemicals into the water supply. So they think by dilution of that in the water and then in the air by burning off all of that vinyl chloride on the early days there, a lot of that experts tell me is probably out of the air. But it's the soil that hasn't been moved yet that has residents worried about what's going to happen to that.",

Investigators also telling us they recovered a backpack the shooter was carrying. And in that backpack, they found eight loaded magazines of nine millimeter ammunition. That's not all. They also discovered a pencil size pouch containing 50 loose rounds of ammo and two empty magazines.Investigators saying today inside of a wallet, the shooter had, they found a note. And that note was two pages. It listed businesses this 43-year-old shooter wanted to target. Investigators saying among the businesses was a warehouse where he once worked. They also told us about the encounter before that 43-year-old man ended his life. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. RENE GONZALEZ, MICHIGAN STATE POLICE: Two LPD officers made contact with the shooter, approximately 20 feet from McRae. They exited their vehicle, ordered him to put his show his hands. However, he produced a weapon and then killed himself. It does appear that from the body worn camera, that McRae did not verbalize anything to the officers prior to him shooting himself or taking his own life. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But he states, you know, my name is Anthony McRae, and I'm going to shoot up the State University. So he basically assigns that location to himself.But having talked to profilers who have reviewed the contents of the note, you know, what they suggest is here is a loner. He has no relationships. He has no friends. There are no teams. But he has created this note to increase the feelings of fear, the menace that he possesses, to make himself out to be this leader of a group to help stoke that fear and his target list. The question there is, Kasie, did he expect to get away with the shooting at the university and then to go through other targets that were mentioned in his note, perhaps leaving the note behind again to instill fear? Or was he always intending to either be confronted by police or take his own life?",

      "sentences": "Well, in his note, he makes a reference to the same supermarket but in Colorado Springs as opposed to boulder, where the shooting happened. So the question with people at the behavioral Science Unit at FBI Academy in Quantico who are going over the note are probably raising is, did he mix that up or confuse that? Was that a target that means something to him because it's in a different city? What do all of these targets mean? But, you know, he paints himself to be the victim, Kasie.He says, people hate me. They made me what I am today, a killer. No one noticed me. Why do they hate me? I am a person. So what you get the sense of is not just that he's a loner, which his family told us, but this increasing feeling of isolationism, injustice collector, all of these tiny, slights or things that bothered him in his contacts with these locations have built up to the point that he's created a target list and that he is trying to rewrite his story.",

They found and this is a huge study with more than 18,000 children ages one to five. So we're talking little children. Almost half did not eat a vegetable every day. About one in three did not eat a fruit every day. Almost 60 percent drank at least one sugary beverage a week. And this is at a time when childhood obesity rates are so high.Let's take a look at that. So 13 percent of children ages two to five are obese, 21 percent of children ages six to 11. When you put it all together, it's 14 million children and adolescents in the U.S. who are obese. And I know, as a mom of four, how hard it is to get your children to eat right. It definitely is a struggle, especially when packaged foods are so attractive. Kasie?",
