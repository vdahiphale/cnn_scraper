It is thecenterpiece deal for the climate summit and could signal the beginning of the end for the fossil fuel era. Some countries and experts say that too many loopholes remain. It falls short of calling on nations to phase out coal, oil and gas. Language that more than 100 countries have been calling for to be included. They say that the agreement is not sufficient to reflect the growing urgency of the climate crisis. So tonight we ask, is this climate deal going far enough? We have David McKenzie joining us now live from Johannesburg. David, we know that there was a huge delay in terms of getting this final agreement. It did seem to pass very quickly during that plenary session. But it is historic and it must be said, because finally we have the words \"fossil fuel\" in a COP agreement.",

In terms ofsentiment, it is definitely significant that the countries, all of, them came together to find consensus on the transition away from fossil fuels. It's pretty extraordinary. After all this time and all the evidence we have, that fossil fuels, coal, oil and gas, are the chief culprits when it comes to climate change and the climate crisis, that we are finally getting it in a document like this, that, unfortunately, for many isn't enforceable. It's nonbinding but it is still significant. Countries have also been asked to move away toward renewable energy as a whole, tripling the level of renewable energy and also looking into issues like carbon capture. Some critics say that this is a loophole but it is significant that there was a consensus. The next decade will be critical to see whether the reductions in fossil fuel use will be enough to get to this 1.5-degree goal of the past agreement.",

In the meantime, now the Israeli military says that nine soldiers were killed in a single incident in northern Gaza Tuesday as the ongoing battle against Hamas expands. It is among the biggest losses of life in a single incident for Israeli forces since the ground offensive began in October. Meanwhile, 85 percent of Gaza citizens are now displaced, according to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees. Many are now in areas which offer very little shelter, not only from Israel's ongoing bombardment but also from increasingly cooling temperatures and torrential rain. Parts of the enclave are now facing flooding. We can see these images right there. All right, so we've also been seeing the spread of diseases like chicken pox and meningitis, very scary scenarios that are playing out in Gaza right now. We have our chief national security correspondent, Alex Marquardt, following all of this from Tel Aviv. I have to say, looking at these images of displaced Palestinians with makeshift shelters, at least tents, and seeing children and adults trying to sweep away water, what seems like almost a Sisyphean task, almost impossible with the diseases and everything that we have been hearing, Alex.

And then you have the inclement weather, the rain on top of that. Yesterday, we saw these storms here in Tel Aviv and the same in Gaza. I've not seen rainfall like that in a very long time. It has created flooding. And you can see those pictures of people wading in water up to their ankles, sometimes higher, up to their knees. It's going into the tents. When this war started two months ago, people were told to evacuate from the north and many of them listened. But that was two months ago. The weather has changed. They left without many of their belongings. They left with that winter clothing so they don't have the proper clothing. They are trying to create heat with fires, collecting whatever bits of plastic and wood that they can find. And then in terms of the aid that's going in, clearly it is not nearly enough. And that is for a number of reasons. There is only one border crossing that goes into Gaza. That is Rafah from Egypt. That was not built to have the hundreds of trucks needed per day go through it. It can't cope with that amount. At the same time, once they do cross into Gaza, you have this chaotic situation, where people are swarming these trucks because they are so desperately in need of aid. The humanitarian groups can't drive those trucks any farther north and distribute the aid because of the intense fighting. So it is an incredibly dire situation. More aid is needed and more gates and crossings are essentially needed to open up. And that is why we are now seeing the White House very vocally telling Israel -- and, of course, the U.S. is Israel's biggest backer here -- that they need to open that Kerem Shalom crossing I was at yesterday, which is now inspecting more aid. But the U.S. saying that that needs to be opened up so that more aid can get in. It is truly a horrendous situation that is only getting worse by the hour, Eleni.",

That is equivalent to nine out of 10 active duty troops before the war; 2,200 out of 3,500 tanks have also been lost and 4,400 or nearly one-third of infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers have been destroyed. CNN's Katie Bo Lillis has been working the story for us and she joins us now from the U.S. Capitol.

Now it's important to understand that Russia has been able to defray some of these losses. They have relied on groups like the Wagner Group, bringing in convict fighters. They've also been able to launch a number of rounds of conscription. They have relaxed some of their mobilization and recruitment efforts. So Russia's continued to throw bodies at this fight and add manpower to this fight but nevertheless -- and I want to quote from this assessment directly. The U.S. intelligence community has assessed that the war has, quote, \"sharply set back 15 years of Russian effort to modernize its ground force.\" As of late November, according to this assessment, Russia has lost over a quarter of its preinvasion stockpiles of ground forces equipment, which has reduced the complexity and scale of Russian offensive operations, which have failed to make any major gains in Ukraine since early 2022. So again, having a big impact on the Russian military but I think the important piece of context to keep in mind here is that the U.S. intelligence community still believes that Putin thinks he can outwit, outlast, outwait U.S. import, that essentially the West is going to eventually get tired of the support that it's providing Ukraine. And Russia will essentially be able to do what it has done in past wars, which is achieve victory through just sheer volume, right? They are just going to keep throwing human beings at this. And certainly the number of men in -- fighting age men, who are available to Russia to call up, is significant. So this is a real concern I think for the Ukrainians. And, of course, if you're Vladimir Putin right now, there are some signs that that strategy of patience may pay off. Here in Washington, of course, the big story is that the support, the military and economic support that the United States has been providing Ukraine is in peril. You have the White House warning that if Congress does not move to pass an additional package of military and economic support for Ukraine, that U.S. support may be in very real danger here. You have a number of Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have expressed increasing skepticism, if not outright rejection, of additional spending for Ukraine and now lawmakers appearing increasingly unlikely to pass a package prior to the holiday break.",

We know that, publicly and privately, Biden has urged Netanyahu to take greater care, to try to protect civilian lives in Gaza as they are waging this campaign. But there has been a lot of frustration from the international community about how Israel has proceeded. You start to see more countries, most recently Canada, breaking from the U.S. and publicly calling for a full cease-fire at this moment. And you also had some pretty pointed comments from Biden about Netanyahu and his hardline government. He said that Netanyahu has to change but he is limited by the conservative government that is currently in place at this moment. There are also these very public disagreements about the path forward for what happens the day after this campaign against Hamas ends. Netanyahu saying that he disagrees with the U.S. suggestions about the Palestinian Authority coming back in a revitalized way. The U.S. noting that Netanyahu's current government does not support a two- state solution. So these are all areas that both the U.S. and Israel are publicly now having to navigate as that rift is now occurring. Now I will also note that, in just a short while, we expect President Biden to meet for the first time face to face with the families of those eight American hostages, still being held by Hamas. Some will be here in person, some joining virtually. And it comes at a time when sources say that Hamas so far has been unresponsive in trying to get those hostage negotiations back on track. Qatar has tried reaching out, offering some ideas of potential releases. But so far, there has been no response. So that is also another angle that President Biden is trying to navigate as he is trying to assure these families that they are still working and doing all that they can forget their loved ones back home.",

And, of course, medicine that weall knew was going to taste bitter but perhaps not quite this bitter. Because, of course, it hits people's pocketbooks. But really, this is acknowledging the reality. The Argentine peso officially was at a little bit less than 400 to the dollar. On the black market, it's closer to 1,000. So this is essentially bringing the peso closer to what everyone knows is the reality, the actual exchange rate that the people have been using. That hasn't taken the sting away for people that are barely getting by. Argentina is a country that, over the years, people there have compared themselves and their economy to European countries, not the rest of Latin America. Now it is a country where there is a 40 percent poverty rate, is really studying how quickly Argentina has fallen. Of course this is a crisis that has been going on for years. But really in the last several years with hyperinflation has just gotten so much worse. So these are the really tough steps that the new president, Javier Milei, says his country has to take, devaluing the peso to this degree. He has talked about adopting the U.S. dollar. But the country does not have enough U.S. dollars to do that, at least for the moment. So in the meantime, they're cutting public works spending. They will be reducing the number of government ministries. There will be a lot less government spending, which traditionally has provided a lot of people with a lot of jobs, has kept the economy afloat. And Javier Milei, you know, when he took office, he said the era of decadence is over. The country cannot afford to keep running up these kinds of deficits. His economy minister said that there is no money left. And essentially this new administration has been left with no money from the previous administration and, in their words, there's never been an incoming administration that has had so little money to work with. Javier Milei, like all new presidents, has enjoyed somewhat of a honeymoon. But it seems that the honeymoon is not going to last very long. These are tough economic measures that are going to feel -- many people will be feeling the pain very soon.",

Elon Musk's automaker is recalling almost every car it has produced, some 2 million vehicles, so that it can fix a problem with the autopilot. U.S. regulators say that Tesla needs to ensure that drivers still pay attention while the autopilot is in use. They say that mistakes by the Tesla autopilot have resulted in nearly 1,000 crashes in U.S., including multiple deaths. Data just out in the United States showing inflation slowed on an annual basis last month when it came to wholesale prices. The producer price index rose at a rate of 0.9 percent annually in November. And that is a smaller rise than anticipated. The cost of making goods is an important number to watch as economists and the Federal Reserve try to gauge where the country stands in its fight against inflation. Vanessa Yurkevich with us from New York to break down the numbers. And I was just looking at that graph, it's really going in the right direction. It's going much lower. And when you see prices at the factory gates, it is important to see this downward projection, because it also is reflecting the cost of producing goods, which includes anything to do with fossil fuels. Is it enough though to try and stop the Federal Reserve in its tracks in terms of what it could do with interest rates?",

Reporters are really going to try to get into the mind of Jerome Powell and the Fed to understand why they made the decision that they made today. What do they think about inflation and the economy? Ultimately, when will they cut rates? You can see the markets there are up, really responding to what they believe the Fed is going to do, which is pause rates. People want to know about rate cuts. When you start to cut rates, you start to bring down mortgage rates for Americans. You start to bring down the interest on student loans, car loans. These are things that people pay every single month. But Jerome Powell holds his cards close to his vest.
