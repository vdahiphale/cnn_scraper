That is that the 25 year old Jayland Walker reportedly shot at least one time at officers doing the vehicle pursuit portion of that night back in June of last year.And because of that, when the 25-year old man bailed out of his vehicle and then initiated that foot chase, according to the attorney general, officers believed that he was still armed and that is why authorities established that when he reached toward his waistband, they assumed that he had a weapon, and that's when they opened fire. Of course, we still have to find out if that use of force will actually be justified, but this certainly is going to raise a lot of questions about a potential -- about what might happen in the community there in Akron. I should tell you, Jake, I've been speaking to people there in the community they have prepared for this for weeks for this announcement that you're about to hear from the state's attorney general.",

The distinction is a grand jury is impaneled and they don't decide guilt or innocence. They merely decide whether there's reason to believe that a crime occurred and that any of these officers committed that. Of course, we know that the prosecutor controls the grand jury, instructs the grand jury as to the law, and it's done in secrecy. And so, I think if it were brought to the forefront, and it were done where there were really a forum, where people would have been allowed to see the evidence, see the witnesses, look at the questions, see the responses, I think that there would be more public trust. But to the extent that it did not get that far, I think that there's great disappointment within the community with respect to the grand jury's determination, Jake.

I think you can have people -- the direct answer to your question is that it depends when the shot was fired. If you shot a -- if you fired a shot at some earlier time and informs the judgment of the police as to whether or not there is a gun, that's going to heighten your alertness. That in and of itself doesn't give you the right, as an officer or anyone, to fire a shot unless at the time the shot was fired. You had that immediacy of fear.But the issues about whether or not the actions were justified, whether they were not, did the police act properly, appropriately in accordance with regulations and rules, et cetera, that's something, I think, again, that the public would have wanted to see by virtue of bringing the case to a jury, and to the extent that we've heard many times that a jury would indict a ham sandwich, you're left to wonder what happened in this particular case. And I think, the community, you know, whether real, imagined, perception or otherwise, the perception is the reality. They didn't indict. Why didn't they? Why wasn't the public allowed to see what would have occurred? And I think this goes to the notion of whether people really trust a system, who is that system working for, should it not have gone to trial, and if it did, the public would have had every right to see, evaluate, review the evidence and making draw their own conclusions. Grandeur is a secret. You don't have that ability in this case.",

And if mifepristone, if the Supreme Court decides to uphold the horrendous, nonscientific, completely outrageous decision by the Texas judge, then it's also going to throw the country into chaos as far as approvals of drugs in this country. Think about your cancer drug. Think about any number of drugs that have been out there for a long time, if somebody suddenly doesn't like them, are they just going to be able to argue that, go to a judge and say, well, we have a political view of this drug, this vaccine, whatever it is, and we're not going to look at the science of it? And you know, I think that's why, in fact, a lot of pharmaceutical companies also are starting to weigh in on this because it has huge implications for all kinds of medications across the country.",
