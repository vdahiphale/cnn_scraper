Thanks for being with us.Early this morning on the East Coast where it is not a column anyone in the Biden administration is going to enjoy waking up to this morning. \"The Washington Post's\" David Ignatius putting it in bold, writing, quote: President Biden should not run again in 2024. His new op-ed says, quote, it is painful to say that given my admiration of what they have accomplished. But, if he and Harris campaign together in 2024, I think Biden risks undoing his greatest achievement, which was stopping Trump. Ignatius says that Biden's age and his vice president would be the two biggest liabilities and his opinion does line up with recent CNN polling that shows that more than two-thirds of Democrats think that the party should nominate somebody else to run next year. Let's break this all down with CNN's Marshall Cohen, who covers politics for us. Marshall, good morning. I think it is important to give our viewers some context here on why this matters and why this is going to be something that campaign aides and operatives are going to be talking about, that the White House is going to be talking about, and that is because of who wrote it. This is David Ignatius. He is a columnist for \"The Washington Post\", but he's also somebody who is extraordinarily plugged in inside the Biden administration. He has covered numerous White Houses over the years. He understands and thinks about politics in a global way that is usually of the more sober-minded variety. And it is really, I think, something that is going to sting inside the halls of the west wing as they read through this, this morning. And I know that you and I have both covered these politics day today. He is laying out a conversation that I certainly have heard from my sources overtime that Democrats are simply nervous, that they might face a situation where Donald Trump ends of the back in the White House again because something happens to President Biden and Kamala Harris, potentially, ends up as the nominee. There's not a lot of confidence that she'd be able to carry -- carry this. I am wondering, can you walk us through what our polling numbers show here at CNN kind of underscores this and the reporting that you have had in recent weeks and months about how this topic is being discussed?",

What this means is that we now have two presidents in a row that were subjected to an impeachment inquiry. Whether this blossoms into a full blown impeachment of Joe Biden, we will see.It's clear that Kevin McCarthy does not have the votes to impeach Joe Biden right now because, as you mentioned, he doesn't even have the votes to launch this impeachment inquiry right now and that's why he's doing it on his own. He directed the chairs of a few of the key committees in the house to begin this process. Basically, they are going to be ramping up there already existing investigations into Hunter Biden, his business deals overseas, the millions of dollars that he made often trading all the family name. But, they are trying to focus on President Biden and here, trying very hard, to connect President Biden to his son's business deals. As of now, Kasie, I have got to say, a lot of the claims that McCarthy put a front and center yesterday, they are unproven, they are uncorroborated, they are a bunch of half truths that he uttered yesterday. They argued that they will get to the goods in this inquiry, they will find more incriminating info, but so much of this is based off of uncorroborated speculation at this point -- Kasie.",

The talks covered a range of issues, economic issues, regional issues, and ended after more than an hour.And ahead of the meeting, Putin said that Kim showed great interest in space and rocket engineering. And Putin was asked the question, it was interesting when he said, will Russia help North Korea build satellites? And his response was, that is why we are here, at the Vostochny Cosmodrome. Now, as for Kim, he pledged to support for the Russian president. Listen to this.

The U.S. remains concerned that North Korea will provide arms to Russia to use in the war in Ukraine. And in exchange, North Korea is seeking advanced technology, like technology for satellites.

His approval numbers are not where the White House wants them to be?

So it definitely is going to be part of the American presidential campaign and we will see how it plays out.But, for Donald Trump, you know it might be an argument to say that I can resolve this.
