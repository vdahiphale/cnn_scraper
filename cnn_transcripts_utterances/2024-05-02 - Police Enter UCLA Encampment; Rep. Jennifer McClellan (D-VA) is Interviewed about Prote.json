They, obviously, UCLA, has gotten to the point where, you know, as Andy McCabe was outlining, this encampment was surrounded by wooden pallets and plywood and all these physical barriers that these officers are now having to remove. There have been all sorts of questions about, you know, the campus jurisdiction, campus police, what kind of punishments these people should face. I mean, legally speaking, how do you view how the universities have handled this in terms of, you know, punishments they can throw at these people, and how do you think we proceed from here on that front?",

I'm seeing the tents, the easy up being picked up by the officers and moved. I'm seeing the barricades shaking. Just a minute or two ago, though, I did still see a Palestinian flag waving in the darkness as this - as this mission continues. I'm seeing more of those pallets being thrown. And, you know, you guys were talking earlier about all of these huge bits of plywood that were allowed to be brought onto campus. I mean just this afternoon I watched as LAPD and highway patrol stood around while inside the camp, just a few feet from them, those protesters were fortifying that barricade. They were - we - we could - we could hear the power drills as they were fortifying, suspecting that something like this was going to happen, and they were just allowed to do that. That was happening. As we've been discussing, UCLA tried to keep a hands off approach. This was allowed to become what it became. And it has now come to this.

They can do that whole thing and then say, but keep in mind, it doesn't always work out for your side.The protests at '68 at Columbia, which we are still in this fit of ludicrous nostalgia over, got - it got Richard Nixon and extended the Vietnam War for five more years, right? It was not - you still find people who think that the '68 protests on these campuses ended the Vietnam War. And I'm like, what parallel universe are you thinking of? If these are the images, the images of chaos, the chaos at the border, chaos on campuses, people - if middle class families who struggled to send their kids to college have their graduations canceled because of all of this and they blame Biden for it, Trump will be elected.

I don't think the public is on the side of these protesters. And to Jonah's point, you know, I think Joe Biden was elected to restore a sense of normalcy, a sense of order, a sense, you know, to stop the chaos that so many people felt Trump represented. And also to restore moral leadership, right? He talked about being moved to run because of Charlottesville, which was a protest that got out of hand where many people said things that were anti-Semitic in a way that was very disturbing. And he took a very strong stance on that. And he was its going to restore, you know, America's moral leadership in the world, restore a sense of right and wrong again in the aftermath of Trump. And I think, to a lot of people, maybe to some of these protesters as well in the other direction, he sort of forfeited that mantle and they don't see where he is in terms of saying, we have a sense of right and wrong here and we know where the lines are.",

Jonah Goldberg, can I just bring you in, in terms of responding to what the congresswoman had to say. I mean this is the question I keep coming back to in terms of the nature of these protests, you know, especially on college campuses where for years there was this issue where people didn't want conservatives to come and talk at all. They were afraid of having them talk because they said, well, this was aggressive.

I mean, look, outsiders or not, a lot of these protests are the results of organic passion on the part of a lot of young people. And they are very mad at the administration, they're very mad at Joe Biden. And I don't think that that is going to stop as long as there's still a conflict in the Middle East. And even if that is resolved, I don't think they're going to stop being angry. So, we've already seen that, you know, the president and vice president can't go anywhere without protests.
