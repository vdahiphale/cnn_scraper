They have been screened for security because the NYPD is out in force. This is going to be a major event. And they do this every year. But this year is a little bit different. Because in the last two celebrations, there were several COVID restrictions. All of those restrictions have been lifted now. So, they are expecting many 1000s or more people this year.

So, clearly he was an expert in criminal justice. He was studying. He was interested in all of this.

I want to read part of the statement from his attorney, where he says, \"Mr. Kohberger is eager to be exonerated of these charges and looks forward to resolving these matters as promptly as possible.\" Now, it's also important to point out that police say they do not have the murder weapon, they do not have the knife. They have yet to give us a motive. Hopefully, we get a motive or at least some clarity into why he did this, or how he is connected to the victims if that affidavit is made public.

He also, in fact, he went the other direction. He actually challenged election results. He said the voting machines, which Brazil has been using for decades were unreliable. He tried to sow doubt and eventually, you know, tried to challenge the election results denying the will of the people.

Water levels have fallen 170 feet since the year 2000. The shoreline, now just a fraction of what it once was. That's a big concern for the Hoover Dam and the 1.3 million people it provides with hydropower. If the water level drops another 100 feet, the dam's turbines won't be able to operate.Now the falling water has drastically changed the landscape so much so that forgotten relics, once lost to the depths of the lake are not beginning to resurface. Joining us now is Associate Writer for CNN Digital Elizabeth Wolfe, she has a piece, a new piece on CNN.com chronicling the fall of Lake Mead. Elizabeth, welcome. It's a fascinating story.

We were able to see handful of previously sunken boats that used to be at the bottom of the lake and now they're just sitting completely dry on the shore, because the water has disappeared around them. And as you mentioned, over the past few months, there have been several other discoveries. This has been World War II -- a World War II boat and ancient volcanic rock and really shockingly several sets of human remains.",
