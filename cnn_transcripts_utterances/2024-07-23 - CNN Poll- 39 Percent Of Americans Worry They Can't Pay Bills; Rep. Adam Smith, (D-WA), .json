I'm Jake Tapper.This hour, a shocking revelation about the murder of Sonya Massey, the black woman killed by sheriff's deputies in Illinois after she called 911 to her home for help. Today, her family says new body camera video seen around the world does not show what they had been led to believe about the shooting. We're going to delve inside the investigation. Plus, what happened to all that talk of unity from Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention and beyond? Changed man, all that? New signs today that those days are long gone, if they ever existed at all. And leading this hour, two very different scenes today for the Biden- Harris administration. On one side, there's Biden returning to Washington, D.C. this afternoon as a lame duck president. On the other side, his vice president, Kamala Harris is holding her very first campaign rally as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. CNN's MJ Lee is at the White House. And MJ, what are we hearing from both President Biden and Vice President Harris today?",

President Biden returning to the White House for the first time in just over a week after having isolated, recovering from COVID in Delaware. And he made that decision to drop out of the 2024 race, of course, while he was in isolation, has had no public engagements or speeches since. And that all is going to change tomorrow evening when he delivers an Oval Office address to the nation.This is going to be, we expect, the first sort of fulsome explanation of that painful decision from the president to abandon his bid for the 2024 second term and also where he will likely talk about his accomplishments and paint a vision for the future, including the six months that he now has left in his first term in the White House. But speaking of the future, the president is, of course, now also trying to pass the presidential torch to his vice president, Kamala Harris. We saw her hitting the ground in really every way possible, winning the wide support of Democratic elected officials, winning the support of donors, whether it is grassroots and big check donors and energizing the party in a moment when the party had been so deflated. And at her first campaign rally as a presidential candidate this cycle in Milwaukee this afternoon, we saw the vice president, just like the president had been doing for a number of months now, drawing that contrast between herself and former President Donald Trump. But that contrast was very much her own as she drew on her prosecutorial background to make that case. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And Shira Stein is a Washington correspondent for the San Francisco Chronicle and has long covered Vice President Harris' political career. I will start with you, Shira, as the journalist here, why don't you tell me, Harris, of course, was a prosecutor. She was a district attorney of San Francisco, then she was the attorney general of the state of California before she was elected to the Senate in 2016.

They've succeeded in doing that. Meanwhile, they're looking forward to getting F16s from countries in Europe as that training wraps up and the Patriot systems that the U.S. and Europe has promised them all of that before the election in November as meanwhile, Zelensky also said he was working on trying to set up a meeting, not just a phone call with Trump.

And, you know, this comes down to this boiling water that was on the stove you know, rather than separating her from that, they allow this woman to go over. And that's where this incident really escalates, where the officer tells her, you know, essentially not to touch it, not to throw it on the officers.They then open fire, beginning raising a lot of questions because we hear so much, at least now, from policing groups, that it's all about de-escalation, trying to remove someone who might be in crisis from a potentially dangerous object. And then in this case, when you're talking about boiling water, which could scald officers, which could actually warrant the use of deadly force, what we don't see on that video is officers trying to create distance, trying to move away. The officer quickly escalates and goes to guns. And finally, I'll point out here, Jake, because, you know, we often hear from some law enforcement, well, you know, why Monday morning quarterback officers when you weren't there?
