That number is soaring, and some groups are hit worse than others. Plus, coming soon to a Florida beach near you, a 5,000 mile wide blob of seaweed. And frankly, guys, it stinks. (MUSIC)",

America's largest banks announced they are going to step in to try to prevent what could lead to a domino effect that would theoretically wreck the economy. The group of banks including JPMorgan Chase, the Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, they are all going to provide a $30 billion rescue for San Francisco-based First Republic Bank. First Republic saw its stock plummet after two other banks failed over the weekend. And Moody's downgraded its outlook for the entire banking industry. Stocks rebounded today over the rescue news, the Dow closing up 373 points, signaling that experts are, at least for now, breathing a sigh of relief that further economic damage may be avoided or at least delayed. CNN business correspondent Rahel Solomon joins us now. Rahel, tell us about this rescue plan and how it would work. RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Jake, this is a major development, essentially, a cash infusion into First Republic, giving it a sense of financial power that SVB did not have at its finger points. I want to read for you for a moment, Jake, the statement we just got from the Treasury Department, essentially saying 11 banks in total, 11 banks announced $30 billion in deposits into First Republic Bank. The show of support by a group of large banks is most welcome and demonstrates the resilience of the banking system, essentially patting these banks essentially on the back for stepping up here, really arming First Republic with financial firepower in the event, Jake, it sees customers move their money, similar to what we saw with SVB, so sort of shielding First Republic if it sees a significant problem in that way. It's also a sign of support, a really show of confidence from these major banks stepping up, signaling not only are they able to land in this way, but they are willing to land, and perhaps also shoring up confidence for depositors. If you are at home and have an account at First Republic Bank and you hear Wells Fargo, Citibank is willing to step up and support this bank, well, maybe that makes you feel more confident about leaving your money there, as well.",

And short-term deposits cost more, and so what you have is your income is being reduced and your expenses are being increased and it just flipped over.Silicon Valley, from what I understand, and I'm not an insider on that at all, but from what I understand, just got caught in the rise in interest rates and flipped the bank over. A lot of financial institutions are facing this sort of problem. What surprises me is that the regulators at the San Francisco Fed, the supervisor, the supervisory group didn't catch it and didn't understand their balance sheets. They didn't have enough reserve to match that shortfall of revenues. And that's really what happened with Silicon Valley Bank and also Signature, and now it's coming to Republic. It will probably come to a lot of other banks, as well. As long as interest rates stay high. TAPPER:  Treasury Secretary Yellen testified that the U.S. banking system is secure.

He's a long-time creature of Washington. He is the type of person whose father is a lawyer, who knows personally many Supreme Court justices, is close friends with them, and has previously worked as a judge, not just in the district court in D.C., but also over the foreign intelligence surveillance court, this court where he has tried to bring transparency and also in that court, has really been harsh towards prosecutors. But in this context, there's big questions for how he's going to handle his role as the chief judge now. What he will do is have to determine how far prosecutors can get, if they're seeking information that people are challenging, when they're issuing grand jury subpoenas. So witness testimony, search warrants, where does he land on that and how quickly does he make calls there? Judge Howell, Beryl Howell is the judge who is outgoing as the chief. She moves very fast. She advocates for transparency. She's been a judge that's been very pro-investigator. She's given the Justice Department a lot of leeway.

An alarming new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the number of women who died due to pregnancy or childbirth complications rose significantly in 2021. And the death rate among Black women is twice as high as that of white women.Here to discuss is Dr. Megan Ranney. She's the deputy dean of public health at Brown University. Thanks so much for being here. So the maternal death rate this the U.S. has been a problem for decades. Why is it still an issue today? DR. MEGAN RANNEY, DEPUTY DEAN OF PUBLIC HEALTH, BROWN UNIVERSITY: Well, the decades of issues reflect so many of the things that you and I have discussed, the inequitable access to health care. We see mortality in states that have not expanded Medicaid access. It's about a lack of pre and post-partum care. So many women failed to show up for visits to an obstetrician in that first or second trimester, don't care until it's too late to address many of those preventable causes of maternal mortality. And then, of course, there is structural racism. We know that chronic stress plays a role not just in setting up black women for all the things that raise rates of maternal mortality, like high blood pressure or asthma, but also are related to their care in the health care system. There's story after story about women who are well- educated, high income, each a woman who worked at the CDC, a black woman, was unable to advocate and get herself the proper care and die. So it's this combination of factors that put the U.S. far behind our peer countries among industrialized nations.",

So vaccination is huge. But secondly, being pregnant and catching COVID puts you at a large risk, and most of that increase in maternal mortality in 2021, was due to COVID related deaths.",

We have seen study after study showing that states with Medicaid expansion have lower rates of pre-delivery, as well as post-delivery mortality. So that's -- you know, make sure everyone has access to insurance and it's easy to get.The second is to make sure there is access to obstetricians, even in rural areas. There are lots of closures of hospitals in rural areas. Many of the women who are at highest risk of maternal mortality, live more than 25 miles from an obstetrician. So making sure there is that access in rural areas. And then the third thing is, addressing all those problems that lead people to have a higher risk during pregnancy or immediately after delivery. So, addressing rates of high blood pressure, addressing food access, addressing mental health. And then, of course, addressing the structural racism in the health care system. Jake, there have been studies showing if women are treated by Black doctors, their rate of mortality is lower. So training up more Black physicians will also help with these disparities and mortality rates.",

The children need to be in the hospital and the parents have such a hard time accessing a bed. So, let's talk about why that's happening because as you said, RSV is over, that's not the reason why.One of the reasons is that pediatricians and pediatric nurses have kind of been leaving the profession in very disturbingly large numbers. Things were so tough and so difficult during COVID. Also, also related to COVID, there's also been an increase in the need for mental services for children. So that's putting a demand on beds. And also Dr. Ranney referenced this -- hospitals are closing, often closing their pediatric units. Why would they close a pediatric unit over an adult unit? These hospitals are often struggling financially and kids don't make that much money. That's the problem. Take a look at this number. When you look at the percentage of children in this country who are on Medicaid, it's 39 percent. Only 19 percent of adults are on Medicaid. Medicaid pays hospitals at a terrible rate. Medicare and private insurance pays much better. Medicare pays much better. So, when a hospital says we're suffering, we need money. Sometimes the kids are the first to go. Also when a child is hospitalized, Jake, it's often for something like asthma or an infectious disease. That doesn't pay very well. Kids don't get coronary bypass. Kids don't get hip replacements. Those are the things that make hospitals money. Those are the kinds of things that adults get. So, often, hospitals will opt to fill those beds with adults rather than children -- Jake.",

I mean, they are so low compared to other types of insurance. Also, they could increase telemedicine. We heard Dr. Ranney talking about access, and especially in a lot of rural parts of the U.S. is it hard to get to a pediatrician. So sometimes a child gets so sick, if the problem were taken care of in the beginning, maybe they wouldn't have ended up in the hospital.
