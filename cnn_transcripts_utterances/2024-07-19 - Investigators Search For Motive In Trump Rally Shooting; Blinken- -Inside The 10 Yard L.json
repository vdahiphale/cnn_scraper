      "sentences": "Nearly a week after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, we have new insights into the gunman's online trail. Investigators say Thomas Crooks looked up information on Michigan High School shooter Ethan Crumbley and his parents and checked out websites detailing how to build explosives.Plus, moments before firing his AR-style weapon, he took a screenshot on his phone of the Trump rally livestream. From Crook's car, investigators recovered rudimentary explosive devices, a drone, a bulletproof vest, and additional magazines for his weapon. Let's get straight to retired Secret Service Agent Robert McDonald for more insight. Robert, great to see you. We are learning just in the last several minutes that the Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheadle will appear before the House Oversight Committee on Monday. The spokesman for the Secret Service saying that just a few moments ago. Do you think that's a good idea?",

I think the Secret Service needs to get its messaging out and be able to be ready to answer some very tough questions, which I don't think have been answered so far.You know, we've got a couple of components here. We've got the failures of the protective advance that allowed to the shooting. We have a pretty good response of the shift in and around the immediate vicinity of the former president. And now we've got the aftermath and the whys and wherefores of how this happened and how we prevent it from happening again. So, I'm hoping that they're working on, getting all those answers and getting them ready before the testimony on Monday.",
