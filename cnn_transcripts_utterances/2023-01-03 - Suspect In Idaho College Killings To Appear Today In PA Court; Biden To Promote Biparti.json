They're optimistic. Damar is someone that you would trust and believe to come out on top of anything that he is faced with.

That speaks volumes.You know, secondly, I think when you look at how it permeated the entire stadium, the people were silent, they were respectful, they were all concerned, and me personally, my phone blew up because there were so many former ball players and fans who called, who expressed that they were sending their hopes and prayers in this situation. And in the midst of the uncertainty that we see in society today, particularly in politics, it is nice to be able to see how this entire society came together in a moment of tragedy, concerned over an individual player's life.

And I think we have some video. He arrived in just the last 20 minutes. Very big police presence here all morning, roads are shut, and they don't have an underground way to get him into the courthouse. So, I think you're looking at the video now when he exited the transport vehicle. And there were some media around there. We were able to capture him with his orange jail garb on. He was cuffed. He walked in very briskly, did not answer any questions as the media was asking him things. Now, we do know that his family -- his whole family is going to be here. They are from northeastern Pennsylvania, not too far from here, mother, and father, and his two sisters. But they will not be allowed to visit with him or talk with him at all. And you know, Steve Goncalves, who is the father of Kaylee Goncalves, he was on our air yesterday and he's very appreciative of law enforcement and what they did. And his focus is now to proceed in this because he says that he is going to be in court proceedings, all eyes are going to be on him, and he wants to see justice met. Kate.",

But I did want to ask you first about how your state is being hit once again by another round of severe weather. I've seen some reports have you been water rescues in parts of the state already today. How is it going there right now?GOV. ANDY BESHEAR, (D-KY): Well, we are having some localized flooding. We are able to respond and thus far have no reports on fatalities. Weather is tough again but nothing like the tornados or ice storms or flooding or the polar plunge or everything else that we've faced this last year and a half.",

And while it is still functionally sound, it was never designed to carry as many trucks and cars as go over it right now.So, when you look at a place like Kentucky, where we're coming off the best two years of economic development ever, where we've become the electric vehicle battery production capital of the United States of America, this is important for our growth to be able to deliver products all across the United States. But I think it is also a great statement that there is nothing partisan about a bridge. And we shouldn't treat legislation that helps fund a project like this ever as partisan. What you got tomorrow are a Democratic and a Republican governor. You'll have senators on both sides of the aisle that are joining the president just to announce that we've done the right thing for our people. It's pretty refreshing.",

I go to communities where we got a great project going and everybody comes together and talks about bipartisanship. And, unfortunately, sometimes when a -- when a session starts and people end up back in Frankfort or the capital, you see the fighting start again about the number of R's and D's and partisanship we don't know.The American people want to see results. And infrastructure is one of those needs that's not blue or red, it is just critical for the safety of our families to get to work or to church or the kids to school and for the future of our economy. But if we could just view more things like infrastructure, you know there is nothing -- there is nothing partisan about clean water, about expanding broadband, about ensuring the health care needs for our people. There is so much that we could get done. I do want to commend Senator McConnell because that wasn't an easy vote with some in his party but it was the right vote for Kentucky. And I think he voted for it. Representative John Yarmuth voted for it. And I'm grateful for both of them because this is a project that multiple presidents have promised. That has been up in Washington for a long time. What it is going to mean to the northern Kentucky, Cincinnati community but all of Kentucky, all of Ohio, and all of the country is pretty special and it is going to continue this economic growth, job growth that we are seeing that I think is going to continue long after inflation has subsided.",

This vocational school that these soldiers were being housed at has been absolutely obliterated when you look at the before and after.New pictures we have from the ground level show that it is simply a pile of rubble, maybe one or two walls managed to survive. And that is why former officials from the Donetsk People's Republic, the occupied part Donetsk region, are suggesting the true number is likely well over 100. You also have pro-Russian military bloggers who are accusing members of the Russian military and intelligence service of incompetence.

We're told Republican leader Kevin McCarthy is prepared to dig in for as long as it takes to achieve his goal of becoming a speaker of the House of Representatives. He has been in very heated talks coming down to the wire. But even McCarthy allies right now are acknowledging he still does not have the votes to claim the speaker's gavel. McCarthy needs 218 votes to be elected speaker. If everyone is voting, that's a majority of the House of Representatives if all members are there and voting. Republicans have right now a very narrow 222-seat majority in the new House. That means McCarthy can only afford to lose the support of four Republicans to win the speakership under these rules. But at least five far-right GOP lawmakers are firm no votes and that list appears to be growing. That's more than enough to sink McCarthy's chance of winning on the first ballot. If McCarthy does fall short, a historic series of events will unfold that could throw Congress into chaos. The vote for speaker would go to a second ballot, possibly a third ballot, a fourth, something that has not happened in the United States for 100 years. This process could drag out for hours, days, weeks until Republicans finally elect McCarthy or settle on a different candidate. In the meantime, the House would be at a standstill. Members of the House could not be sworn in. They could not vote on legislation. They could not begin work on committees until they have a speaker. Our congressional correspondents are fanned out on Capitol Hill covering all the behind-the-scenes maneuvering ahead of the vote for speaker. First to Manu Raju. Manu, we heard from leader McCarthy -- Kevin McCarthy a short while ago on the brink of this high-stakes vote, and what he said did not sound as though he has the votes.",

We need to move forward as a conference.But he got pushback. Congressman Scott Perry for one got into a heated back and forth with him as did congressman Chip Roy arguing that they need to be more. They want more power over the speakership. But McCarthy is not willing to go as far as a number of these members want. And a number of McCarthy allies say that they too are prepared to dig in, support Kevin McCarthy for as long as he wants to go. And privately and publicly, McCarthy is signaling he's not going anywhere. He's ready to dig in for the long haul. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R-CA): For the last two months, we worked together as a whole conference to develop rules that empower all members. But we're not empowering certain members over others.

But that is not doing anything to sway these members. The number of opponents is only growing.Kevin McCarthy could lose maybe 10, maybe 15, potentially even up to 20 votes here when they vote here in a matter of minutes. But he certainly does not have the 218 votes he needs to be elected a speaker so that means, Jake, it is going to be a period of uncertainty, chaos, and it could go on for a very long time until the House determines who is going to lead this chamber for the next two years.",
