Theyare, I would say, just sitting on the sidelines waiting to see, down just 55, not even worth you and me spending another second talking about it. The main event of the day, most certainly are, President Biden preparing to tell voters US democracy is at stake in this November's presidential election. Donald Trump is holding rallies in Iowa, only days to go until the states' caucuses. And the US economy shows no sign of slowing down, the jobs numbers beating expectations. Live from New York, Friday, January the 5th. I'm Richard Quest. I mean business. Good evening, within the hour, we are expecting President Biden to speak and launch his campaign for the 2024 presidential election. There, you see it. It's in Pennsylvania, the location, the speech, the significance, because in a typical election year, it is the economy, pocketbook, cost of living issues that shape the race. As memorably defined, \"It's the economy, stupid,\" as the political strategist James Carville put it. This year, President Biden is telling voters, it's democracy that's on the ballot in 2024. The president will speak in Pennsylvania, and an aide says his speech will argue. This year's election is about the question of democracy and whether it can be preserved. It's meant to mark the anniversary of the January the 6th riot in the capitol, an event Donald Trump is accused of provoking in order to stay in office. In both this speech and his campaign ads, President Biden will laser in on the contrast between him and Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
