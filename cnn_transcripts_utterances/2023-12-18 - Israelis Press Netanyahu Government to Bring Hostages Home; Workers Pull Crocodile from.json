U.S. DefenseSecretary Lloyd Austin is in Tel Aviv as the U.S. toughens its tone on Israel's war with Hamas, the latest on his talks with top Israeli officials. Plus Pro-democracy Activist and Former Media Tycoon Jimmy Lai goes on trial in Hong Kong why he could spend the rest of his life in prison. And a major storm battering the U.S. North East what it might mean for holiday travel. And this hour, some thorny issues being tackled in Israel, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is there meeting with top officials including his Israeli counterpart and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The U.S. is looking for a detailed plan on when and how the Israeli military will shift towards a more precise intelligence driven campaign against Hamas militants and away from the sweeping offensive that's caused so much death and destruction inside Gaza. The Hamas controlled health ministry there telling CNN more than 100 people were killed in Israeli attacks on Jabalya in Northern Gaza just in the past 24 hours. And inside Israel thousands gathered over the weekend to demand the government bring home those still being held captive by Hamas. And anger persists over the accidental killing of three hostages by the IDF. Jeremy Diamond joins us live from Tel Aviv and we have Natasha Bertrand, who is at the Pentagon for us too. Jeremy, I want to come to you first. I think there's clear devastation, and also outrage over the three Israeli hostages that were killed by the IDF, including as we get more details of how they were trying to tell people that they were there and they need to be rescued. What more can you tell us about those details and the pressure that's being applied particularly by the United States to engage in more truce talks and release more of those hostages?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, absolutely devastating news on Friday that really sparked a kind of spontaneous, you know,protests in Tel Aviv over the weekend as thousands of people went to the Curia, which is the defense and military headquarters of Israel, to kind of demand that a deal be made to free the remaining hostages. There is a real sense particularly among the families of those hostages, but also more broadly in Israel that the government is simply not focused enough on getting those hostages who remain over 100 of them, who are still believed to be held captive in Gaza out and that instead, the government is too focused on this military campaign against Hamas. And we saw those two really collide. Because while the Israeli Prime Minister has been claiming for months now that he believes the military pressure on Hamas is what is driving them to the negotiating table. We also saw the pitfalls of that military operation, as an Israeli soldier mistakenly killed three hostages, believing them to be a threat. We now have new images released by the Israeli military showing that these three hostages appear to have taken remaining food and written help three hostages on the building where they were staying. This was just next to the area where they were actually killed by that Israeli soldier. And so we are seeing mounting pressure from the families. But also from some recently freed hostages who are also beginning to give interviews to the Israeli media, all of them feeling like the government is simply not doing enough. There's no question that that is a part of the conversations that U.S. officials are having with their Israeli counterparts, as they really try and bring Israel and Hamas back to that metaphorical negotiating table. We know that the U.S. in the past week has been looking for ways to restart those negotiations, giving -- talking over ideas with the Israelis, giving those to the Qataris and hoping that the Qataris can bring Hamas back to the negotiating table as well. It's unclear how the current status of those military operations is playing into Hamas's decision to engage or not engage in the negotiations. The Israelis believe that it is driving Hamas back to the table. So far, there's no evidence of that. But we do know that over the weekend, Israel's Intelligence Chief or the Head of the Mossad, David Barnea was in Qatar to meet with the Qatari Prime Minister. And so at least there does appear to be some movement, but it's certainly not happening fast enough for those who still have loved ones in Gaza.",

      "sentences": "Well, Secretary Austin will be seeking really an assessment from the Israeli Defense Minister aswell as Israel's war cabinet about the next phase of this campaign. And the timeline for winding down this very high intensity, high tempo operation in Gaza against Hamas more towards a lower intensity more localized, more targeted focus on seeking out the Hamas -- leadership in Gaza, rather than continuing with this campaign, very heavy airstrikes that are resulting in a large amount of civilian casualties, thousands and thousands of civilian casualties. And so the Secretary is going to be urging his counterparts to start thinking about moving towards that next phase of this conflict. And we have actually reported over recent weeks that the U.S. writ large U.S. Biden Administration officials have been urging Israel to move into this new phase. Because they say they're losing rapidly international support for their war in Gaza, because of the high number of civilians who are being killed as part of the operation. So Secretary Austin will be trying to get a sense for what the next phase of that operation will look like. And importantly, when it is going to take place, because the administration really wants to see this kind of wrap up by the end of this year, early next year and move more into this more targeted phase that will not pose such a big threat to civilians. Now, importantly, going off of what Jeremy was just saying earlier, Secretary Austin will also be in Qatar. And he will be meeting with his counterparts there to discuss issues related to hostages. The Defense Department has been flying into reconnaissance drones over Gaza to try to help Israel find the hostages. They have also been in discussions with Israel about this plan that the Israelis have to potentially flood the tunnels in Gaza. They have begun doing so on a very limited basis consulting, we are told with the U.S. ensuring them that they are not targeting tunnels that are believed to have hostages inside of them, so all of this will be at the top of Austin's agenda. But in addition to that, he will be trying to figure out a way forward with regard to all of the attacks that are being leveled against U.S. forces in the region in Iraq and Syria by these Iran backed groups, as well, of course, is in the Red Sea, which is really impacting international shipping and commerce there. So it's a really heavy week for the Secretary of Defense hoping to find a solution to all these huge, huge problems, Julia.",

Just over the weekend, the USS Carney responded to a drone attack by the Houthis. They launched 14 drones in the vicinity of the Carney and some of them were shot down. And then this morning, we learned that according to U.S. military official, additional projectiles were shot towards yet another vessel operating in the Red Sea. This has caused at least four major companies including BP to pause all of their operations in the Red Sea. Clearly a major impediment here to international commerce, oil shipping.

And you're talking abouthundreds of thousands of people without power because of a strengthening storm system. Now, this is a live look. This is the Hudson River. There's the New York City skyline kind of dramatic with the clouds in the background. But I wanted to show this because it's the first time we've seen the sun shine for several hours because it was socked in earlier with heavy rainfall, which has now lifted a little bit to the north across New England into the Hudson Valley. There are 40 million Americans under flood alerts as we speak, but the flood warnings exist across much of Connecticut, the Hudson Valley into New Jersey. You can see even for Essex, Hudson and Union Counties a population of roughly 2 million people under a flood warning right now valid through the next couple of hours. This is the storm system you can see the clearing skies near New York City in particular, but the heaviest rainfall has shifted just to the north. So it's impacting places like Massachusetts, including Boston and just to the west. Now when we look back at how much rain has fallen from this system, it has been impressive along the entire eastern seaboard causing all kinds of trouble headaches, but we focus in on South Carolina because it was Florida and the Carolinas this weekend that got hit the hardest. Some rainfall totals in Georgetown exceeded 300 millimeters in a 48 hour period that caused localized flooding. So the other factor to this storm system is the winds. It's been gusting tropical storm force for many locations along the coast, including Florida. This is what it looked like in Orlando yesterday. But now as the storm system transitions to the northeast, this is where we're experiencing those Tropical Storm force gusts. And even some hurricane force gusts in the Blue Hill observatory just west of Boston had 100 plus kilometer per hour wind gusts reported just a few hours ago, you can see that suddenly component to the wind here that is causing that problem. Also impacting the temperatures as well as we briefly warm up. And Julia, I'll end with this, this flooding in Charleston, South Carolina is not only from the heavy rainfall that happened inland, it's also because of the storm surge component to this low pressure as it moved in. It actually brought in some of the highest recorded tidal surge in Charleston Harbor from a non-tropical storm. And so that's impressive because both of those working together to raise the water levels within the city. And it caused the flooding you saw a moment ago.",

Wall Street of course coming off an exuberant week last week, the Federal Reserve's signaling it could cut interest rates three times next year.

This is Brent and WTI in the United States crude prices all higher as more tanker operators say they're suspending shipments through the Red Sea. More details on that very shortly. Welcome back. I'm Julia Chatterley in New York and you're watching \"Connect the World\". Let me bring you up to speed with some of the headlines this hour. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is meeting with top Israeli officials in Tel Aviv today. His visit comes as the United States grows increasingly vocal about the mounting casualties in Gaza. The Biden Administration is urging Israel to move to a new phase of its war against Hamas one that's more targeted and less harmful to civilians. The trial of jailed Hong Kong Media Tycoon Jimmy Lai is underway. Lai is being tried under Hong Kong sweeping national security law facing charges linked to Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and his now shuttered pro- democracy newspaper. China's Foreign Ministry says the case is being handled in partially. Lai faces possible life in prison if convicted. And in Northern Australia, the heaviest rains in decades have left the City of Cannes virtually cut off. Storm Jasper which made landfall last week triggered floods and forced hundreds of people out of their homes. The Premier of Queensland say some people spent the night stranded on their rooftops. And in one town rangers rounded up a two and a half meter crocodile that got swept up in the floods. Now Oil Giant BP is the latest company to temporarily suspend shipping through the Red Sea. Iranian backed Houthi rebels from Yemen have been attacking ships moving through the Red Sea claiming they're doing it to pressure Israel to send aid into Gaza. A U.S. Navy warship responded to an attack earlier Monday after shooting down 14 drones over the weekend. U.S. defense officials say the continued attacks threaten free commerce. Anna Stewart joins us now from London. And Anna, we're already seeing companies saying look they have to suspend operations.

And then there's the risk of what happens if you try and avoid the Suez Canal route because ultimately this is a very lucrative shortcut linking Europe to Asia for shipping. It accounts around 12 percent of global trade as much as 30 percent when it comes to container shipping traffic. So it's really sizeable when you look at that. Now the cost for all of these companies which have decided they will pause at least for now going through the Suez Canal to avoid all these risks. They're looking at a very long route round. We have a map for you just to show you what that means. To avoid it they go right around the West Coast of Africa around the Cape of Good Hope. Now that adds a significant amount of time to any given route as much as one or even two weeks depending of course on the weather, that means more fuel costs. It means obviously more stuff on board. And it delays of course, all those products getting to where they need to be. It puts pressure on the capacity of shipping around the world. And ultimately, if this is sustained it could of course play absolute habit when it comes to supply chains which we're all familiar with right from the pandemic. So this is what we're looking at in terms of the knock on impacts from what we're seeing here.",

Anna, great to have you thank you, Anna Stewart there from London. Now the United States is condemning North Korea's recent missile launches. The South Korean military says a long range ballistic missile was fired Monday from the Pyongyang area with a flight range of about 1000 kilometers. Now Japan's Coast Guard believes the missile fell into waters west of Okushiri Island in the Hokkaido region. Just a day earlier North Korea fired a short range ballistic missile that flew about 570 kilometers before falling into the water. Pyongyang says their launch was partly in response to a U.S. nuclear powered submarine arriving in North Korea. Now turning to the war in Ukraine, Russia has been using fleets of drones to attack targets on a near daily basis. Ukrainian officials say they took down at least 20 drones on Sunday. They say one of them crashed into a neighborhood in Odessa, destroying homes and killing at least one person. This is the third Russian air assault on the Odessa region this week. And the official results are yet to come in. But Serbia's President is claiming a party victory in the snap parliamentary elections. President Aleksandar Vucic declared victory for the Serbian Progressive Party in Sunday's election. Polls looked like they were in favor of the President's party though he wasn't on the ballot himself. It will allow the party to expand their reach in Parliament after failing to take a majority in 2022. The vote comes after a difficult year in Serbia with back to back mass shootings spoiling anti-government protests. Parliament must meet within two weeks of the official results being announced with just 60 days to form a new government. OK, coming up here on \"Connect the World\" Manchester City conquered all in the Champions League last year, but who will they be facing in this season's first knockout round?
