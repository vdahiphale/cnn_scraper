He`s onlythe second cabinet official ever in U.S. history to be impeached. The other was Secretary of War, William Belknap, way back in 1876. Now, the final count came down to just one vote. And this comes one week after House Republicans previous impeachment effort fell short. At that time, House Majority Leader, Steve Scalise was absent during the vote due to cancer treatment, but his return this time helped push House Republicans to approve the measure. Not every GOP member supported this decision, though, including Representative Ken Buck. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEN BUCK, (R) COLORADO: You can, try to put lipstick on this pig. It is still a pig. And this is a -- a terrible impeachment. It sets a terrible precedent. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
