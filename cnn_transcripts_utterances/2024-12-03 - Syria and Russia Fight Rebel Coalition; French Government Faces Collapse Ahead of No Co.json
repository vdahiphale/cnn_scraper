Here's how the U.S. State Department views it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATHEW MILLER, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: What we have seen since the ceasefire went into effect is it being successful? Broadly speaking, it has been successful in stopping the fighting and getting us on a path where we are not seeing the -- just daily loss of life that we had seen for two months prior.

The Israeli military now says Neutra was killed during the Hamas attack on October 7th last year near the Kibbutz Nir Oz and his body is in Gaza. He was previously believed to be alive and held as a hostage in the enclave. The Israel Defense Forces say the 21-year-old had been serving as a tank platoon commander in the IDF at the time of the attack.

Then, after the president spent the Thanksgiving holiday with Hunter, his wife and their son, Biden informed his staff about the pardon decision on Saturday night. On Monday the White House had no clear explanation for the president's flip flop. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I can speak to where we are today and so I can't speak to hypotheticals here. Where we are today, the president made this decision over the weekend. He thought about it. He wrestled with it. REID (on-camera): One former White House staffer asks the question, which is, if it was so obvious that the president was going to pardon his son, why did he and the White House pretend otherwise for so long? We do not have an answer to that question, but another source points to the fact that, look, the president did allow David Weiss, who began investigating Hunter in the Trump administration, allowed him to continue his work, allowed the Justice Department to bring two cases against his son. They argue that this pardon should not undermine the lengths that Biden went to to allow the DOJ to act independently. But again, that was not the message from the White House over the past year.

And in this case, this has proved completely unpalatable, especially to the to the far-right that is simply unwilling to go along with this and would rather see this government collapse than continue with negotiations. Now they did back down over some of the projected reforms over reinstating an electricity cost as an outcome of the energy crisis, but most people are feeling a cost of living pinch here.

In other words, based on the respect and the adherence to mutual valuesAnd I just, you know, wonder whether you thought he did act in that way, and especially, because you said he was clearly fascinated by the Russian president: \"In the years that followed, I received the distinct impression that he was captivated by politicians with autocratic and dictatorial traits.\" How did that manifest itself to you? ANGELA MERKEL, FORMER GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): Well, in the way that he spoke about Putin, the way that he spoke about the North Korean president. Obviously, apart from critical remarks he made, there was always a kind of fascination at the sheer power of what these people could do. So, my impression always was that he dreamt of actually overriding, maybe, all those parliamentary bodies that he felt were, in a way, an encumbrance upon him, and that he wanted to decide matters on his own. And in a democracy, well, you cannot reconcile that with democratic values. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
