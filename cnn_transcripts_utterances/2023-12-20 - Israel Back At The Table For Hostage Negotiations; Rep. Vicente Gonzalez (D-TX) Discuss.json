      "sentences": "Before the hostage talks, can we just point out again that we did just see another hospital, a church.As you mentioned, southern Gaza, dangerous now. But northern Gaza, 80 percent of the buildings there are already flattened. Yet, Hamas still, apparently, reluctant to come to the negotiating table. It certainly speaks volumes, from the Israeli perspective, as to why all of these people are suffering. Don't forget, it was on October 7th that hundreds of people were slaughtered in Israel. That is what started this war. And the Israelis say that often gets lost in the horrific news from the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry today that the death toll in Gaza has now surpassed a horrifying 20,000 people. It is a terrible situation all around. Israel, at this point, is ready to talk about a pause in the fighting. They are not talking about what Hamas wants, which is an exchange for the remaining 100-plus hostages and an end to the war altogether. Israel says that is not on the table because their job is not done yet. They say their job is to eliminate Hamas. They have not accomplished that objective yet. So here's where we stand right now. What Israel is offering, according to CNN sources, is a weeklong pause in the fighting, for starters, in exchange for 40 Israeli hostages and some sort of a swap on the Palestinian side with people from Gaza who are being held currently in Israel. Now that swap, Hamas is asking not for women, not for teenagers or young people. It's Israel is the one asking for women, for the elderly and for people who require urgent care. But Hamas wants what they're calling heavy hitters, people who might even be facing criminal charges here in Israel in exchange for the innocent civilians that were kidnapped on October 7th and have been held hostage in these horrific conditions ever since. The suffering in Gaza is such that it is absolutely dire. They need a pause in the fighting so they can get badly needed humanitarian supplies. But the big question now, when could this possibly happen? Given the reluctance, according to Israelis, on the Hamas side, it might be quite some time before another hostage exchange. The last deal took more than a month to put together -- Boris?",

Over the last 24 hours, border officials have been processing more than 10,000 migrants who unlawfully crossed into the United States.

Article I, Section 8, Paragraph 4 dictates the United States Congress and only the United States Congress has the power to create immigration policy. What the governor is doing is grandstanding to the rest of the country and continuing some of the rhetoric you hear from Donald Trump, as he repeated. And feeding red meat to his base. And it's unfortunate that these awful bills passed the Texas legislature. Hopefully, the Supreme Court will overturn that. I'm confident they will. They usually have. Buit it's awful that this is the times that we are living in places like Texas and places across the country. I'm very critical about what's happening on the border.

We will not rip children out of their mother's arms and separate families the way President Trump did. But we need to have law and order on the border. And we need to have an orderly process for people to migrate into this country. And I've been proposing an idea called the Safe Zone Act, which develops zones in Guatemala and Panama and maybe Columbia for migrants to go and process at that juncture. And we are going to turn them down, if we can allow them in and they can go to an airport in their country or near their country and fly to their final destination. That would take the pressure off our southern border. It would eliminate the cartels out of the equation. And it would create a human, a legal pathway much more than we have now for people to come to this country. At the end of the day, we need to realize that about 70 percent of asylum-seekers that come to the southern border never, ever qualify for asylum. We also need to recognize the fact that we have a huge labor shortage in this country. They need jobs and we need people. We need to find a legal pathway that's orderly to do and it is not on our southern border.",
