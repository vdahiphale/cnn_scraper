It was a joint UNICEF-UNRWA mission, and we were trying to bring fuel and lifesaving nutrition and medical supplies to the north of Gaza.We had made the departure from Rafah and were heading to the checkpoint when we were asked to wait in a designated holding area where U.N. vehicles wait before being pulled to the checkpoint. While we were waiting there, gunfire broke out in the vicinity, and shots were fired from the direction of the crossing towards civilians who then ran in the other direction away from the crossing. We were caught in that line of fire. Three bullets hit the car that I was in. A U.N. colleague dropped to the ground outside and lay on the floor. We thought he was injured, but thankfully he was OK, and so was everybody else with us.
