This is what we've got now from unsealed search warrants that we just got from our affiliate WTKR -- they obtained it from the courts. These warrants indicate statements that this 6-year-old boy gave to a school employee who was restraining him in the moments after he shot that teacher Abby Zwerner on January 6.According to these documents, these search warrant documents, he said, quote, as you said in the intro, quote, I shot that expletive dead. Another quote, I did it. Another quote from him, I got my mom's gun last night. A bit little more information we're getting on the moments right after the shooting according to the unsealed records. On Abby Zwerner's statement to police later that day, she said that when he pulled the gun out of his pocket in the classroom she said, quote, what are you doing with that? So again, this young man, he was restrained by another school employee. A very brave school employee we have to add. Because this young woman ran out of the room after Abby Zwerner ran out of it. She ran into the room, saw the gun on the floor next to the boy -- that's another new piece of information from these documents -- she restrains him until the police got there and then he makes these comments to her. Again, quote, I shot that expletive dead. I did it. I got my mom's gun last night. We reached the attorney for the mother, his name is James Ellenson, the attorney. He said, quote, the child had extreme emotional issues and we are working to see that he improves every day. Mr. Ellenson told me on the phone that the child has been in therapy and there has been improvement shown. We also just now, Brianna, got a response from the Newport News public school. Because police did allege and these documents that some of the information from child protective services and other information that they needed to get on this incident at Newport News schools was not really giving them. But Newport News schools just sent us a statement saying that since the tragedy, the Newport News public schools has worked closely with police. And while they can't comment on legal actions, they're working to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone involved. So I mean, the Newport News schools doesn't come out so well in this. But again, the quotes from the boy are just stunning. I mean, showing seemingly no remorse. But again, we have to reiterate that the attorney for the mother just told me that he's been in therapy and that he's been improving. She will be sentenced on federal gun charges in October.",

Bimbo photos, really despicable, unsophisticated girls.

When he's had something to say he has not held back from doing so publicly -- that's a spokesman for Andrew Cuomo.And then Madeline Cuomo responded to CNN about the \"New York Times\" report also saying, to the extent I invoked his name, it was so that the group felt their efforts were appreciated, but not at my brother's direction or his knowledge. To be clear, I acted on my own with the people of WDNY -- that's the organization. And without my brother's involvement in anyway. That of course, is contradicted by the message in the trove.

Because it was known that if patients had type two diabetes and they take a drug like this, they could reduce their risk of having a heart attack or a stroke or another cardiovascular event pretty significantly. But this has never been shown in a drug for weight loss in people who don't have diabetes. And so what they found in this trial of more than 17,000 people who'd had a previous heart event, like a heart attack or a stroke, that this could reduce their risk of another event by 20 percent.We know that these drugs provide a lot of weight loss but we haven't seen that protective benefit. What people are really focused on here is this potentially may open up insurance reimbursement for these medicines because they're pretty expensive. $1,350 per month. And right now the insurance coverage isn't great. So if this study, once it gets through the FDA. It's published in a peer review journal and this is added to the drug's label. It's expensive but that could open up insurance coverage in a much bigger way. And so, this is something people are very excited about for the health benefits and also more people who could benefit from those because they actually get coverage of the drug.",
