But even cities like Portland and Boston, that transition from rain into snow is happening. So, even if you've been lucky up to this point just to have rain, you're going to start to see more of that mix in with snow as the day goes on.Pretty significant snowfall totals already two feet across areas of Vermont. But even areas of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York also picking up in excess of one foot of snow. We also have the potential for some snow in the Midwest, most of this is really going to be lake effect snow, but some of them still looking at several inches, maybe four or five, even six inches of additional snow across the Midwest, on top of what they've already seen. But the heaviest amounts of snow are actually going to be across portions of upstate New York in areas of Pennsylvania right there along the lakes from that lake effect, it will we could see as much as an additional one feet, or one foot of snow on top of the feet of snow they already have. One thing to note really for the entire eastern half of the country is you're going to start to notice a big change in terms of temperatures. Some of these areas, as much as 40 degrees below normal. Most areas, however, will be within that 15-to-20-degree range. Look at Minneapolis, for example, high today of 21. That's still below the average. But it's going to drop even more. Thursday and Friday of the upcoming week. We'll be lucky if we can maintain in that positive range for the high temperatures. And Atlanta, again 50s for much of this week, still below average.

It's interesting because even though that the process playing out right now with bipartisan negotiators, is high stakes, and going to the last moment, the White House is aware of the fact that it is a piece of cake in comparison to what they can expect for next year.Already, Republicans have said that they would make these sorts of partisan fights out of must pass bills like government funding, spending, and the debt limit. So, the White House, at the direction of President Biden has started kind of this early preparation, early research, trying to identify key groups of Republicans that they feel that they could come to some sort of agreement with when it comes to bipartisan legislation. Now, they've identified two such groups, officials tell CNN, and that includes moderate Republicans who have a track record with reaching out over the line with Democrats. And of course, those Republicans in this new class, of Republicans that flipped congressional districts that President Biden won in 2020. Flip them to win them, and this midterm in 2022. So, those are who the White House is focusing on. Now, this is in the early stages here, Boris and Amara. And that includes kind of researching them, researching their pressure points, identifying what makes them tick, and what kind of issues that in the past they have worked on, that they would like to work on, again. Of course, as this White House faces a reality that the legislative, bipartisan wins that they face, there are -- that they won rather in the last two years, could dry up when it comes to Republicans in the House. And they said that they are not signing any blank checks moving forward. So, this is in the early stages, of course. But it all leads up to White House reach out, which, of course, can lead up to President Biden reaching out to these Republicans. As we know that he likes to work across the aisle, as the White House tries to find some way -- some silver lining to get some bipartisan wins in the last two years of the president's first term.
