The Israelis are saying that some seven people were arrested, while the Danish services are saying four were arrested, three of them in Denmark and one in the Netherlands. But what everyone is agreeing on right now is that these people were arrested in connection to a possible terror plot. The Mossad and the Shin Bet agency here, which is the equivalent of the U.S.' FBI, says that these arrests were made in connection with a terrorist plot to kill civilians on European soil. The Israelis are saying that these people were acting on behalf of the Hamas terrorist organization. The statement from the Danish security services going on to say that the three who were arrested have been charged with terrorism offenses. So, of course, this is far away from this region. This is far away from this war. Kate, there had been fears that, as a result of this war, we could start to see more terrorist attacks. Of course, in the United States, we have seen this huge spike in antisemitism and Islamophobia. This war in Gaza has led to a huge amount of anger across the Arab and Muslim world. And so this was a major concern from officials and terror experts that we could start to see a new spike in terrorist attacks, this one, this plot clearly stopped before, thankfully, it was carried out. But there was a series of raids in Denmark that took place today resulting in these arrests that Israel is saying was targeting European citizens on European soil. They say that Hamas has been expanding their operations to try to go after Israeli, Jewish and Western targets -- Kate.",

Now, talk to me more about this fear that we have been hearing about for quite some time since October 7 and what October 7 and the reaction from Israel in going after Hamas terrorists in the aftermath, the fears that it has raised in terms of Hamas expanding their capabilities far beyond Israel and Gaza.",

You are joining us on the steps of the Capitol, Manu.

He's been criticized for defying that January 6 Select Committee subpoena from the last Congress, and now he's threatening to hold Hunter Biden in contempt for defying the subpoena yesterday, not coming before the committee behind closed doors to be deposed as part of their impeachment inquiry into President Biden.I asked him about this and about, why did you -- and how you defied that subpoena with the January 6 Committee? How could you go forward with this, given your own personal history? He said that he didn't defy the subpoena. He was taking issue with the word defying the subpoena. He said:  I wrote a letter back to the committee. They never wrote a letter back to me. The subpoena did call for interview and also records and the like. But he also indicated he was walking on his way to a closed-door deposition with a former U.S. -- assistant U.S. attorney who was involved in the investigation into Hunter Biden. That's all part of their probe into the president. The question is, can they establish a connection between President Biden and his son Hunter? And they hope that is enough to move forward articles of impeachment for the president, but many Republicans flatly acknowledge they simply do not have that proof yet, and it's unclear if they will get there. But talking to some Republicans, including some conservative members, they're making clear that they believe that they should go down the road of impeachment, no matter what, and also warning about political blowback if Joe Biden is not impeached.

This investigation will continue into next year. But, at some point, the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, has to make a decision about whether to move forward with articles of impeachment. And if he does, what is the evidence that they have to show that the president should be charged with high crimes or misdemeanors? And, also, can he get the votes? Because there's so many Republicans in those swing districts who don't necessarily agree with what you heard there from Congressman Mark Green, who -- they don't believe that it's actually good for them politically to go down this road, particularly the ones in swing districts who are not sold yet on moving forward with an actual high crime or misdemeanor charge against the president. So, all huge questions, as many on the right pushing to have Joe Biden impeached, some in the middle uncertain and caught in the middle, the speaker of the House, who has key decisions to make when they come back into session next year, as they just wrapped up their session for the year just moments ago -- Sara.",

And if the Republicans continue to stick to wanting H.R.2, then that's completely out of bounds as to what Donald Trump did, and we're not in agreement with that.

But he also, again, really went after Nikki Haley in a way that we haven't seen. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  They have been talking about the Haley surge. So she goes up two points. I go up, I think 10 points, nine or 10 points, and they say that's a Trump surge. But they don't want to say that. They said she's surging against him, but he's gone nowhere. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She just had that big endorsement from the New Hampshire governor, Chris Sununu.And from my conversations with Donald Trump's campaign and his advisers, they recognize that she is a growing threat. Now, when you talk to them publicly, they will say they're not that worried about her, he's still doing very well, which is true. He still has a very commanding lead in the polls. But they do recognize that you could be a problem for him, particularly in New Hampshire. And one of the key things here to keep in mind is that Donald Trump's team doesn't just want him to win in Iowa and win in New Hampshire. They need to have a really good showing. And that's because there's a lot of expectation that he's going to dominate. But they also want to build that momentum to be strong enough to not only carry him through the rest of the primaries, but to really force his opponents like Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis out of the race. And so that is a growing concern. And then just really quickly, Kate, I also want to get to another major point that Donald Trump made last night. He is growing -- or -- excuse me -- he is increasingly going after Joe Biden and making the primaries not just about his opponents, but also about Joe Biden. He really is trying to go after Joe Biden's unpopularity to try and galvanize these voters to come out for him. And he very much made that message clear last night, talking about the economy and arguing that, as we go into the holidays, people are very worried about it and that Joe Biden is the reason that there are those concerns -- Kate.",

Biden faces basically the opposite problem, whereas he really has the support of donors and establishment Democrats, but sort of rank-and- file Democratic voters are really concerned that he's too old. They think he -- they are worried about his handling of the economy, and he just has a low approval rating. Bloomberg News has a new poll out this morning that shows that Biden's standing with young voters, with black voters is really dropping. And this is a third month that we have done this poll.
