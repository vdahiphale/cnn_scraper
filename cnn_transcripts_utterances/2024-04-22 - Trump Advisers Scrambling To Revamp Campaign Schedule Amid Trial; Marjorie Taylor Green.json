He is required to attend every single day on the trial, which will cut into his time in crucial battleground states in this incredibly tight presidential race.So our Kristen Holmes is outside the courthouse here in Manhattan with me as well. So, Kristen, how is Trump's campaign handling this unprecedented situation? Because it's, you know, they get one day a week. It's a Wednesday in the middle of the week. There's only so much you can do with the limited time that they have.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Erin. I mean, look, there was a little bit of denial here. They were hoping that this day would never come, that he would actually have to sit through this trial.But they had been planning on him being in court every weekday except for Wednesdays and using Wednesdays and Saturdays as campaign days. But planning and reality are a little bit different. They are trying to now figure out what exactly that looks like. As we saw, it's not always going to be perfect. And they're particularly concerned given the fact that they're looking at poll numbers in which it seems as though Biden is closing the gap that Donald Trump had. Now, this is all within the margin of error. This is all very early. But, you know, Donald Trump pays attention to those polls. So what they have been doing was using Donald Trump to go to the cameras in the hallways at every opportunity they had, trying to keep treating these appearances as campaign stops. But now there is some concern that that's not going to be enough. And what we saw last week was really an example of how this could go any which way. We saw the team celebrating after they had this kind of impromptu, politically motivated stop at a Harlem bodega. But then they had a loss when they were supposed to have a campaign rally in North Carolina. Now, with nothing on the schedule, there is nothing for about over a week for him to do. Now, we'll see if they add any kind of stops. They've been looking at ways to try to get him around the New York area, probably to places where he would be more popular, like Staten Island, not necessarily in Manhattan, and also looking for ways to utilize him being in court. Does that mean more local interviews? Does that mean setting up a studio within his Trump Tower to try and get his messaging out? It's just unclear how exactly this is going to play out. But what is clear is that they are trying to find alternatives, despite, again, having known this schedule, the reality now sinking in that it can't just be Wednesdays and Saturdays in this kind of campaign.",

And that has effectively become his campaign.And what Kristen is saying is that his advisers are beginning to realize that's just not enough. I mean, you see the Biden campaign getting more aggressive, having a president out there traveling. I mean, Joe Biden is doing the opposite of a Rose Garden strategy. He's out there on the campaign trail. This is not to say that Trump was out there a lot before the trial, because he really would sort of jet in, do a big rally and then jet out. But he's got to do more than he's been doing. And the trial handcuffs him, but he's got to figure out a way to get out of that and make some other political points that go beyond how unfair the trial is.",

She's accusing him of betraying Republican voters.The threat comes after House Speaker the House speaker defied GOP hardliners by putting that foreign aid bill on the House floor that had $61 billion in Ukraine. It passed over the weekend and it now heads over to the Senate. So let's go to Melanie Zanona for more. Now three Republicans at least are calling for the speaker's removal. And I know that, you know, technically they've only got a one vote majority. But in all of your reporting that you've been doing so tirelessly on this, Melanie, what's going on?

As you mentioned, right now, it's only three co-sponsors officially on that resolution. But most Republicans do not want to see another messy speaker fight, including former President Donald Trump.They're worried that it would really undermine the party heading into November. But Greene is confident that when Republicans go home for this recess break, hear from their constituents, see how angry the base is, that there will be a pressure campaign that pushes more Republicans squarely into her camp. And she's also warning Johnson that if he does not step down on his own, they will try to push him out of the job. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): Johnson has betrayed America. He's betrayed Republican voters. Under his leadership, he's passed the Democrat agenda, passed the Biden administration's policies, and fully funded them. We're going to fight in Congress to do everything we can to stop this type of uniparty leadership. Mike Johnson's speakership is over. He needs to do the right thing to resign and allow us to move forward in a controlled process. If he doesn't do so, he will be vacated. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But behind the scenes, there is a lot of interest in doing so. And that is because Democrats appreciate the fact that Johnson put this foreign aid package on the floor, defied his right thing.That was something that there was a lot of doubts that Johnson would actually do. But if Johnson is ultimately propped up by Democrats, that might fuel questions about his long-term political future. And meanwhile, even though former President Donald Trump has been supportive of Johnson, he obviously is preoccupied with his own issues right now. So for Johnson, he's not going to be able to rely on Trump to offer him a lifeline. He's really going to have to depend on Democrats -- Erin.",

We've now come outside.And what's important about what's happening out here is that most of the people here, Wolf, I want to show you, it's not a very large group, but it's a very loud group. They've been out here for several days as well, and they're here to support the people that are on the inside, which are the students. And what happens is many of the students who are inside come to this gate and stand out here to sort of do a back and forth as you can hear some of the chants. And a lot of the trouble that you have seen has started outside here. Fires burning, some of the interaction and confrontation between the community and some of the people who have been here, including some pro-Israel supporters who've been out here. The other thing I want to show you, Wolf, as we know, the NYPD is outside. I want to show you. This is where they have remained here on the perimeter, keeping an eye on the folks here. They're right now not allowed into the school. The city says that if they're requested by the school, they would allow the NYPD officers to go inside and help in any way that they need. Remember, it was just a few days ago that the school did ask the NYPD to come on campus and to remove the tents, to remove the encampment resulting in those hundred students and faculty members and other people being arrested. That was a flashpoint in this, certainly. So anything that happens now is going to be something that the university is going to think about very carefully before they decide in allowing the NYPD inside. But the NYPD is out here. The supporters of the students who are on the inside remain out here. And this goes on for hours, well into the night, Wolf, the folks out here standing, chanting. And then you have the students on the inside at these gates -- Wolf.",

They need to remain brave to face the adversity and some of the challenges that they're facing on campus.So while some of them, of course, are afraid, they're doing things to minimize their risk. They're getting together. They're staying in groups. And most of them say they plan to remain here for now. A lot of the concern that these students are getting are coming from their parents. Their parents are very worried about them. But for now, the students said, yes, we don't feel entirely safe. This is not what Columbia is. This is not what we came here for. So we are worried for our safety. Some have said that they have been harassed, but they're going to keep coming. They're going to keep coming to campus. It is the first night of Passover.
