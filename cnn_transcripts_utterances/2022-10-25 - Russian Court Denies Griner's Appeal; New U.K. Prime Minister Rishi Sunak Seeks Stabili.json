There was swift reaction from the White House after the appeal that didn't go anywhere, slamming the court proceeding as a quote, \"sham,\" vowing the Biden administration is doing everything it can to bring her home.

And we also heard from the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. And what he said is that the Biden administration is working through every means available to them to try and secure a way to get Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, another American wrongfully detained in Russia, out. And, of course, now that these proceedings are over, the onus is really on the Biden administration to continue trying to do that.

Again, what is amazing is that you're not hearing anything that suggests serious progress. To me, these statements being released publicly suggest that they aren't able to make real headway with Russia. No surprise:  Brittney Griner is a hostage. She's been a hostage to the Putin government from the very beginning. Unfortunately, she's a valuable hostage. The more publicity and attention she gets, the more that it increases her value to Vladimir Putin. And 250 days is also the amount of time that the whole country of Ukraine has been held hostage to a brutal war of extinction and attacks on civilians. Think about the millions people impacted by this. Brittney Griner is a very visible public example of the lengths to which the outlaw Putin government will go.",

Republicans hoping to hold onto it. Democrats certainly hoping to flip it. And what we have here is quite a dynamic race on our hands in the sense there are a lot of issues at play. We have new polling at CNN, showing where we think the current state of play is, showing Fetterman with a slight lead at 51 percent to Oz's 45 percent. And then you take a look at the issues that people care most about and if you look at top there, it is very easy to see, by the numbers, it is the economy in a very big way, followed by abortion. But you see the big gap in numbers there. And so tonight we expect them to talk about these issues. But just kind of laying out the landscape for you, you have the Democratic nominee, John Fetterman, who is recovering from a stroke he suffered just days before the May primary. He still has  some auditory processing issues. So that means that he's been using closed captioning to communicate with people in the sense that he'll read what people are saying and then he can respond to it. His doctors saying that he is able to -- he has no restrictions. But we are going to see that at play tonight. Oz has been on TV for years and years. So it is interesting to see how this plays out.

Several -- 28 percent of voters rank it as the most urgent issue. So we know that Zeldin is speaking to them. Now on Governor Hochul, she's likely to argue she's been working on a crime fighting problem with the mayor of New York and state resources from the very beginning. She's tried to say this is a continuation of a strategy. Even the strategy announced over the weekend to increase the number of police officers on subways or police officer hours on subways. She said it is a continuation of a strategy. So she's going to be prepared to push back. But we'll have to wait and see what happens in this, their only scheduled debate before Election Day.",

That was taken in September.That was even before the hurricane and before DeSantis unleashed an onslaught of spending in this race. So we don't know how it is changed since then. But here is another problem that Charlie Crist has:  2 million people have already voted in this state. About 1.2 million people voted by mail.

And he uses it to humanize himself because he says everybody has gone through health issues in their family or with themselves and I'm working through this because I had a stroke in May. And, you know, I think for Oz, he has to appear more relatable to the voters. He has to show that he's not going to be mean to Fetterman, which they've accused him of being about the stroke over the last months. And then I think, it is going to take a turn right to the issues. I mean, these people could not be more different. You've seen that Oz has tried to back away from the MAGA label. Fetterman has to prove he's not too liberal for the state of Pennsylvania.

In New York the registration is Democratic 2-1. So they're not too -- they weren't too concerned. But suddenly now Hochul understands that Zeldin is making some headway on the crime issue.

Now the question that I have is, if you're a DeSantis supporter, you're going to say, yes, he's not going to stay in the state because I want him to be president. So if you're already supporting DeSantis, it wouldn't, I don't think it would hurt him and he's way ahead.
