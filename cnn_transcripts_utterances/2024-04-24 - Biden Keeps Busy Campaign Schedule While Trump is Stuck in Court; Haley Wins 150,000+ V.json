Talking about how you're fighting to bring down costs, talking about how you're going after predatory interests who are gouging consumers, those are winners. And putting Trump on the other the side of issues like the tax cut, the 2017 tax cut that favored the wealthy, that will come up for renewal. Those are winners for Biden.

If that's all we were talking about, pro-Palestinian protests, well, protests on campuses are nothing new.But there's a critically important line between free speech and hate, hate that is making Jewish students at these schools feel scared and unsafe and in some cases, not because of differences over the war, but because they are Jews. And since the brutal October 7th massacre by Hamas inside Israel, we've seen that line crossed over and over again. This is what Jewish students are hearing on and around college campuses.

But what I will say is that it is uniquely framed in light of what's been happening at other campuses over the past couple of days, when you see the violence happening at Columbia, the violence happening at Yale. Thankfully, that has not happened at Brown. It has remained peaceful. I am hopeful that it will remain peaceful, but the context of other campuses has made this protest incredibly unique.",

Well, let's hope that, especially given the fact that the ADL just recently did a survey on college campuses around the country and Brown got a 'D' when it comes to antisemitism. This is before everything that we are seeing now.Adam, here in Washington, I want to read you, speaking of the ADL, something that Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the ADL, wrote in an op-ed on cnn.com. He went to Columbia's Hillel, met with about 80 Jewish students. He said one depicted the assault of a Jewish classmate, an Israeli flag ripped from his hand. Another showed a Jewish student being screamed at by a fully masked individual who came right up to his face, his voice shaking with fury. He went on to say demonstrators calling openly for Hamas to burn Tel Aviv. We heard that ourselves. Others yelling that October 7th is about to be every day. What I want to know from you is, if you have any sense from the Jewish students you talked to all over the country, all over the world, but specifically, let's start here in the U.S., why is this happening? Why is it going from basic protest, free speech, to intimidation and sometimes some scary violence? ADAM LEHMAN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, HILLEL INTERNATIONAL: Yeah. Thank you for having us on this conversation, Dana. It is really quite simple. There are organizations like National Students for Justice in Palestine that are not interested in dialog and debate. They are not interested in even necessarily simply supporting Palestinians. They are interested in advancing a political worldview. In the end, that reflects the goals of Hamas, of Hezbollah, of Iran, and they are using campuses as an instrument to try to effectuate that change. And unfortunately, a lot of students who understandably want to think about and express compassion towards Palestinians, hopefully they think the same towards Israelis, the victims of 10/7 and others who have been so adversely impacted. But even with all of that, they are getting in my view, co-opted into a political movement that, as we have seen, has been marked by hateful, discriminatory, and violent speech, and actual harassment and violence spawning from those protests.",

The campuses involved in this story and really the hundreds of other campuses where we've seen protests have provided ample time, place, and space for protest. However, passionate or aggressive students want to be in those spaces, students are running and non-students coming in to take advantage, running roughshod over those parameters.
