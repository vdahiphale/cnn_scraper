And we took that recommendation, and it was in 2016 and 2017 publicly supported by all our uniform chiefs of staff because it makes sense. Seventeen percent of the military today is composed of women. They're in every aspect of service, combat arms, technical services, et cetera. And we're in a situation where all we're trying to do is register. There's no draft in place today. It would take Congress to act, to pass legislation, to create a draft. And in that legislation, they could make distinctions, clarifications, whatever Congress thought.But without this registration requirement, we are missing on a vast pool of talent. I mean it's interesting, we're talking about Israel. Their armed forces have been gender neutral for decades and decades and decades. And they're one of the most effective fighting forces in the country. In the world I should say. So, what we're talking about now is simply if we get into a crisis, if we need the -- to start drafting, that we want to be able to draft the most qualified individuals in the country.
