I'm Jessica Dean in Washington.And new tonight in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, right now a Hamas delegation is in Cairo for talks on a hostage and ceasefire deal. Also there, CIA Director Bill Burns, who played a key role in past negotiations. And while Egyptian media is reporting what they call noticeable progress in these latest talks, U.S. and Israeli officials say it could take days to iron out the final details of a potential deal. CNN's Kevin Liptak is with me now. Kevin, what are you learning? Obviously it is very, very late, in the middle of the night pretty much in Cairo right now. But what are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think you do hear a degree of cautious optimism coming from the Biden administration and the caution comes because they have been at this point before. They have been at a point where it appears as if they're reaching the final stages of a deal only to see it all fall apart. And so I think that's where you're seeing that level of caution come from.But I do think it's significant that Bill Burns is in the region. That does give you an indication that at least from the American side, they do see some talks progressing. And we also heard from Hamas as they were going to Cairo for these discussions saying that they had a positive spirit about this framework that's on the table. This has been on the table for about a week. Hamas hasn't yet said what their answer to that is. But it would release a significant number of hostages, about 30, in exchange for a temporary ceasefire. And what American officials have said is that this is a generous offer, but there are some significant sticking points and I think the biggest one is whether this deal would eventually lead to an end of the war. That is something that Hamas has said is a bottom line for them. Israel has said that it still needs to continue going after Hamas in Gaza. So it isn't really clear how that not will come untied, but certainly from the American perspective, they do think that they're making some progress. What we have heard from American officials and Israeli officials today is that even if Hamas does agree to this framework, that's not necessarily the end of the road. There are still some final details that will need to be ironed out before the hostages start coming out of Gaza. And I think the real fear among American officials at this point is that if this framework collapses, if this falls apart, that will be the impetus for Israel to go into Rafah. That's the city in southern Gaza, where more than a million Palestinian civilians have been sheltering. Prime Minister Bejamin Netanyahu has said that he will go after Hamas in Rafah whether there's a deal or not. The American side has said they need to see a credible plan to protect those civilians, and they haven't seen it yet, and they very much want to avoid that eventuality and that is really kind of looming over these talks and certainly giving them a degree of urgency.",

Again, violence that we've seen happen on both sides of this from the protesters and counter-protesters, and from the over-militarized police response. But I, you know, I do support the underlying goal of a lot of these young people who are saying that 30,000 people being killed is too many and that it's time to get a ceasefire to enable humanitarian assistance into Gaza and to get the hostages out.",

And we know that it's dangerous. However, I don't believe that the bill that was passed through the House is actually going to solve that problem.I don't believe that anti-Zionism is inherently antisemitism, and I think it's incredibly important that we allow for First Amendment rights to protest, to free speech, that actually that college is a time to be questioning all of the underpinnings of our system and questioning the things you thought you know. And that's a lot of what these students are doing. And so to me, the definition now going to be codified in this bill, not only would bring in a lot of the protesters that are being non-violent, that are being peaceful into this definition. But also, I'm incredibly worried that if this bill, if this law, if it becomes law and it goes to court, it could actually be used to undermine much more of the Civil Rights Act and make everyone less safer. And I just fundamentally don't believe that conflating the very real rise in antisemitism and hate crimes with protected speech, even speech you disagree with, is actually going to make Jewish students any safer.",

What do you do in that situation? JACOBSpeople, there's wide disagreement on the exact definition of antisemitism. That's what this bill was about. And frankly, in the Civil Rights Act, we don't have a definition of racism. And I'd argue if we tried to define racism in the 1960s, in the 1970s that definition probably wouldn't hold up very well. And so I think, you know, I think personally speech is protected. And I think that there's a very different -- there is a difference between acts of violence and speech that could be construed as calling for violence, and different ways in how we should approach that. And I think any acts of violence need to be penalized. And I think we should have a very wide leeway for what speech we are allowing.",

He says that what he's doing is monitoring his property from afar, through a camera. He let me borrow his phone, just take a look. This is what his backyard looks like right now. This is a live camera. He tells me that this is his backyard. Normally, there would be no water here. He has a mechanic shop. And so this would show equipment, vehicles, and you see right there that it is completely covered in water. Now, this area is just beyond this row that you see. Back there, what it's called, its river bottoms. And from talking to neighbors here, they tell me that between eight and 15 people have refused to leave that area. Now, they tell me that that the water levels go up and down because the ground goes up and down. But here on the fence you can see the water level where the water is. Now you also see the water level on the trees. That gives people hope because they see that the water level has dropped a little bit. Now I talked to the owner of this home. Her name is Stacey Smith. She's devastated because she knows those 18 to 15 people who are back there who refuse to leave, some of them are elderly, some of them are disabled, and she says that they own so few things in life that they don't want to leave them behind. And that's why they refuse to leave. They just don't want to leave their property and their belongings.

Now we will get the official FEC reports until later this month when they drop so we can't independently verify that but that is what they laid out according to multiple attendees in the room. And now to your other point, you're exactly right. Donald Trump had an opportunity to showcase and brush shoulders with some of this potential vice presidential contenders. While speaking at a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago today he invited a series of them up on stage. That includes people like Elise Stefanik, J.D. Vance, Tim Scott, Doug Burgum, Marco Rubio, all people we know from our conversations with the Trump campaign that Donald Trump is considering as his potential running mate. And I do just want to be clear here, Jessica, from my conversations with his team, they do not anticipate the former president to announce his pick anytime soon.

Forty thousand people are set to be inside Memorial Stadium here in Bloomington, Indiana.So far we have not seen any real notable protests out, at least outside the venue. But the big question is, will a protest pop up inside the venue during this commencement? Indiana has seen its share of protesters, Jessica. It was last month that 33 protesters were arrested at Indiana University. Certainly, it is an open question mark of whether these disruptions that we've seen on campuses as well as at ceremonies all across the country will continue here at Indiana University. To that end, the university has designated a specific protest zone to try to maintain the freedom of speech and make sure that people have that option available, while also preserving a controlled and smoothly run ceremony. But what we saw at University of Michigan, Jessica, at least at the outside was very similar to what we see here as we were outside the University of Michigan's commencement in Ann Arbor, we saw no indication that there would be a protest. We saw no protesters. We saw no signs. It was during the commencement ceremony, about 15 minutes in that we saw a group of protesters move from the back of Michigan Stadium, the back of Michigan field, to the center of the commencement ceremony, and make their presence known in a very vocal way. They caused a brief disruption, I'd say Jessica, it was between a dozen and three dozen protesters yelling. They were very clearly pro- Palestine and the Michigan State Police were on top of them very quickly, making pretty clear that they were not going to allow that disruption to move anywhere near the stage. That went on for I would say five to 10 minutes and then Michigan State Police said protesters sort of escorted themselves out to the back of the ceremony and the rest of the ceremony went off smoothly, Jessica. But certainly with what we are seeing all across the country, especially at Indiana University where I would said before there were dozens of students arrested last month, it is an open question mark here. The university trying to get ahead of that, again, as i said with this protest zone. So this commencement is set to begin in the next 15 minutes or so, and we will be watching to see what happens -- Jessica.",

Thanks so much for that reporting.Let's go now to Florida where a new law went into effect this week, banning nearly all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. That's before many women even realized they are pregnant. While this decision was made by lawmakers, come November, voters are going to have their say at the ballot box. My next guest was involved in crafting Amendment 4. It is a state constitutional amendment to protect abortion up to 24 weeks. Anna Hochkammer joins us now. She is the executive director of the Florida Women's Freedom Coalition. Great to have you here with us. Thanks so much for being here. Listen, changing the Florida Constitution is not an easy thing. It requires is a 60 percent majority and it is a high threshold in a pretty purple state that has gone red the last few cycles, how do you think this is going to be possible? How do you guys plan to do this? ANNA HOCHKAMMER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FLORIDA WOMEN'S FREEDOM COALITION: Florida has 60 percent threshold, but 75 percent of Florida voters reject the six-week ban. They think its cruel. They think it causes chaos in people's lives, and we believe that we will have a strong bipartisan coalition that will not only get to 60 percent, it will burst through 60 percent. I think this is a case where extremist politicians misread the room and they don't understand that we've been living with access to safe legal abortion up until viability for over 50 years in this country, and in this state, and voters are going to clap back fairly strongly in November.",
