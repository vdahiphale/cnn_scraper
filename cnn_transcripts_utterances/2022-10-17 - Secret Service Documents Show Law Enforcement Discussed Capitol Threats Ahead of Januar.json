Prior to the January 6, 2021 insurrection, and yet none of the agencies gave a clear potential for large scale violence, like what unfolded at the Capitol building that day.Here with me now is CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller. John, great to have you with us here. So, what exactly are we learning about the extent of the risk that they were aware of before January 6th?",

But there is a lot of reporting in there. These documents came from the Secret Service but most of them originated from other agencies, FBI, U.S. Marshalls, Homeland Security, where that intelligence was being shared.But they're following the hashtags, we are the storm, 1776 rebels, they're seeing lots people are either coming to the Capitol or to the White House and they're talking about bringing weapons. They're talking about quick reaction forces for groups, like the Oath Keepers, where that trial is going on right now to be staged in Virginia in case they get the call from POTUS, president of the United States, to come in. So, that is armed quick reaction forces across the river waiting for -- so, in other words, there was a lot of information that these large groups thought that they were working for the president.",

Executive order 12-333 gives the responsibility for information sharing on these kinds of events to the Department of Homeland Security, and on terrorism, the FBI.Now, DHS routinely does threat assessments that go to all of law enforcement and all the partners to say, here is the event. It could be anything from the Kentucky Derby to the 4th of July to the lighting of the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center, and yet they didn't put one out either as DHS or with joint seals, them or FBI, on January 6th. And there could be politics involved in that, which is it would be hard for an acting secretary of Homeland Security to put out a widely circulated document that captured the threat but also said the president's most virulent supports constitute a danger to Washington.

Innovation was emphasized, that this will remain at the heart of China's modernization, self-reliance, the economy is seen as crucial going forward. But, nonetheless, there wasn't much said about common prosperity in terms of detail. It was, I think, just lip service paid to it in his speech.So, the details of what the economic policies will be going forward, I think the jury is still out. But my expectation is that we won't see very much change going forward. We will see a central role for the state. We will see more subsidies coming from China to industries where they want to catch up with the United States.",

Some people think he will be in power for life. Others think he might be there for another 5, 10 or 15 years. I don't think Xi Jinping has made a decision yet that he will have to use force to achieve that goal. And, indeed, he talked about peaceful reunification, that this party will strive the utmost to achieve that unification peacefully but did not rule out the use of force.That said, going forward, if Xi Jinping believes that there is a potential for Taiwan to permanently separate from China, that legal jury independence is possible, then he may make a decision to use force.

Monitors say more than half of the U.S. is experiencing drought conditions and experts say it is having a significant impact on the Mississippi River.More than 40 river gauges on the river are reporting low water levels. And it comes at a crucial time. Crops from the nation's heartland are being moved down river. The low water levels means barges loaded with grain have to be queued up, waiting for the all clear. The dried river bed has also produced unique opportunities for sightseeing. In Missouri, people can now walk to Tower Rock. The 32- acre island is in the middle of the river and usually only accessible by boat. And Louisiana, extremely low water levels have revealed a 107-year-old ship wreck. Archeologists are using the opportunity to learn about the ship and recover artifacts. The ferry called the Brookhill sank in 1915 during a hurricane. Well, like the price of just about everything, the cost of ketchup for your French fries or the sauce for your pasta is up. California farmers grew $1.18 billion tomatoes last year.
