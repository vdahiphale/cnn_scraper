Ahead on CNN Newsroom.A close encounter causes one New York airport to pause operations. The latest on a string of mysterious drone sightings. Donald Trump got a hero's welcome at a much-anticipated Army-Navy football game. We'll find out who joined him. And a tornado warning. Shocking residents in San Francisco. A look at the historic alert and the winter weather blanketing the West Coast. Welcome. We begin with more questions about what's going on in the skies above the Northeastern U.S. For the better part of a month now, people have reported consistent sightings of unidentified aircraft, often described as drones. But U.S. federal officials have downplayed the sightings, even as more drones are reported near sensitive sites across the Eastern U.S. State and local officials are calling for more action and more answers from the Biden administration.

      "sentences": "Six states throughout the Northeast have reported these drone sightings, everywhere from New Jersey to Pennsylvania, Virginia, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, and even here in New York, where a local airfield had to shut down over the weekend, after a reported drone activity over its skies led the airspace to be shut down for over an hour.That led the governor here in New York, Kathy Hochul, to issue a statement, saying that all of this had simply gone too far, and calling on the Biden administration to step in to do more and provide more public information. These drone sightings are causing a lot of consternation among local communities, from people who are reporting the sightings, and very confused about what exactly they are and what is behind them. Now, we heard from some federal officials who are responding to the drone activity over the weekend, and they had some contradicting information, as well. They said that while there is no national security threat associated with any of these sightings, they still don't know whether or not there is anything malicious, or if it is criminal in nature. That is certainly a little bit different from what we have heard from other federal officials who have said that this is likely a case of mistaken identity, and that there is no security threat to worry about. In the meantime, a lot of frustration from local lawmakers across the area who say that the federal government is not doing enough to make sure that communities have the information that they need in order to feel safe. Take a listen to a local state assemblyman from New Jersey describing the activity that he himself witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERIK PETERSON, NEW JERSEY ASSEMBLYMAN, DISTRICT 23: And the way that they're moving, they move forward, they stop, they hover, they move sideways, they stop, they hover, they move backwards.

There are no reported or confirmed drone sightings in any restricted airspace.\" [05So you can see just how confusing some of the information has been. That's not helping when it comes to people who are continuing to report these sightings and who want to know more about what is exactly behind them. On that end, we've also learned that the FBI tip line has received more than 5,000 tips regarding drones and reported sightings, but so far, fewer than 100 of those were deemed worthy of further investigative activity.

You heard from Assemblyman Peterson. He's a personal, dear friend of mine. So I know that if he says he's seen something, he's definitely seen something. In October, the first person to tell me about that was a local politician, James Kern, who I handed a diploma to, and he said he's seen it.

Vance, and incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune. Also spotted alongside Trump was Daniel Penny. He is the ex-Marine who was acquitted this week by a Manhattan jury on charges that he choked a homeless man to death in New York on the subway earlier this year. While on his way to the game, Donald Trump continued to announce new picks for his incoming administration, including Troy Edgar. He is an IBM Executive who will be Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security for Donald Trump. This is someone who previously served in the Department of Homeland Security. He is also someone who contributed to Product 2025, that is the controversial playbook for a second Trump term put together by the Conservative Heritage Foundation. Trump during the campaign tried to distance himself from Product 2025, though as he puts together his administration, he has repeatedly pulled from people who contributed and helped write it for his new administration. Trump also announced that Devin Nunes, the former House Intelligence Committee Chairman, will serve on the Intelligence Advisory Board for Trump.

Jean Carroll case. And George Stephanopoulos repeatedly used the word rape, saying Trump was found guilty of rape, liable of rape. Well, in fact, the accurate phrase to use is sexual abuse. That is what the New York court found. But because Stephanopoulos kept using that R word, rape, Trump filed a lawsuit. He filed a defamation suit. We've talked a lot in recent years about people using the courts trying to seek justice. Remember the Sandy Hook case against Alex Jones. Well, those defamation kinds of cases can also be filed by someone like the President-elect. So Trump filed a defamation suit. It was working its way through the courts. \"ABC\" was unable to get it thrown out initially. And actually, in the next few days, Trump was set to be deposed in the case. But \"ABC\" is avoiding going any further by settling. They're paying out $15 million, plus a million in attorney's fees. They say this is going to go to a nonprofit, basically to Trump's future library. That's the idea. But maybe most importantly, \"ABC\" is also apologizing, issuing a statement of regret. But \"ABC\" is going to say, basically attach an editor's note to the website saying it regrets, and George regrets the statements. Meanwhile, an \"ABC\" spokesperson tells me they are pleased to have reached this settlement.

Earlier this week, satellite images showed what appeared to be Russians packing up military equipment at one of its bases. You can see the location of the two Russian bases on this map right here. Russia operates an air base at Khmeimim and a naval base in the port city of Tartus. Meanwhile, social media video from Homs shows a Syrian waving a shoe as Russian troops pass.

The Ukrainian Air Force says it shot down dozens of drones targeting areas across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv. Authorities say at least three people were injured. Meanwhile, Russia claims it's developed a new system that can track Ukraine's Starlink terminals, which are used to run their fleet of attract drones. Russian state media reports that it can identify and destroy drones in the sea and air, and that they're already producing and testing the system. Ukraine's military says it's replacing the commander of the nation's Eastern Donetsk group. He faced heavy criticism for failing to stop recent Russian advances on the key city of Pokrovsk. The area has seen some of the most intense fighting on the eastern front for months as Russian forces inch closer to the city.

Footage from social media shows winds in excess of 200 kilometers per hour ravaging through houses with heavy rain forcing residents to stay in solid shelters. Officials say emergency services have been mobilized, ready to launch rescue missions once the worst of the storm passes.

The National Weather Service confirms a tornado did not actually hit the area, but the damage left behind is consistent with an 80-mile-per-hour straight- line wind.

And that is when the new president, who was just elected by, I should say, by the Parliament, which is considered illegal by the opposition and the existing president, that is when he's supposed to be inaugurated. So you could have the Western-leaning president, her name is Salome Zourabichvili, and she could be saying, I'm staying until we have legitimate elections. So that's one of the big underlying issues. And the other one would have to be the decision recently in November by the prime minister to put on hold the accession process by Georgia to the EU. And that really, really angered a lot of people, especially, you know, the more liberal Western-oriented people. Across the board, about 80%, 8-0%, support joining the EU. Now, how many people want a redo of the election? That would be harder. I haven't seen any specific polling on that. But you do have these protests, as you mentioned. They've been in Tbilisi. They've been literally across Georgia with very large numbers. So you would have to say a significant number of people were not happy with that election, and especially not happy with the decision by the prime minister to stop that process of joining Europe. Saturday, there was a feeling among many, in fact, people that I'd spoken with in the opposition actually did fear that martial law would be invoked, and that the decision by the parliament to elect this new president would spark, you know, maybe even violent uprising. It didn't happen. And I think maybe that's why we don't have, at least at this point, martial law. I mean, if you look at the protesters, what some of them did, which is very interesting, kind of a civil society approach, young people were out in the streets kicking soccer balls around. And that was a bit of trolling because, you know, this new president, Mikheil Kavelashvili, is a former soccer star, football star. And so he's considered actually very far right. Many people in Georgia who are educated note that he doesn't have any college education. But be that as it may, there was a lot of trolling, and it was peaceful for the most part.

And according to authorities, they had gone to the area of Angamacutiro on November 30th to be with family. We know that Rafael and Gloria Cardona were killed that day. Gloria Cardona died at the scene while Rafael was taken to the hospital and died shortly after. Officials there also saying that they had three children. U.S. authorities saying that two of them minors and are now with extended family. We are also aware that the State Department is in touch with their adult daughter. Now, Mexican officials also saying that they spoke to Rafael's brother who described the fact that their brother-in-law is a Mexican official in that area and the couple was driving their van. Now, that Mexican official, the brother-in-law, took his job after his predecessor was kidnapped and killed. Mexican officials not confirming the motive behind the killings. But we do know that this is an area where there are gangs and drug violence. We know that this is also an area where a lot of avocados are grown. And according to a report from Insight Crime, traffickers forced local farmers to grow marijuana and other drugs. We also know that in Michoacan, the homicide rate is almost twice as much as the homicide rate in Mexico, which is already one of the highest in the world. So, of course, concerning numbers when it comes to all of this. And also in Mexico, more than 100,000 people right now missing without explanation. In this case, we know who it was and what happened.

Now, 18 years later, Mangum, says it was all a lie.In an interview for the web show Let's Talk With Kat, hosted by Katerina DePasquale, Mangum said she testified falsely. The interview took place at the North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women, where the 46-year-old woman is serving time for a 2013 second-degree murder conviction for stabbing her boyfriend two years before. This is part of the interview where she asks for forgiveness for lying about what truly happened. Let's take a listen.",

The three were arrested following the woman's allegations of sexual assault at a party. Their lacrosse team was forced to cancel its 2006 season. And their coach, Mike Pressler, lost his job as a result.A year later, in 2007, the state's then-attorney, General Roy Cooper, now North Carolina's governor, reviewed the case and exonerated the three men. He reached a settlement with Duke University after the charges were dropped. Asked about this new development, Governor Cooper said it was important for him to get to the bottom of the case when he worked on it back then.",
