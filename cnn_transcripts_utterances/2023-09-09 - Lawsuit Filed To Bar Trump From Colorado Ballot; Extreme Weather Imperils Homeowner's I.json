      "sentences": "Is the fifth time the charm? I doubt it. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.Four legal threats to Donald Trump have only helped him politically and number five will probably be the same. We'd been through the data so many times but it does bear repeating today. Survey after survey show that Donald Trump's numbers have risen with each of his four indictments and the first GOP debate which he skipped changed nothing as to his hold on the party. Look more deeply at the polls and you find the reason why. Republicans largely share Trump's opinion that the indictments are political. One recent example The Wall Street Journal earlier this week found that Trump is the first choice of 59 percent of Republican primary voters. That's up 11 percent since April. His lead over his closest competitor Ron DeSantis, just keeps rising. DeSantis is at 13 percent nationally barely ahead of the rest of the field at this point. Why is Trump so strong despite being indicted four times? Because Republicans largely agree with His claims of election fraud. That same Wall Street Journal story points out this, \"Asked about the indictments of Trump, more than 60 percent of Republican primary voters said each was politically motivated and without merit. Some 78 percent said Trump's actions after the 2020 election were legitimate efforts to ensure an accurate vote. About half or 48 percent said the indictments made them more likely to vote for Trump in 2024.\" And a new poll from CNN has found that 71 percent of Republicans say Biden didn't legitimately win enough votes for the presidency. These views have held for quite some time. A May poll from Reuters Ipsos found that 25 percent of Americans blame Trump's loss to Biden on illegal voting. And yet that same poll found 54 percent of Republicans think the January 6 Day was the work of violent left wing protesters trying to make Trump look bad. Some more data, in Georgia, the only state to bring an election related prosecution against Trump, where the former president is being charged with election interference under the state's RICO laws, a majority of likely Republican primary voters, they agree with him. This from the Atlanta Journal Constitution and the University of Georgia when asked, do you believe there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election? Sixty-one percent say yes. In that same poll, Georgia, likely Republican primary voters were asked, if they think politics played a role to indict Trump in that decision in the Peach State, 84 percent said yes, politics played a big roll. Now two updates. First, an academic conversation has been building as to whether Donald Trump is barred from running under a constitutional clause that prohibits those who engaged in an insurrection or rebellion against the Constitution from holding higher office? To law professors spent a year looking at the issue and are opining in a forthcoming 126 page law review article at the University of Pennsylvania that the preclusion does apply. You might remember that Ned Foley, a constitutional scholar at the Ohio State University was recently my guest here making that case. There is, however, a difference of opinion among academics. Among the impediments to the applicability is the question of whether it would apply to a former president and the lack of any judicial finding that Trump has engaged in insurrection. In fact, among the 91 counts that Trump faces, none are for insurrection or sedition. He was impeached a second time by the House of Representatives for incitement of insurrection, but he was later acquitted by the Senate. There are also constitutional issues about denying a candidate ballot access and about denying voters their say, ultimately such a case might reach the Supreme Court. But guess who believes the 14th Amendment should not be applied? Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia Secretary of States, yes, the recipient of what Trump calls a perfect phone call as in this.

      "sentences": "That call was largely the predicate for the prosecution of Trump in Georgia. And yet, writing for The Wall Street Journal this week, Raffensperger argued the following, \"Mr. Trump might win the nomination and general election. Or he could lose. The outcomes should be determined by the people who show up to make their preference known in primaries, including Georgia's on March 12 and the general election on November 5. A process that denies voters their chance to be the deciding factor in the nomination and election process would erode the belief in our uniquely American representative democracy.\"Meanwhile, this week in Colorado, a progressive group filed a lawsuit to bar Trump from appearing on that state's primary ballot. The complaint was filed on behalf of six Republican and unaffiliated voters by a group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The Colorado Secretary of State responded that she welcomed the guidance that the litigation would bring. In most states, the Secretary of State is the chief election official who can decide if a candidate is qualified to run for president in their state. Now, Colorado isn't the only state where there are active or potential steps to have Trump barred from running for office. Trump's lawyers responded yesterday requesting that a judge move the lawsuit to federal court because it cites a federal law, namely the 14th amendment. So, for prosecutions underway that have been to Trump's political benefit, at least in the short term, now a new challenge looms, which might have the same impact. I want to know what you think go to my website at smerconish.com this hour and vote on this week's poll question, will the lawsuit to bar Trump from the Colorado ballot under the 14th Amendment help or hurt him politically? My next guest is the Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, who also chairs the democratic association of Secretaries of State, she has been a sharp critic of former Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Thank you so much for being here. So, as I referenced, Brad Raffensperger, he has your job in Georgia. He said it would be essentially un-American to remove Trump this way from the ballot. Do you agree with him?",

Section three of the 14th Amendment clearly lays out that if someone swears to uphold the Constitution and then later engages in insurrection or rebellion or aid or comfort to the enemies of the Constitution, they cannot serve in office. You know, this amendment has been applied before, namely, during reconstruction when hundreds of former confederate soldiers and office holders were removed. So there are some big questions. For example, does the amendment bar someone who would be disqualified under it from running for office or just being seated in office?Who gets to make that decision? There's also questions about how to consider such disqualification under state law. So I am a big proponent of this needs to go and be decided by courts. And that's exactly what is happening in the state of Colorado. I hope this litigation gives guidance to myself but also other secretaries of state across the nation.",

They're told that something works, end of the story. That's not science. What science is about is likely or unlikely to work or we can't find any evidence of it. So, the problem now is communication.",

And herein lies the confusion with the editor in chief. Put this on the screen.Karla Soares-Weiser, the editor in chief of the Cochrane Library says -- quote -- \"Many commentators have claimed that a recently updated Cochrane Review shows that masks don't work, which is an inaccurate and misleading interpretation. It would be accurate to say that the review examined whether interventions to promote mask wearing helped to slow the spread of respiratory viruses, and that the results were inconclusive.\" Do you disagree with her statement? JEFFERSON: Dr. Soares-Weiser appears to be apologizing for the misconceptions and misquotes of third parties which is extraordinary. If I had a pound or a dollar for every time I've been misquoted, I'd be in the Bahamas. I wouldn't be speaking to you. Sunning myself in my huge villa. Being misquoted and misunderstood, unfortunately, and being also in a political forum like this which is not my natural habitat, I don't -- you know, this has become political. You see, the first four iterations -- the first three iterations of the review went completely unremarked. Apart from the 2020 -- the 2020 update and the 2023 updates, they started getting attention simply because masks have become political. So, this is a political menu. I can only tell you what the science is -- reliable science shows with all its limits, what I've just told you. I can't make up stuff.",

You just described it.The Cochrane hierarchy has done other things that we will -- in the public (INAUDIBLE) trust the evidence and systematically undermine both the 2020 and the 2023 work. All 12 of us. So, that's my final word. Now, if your viewers are so interested in finding an answer, they should put pressure on those in power to conduct good quality trials, good quality studies to find an answer and to diminish, decrease the uncertainty that I just described.",

Today, day 10 of the manhunt for Danelo Cavalcante, convicted last month of first-degree murder in the 2021 killing of his ex-girlfriend, stabbing her nearly 40 times in front of her children. Cavalcante who is 34 was sentenced to life but before his transfer to state prison on August 31st at about 9Neither the tower guard overlooking the prisoners nor the person tasked with monitoring the facility's cameras saw the escape as it happened. The tower guard, an 18-year veteran, he was fired yesterday. By Friday, nearly 400 local state and federal officers were scouring an eight square mile stretch of woods near an area called Longwood Gardens, where Cavalcante was seen around noon on Thursday, one of the eight or nine reported sightings that were deemed credible by authorities. You're about to hear a one-of-a-kind tale about one such sighting last Friday evening about a mile and a half from the county prison. Ryan Drummond joins me now. Ryan, thank you for being here. Paint the picture. It's last Friday night. It's close to midnight. You're home. You're in bed. Wife is in bed. Kids are in bed. What happened?",

And we were locking up the house, because we knew that there was a prisoner on the loose. And we have this old French door that was off the side of our deck. And I really struggled to get it locked. And my daughter was very concerned.I said, don't worry. He's probably nowhere near here. And, of course, why would he ever come to this door? So, we end up going to sleep. I hear a noise at around 11:30. I walked out of the bedroom. And from my bedroom, I can look down so -- look down towards the living room and the kitchen is off to the side. And I thought I heard a noise. I went back to my wife and I said, hey, I don't want to freak you out but I think there might be somebody downstairs, grab your phone. I went back out. I saw that the door was slightly ajar. That's when my stomach dropped. I ran down the hallway to make sure all my kids were accounted for. And when I came back, I could start to hear, you know, a little bit of shuffling. So, I grabbed any kind of weapon that I could and ironically the only thing that I had there was a picture frame of my wife -- a picture frame of my wife and kids. And when I grabbed it, I did like a frisbee motion. I should go over the head and -- in that moment, I realized how ridiculous this is. Here we have this a guy who is a murderer surrounded by steak knives, because we did have steak that night. And I looked to my left and saw the light switch and decided to flick the light switch on and off, three or four times. There was a little bit of a pause. And then he flicked the light switch back at me from the kitchen. So, that was kind of the acute moment of terror. I turn to my wife. I said, he's downstairs, call 911 right now. And at that point, there was a little bit of a pause. And you know, I wasn't sure if he was going to come up the steps. In which I would -- you know, have to go down and there would be a confrontation. And in that moment, I saw him walk out of the kitchen into the living room, not even running, just kind of walking methodically. He had a white shirt, white bag, white hat and he went out that French door. And by that time, I was on phone with the police and they arrived moments later.",
