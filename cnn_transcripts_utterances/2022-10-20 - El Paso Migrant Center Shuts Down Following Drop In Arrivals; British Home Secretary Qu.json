It turns out he had two handguns, a shotgun, and unregistered ammunition, all banned on the U.S. Capitol grounds. Payne claimed he was there to deliver documents. A man and a woman inside the vehicle were questioned by police but not charged. There's been a significant drop in the number of asylum seekers pouring through the border town of El Paso, Texas -- so much so the city has decided to shut down its migrant center. Some officials credit the governor's controversial shipping of asylum seekers to cities like New York; others attribute the decline to the Biden administration's Return to Mexico policy. Stefano Pozzebon has more from Bogota, Colombia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The measure allows U.S. Border Patrol to deport back into Mexico undocumented migrants that are found on U.S. soil on public health ground.But these migrants who are traveling from South America through Mexico trying to reach the U.S. southern border are saying that their lives are now in limbo as their plans to relocate to the United States have been broken by this new policy. Some of them are thinking of remaining in Mexico where already, 77,000 Venezuelans live and work every day, according to the Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard. In the Mexican cities along the U.S. southern border, such as Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez, and Matamoros, as well as cities in the southern state of Chiapas -- have seen the largest movement of migrants in recent days.

Even her new home secretary suggested not long ago that Liz Truss has an Everest to climb in order to save her own job. She just cannot seem to catch a break.Yesterday, as you mentioned, her home secretary resigned. This is one of the most senior positions in the cabinet. And ostensibly, this was over a rather administrative error, but she took some pretty heavy swipes at the government on her way out, criticizing its commitments to its own policies and then taking a -- I wouldn't even call a thinly-veiled swipe. She -- this was some grade-A trolling in her resignation letter. I'll read you part of it. It said, \"The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven't made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can't see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics. I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility, I resign.\" Even after that, though, Christine, there was even more chaos, this time in Parliament over a vote that the government had told its MPs to vote against or risk being booted from their own party. Opposition lawmakers say that in the voting lobbies, lawmakers go to a separate lobby to vote for or against bills. And in the voting no lobby, opposition lawmakers say that they witnessed conservative MPs shouting, bullying -- even physically manhandling their colleagues to get them to vote with the government. Ultimately, they did manage to vote down that legislation. But this is what one conservative MP, who has already been critical of Liz Truss, had to say about the whole affair afterwards.

And if we are playing these political games and trying to potentially boot our own leader, it doesn't look like we're actually looking out for people's interest.

But for the most part, our leaders often have little to do with these price changes. Will President Biden's move keep prices down or at least keep them from rising? We just don't know.We do know a big factor in the recent price surge was refineries shutting down. An explosion shut down a refinery near Toledo, Ohio last month. Other refineries closed for regular maintenance. Now, a number of west coast refineries are back online, triggering a plunge in gas prices west of the Rocky Mountains and driving down the national average. All right, now to stock markets around the world. Asian markets lower as Chinese stocks hit multi-year lows. Investors concerned about China's rising COVID cases and the gloomy economic outlook there. On Wall Street, stock index futures, right now, are narrowly mixed.

A third ALC -- a showdown in the last six years.But after a decisive fifth game against Cleveland on Tuesday night, the Yankees didn't arrive in Houston until early yesterday morning. They had to start the series that same day, so you thought it was going to be tough. I mean, that's a really difficult task no matter who you are facing, but especially when it's Cy Young Award-winner Justin Verlander, the favorite to do it again. The 39-year-old striking out 11 over six innings, and his offense took over from there. Yuli Gurriel lining one into the Crawford Boxes in left, giving Houston the 2-1 lead. And then a batter later, it was Chas McCormick who went the other way for the solo shot. So the Astros win it 4-2. They are now 4-0 in this year's playoffs. No rest for the weary. Game two is tonight. And for the first time ever, a pitcher had to go up against his brother in a playoff game. How about this? Aaron Nola throwing to his brother Austin and Austin getting the better of his younger brother this time around, lining an RBI single to right-center. That was the start of a 5-run rally by the Padres in the fifth. Brandon Drury putting the Padres ahead for good with a 2-run single to center. San Diego rallies for the 8-5 win. They even the series at one. And game three is in Philly tomorrow night. In the NBA now, the Suns welcomed the Mavs to Phoenix, who blew them out in game seven of the playoffs by 33 only five months ago. Dallas led this one by 22, but Phoenix came storming back. Damion Lee driving, pulling up a tough fall-away jumper, getting it to go. And then, the Suns' lead was cut by two. Luka Doncic had one last chance for this -- a long three that would come up just short. The Suns win it by two. It's the team's 10th-straight regular-season win over Dallas. Zion Williamson back with the Pelicans after missing all of last season with a broken foot, and looked stronger than ever. Huge post move to get the layout and the foul. That's what you want to see. In the fourth quarter, he would get a nice little feed and throw down the jam. Twenty-five points and nine rebounds for him as the Pelicans go into Brooklyn. They route the Nets 130-108. A rough debut for Ben Simmons and these Nets. They just cannot get it together. Four points and five rebounds before fouling out in the fourth. We have a big double-header tonight on our sister network TNT. It's the Bucks and Sixers at 7:30 eastern, followed by the battle of L.A. between the Lakers and the Clippers.
