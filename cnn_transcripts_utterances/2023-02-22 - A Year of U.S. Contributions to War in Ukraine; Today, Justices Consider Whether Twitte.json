So, here we go. This is what we have provided up to this point. Over the last year, the U.S. has sent nearly 30 billion in aid to Ukraine. To put that in perspective, Walmart's revenue in 2022 was $573 billion. This is what is included in that. Included in the aid, over 100 million in artillery rounds, also 56,000 missiles and rockets and drones, over 2,500 of them, plus, there is what the U.S. will provide Ukraine in the coming weeks and months, okay? This is what we're going to provide them in the coming weeks and months. Ukraine is set to receive the Patriot missile defense system, which the U.S. agreed to send late last year. Like a lot of military equipment we're talking about, it is something that President Zelensky pleaded for, for months, and just last month, okay? President Biden's pledge to Ukraine expanded to include Abrams tanks, a move that added the U.S. to a list of allies donating tanks to the war effort. Now, take a look at the battlefield equipment delivered are pledged to Ukraine. I remember at the start of the war talking with CNN military analysts about what was needed. They needed those Howitzers on the ground. Those are like cannons. Like I said, massive tanks are now on the way, all of this is necessary to keep Ukraine in the fight. Kaitlan?",

Think back to last October when a week-long Russian barrage destroyed nearly a third of Ukraine's power station plunging millions of Ukrainians into the darkness right ahead winter. Back in Washington, that was a game-changer. I am told by a senior administration official that President Biden was outraged by Russia's deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure. He was concerned that Ukraine's air defenses would be spread too thin. And, therefore, he directed the Pentagon to look for a way to get a patriot missile defense system, the U.S.'s most advanced defense system, to Ukraine. And until that point, U.S. officials had called that Patriot defense system too complex and too scarce to provide it but all of that changed with the president's directive following those Russian attacks.",

Ukraine has really been fighting this high-expenditure artillery-based warfare. The U.S. officials are now trying to get Ukraine to start shifting to a more maneuver modern warfare style that would use less artillery ammunition, for example, and also U.S. officials believe gives them a tactical advantage. And, of course, there is the question of what is it next for the United States? We have seen them already go back on the Patriot system, we've seen them go back on tanks and decided to provide those. Now, Ukrainian officials, of course, are trying to get F-16s, for example. We'll see if that next or perhaps the HIMARS, that long-range missile system which Ukrainian officials have been asking for.
