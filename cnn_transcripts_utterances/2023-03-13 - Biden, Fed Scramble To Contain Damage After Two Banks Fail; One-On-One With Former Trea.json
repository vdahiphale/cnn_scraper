There's obviously the policy component, we saw dramatic emergency authorities rolled out on Sunday night and Treasury officials and bank regulators have been watching the effect of those efforts throughout the course of this day, on the phone constantly with regulators in these financial institutions, with bank CEOs as well, trying to ensure that they are having the desired effect.And well, Christine pointed out, those regional banks are getting hammered in the equity markets. Behind the scenes, I'm told that we're seeing some positive signs as it relates to deposits. Obviously, depositors and the risks that they face were a critical concern here mostly on the rationale of panic. They were concerned that there would be significant and dramatic depositary outflows from some of these banks. They have seen those outflows start to slow, which they view as a positive signal. The other key element here is access to credit, ensuring that these banks can stay liquid, even if they're getting hit by the market long enough to maintain some level of durability and sustainability going forward. They've seen some of that as well tied to the Federal Reserve's credit lending facility. So some positive signs going forward on that front. The other obviously, is messaging. The President making very clear that he wanted to reassure individuals, reassure small businesses, trying to make clear what his regulators and finance officials are saying that the market on the whole is stable and well capitalized. They need that to be believed, obviously, to ensure there's no panic that carries out further,",

They're going to have to make some difficult judgments, no question, but that events like this are likely to mean that the banking system is a bit less forthcoming with new loans and that is a kind of monetary tightening. And because that's happening, the Fed may need to tighten less than it otherwise would have. But I certainly think the Fed needs to stay focused on the inflation challenge that is really what the American people have said, is what they see as our principal economic challenge.

Then saying that he doesn't believe history will hold Trump accountable was very notable. Taking that stance, going that far as to say about how Trump's words endangered Pence, endangered everybody who was at the Capitol. Pence was also really critical of FOX News, which I thought was remarkable because we have not seen him -- I mean, he is going after one of the biggest hosts on FOX and saying that the way that they portrayed what happened on January 6th with that 40,000 hours of footage that they reviewed, he said was -- it mocks decency to portray it that way, because it wasn't just sightseeing, it wasn't just tourism. Trump has been unhappy with that, and so today on the plane to Iowa where he is speaking now, he was saying that, because Pence didn't do what he wanted, that day, actually, he is responsible for the violence that happened. That is the exact same argument that John Eastman, who was that attorney at the time of January 6th in and out of the Oval Office, e-mailed to Pence's attorney that day, his counsel, Greg Jacob, he e-mailed and said actually --",

He is fighting a subpoena from the DOJ to come and testify at the Special Counsel's investigation into January6th. He did not go testify before the January 6th Committee. He did write about January 6th and the conversations in his book.   I think, a lot of this has to do with political timing, I mean, the 2024 field is shaping up and what Pence has done by going out this far to say that Trump will be held accountable that day is every other 2024 candidate is going to get asked about this now and if they agree or where their stance is and so he's kind of, you know, setting a standard there.",

They also include works by Judy Blume, James Patterson, and my next guest, Jody Picoult.

Jody Picoult joins me now for her first TV interview on the subject. Her most recent book is \"Mad Honey\". Jodi, thank you so much for being with us. Can you just explain your understanding of why some of your books have been taken off the shelves? I mean, how does that actually happen? JODI PICOULT, NUMBER 1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR: So in Martin County School District, you do not actually have to read the books to challenge them. And you do not even have to say what is objectionable in a book to have it removed from a shelf. And this is actually true in a lot of Florida. So it's worth saying that although 20 of my books happened to be removed this time, this is happening all over Florida and the rest of the country. And most of the people who are affected as authors are BIPOC, and LGBTQ authors. From what I understand, the objection to my books is that they were classified by this one parent as adult romance, which is very interesting, because I do not write adult romance. And, in fact, of the books that were challenged, one of them is a book called \"The Storyteller,\" which is about the Holocaust, and about the rise of fascism among ordinary Germans. And there's not even a kiss in that book. So I was confused. And, you know, it just felt a little ironic, actually, that that was one of the books banned here.",
