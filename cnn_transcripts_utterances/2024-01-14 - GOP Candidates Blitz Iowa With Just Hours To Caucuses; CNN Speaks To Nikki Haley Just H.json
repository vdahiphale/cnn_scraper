Now Republican candidates are out in temperatures well below zero, but they are still fighting to try to get everybody to turn out and vote in Iowa. You're looking at live pictures right now of Nikki Haley's rally on election eve, and she is not alone. Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy also holding events tonight. Their supporters are there, too, despite the dangerous conditions. And that's because of course the stakes could not be higher. There is so much on the line in this unprecedented election campaign season that we are now finally in the midst of. Haley and DeSantis are desperately trying to close the gap with Trump, who just wrapped up his rally in these final hours. And, you know, as I say, it's unprecedented. But there is still some sense of history here. And in past elections, Iowa always ends up being about turnout. Trump, for one, has experienced that, and knows it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You can't sit home. If you're sick as a dog, you say, darling, I got to. Even if you vote and then pass away, it's worth it. (END VIDEO CLIP) BURNETT: I want to make sure to get that one in there tonight. All right. We're going bring you the candidates' closing pitches and break down the factors that could help propel someone towards the White House and send some others, well, ending their hopes. Jeff Zeleny begins our coverage tonight. OUTFRONT live in Des Moines. So, Jeff, it's freezing, and it can be very dangerous in many places where people may have to caucus.

We talked about where he is overall. But the enthusiasm gap is -- cross tab important. He has an 88 percent very high enthusiasm rating with the voters. Nikki Haley is down to like 40. So it just goes to show he has people that are more energized and enthusiastic about getting out there to vote for him. So that bodes well for him.

And that's key to Donald Trump.Let's go back to what you've been discussing with your panel and Kristen just there for a second and show this poll. Excuse me for turning my back. I just want to stretch this out. Yes, yes, Ted Cruz came back, he was running behind and he won last time against Donald Trump. He was not leading in the last poll. Yes, Rick Santorum was not leading and then he won in 2012, surpassing Mitt Romney. But the lead was nothing like that. Donald Trump at 48 percent, Nikki Haley at 20, Santorum at 16. So this would be an earth-shattering what if someone beat Donald Trump in Iowa. So largely, it seems to be a fight for second place. But can Trump stay under there? So what do you look for? One of the key things, Erin, and we talked a little bit about this the other night is if you look at here, the deeper the shading, the more evangelicals live in those counties. That's the area Donald Trump split with Ted Cruz back in 2016. That is where the area where Donald Trump, mostly small rural counties, couple hundred people vote there, maybe a thousand people vote there, but if you add them all up, that's how he boosts and offsets any losses in the urban and suburban areas right there. That's the key. That's where Trump wants to run it up. And that's where they are a little bit worried about turnout. Now if you're Nikki Haley and you're looking at this map, what you're thinking about is, can I get into the suburban counties? And can I get people to come out there? I just want to show you right here. The lighter gray counties, the lighter gray counties, around Des Moines and Ames, around Sioux City, around Cedar Falls, your traditional suburbs. These are not big cities like New York, not big cities like Philadelphia, but those are your urban areas. A lot of new people in those suburbs. That is the key. If we're going to see Nikki Haley pull off any kind of a surprise, it will be there.

Do you want to get in the car, risk a flat tire, risk something happening to you if you're older, if you have to drive 15, 20, maybe 30 minutes or more to your polling place.So they are a little bit nervous like that. It brings up this interesting point here, too. They've been very, very confident to the end. Look at the ad spending here. Again, I have to turn my back just so I can stretch this out so people can see it. Haley's campaign and pro-Haley super PACs have spent about $8 million since the beginning of the year, January. DeSantis a little more than $6 million. That's the DeSantis campaign and super PACs that support him. Pro-Trump has spent much less money because they entered the new year very confident. And you have to schedule that TV time a long time ago. So one of the reasons he's there or one of the reasons he's saying come out and vote even if you're sick, is that they were so confident they have not spent as much money on television. That is a big debate about whether that works as much or not. But the reason he's out there at the last minute, the reason he's saying vote if you're sick, and Erin, the key here is they have those phone numbers, so they're texting these people.

And so they think actually, Trump is the stronger general election candidate. That's what's happening at the grassroots level in Iowa right now.

I mean, DeSantis was indignantly complaining last week that the media says he hasn't made a case against Trump when he has and in fact, he has from the right that you can no longer trust Trump to advance the America First agenda. That is a message that appeals to, I think we're going to see a relatively thin slice of the Republican electorate. It has left a lot of room for Nikki Haley in the center among the voters who are most disaffected from Trump, but she too, you know, is kind of facing the reality that unless she and expand beyond what she's likely to see tomorrow and quickly you know, her runway could run out pretty quickly as well.",

But look, she is consulting that part of the party.I think that you know, you can lose sight of the big picture. Like Haley and DeSantis focusing on who comes in second, Trump is way ahead, one of them has to make a stronger argument than they've done so far to change that dynamic.",
