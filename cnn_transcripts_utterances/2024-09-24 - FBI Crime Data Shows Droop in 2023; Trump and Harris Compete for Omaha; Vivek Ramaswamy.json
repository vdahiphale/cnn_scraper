According to the bureau, violent crime dropped approximately 3 percent in 2023. The data also shows murder and non-negligent manslaughter dropped in the United States nearly 12 percent from 2022 to 2023, which represents the largest decline in decades. Reported rapes also dropped by more than 9 percent, and reported hate crimes fell by nearly 1 percent.The Harris campaign put out this statement, \"new data submitted to the FBI confirms that our dedicated efforts and collaborative partnerships with law enforcement are working. Americans are safer now than when we took office.\" Of course, there, Brad Todd, is a lot of argument on the internet about whether these statistics are accurate or not, but 12 percent is a very significant number. And we should note that these statistics, the FBI has been putting them out for many years now, and we all collectively rely on them. Does this help significantly pushed back against, for the Harris team, the Trump argument on crime, or does it not matter in your view?",

The state currently awards electoral votes by congressional district, with one vote going to the winner of Omaha's congressional district. The only other state that does it this way is Maine. Yesterday, a key state senator from Omaha announced he would not support this effort. Omaha's single electoral vote, it really matters because depending on how the battleground states go for Harris and Trump, it could make it all or break it all. Let's look at this map of how it could look on election night. If Harris were to win Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, while Donald Trump were to win the sunbelt. In this scenario, Omaha's single electoral vote would determine whether Harris wins with exactly 270 votes or if we would have been headed to a truly unprecedented scenario, because if Trump were to win that fifth Nebraska vote, the election would result in a true tie, which would, of course, throw the election to the House of Representatives to decide.

Thank you very much for being here. You, in the book, have a chapter, one of your truths is dedicated to border security. You say an open border is not a border. But I want to ask you about that moment in Springfield, Ohio, from someone who has lived there their whole life, and who says they've not experienced this kind of racially motivated animosity from the members of their community before this past week. Is President Trump's rhetoric contributing to what happened to that man? And do you think it's right? VIVEK RAMASWAMY, AUTHOR, \"TRUTHS: THE FUTURE OF AMERICA FIRST\": So, look, the reason I went to Springfield is I wanted to have open dialogue with the citizens of that community close to where I grew up as well. That was important to me. And I want to be precise about what that man said, because I think it was actually really important and insightful. He didn't say it was in the last week. You heard in that clip, he said it was in the last year. And I did - I'll tell you what I told him to his face, which I believe is true, is a big part of the uptick we are seeing in anti-black racism and anti-minority racism, and we are seeing that uptick in the country, and it worries me, is a response to the anti-racist policies that have increased race consciousness in this country over the last several years. I say this - I'm releasing a new book today. I wrote a book about three to four years ago called \"Woke Inc.,\" predicting exactly this trend. And that's my concern with race conscious policies. There is no better way to create racial animus in this country than to take something else of value from somebody else based on the color of their skin. That's a prediction I made in my first book several years ago, and I'm sad to say that it's come to transpire. And that man and I had a great exchange. I also think we need more of that in this country. We had several hundred people come out, about 2,000 people RSVPed for that event in Springfield, which tells me people across this country are hungry to be heard. And that's how we get our country back, through open debate, free speech, and open dialogue. And that's the core thesis of the book that I'm putting out today.",

The truth of the matter is, as recently as three months ago, or even three weeks ago, we, as a country, weren't really talking about the kinds of issues confronting communities like Springfield in Ohio, a town that's really important to me and to the country.

I think it's important to get all perspectives.What I will say is this, I think this debate about immigration is in the long run going to be a good thing for the country. We can't sweep under the rug, in a town of 50,000 people, you had an influx of 20,000 Haitian migrants to a community that was unprepared to actually integrate them. Migrants who were unprepared to integrate themselves. That's a tough conversation, but it's one that we actually need to be having in this country. And we weren't before. It's one of the things I talk about in this book is, how do we actually get to solutions on this issue? People skirt around this issue of legal immigration. I'll tell you what I told those Haitian migrants. It was a tough exchange, but one where we actually came out stronger for it. I said it's my view that if anybody enters this country, the United States generally should not admit somebody who's going to be a client of the welfare state, somebody who's going to be a recipient of government assistance. I don't think the U.S. policy should admit those immigrants, legally or not, into the United States of America. And in that exchange, the people on the other side, they thought about it, they said, you know what, that's a fair policy. That's constructive. And I think that we need to think about immigration (INAUDIBLE).",

When you look at the rates of usage of welfare, Medicaid, et cetera, I think it's a reasonable immigration policy for the U.S. to set that if you're going to come to this country, we want people who are able to speak the English language that's broadly used in the United States, and able to stand independently without relying on government assistance or the welfare state. That's the kind of debate we need to be having. If people believe that we should admit migrants who are going to be reliant on Medicaid or welfare, then they could represent that view. But we haven't been having that debate today. Those are the kinds of issues I explore in my book, focusing on thesubstance rather than in the mudslinging that we sometimes see in the media-driven fueled, social media fueled political discourse. We need to speak about stone-cold hard truths and have that debate, even when it's uncomfortable in the open. That's how I think we're going to save the country. It's a big part of why I wrote this book. And I also think that I'd like to see that standard applied a little more even handedly across the board. In that same debate you had Kamala Harris making the claim, also repeatedly many times since, that women are bleeding out in parking lots when there isn't a shred of evidence of a single woman bleeding out in a parking lot of a hospital.",
