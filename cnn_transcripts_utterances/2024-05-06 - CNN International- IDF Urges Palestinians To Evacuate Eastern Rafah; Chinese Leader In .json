      "sentences": "It has all the hallmarks of a ground offensive, and typically when Israel has launched the previous ground offensives going into Gaza, not long after the -- those horrific October 7 attacks, it took many days before we began to get an idea of the scope and scale of the operation. It was a big operation that Israel was sort of able to keep it pretty much under wraps, remembering journalists like ourselves and other news organizations are not allowed by Israel to go into Gaza to freely report and see what's happening. So, there is a level of difficulty to understand precisely what's happening in and around Rafah at the moment. But, what is clear, these leaflets that the IDF are dropping are verysimilar to leaflets they've dropped prior to other major military operations. They've told Palestinians in about 12 different blocks of housing, that's about 100,000 people, the UN estimates, to leave their houses and go to an expanded safer area. And these leaflets, these flyers that the IDF are dropping, tell the residents there that their area was going to be used as -- is going to be where an offensive is against terrorists, and it says that those terrorists are going to hide among you. It's very clear that when the IDF goes in there, the scenarios could be, it appears, like previous military operations where civilians get caught up in the operations. Now, has the operation, military operation actually begun? It doesn't appear so. But again, we're restricted in what we can see and what we can actually get access to report. So, we know that the negotiations at the moment are sort of stalled. They're not completely broken down. So, is this a last ditch pressure effort by Israel on Hamas to cede to their terms? The gap still remains very big at those talks. So, what the UN is describing now in and around the area of Rafah where people are being told to go to these areas where there isn't enough food, isn't enough water, isn't enough sanitation, not the right conditions for them to go and live, and as we've seen in other operations, who won't necessarily be safe in these designated humanitarian safer areas. So, the UN is very concerned not just about their welfare, physical, but psychological welfare, and this could precipitate panic, which could mean in an area where there are about 1.5 million people living, that could be pretty dire consequences. And UNICEF is saying about 600,000 children there face a very uncertain time at this moment.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Amara. There is no question that the White House is watching these latest moves from Israel relating to eastern Rafah incredibly closely. It comes as the administration for months now has warned about a potential ground operation in Rafah, with President Biden and others here at the White House stressing to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that they need to ensure there is a plan in place to ensure the safety and evacuation of the more than 1.4 million Palestinians who are in the Rafah area at this time.Now, on Friday, we reported that U.S. and Israeli officials had been in conversations about Rafah that Israel provided insight into their thinking relating to the evacuation of Rafah. But, sources cautions that what was presented did not appear to be a final plan, that there was no full briefing when it comes to what a military operation would look like. But, the White House certainly has been watching this with quite a bit of concern, as President Biden is also facing domestic pressure here at home relating to the way that Israel has conducted its campaign in Gaza. Now, over the weekend, we also learned that the U.S. paused a shipment of U.S.-made ammunition to Israel. A source familiar with the matter told us that this was not due to this potential operation into Rafah that this would not impact aid going forward. So, big questions about why exactly there was that pause in shipment. Senator Chris Coons, a key member of the Foreign Relations Committee, suggested it could have been logistical issues. But, this is all playing out, as Nic noted, against the backdrop of those hostage and ceasefire negotiations that appear to have stalled out over the weekend. CIA Director Bill Burns was on hand in Cairo, working as a mediator on this issue. He then traveled on to Doha, where he met with the Qatari Prime Minister. He was set to travel to Israel today, but is actually remaining in Doha, as the administration all last week had really been speaking in quite optimistic tones about the prospect of a deal coming together. But, we saw the Israeli and Hamas sides both really blame each other for what they viewed as each other's extreme view. So, this is something that the White House certainly wants to try to get an agreement on. But, at the time, it appears those conversations are stalled out. It doesn't mean that they won't get on track at some point. But also, I would note that today, President Biden here at the White House will be having lunch with Jordan's King Abdullah. Abdullah, of course, is a key player in the region. He has warned and expressed concerns about the way that this operation has been conducted in Gaza, about the humanitarian issues that are on hands there. So, the President might have a chance to hear directly from King Abdullah about his concerns. But, all of this comes as you have big questions about what Israel will be doing going forward when it relates to Rafah, as the U.S. has been trying to stress that they need to take great care to ensure the safety of civilians there.",

The Chinese leader's visit to France, his second state visit there in five years, it also coincides with the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Now, top of the agenda is trade with the EU and of course, as you mentioned, the war in Ukraine, a war now in its third year that China is yet to condemn.On the issue of trade, von der Leyen has called on the EU to de-risk its supply chains away from China and to probe the influx of Chinese electrical vehicles into Europe. Macron is also seeking protection from those cheaper products like EVs. And look, Xi, he has said he wants Chinese companies to invest in France. And there are reports that China will place an order with Airbus for around 50 planes. But, analysts, Amara, say that this visit is more than shoring up trade. It is part of China's strategy to really exploit differences inside Europe and that 27 country bloc. Germany, as we know, has a much softer stance on the EV probe. But, overshadowing this visit, of course, the war in Ukraine. China's support for Russia's wartime economy. Macron and von der Leyen no doubt reiterated calls for China to stop exports to Russia of dual use and other technologies that are propping up Russia's war effort. Look, it's important to note, Amara, that Putin, Vladimir Putin is traveling to Beijing later this month. Macron will hold a bilateral with Xi in the coming hours. They will then hold a joint press conference before a state dinner. And then, after Paris, the two men will travel to the Pyrenees Mountains in the south of the country for some more personal one-on-one time. And then after France, Xi will then travel to Serbia and Hungary. That visit is seemed to be much less contentious, Amara.",

And you hit the nail on the head. She establishes that Donald Trump was aware that Michael Cohen was making these payments, and she was aware that Donald Trump was reimbursing Michael Cohen with Donald Trump's own personal checks or his checks that he signed. That's very devastating.The last point about Hope Hicks is she establishes that crazy timeline after the Access Hollywood tape came out, how they thought that they had hit an iceberg, it was the Titanic, and they thought that they were going down the tubes, and how much fear the campaign had if these stories came out. And last point I want to make is this. The National Enquirer had the right to publish the Stormy Daniels story. That NDA was between Trump and Ms. Daniels. So, that the National Enquirer did not publish it is evidence that there was a conspiracy to protect Donald Trump from negative stories.",

Eventually, the battery in their vehicle died. Water started going into the vehicle.

The prosecution is not required to reveal the order of its witnesses, and they've been holding close to their chest because of fear that Trump or his surrogates may attack these witnesses in public. Friday's court session concluded with dramatic testimony from one of the people closest to Donald Trump during the run up to the 2016 election, his press secretary and close confidant Hope Hicks. With more on that, let's bring in CNN's Brynn Gingras. Hi there, Brynn. You're outside the courthouse. Let's start where the trial left off on Friday with pretty emotional testimony from Hope Hicks. BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. She was very emotional. She didn't want to be there, you could tell. She was there under subpoena. She said she hadn't spoken to her former boss in two years. At one point during her testimony, she actually cried and how to get off the witness stand and take a moment to break because she just was overwhelmed with emotion. But, there was a lot of dramatic testimony. And it's clear that prosecutors are really trying to inch closer with their line-up of people taking the stand to what is at the heart of this case, which is trying to prove that Donald Trump knowingly knew about these hush money payments in 2016 to Stormy Daniels, and he did it to make -- to basically interfere with the election. And Hope Hicks connected a little bit of those dots for the prosecution. She said that when The Wall Street Journal article came out in 2018, so after the election, that discussed the payments to Stormy Daniels, she said that Trump essentially admitted that he knew about that after the fact, and said it was better that they had -- that article had come out then, then closer to the 2020 election. So, that was just a little bit of help there for the prosecution. Another thing that she brought up was how Michael Cohen didn't do really anything without -- in regards to a payment without Trump's blessing, and saying he really wouldn't do something out of the kindness of his own heart. And also for the defense, though, they also had some moments with her as well. It was clear that they were going to continue attacking Michael Cohen, who we know is supposed to be one of the star witnesses here for the prosecution. Hope Hicks talked about how he would go rogue on the campaign and sort of insert himself. It was more frustrating than anything as a person to the Trump campaign in 2016. And also, she talked about Trump being a family man and kind of bringing up this notion that it's possible the former President didn't want anyone to know about any payments or anything because he didn't want his family to be embarrassed, and it had nothing to do with the election. So, there were some sort of points scored, if you will, on both sides when it came to Hope Hicks, but she was certainly one of the most key people to take the stand thus far for the prosecution. And like you said, Amara, we are not sure who is coming up next. Obviously, there are some big names that are on the roster. They're Stormy Daniels, Karen McDougal, Michael Cohen, of course. So, we'll have to see once court picks up at 9:30 today.",

She claims that she wants to put Republican members on the record, and she wants to prove that if Johnson is able to continue winning the majority in the November elections, that he won't have the support that he needs to be the Speaker again, Thomas Massie put it in his words, is really displaying that Johnson would be a lame duck Speaker in the months ahead. But, as you noted, we know how this is expected to end. Democrats aregoing to help table this motion to vacate, essentially killing it. Putting it to the side. But, the question becomes then, what does this mean for Johnson's future? He has already worked with Democrats on a couple of key issues, and that is part of the reason that so many Democrats feel this goodwill toward the Speaker, despite the fact that they really do disagree on many key issues, and that they are on opposite sides going into this November election. But, he helped support government funding so that the government didn't shut down. He also finally pushed through additional funding for Ukraine, something that Democrats had been pushing him toward and some Republicans in the Senate for months. So, there is some goodwill here for Speaker Johnson among Democrats. I think another key question is going to be, does Marjorie Taylor Greene continue to try to oust the Speaker? Does she bring this motion to vacate forward, not just this week, but perhaps in the future? She has not ruled out doing that. And Democrats haven't said what they would do if there are multiple episodes of this in the weeks ahead. Meanwhile, this is obviously dividing the Republican Party. There is just a small number of members that we expect would support this. Right now, there are only three Republicans who have publicly said that they will back this motion to vacate, including Marjorie Taylor Greene. So, there becomes sort of this bigger intra-party fight that is brewing right now heading into the election, as Republicans who are opposed to this say that all Marjorie Taylor Greene is doing is really sowing more chaos, when they should be unifying to try to take back the Senate going into November.",

It's not as though we haven't seen a Speaker's fight before. Remember, Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted just a few months ago, and it took three weeks to get a new Speaker. And in that time, the October 7 attack happened, and Congress was unable to do anything, because without a Speaker, they can't legislate. They can't pass any new laws. They can't even pass a resolution vowing support for Israel in the wake of that October 7 attack because they had no Speaker.I think there is concern about in an era of geopolitical uncertainty casting Congress back into that place.

      "sentences": "There are multiple videos circulating online showing the protests at the University of Mississippi and Oxford. But, there is one video in particular that has gone viral and is at the center of the controversy. Before I show you the video, we need to warn our viewers that it may be offensive to many people.(VIDEO PLAYING) As you can see, the video shows a group of mostly young white men in the counter-protests yelling out a black woman. At least one counter- protester is seen on video and appears to be making gestures at the woman. We now know who the woman in the video is. Her name is Jalen R. Smith, and she is 24-years-old. She confirmed to my colleague Dianne Gallagher that she is the woman seen in the video. Smith said that during the protest, pro-Palestinian demonstrators were kept in an enclosure which police said was for their safety. She also said that she briefly stepped out of the enclosure to go live on social media and that's when the confrontation took place. CNN has made efforts but has not identified any of the counter-protesters seen in the video. We have also learned that the University of Mississippi has opened an investigation into student conduct but they didn't say who or what they were specifically investigating. In the letter, Chancellor Glenn Boyce says university officials are aware that some statements were made that were offensive, hurtful and unacceptable, including actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones. Smith tells CNN she said some insults back to the counter-protesters but adds the following quote, \"People calling me fat or Lizzo - didn't hurt my feelings because I know what I am. I am so confident in my Blackness. I am so confident in my size, in the way that I wear my hair, and who I am. They do not bother me. If anything, I feel pity for them for how stupidly they acted.\" The controversy took another turn when U.S. Representative Mike Collins, a Republican representing parts of Georgia, shared the viral video on X the following day, saying Ole Miss taking care of business. CNN has reached out to Collins' office but there hasn't been an answer so far. And then on Saturday, Congressman Collins tweet prompted the NAACP to send a letter to congressional leadership asking for an investigation into Collins' conduct. In part, the letter says the following. \"These actions conducted by a member of the House of Representatives, regardless of intent, legitimize and propagate racism and undermine the principles of equality and justice that our government is sworn to uphold.\" Some of our viewers may remember that the University of Mississippi has a long history of racial incidents, including the deadly riots that broke out there in 1962 when James Meredith became the first black student to enrol at the school.

      "sentences": "So, the real reason that Pearl was at this sanctuary was because she was burned as a young Joey in the 2020 Black Summer fires. These were horrific forest fires across long stretches of Australia. And on that particular island where I was, Kangaroo Island, half of the island was burned down. More than half of the koala population was killed. And this one koala, fortunately, survived. What I saw in Australia was that this country, this continent is very much on the frontlines of climate change, where scientist residents are saying that the cycle of fires and floods are getting more unpredictable and more extreme.On top of that, I got a good look with my team at the Great Barrier Reef, this sprawling marine habitat that's the size of Italy, where we saw the beginnings of a mass bleaching event that was later confirmed by the Australian government, where record-high ocean temperatures are quite literally cooking coral and killing it. It's part of a planet- wide phenomenon that's been witnessed over the course of the last year. So, all of these changes that are impacting Australia are not only devastating natural habitats, but they're also impacting cities and towns and even prompting some Australians to consider leaving some of these more vulnerable communities.
