      "sentences": "It's Memorial Day weekend and everybody's getting in the poll. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.Why are so many Republican candidates now challenging Donald Trump for the GOP presidential nomination? Think about it. He's a former president, essentially a GOP incumbent who's consistently polling around 50 percent of the GOP vote in the polls. And we learned in 2016 that given the hardcore support that Trump enjoys from some, he's the beneficiary of a large field. Remember, in that cycle, there were so many running that debates they had a kid's table. This time Trump announced first, and then Nikki Haley, and then Vivek Ramaswamy, Larry elder, Asa Hutchinson, Tim Scott, and now Ron DeSantis, who by the way is only 44 years old. By Biden Trump's standards, he's got three more decades to run for president. So why run now? Why get into the steel cage with a wrestler who always carries a foreign object? Mike Pence said he'll soon make a decision. Chris Christie sure sounds like a candidate, Sununu might get in, even Glen Youngkin, according to Axios is taking a second look. So what's going on? Maybe that they don't think they'll have to be Trump, that that work will be done by a combination of Alvin Bragg, Fani Willis, Jack Smith, and Merrick Garland. This week, Trump appeared remotely in a Manhattan courtroom in connection with the Stormy Daniels case. Judge Juan Merchan told the party's not to make any plans around the scheduled start of trial March 25, 2024. Trump reportedly reacted by shaking his head. There's still jockeying going on regarding the caucus and primary schedule for next year. But take a look at 2016, that was the last time that we had a competitive Republican process. Look at that as a guide. In that cycle, Iowa held its caucus on February 1, New Hampshire voted on February 9, then came South Carolina and Nevada. Super Tuesday was March one. There were six more election days in March. And then in April, came Wisconsin, New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Indiana. And in May, Nebraska, West Virginia, Oregon and Washington state. In the thick of that schedule, Donald Trump will spend a week or two sitting in a Manhattan courtroom facing criminal prosecution. And even without cameras in New York courtrooms, his comings and goings will all be noted. Sketch artists will have a field day, it's going to be OJ on steroids. And that's not all, last month, Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis sent a letter to the county's Sheriff putting him on notice of charging decisions that she'll announce in connection with her investigation of Georgia's 2020 election. And she wrote these words, \"I'm providing this letter to bring to your attention the need for heightened security and preparedness in the coming months.\" She noted her timetable was between July 11 and September 1, that granted there are more individuals than just Donald Trump whose conduct is being investigated in Georgia. But would any of the others warrant notification of the sheriff of the possibility of unrest? I doubt it. Instead, I think she tipped her hand that she intends to indict him. And then their special counsel Jack Smith appointed by Merrick Garland, The Wall Street Journal was the first to report this week that Smith has all but finished his work. They reported quote, \"In recent weeks, prosecutors working for Smith have completed interviews with nearly every employee at Trump's Florida home. From top political aides to maids and maintenance staff.\" The Journal couldn't determine whether Smith has decided to charge Trump. But earlier this week, Trump's lawyers sought a meeting with Merrick Garland. Common sense suggests that there's no need for a meeting unless Trump's lawyers think he's about to be indicted. And now \"The Washington Post\" reports that two of the former president's employees moved boxes of papers from within his Mar-a-Lago home a day before FBI agents and a Justice Department official arrived to pick up classified documents. So, there's a serious prospect of the former president soon facing criminal charges in three different jurisdictions and in the thick of the campaign. Some will suggest that this is all to Trump's benefit. According to his campaign, he benefited financially after Alvin Bragg charged him in the Stormy Daniels case, raising $15.4 million in two weeks, and his polls went up. I think because at its root, that's a case about sex. And in the 1990s, we learned that Americans don't see that as warranting a presidential downfall. But what additional prosecutions have the same impact? Would some finally have had enough of the reality show? I can think have several in the latter camp their names are Haley, Ramaswamy, Hutchinson, Elder, Scott, DeSantis, maybe Pence, Christie, Sununu and Youngkin, too. And if they're right, and Trump isn't the candidate does, that put more pressure on President Biden to step aside where in the face of polling showing that even Democrats want a change in their ticket, his retort is to suggest that he alone can defeat Donald Trump. Bottom line, none of us have any idea what's about to unfold, but it's going to be riveting. [15:05:35] Joining me now is Elie Honig, the former federal prosecutor and author of the recent book \"Untouchable, How Powerful People Get Away With It.\" Elie, I want to go through the three buckets Manhattan, Georgia, the feds. Relative to Manhattan March 25, is that a firm date? Will it really happen? And does he need to be in the courtroom? ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF N.Y.: So Michael, I would say that's a semi firm date. Usually when a judge sets a trial date in a criminal case, you would write it in your date book in pencil things happen. Defendants often ask for more time. Prosecutors sometimes find new evidence and say we need more time. But this judge, Judge Merchan, made a point this week of telling the parties put this date down, do not schedule anything around it, be ready to go to trial. But I do want to highlight there is a possibility Trump may go to the federal courts and say, you need to push this date back because as you said, Michael, this is going to fall right in the middle of the Republican primaries. And Trump's going to argue I'm a candidate for federal office, I have a First Amendment right to free speech to run for office, and to take me out for several weeks where I have to sit in a courtroom is going to interfere with that right. So, I think that trial is conspicuously timed. And I think there's a chance Trump may try to get it changed.",

And here are the theories, the other crime appears to be interference with the Federal Election of federal campaign violation. But we're in state court, so that's the novelty here, that could be challenged before trial. And if it goes to trial, he's convicted, Trump will appeal on that basis.And one important thing to keep in mind here, Michael, even if this trial goes off in March, and I think it will carry certainly into April, Trump is not going to be sentenced for several months after that. And even if he is sentenced to prison, which I think is unlikely, given the nature of the charges here and given the way New York State law works, even if he's convicted, he's not going to get sentenced to prison in all likelihood. And even then, even if he's sentenced to prison, he's not going to actually have to start serving his sentence until after his appeals are done, which certainly will carry way beyond the November 2024 election.",

Elie, final thought then, little game theory here, it sounds like it's possible that the only case that could get to trial if, big if, there are actually three cases is the Alvin Bragg Stormy Daniel's case where we've seen in the last couple of months, it's arguably to the benefit of Donald Trump. Theoretically, Trump could get a trial date in the midst of the primary season and regardless of the outcome have some wind at his sails. And the other two cases don't get resolved until after the 2024 election. True?",

This is the world we are living in, Michael, where we could have a leading candidate, perhaps a presumptive nominee for the presidency on criminal trial just a few months before the actual election. We could have two other pending indictments that are sitting there unresolved without a trial on the date of the election. Then, if Trump wins, or if a Republican wins, we could be looking at the potential for pardons. We could be looking -- there's no way he's going to be tried if he wins, and he goes back into office, he's not going to get tried while he's in office.And if he loses, then the question is, well, are we going to have these trials in 2025 after he's lost two elections now.

Listen to this, according to a new CNN poll, 66 percent of all Americans say a Biden victory would be a setback or even a disaster for the country, 56 percent say the exact same thing about Donald Trump. Which is why a nonpartisan group called No Labels is threading together a safety net for the American electorate in case the vast majority of voters aren't satisfied with a Biden versus Trump rematch if it comes to that.The group aims to gain ballot access across all 50 states and the District of Columbia for a third-party candidacy hoping to appeal to independent voters with a -- quote -- \"unity ticket\" made up of one Democrat and one Republican. So far No Labels has been successful in gaining ballot access in Oregon, Colorado, Arizona and Alaska. Their push now is to get a third-party candidate on the ballot across key battleground states like Florida, North Carolina and Nevada. But the momentum doesn't stop there. The organization has gathered 600,000 signatures and hopes to raise $70 million for their unity ticket by April of 2024. According to their chief strategist, they're about a third from reaching their goal. Nominating a third-party candidate is of course controversial. Critics argue the groundwork No Labels is laying down will only catapult Trump back into the White House.

      "sentences": "So I think there's actually been a lot of hysteria around these bills. When you look at the text of what's actually been enacted, they're really quite moderate, even milquetoast reforms. Basically, letting teenagers maybe work a little bit younger or a little bit longer, but nothing really crazy. And you mentioned increased child labor violations. I think there has been a bit of a bait and switch. So, the majority of these child labor violations actually involve migrant children working illegally in places like commercial farms. These reforms really have nothing to do with that.And importantly, you know, that kind of labor will still be illegal under these reforms. So I think instead of panicking, we should be celebrating because there are so many positive outcomes associated with working as a teenager.",

The one that troubled me the most that I read about -- it was not the booze. It was the hours of working during a school year, up to six hours on a particular day. For me that's too much because I think you've got to prioritize the schoolwork.I wanted to ask you this. Is this really about American kids or about migrant workers?",

A lot of them are self-evident, you know, responsibility, learning to show up on time.Teenagers themselves really like working. They like having their own money. They like not constantly hounding their parents for cash. And, in fact, there has been some research that indicates that teenagers who work part-time actually earn more later in life than those who didn't. There is one study that looked at teenagers that worked part-time during their senior year. And what it founds is that those who worked about six to nine years after graduation were earning 20 percent more than those who didn't. So I think we should really be celebrating and encouraging places that are making it easier for teenagers to get jobs.",

So I think when we're looking at the areas that teenagers like to work in, fast food and food service is a good example, right?So there has been a lot of fearmongering about the laws that are loosening, the age that kids can serve alcohol. A lot of these once they had a bill that was very clear about saying that you can't bartend until you're 18, so mostly this will just like, you know, 14 or 15-year-olds work at a place like an Applebee's, right, that serves alcohol. You know, I think teenagers might fill those positions. You know, if we're looking at places that -- sectors that teenagers don't really want to work in, I don't think that's the solution to the labor shortage. I think the solution to the labor shortage is liberalizing our immigration laws and making it easier to work here if you're not a citizen.",
