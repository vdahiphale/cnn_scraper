At 1:10:30 victim Jerrald Gallion enters the store with his girlfriend. At 1:13:05 one round shot spotter initiates again. At 1:13:10 the suspect shoots a third victim, Jerrald Gallion. At 1:13:12 the suspect chases a witness Elvicia Campbell (ph) through the store, shooting at her, but does not strike her. At 1:13:25, Elvicia. Campbell exits the east door of the store. And at 1:13:37 the suspect shoots out the rear door on the east side of the building. At 1:13:43, a four-round shot spotter initiates. At 1:13:47 the suspect re-enters the building and walks back toward the office. At 1:14:23 the suspect enters the office. At 1:18 the suspect texts his father and says use a screw driver to get into my room. The father enters the room and finds a last will and testament of the suspect along with a suicide note on his laptop. At 1:19:21 the officers entered the building and begin to clear just 11 minutes after this whole ordeal began. Patrol clearing the hallway when the officer hears a single gunshot. We believe that's when he killed himself. At 1:41:03 EWU's security Marcus Williams calls to notify GSO. At 3:45 -- 3:44:24 our SWAT officers confirmed that the suspect is down. Homicide detectives have gathered surveillance footage -- video footage from the Dollar General which captured the shooter's rampage. I'll share portions of that video right now. Again, out of respect for the victims' families, we are going to cut this video short. We will not be showing their loved ones and what happened to them inside the store. Rather these video surveillance excerpts, details some of the shooter's movements outside and inside the Dollar General. As you'll see form the video footage, the shooter outfitted himself with a tactical vest which he covered with a short-sleeve button-up shirt. He created a facial covering and donned gloves for his attack. This investigation is ongoing and I will provide you with additional information as it is established and verified. I want to thank our law enforcement partners for their continued support in this investigation. As our community collectively grieves this tragedy, this agency will continue to diligently investigate so that we can provide victims' families and our community with as many (INAUDIBLE) we can. Our community is grappling to understand why this atrocity occurred. I urge us all not to look for sense in a senseless act of violence. There's no reason or explanation that will ever account for the shooter's decisions and actions. His sickening ideology is not representative of the values of this Jacksonville community that we all love so much. We are not a community of hate. We stand united with good and decent people of the city. We reject this inexcusable violence. And this agency will not rest until this investigation is complete and every available avenue of accountability has been exhausted. I'll be happy to answer any questions after we view this video. Again, the video is rather short because I don't think some of the things that are on there are appropriate for television. It's not meant to entertain or be insensitive to our victims and our victims' families. So I wanted the people to be able to see exactly what happened in this situation. And just how sickening it is. I'll answer any questions if I can. Yes, sir. (INAUDIBLE)",

We have heard from the Australian prime minister who offered his condolences to the U.S. Here's a little bit more of what the prime minister had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It was Wednesday since that private jet belonging to Yevgeny Prigozhin's Wagner group plunged into the ground between Moscow -- when it was on a flight to Moscow and St. Petersburg. It was caught on video tape. People recorded it on their cell phones.And on board, there were ten people. Everybody on board was dead. And the passenger manifest included the name of Yevgeny Prigozhin. It's now been confirmed for the first time after genetic tests on the human remains recovered from the crash scene that Yevgeny Prigozhin was indeed on board, and they've forensically confirmed he's dead. I mean, the reason is -- one of the reasons there's been so much caution when it comes to this, because there's been other plane crashes in the past, one in 2019, for instance in an African state in which Yevgeny Prigozhin was also meant to be -- was also on the manifest. But he didn't actually die. He wasn't on the plane at all. He popped up a few days later saying, no, I'm not dead. And so, you know, there was -- you know, h often put his name, for security reasons, put his name on passenger lists and didn't take the plane. On this occasion, though, it was a flight that he was on along with several of his senior deputies and, of course, three crew members, seven people from Wagner, including one of the founders, Dmitry Utkin, the head of security, people like that. They're all now confirmed to have been killed in this plane crash. The reason for the crash, the biggest mystery in Russia today. And the Russians -- the Russian authorities say they have launched an investigation to try, they say, to get to the bottom of it.",

In Washington, D.C. the judge overseeing the federal election subversion case against Trump will hear arguments over when to schedule that trial. It could start as soon as January.And then in Atlanta tomorrow, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows will argue his case in Georgia should be transferred from state to federal court. And if he succeeds, Trump and other defendants will likely try to do the same. With me now to discuss this is J. Tom Morgan. He is a former district attorney for DeKalb County, Georgia, which borders Fulton County. J. Tom, great to see you. So, you filed a brief with other former judges and prosecutors arguing that the Fulton County indictment of Mark Meadows should stay in state court and should not move to federal court. Explain why you all did that and what your point of view is. J. TOM MORGAN, FORMER DISTRICT ATTORNEY, DEKALB COUNTY, GA: Good to be with you, Fredricka. Yes, I, along with several other district attorneys and judges, both Republican and Democrat, filed a brief arguing this case should stay in state course. Just because Mr. Meadows, and his case will be heard tomorrow, are government officials, it doesn't mean -- and get a government paycheck doesn't mean that they are working within the scope of their employment when they come down here to Georgia to try to interfere with an election. Also, the U.S. Constitution, Fredricka, makes it very clear that the elections are to be supervised by the states and Congress. The executive branch has nothing to do with state elections. Yet these gentlemen were down here in Georgia trying to change the vote count, and Georgia wants to hold them responsible.",

RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA: -- perpetrating violence of this kind is unacceptable and targeting people due to their race has no place in the state of Florida. Casey and I extend our condolences to the victims of their -- and their families on behalf of the entire state of Florida. I've spoken with Jacksonville Mayor Deegan, Sheriff Waters and President Faison from Edward Waters College. We will work with Dr. Faison to ensure the college has adequate security, just like we've done when our Jewish Day schools have been receiving threats. We're not going to allow in the state of Florida our HBCUs to be targets for hateful lunatics like the guy yesterday. Now, with respect to the Tropical Storm Idalia. It is currently 80 miles off the coast of Cozumel, with 35-mile-per-hour winds. It will become a hurricane by late Tuesday afternoon. Landfall is currently expected along the Big Ben region on Wednesday and it could arrive at the state of Florida as strong as a category 2 hurricane. The storms, of course, as we know, these things can wobble so Floridians along our Gulf Coast should be vigilant, even if you're currently outside the cone and indeed you could see impacts if you are in a place that's outside the cone. We issued an executive order yesterday to allow prep time and to stage resources to be able to respond to the storm's aftermath. Our emergency operations center here in Tallahassee will go to a level one, 24-hour around the clock starting at 0700 tomorrow. Please listen to your local officials. If you look at this Big Ben region, the models are probably more in agreement than we had Ian last year. But these things can shift. There's still some uncertainty out there. So, please, just heed the warnings of your local officials. Continue to watch the news. If you are in the path of this storm, you should expect power outages so please prepare for that, particularly if you have one, if this storm ends up coming in the Tallahassee region, there's a lot of trees that are going to get knocked down, the power lines are going to get knocked down. That is just going to happen. So, just be prepared for that and be able to do what you need to do. If you are power dependent, particularly the elderly or others with medical needs, please plan on going to a shelter. These -- some of these counties are going to be announcing that they will be opening shelters. I would imagine in the next day or so. That will be a good decision because the chance of you losing power if a category 2 hurricane hits is very, very high. In terms of resources, we have mobilized 1,100 national guardsmen and they have at their disposal 2,400 high water vehicles as well as 12 aircraft that can be used for rescue and recovery efforts. Power, we are going to start -- the power companies are going to start pre- staging linemen starting on Monday, and we're going to have probably not as many as we had for Ian because the track of the storm is different and the number of people affected is likely to be less, but there is going to be a significant amount of linemen that are going to be stationed and ready to go. And so, what we would say to the municipalities and other electric outfits is please be willing to accept this mutual aid so we can get the power back on as quickly as possible. When we did hurricane Ian, the places that accepted the mutual aid early, they got the power back on a lot quicker. So, please, these resources are going to be there. Let's all work together to get the power back on. Clearly, we've had instances in the past where it dragged on and there were a lot of people without power, particularly in Tallahassee in a 2016 storm. We want to avoid that. The linemen are going to be there. And we want to put them to work and I know that -- I know that all the residents will really appreciate that. So, please accept the mutual aid. Contact Kevin Guthrie if you have any questions about that but we are going to have power outages and so, we want to get the power back on for all Floridians as quickly as possible. We are likely going to be staging the majority of our resources in Marion County and parts of north Florida and that's going to give us the flexibility in case the track changes to be able to mobilize resources where they need to go. The Florida Department of Transportation has now allowed expanded weight and size requirements for emergency transport so they're going to able to bring in more supplies on trucks than they otherwise would be. Please just be vigilant and watch -- watch the weather channel, watch the news and listen to your local officials. We're going to continue to have briefings, you know, as the days go on. Here, if you want to know how can you prepare, go to floridadisaster.org/getaplan, floridadisaster.org/getaplan. You have time to make the preparations. You're going to see on that web site all the things that are recommended that you do, but I would say, again, if you are in the path of this storm, expect -- expect to lose power.",
