Authorities say the U.S. Army veteran was 100 percent inspired by ISIS, and posted videos in the hours before the attack. And also, some new details on the Tesla cyberattack -- Cybertruck explosion, I should say, outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. No definitive connection to New Orleans. But some eerie coincidences. Another driver, who rented his car from the same app, and was an active-duty military member who had been stationed at similar places, as the New Orleans attacker. And a cliffhanger, right here in Washington. Speaker Johnson has just hours to lock down the votes to keep his job with the smallest House majority in 100 years. I'm Pamela Brown, in for Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, the FBI just released new photos of the man that they say plowed through a crowd in New Orleans. And we're told that this Army veteran from Texas acted alone. The FBI wants to hear from anyone who saw him. That's why they are releasing these pictures. Or this blue cooler, right here on the screen. Inside was a bomb that fortunately didn't go off. Police say the man in the pictures is the one behind the wheel, in new surveillance video, showing just how quickly the party turned deadly, as a pickup truck plowed through the busy French Quarter, in the early hours of this New Year. And they're also examining this CNN exclusive video, doorbell footage from the Airbnb, where the attacker was staying. And you can see him, just outside the house, just hours before the attack. Time is critical. Investigators are working step by step, trying to bring to light, an explanation, for what seems unexplainable. How a man, who his brother describes as kind and soft-spoken could be the same one the FBI now describes like this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, CNN has just obtained exclusive new video of the suspect, shortly before the attack in New Orleans, and it was taken just after midnight. And in it, you can see the man putting what appears to be a white pole with a black top into the bed of the truck. Authorities have said an ISIS flag was found in the truck. And in addition, that the suspect can be seen working on the hitch of the truck, right here. When he is about to leave, he pulls away, and then backs up, and then pulls away again. My law enforcement sources tonight are: The former D.C. Chief of Homeland Security and Intelligence, Donell Harvin. And the former FBI Assistant Director for the Criminal Investigative Division, Chris Swecker. Great to see you both, under these just horrible circumstances. Donell, first to you. I just want to know what your takeaway is, as this information, and this video comes in. DONELL HARVIN, FORMER D.C. CHIEF OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE, HOMELAND SECURITY ANALYST: Well, this is an individual who is typical, dived in town a few days before, started doing, what we call, pre-operational surveillance, surveilling the locations, possibly, getting a plan together. And the fact that he was inspired by ISIS comes to no surprise to people like me. ISIS has been inspiring individuals, for the last decade to do this, just this type of attack. Over the last 10 years, we've had, nearly 20 attacks have taken the lives of almost 200 people and injured hundreds more. And so, this is part of the ISIS playbook, to inspire people online, to get them to do these very low-tech attacks. And it keeps on happening.",

I mean, they seem to have ruled out, they being the FBI, seemed to have ruled out co- conspirators, even though, early on they were saying there were. But it's important to understand if he was directed versus inspired. If he was directed, there are -- there are probably others that we need to be concerned about. If he was inspired, I mean, there's always going to be that lone wolf, and what will put him in that category, if this was a so-called inspired act. But I think there's still quite a bit we need to learn about him. We're hearing from friends and family that he had some spiral -- you know, his life was spiraling downward.

And as -- there we go, here they are on the -- you know, you could walk past him on the street, and not think anything of it. And yet, the FBI has come out and also said that he joined ISIS before the summer.And Donell, you have noted that the Justice Department has charged at least three other alleged ISIS sympathizers since last fall.

They're still publishing regular online radicalization materials, like their Inspire magazine and videos.And they really prey on individuals that are on the spectrum of mobilization to violence, people who are downtrodden, people who are upset at the world. I don't think it's going to get any better. There's a lot of conflicts going on. DHS and the FBI director, earlier this year, talked about the conflict in the Middle East inspiring individuals to radicalization. And so, there's a lot of cause out there. What we normally say is that an individual mobilizes the violence, because they have some type of grievance. They're mad at somebody or something. And so there's a lot of things to be mad about.

And in this case, I think we're going to learn more about his life, but you can see, he follows that spiraling, downhill. It's just the true-believer syndrome.

Certainly, as you mentioned, not only DHS put this bulletin out once, but twice during December. But this is an annual bulletin. It's a joint bulletin between DHS and the FBI. We call it a JIB, a Joint Intelligence Bulletin, that goes out to folks like I was, and say, Hey, it's the holiday season. We're monitoring different types of streams of intelligence. Keep an eye out for this, and make sure that if you have any celebrations, tree- lightings, things like that, that they're protected. Now, if you ignored those two bulletins that came out in December, you can't ignore what happened two weeks ago in Germany. And as I mentioned in the opening, the vehicle as a weapon is a known ISIS tactic, technique and procedure. They've promulgated this. They've used it successfully. Hundreds of people have died.

So, you have that. You have the constant indoctrination and propaganda on the internet. Al-Qaeda used to have their publication called Inspire, which was designed to inspire these types of attacks. And you see, ISIS being degraded. I think that makes them more dangerous, even more dangerous than they are when they had their enclave. So now, they're -- they're in sort of panic mode. They want to -- they would still want to exist as an organization, then they can extend themselves, virtually, through people who they can radicalize on the internet or through social media.

And authorities say the following evening, he drove to New Orleans. Then between 01:00 a.m. and 02:00 a.m., local time, just after the New Year, law enforcement officials say that Jabbar is seen on surveillance video, planting two explosive devices in the Bourbon Street area. He posted the first of five Facebook videos at 01:29 a.m., where he walked through what he said were canceled plans to kill his own family during a holiday celebration, and he also discussed his decision to join ISIS, and provided a last will and testament. At 03:15 a.m., Jabbar is seen driving down Canal Street, turning sharply around a police vehicle and onto a sidewalk, gunning it, and striking dozens of pedestrians, before hopping out of the truck and opening fire on police officers who then shot and killed him. Federal investigators say the suspect was, quote, 100 percent inspired by ISIS, as we've been talking about. But three phones and two laptops recovered at the scene could bring some more insight into potential foreign or domestic influence. My source tonight is former National Security Adviser, during President-elect Trump's first term -- first term. Ambassador John Bolton, nice to see you. Bottom line, how high is the threat level now, after this New Orleans attack? JOHN BOLTON, FORMER TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: Well, I think it should be very high. It indicates that ISIS and probably other terrorists recruiting, even if it's just online, continues to pay off for them. I think it's a mistake, and it has been for some time, to think that the global terrorist threat against us is declining. I do think people come across our borders. Some are recruited here. You have to be vigilant in both cases. But the idea that radical Islamicism has gone away as a problem for the United States, or our friends and allies, ask Israel, is really a huge mistake.

And not to have the smooth transition of power, to watch someone who was an outgoing president, egg this on, to not put a stop to it. I know that people are going to say that he said X, Y and Z. But the fact of the matter is, we had law enforcement officers, who nearly lost their lives, law enforcement officers who were in the line of fire, law enforcement officers who gave everything they could on January 6th, all because of MAGA at the Capitol.
