It is a slap in the face to them and to the victim in our case to refuse to allow us to seek justice and full accountability for a New Yorker's death.\" And now Bragg saying also that she's playing politics here. Of course, Mitchell is a long-time Republican. Bragg is a Democrat. He's been sort of a political punching bag for Republicans for being soft on crime in New York City.

Take a look at this government exhibit that prosecutors just offer. They're essentially telling the judge that in this picture, one thing here is not like the others. What's called out there in that red box is a live round of ammunition that was found in a box of dummy rounds that are typically used on movie sets. And they really focused on the color there, saying you could see the difference between the silver of the live round and the gold on the other rounds. Saying that someone like Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was the armor, a weapons expert, should have known the difference. Now what prosecutors did is they took it a step further. They went and collected all the imagery that they could find from the set of that movie. Here's what they discovered, (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's also taking his case against the production company in this culture of unsafe practices on the set, even pointing the finger directly at Alec Baldwin himself. Have a listen.

He expressed his admiration for the opposition leader's extraordinary courage and his legacy of fighting against corruption.\" And the president goes on to say that, \"Alexei's legacy will carry on through people across Russia and around the world who are mourning his loss, fighting for freedom, democracy and human rights.\" And the president, in this meeting. also affirmed his plans along with other countries to assign new sanctions on Russia tomorrow for the death of Alexei Navalny. Of course, President Putin (sic) has assigned blame directly on Russian President Vladimir Putin for the opposition leader's death. He has called on Russia to provide a full accounting of how this death happened in a labor camp in Russia. And certainly, President Biden planning for more forceful sanctions against Russia tomorrow as part of this. In this statement that the White House says, he says, \"These sanctions will be in response to Alexei's death, Russia's repression and aggression and it's brutal and illegal war in Ukraine.\" And so certainly a remarkable moment for President Biden to be meeting with these family members here in San Francisco. And certainly, President Biden has a lot of experience in meeting with those who are dealing with loss. But this loss obviously coming on an international stage at a global level. And President Biden, very eager to show his support for this family as he prepares for this new package of sanctions.",
