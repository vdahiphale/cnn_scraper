And in final moments of this race, Donald Trump is spending his time, focusing his attacks on Liz Cheney. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign tonight is bracing for Trump to declare victory, even if the votes are still being counted on Tuesday, circa what we saw in 2020. What the Harris campaign is expecting, as she is out on the campaign trail, making her final pitch. And if you're spending these last few days, before Tuesday night, maybe a little bit anxious, eating your feelings? You might need some advice. And so, we are going to bring you the one and only Bobby Flay. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. In these precious final moments of what could be one of the closest elections, in U.S. history, Donald Trump is not dialing back his rhetoric in some last-minute bid to reach those elusive undecided voters, tonight. Instead, we're seeing the former President actually doubling down and repeating the violent language that he first used, last night, when he was talking about one of his most prominent Republican critics, Liz Cheney. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK?

It's a question of the undecideds of what is going to move them.But T.W., just on the language itself. I understand the argument that the Trump team is making. They're saying he was talking about involvement in foreign wars, something he's been against. But he could have said that without using such violent imagery, about guns being fired upon someone, who's a huge critic of his. T.W. ARRIGHI, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Perhaps. And I think the second time he did, it was a little softer. And look, I'm the biggest critic of Donald Trump's rhetoric, and his demeanor, most of the time, always happened. When I woke up this morning, though, in red headlines, accusing him of wanting to put Liz Cheney in front of a firing squad, I spit out my coffee, and I wasn't even drinking any. So, I went back and I watched all eight minutes. I don't even like a politician to talk for five, never mind eight. But I listened to it. It was a classic weave of criticism. And I thought I was listening to a speech, from the 2004 Democrat National Convention. I was there. And everyone accused Cheney and Bush of not having skin in the game, their kids having guns trained at them while our boys and girls were over there. That was very heartfelt at the time, and it still is today. And the point Donald Trump was making was that leaders like Liz Cheney, who is hawkish, and I love the Cheneys and Bushes, should think twice before they put people in harm's way. And the bigger point I want to make about this is there is so much to go after Donald Trump for. And I know that the imagery of a barrel trained at her head is tough. He should know that. But when people hear firing squad, and then actually listen to what he said? People are going, next time they say Donald Trump said something crazy? They're going to assume, Well, did he actually say that?",

Nancy Pelosi was on with Jake earlier, talking about this being kind of the second year anniversary of the attack at her house that went to her -- her husband was injured. Donald Trump himself has gone through this. Why are we talking about training guns at politicians' heads? This is -- this doesn't make any sense to me.

It's that you're not doing what he wants to do. It's disloyalty. It's really a children's playground kind of approach.I do think, in Liz Cheney's case, though, there's more to this that people are not catching. And that is, his criticism of her is not based on her being a war hawk or anything else. The fact is, she voted to impeach him, after January the 6th, and he cannot get it out of his head. And that's why, notwithstanding, the comments were, were not about a firing squad directly, but about being in combat. It would be a pretty unusual situation, in the field, for one lone American soldier, suddenly to be confronted by nine enemy soldiers, pointing their rifles at her head. So, I think, in Trump's mind, this effort to denigrate Liz, really, is based on the vote to impeach. And in his mind, this violent image, is very real, and it's disturbing. It's not the first time it's come up. And it's just typical, the way he goes after people. When you're -- when you're on the wrong side of Trump, there's no hope for in his mind.",

But look back at his record, as Commander-in-Chief, he kept troops in Iraq. He kept troops in Syria. He ordered the strike against the Iranian General Soleimani.

And that turned out to be a terrible mistake for the United States. But that gets into the substance of the policy disagreement, and Trump just isn't capable of carrying on a sustained discussion there. He translates that sort of thing, into a direct attack. And he's very good. He's found a way to say things that are really outrageous, but with enough of a qualification that he can -- he can slough it off later. For example, saying he wants to be a dictator, but just on day one. Some people hear, Dictator, and they don't hear, Just the day one part. But it allows Trump to work both sides of the street.

I mean, for so long, they have been banking on these low-propensity podcast bros, to come out and bail them out. But it was a risky bet all along.

And that has been something certainly on the minds of the Harris and Trump campaigns, as they're in battle ground Wisconsin, tonight. There are, our latest CNN polling shows no clear leader on which candidate voters trust more on the economy.
