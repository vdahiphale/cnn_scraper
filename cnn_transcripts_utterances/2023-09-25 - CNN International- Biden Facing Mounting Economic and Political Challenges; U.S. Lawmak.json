      "sentences": "Right. So, taking Odessa, what happened overnight was a pretty significant Russian combined drone and missile attack. Ukraine's air defense is very effective. They say they managed to shoot down all 19 Shahed drones, and all but three of the missiles that were launched. This does significant damage around port area, hotel that have been in operation for years, granaries, port infrastructure.No indication as of yet that any of the buildings were used for any military purpose, even though Odesa is of course the headquarters of Ukraine's navy. But we had this tweet from Ukraine's defense ministry that says the attack on Odessa was, they call it a pathetic attempt at retaliation. It's quite small, not true he can read it, but a pathetic attempt at retaliation for a successful hit at the Russian navy HQ in Sevastopol. So they are saying that this is Russia retaliating for that. By the wider context, of course, as we've seen Odessa hit multiple time since the green deal clapped in the middle of July. Russia continuing and we saw this morning, granaries hit. Meanwhile, Russia, of course, is exporting beat in record volumes. And Ukraine is trying valiantly to get it sweet out through its own unilateral maritime corridors very slowly, facing other hurdles as well. So, that's the context there. In terms of the deal in Washington, you know, Zelenskyy has to bring him something. He didn't bring him ATACMS, so he's talking up this joint production agreement. The U.S. side is not seeing as much about it. All we know from President Biden's they are apparently going to host conference in the fall to bring together members of the defense industries from both countries, representatives of government, to try to figure this out. Zelenskyy says several agreements have already been signed. The talk about, this it could be joint legal entities, joint ventures, we've seen similar things with European defense companies. But we don't know exactly what kind of shape that will take. But clearly, part of Ukraine's effort to bolster its own defense industry for the long term.",
