      "sentences": "Well, good evening everyone. I am Laura Coates and this is CNN TONIGHT.And there are new developments into the investigation into the classified documents from President Joe Biden's time as Vice President Joe Biden. We are learning more about his private office where ten classified documents were found. Now, more on that in just a moment. We also got some new CNN reporting on the classified documents found in that office including a memo from Biden to then President Barack Obama, two briefing memos preparing Biden for separate phone calls and one with the British prime minister, the other with the president of the European Council. Now, look, it is unclear how much of this material actually remains sensitive and whether that is really going to be the point in the end. But tonight, we're going to go dig deep into what we know about the special counsel's investigations of President Biden and former President Trump, what the special counsel in each case is looking at and the key differences between them. Plus, the two stories everybody cannot stop talking about this week, the GOP's George Santos problem and the firestorm over gas stoves, gas. Yes, these are two big stories this week. You see what I did there about the fire storm? It was a moment. It's a Friday night, everyone. Congressman Santos got caught in what looked like a never ending series of whoppers about his own resume and it doesn't stop there, as they say. But wait, there's more. It also includes whoppers about his education, even his own family. Now, CNN's own KFile has learned about his work for a company that was later accused of running a Ponzi scheme. Meanwhile, all the brouhaha over gas stoves, it shows no signs of dying down. There is something these two stories have in common that, well, you might not have noticed. And we're going to thread that particular needle when we come back a little later, and we'll tell you about it later on tonight. Lots to talk about tonight with CNN Political Analyst Alex Burns, the former Independent Counsel Michael Zeldin, and former Federal Prosecutor Elliot Williams. I am glad you're all here with me tonight. Let me begin with you, Michael, because you, at one point, were an independent counsel. And I'm wondering, when you are looking at these scenarios, taking a step back, everyone is focusing on, look, there are two special counsels but they have different roles because the facts might be different even though the headline is the same. How do you see it?",

Why did they get out? Were they disseminated? Was there criminal intent? And so it is a much more circumscribed issue. Smith has got a big deal on his hand.

That is the reason why, as we talked about the other day, one of the bases for the search warrant of his property was possible obstruction of justice, acts to get in the way of the Justice Department.Right now, what folks -- if you noticed, if you're reading between the lines about what people were complaining about with Joe Biden, it is, well, they didn't tell the media fast enough. The story switched a little bit and they weren't totally forthcoming. That is public relations. Now, look, it can spiral into a legal problem. If it -- evidence comes out that the Biden team was either hiding information, was aware of what it was, was deliberately trying to conceal documents, of course, there is possible criminal liability there.

But I want to show you the layout of Biden's office again for a second here. And I think it is important just to try to take a step back and look at what we're talking about here of where these documents were supposedly found. This animation actually shows where White House documents were found. I believe this is at Biden's office.But I also want to show you -- do we have the animation of where we found them -- not we -- I mean, the royal we -- where they were found at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate as well, just to think about the contrast here in terms of where they may be. This is Biden's office. I don't know why it is not showing up right now. But we remember, Alex -- well, here it is -- the contrast here. And I point these two things out because both one have been, Alex, to look at where we are talking about to figure out, should it raise any eyebrows all of a sudden about where these documents were found. There was that indelicate moment yesterday with Biden talking about his corvette and that seeming to intimate, look, my corvette is in a locked place. They're safe. The documents may have been.

Because on the one hand, it is very clear that the Biden case, based on what we know about it now, is far, far less legally dangerous than the case involving former President Trump.At the same time, it is a little bit misleading just to consider sort of the facts of the Biden situation in contrast to Trump. This isn't an election where one of these guys is going to get indicted and the guy who has the much worse facts of the case is probably going to be that guy, no. Joe Biden needs to handle this in absolute terms. Either stuff was done improperly or illegally or it wasn't. Look, I'm with Elliot here. Based on what we know right now, we are clearly not in a position to say that Joe Biden is in profound legal jeopardy. At the same time to the point about public relations and like what we know is they weren't fully forthcoming and there were questions about why they didn't answer certain things at certain times, those are the kinds of gaps that lead you, in my view, sort of to withhold judgment on the seriousness of this because we clearly don't have all the information.",

Was there any effort to alter or destroy, as was in the case of Sandy Berger who was prosecuted under this statute for taking documents and then when they sort of realized that he had them, he sort of altered them, or in the case of Alberto Gonzalez, where he had them but didn't disseminate them. They determined that there was no criminal liability because there was no knowledge or intent. Petraeus also prosecuted under this statute. He took them, he gave them to his biographer, who he was having a relationship with, and they determined that that dissemination tipped it over to being criminal.So, all of those things are what the special counsel has to look at before he can determine whether or not this is inadvertent, non- intentional, not willful, therefore not criminal, or whether it implicates criminal law that requires the national security section and him collectively to make a determination does this fit in the norms of prosecution.",

I know you and I have talked about this before, Elliot, if it were a trial, in a criminal trial, you would have problems getting into evidence that which you could not show had a chain of custody that preserved the integrity of the evidence.

Trump is saying the same thing. He's saying, I'm working to the very end. I don't think I've lost this election. Then it turns out that I've got to leave and they're packing up boxes furiously.

And we all remember the Mueller investigation very, very clearly. And at the end of the day, people have a pretty developed view of the president.Now, what I think personally as a political reporter talking to sort of sources who are on the political side of things, the question for Biden is does this undermine the sort of impression of competence, which already has been through the ringer a bit in the presidency and also does it sort of this notion that he was just working really hard, he lost track of his papers? Like does it reinforce the kind of like absentminded grandfather side of the Biden image, which the White House is not super enthusiastic about, right?

It stands for the Stopping Another Non-Truthful Office Seeker Act, or for short, see, the SANTOS act.Meanwhile two Republicans taking a cue from the heated controversy over gas stoves this week introduced their own STOVES Act. Now, what is that short for? Look at it. Stop Trying to Obsessively Vilify Energy Act. Are these political micro aggressions? I don't know. That would prevent the banning, of course, this one of gas stoves or ranges.

So, look, obviously, it is understandable how the Santos discussion continues to concern so many people because it is a sitting member of Congress. What is more surprising for people, though, is the quick pace at which the gas study that was released back in December and commented on and revealed earlier this week had even the president of the United States, I would say, arguably responding quicker than he did to the allegations about mishandling classified documents.

You look at the Dr. Robert Bierenbaum case in New York where he murdered his wife, strangled her, and then flew her in an airplane over the ocean and dumped the body. The body has never been found and he has been convicted. And at a recent parole hearing, finally confessed to doing just that. But most on point, I think the case, John Smith. John Smith murdered his first wife in New Jersey -- in Ohio. Murdered his second wife in New Jersey.

This country has been successful at prosecuting people who hide bodies since the 1800s. But when you talk to investigators and you give misleading information with respect to your wife's whereabouts, when you have ankle bracelets and you are, right, pursuant to that federal conviction that he had on probation, and as a result of that you have to stay home, and you could leave to pick up your children but you left and your children didn't have school, all of those thing's kind of circulate to the consciousness of guilt issue. In addition to that, we talk about the circumstantial evidence. You know, Laura, circumstantial evidence is evidence. It's powerful. People don't get credit because they're smart enough to conceal their crimes. So as a result of that, what you do is you string together things that make sense.

Why did you say she left the house when the cell phone was pinged to the home? Why did you go to Home Depot and pick up supplies? Why was there blood in the basement, right? Why, why, why. So, you put all of those issues together and all of those issues really seemed to suggest that she is missing and she's not going to return because it was at your hands. So, yes, there are challenges as you know associated with any prosecution particularly when you don't have the body, but those are not challenges that cannot be overcome predicated upon the evidence which is not direct. No one saw you. But the circumstances strongly suggest that you did it.",

So, the idea that he made threats allegedly to kill her and that that was reported to police in Washington, is what we call a clue. On the other hand, and this happens in the District of Columbia where you were a prosecutor, you're going to be fighting the idea that it happened in 2014.After that they had a relationship, they got married, they had three children. And you know, on the night before she disappeared, she writes a letter in red marker apparently, you know, on a champagne bottle box that says, you know, love, perseverance, and you know, we'll have a great 2023 because we're still together even though she knows he's going to prison. So, she is messaging, if that's her handwriting, that everything is okay and there is a future.

The fact is that if you admit this in front of a jury, they aren't going to want to hear anything else. They're just going to want to convict.So, it's an open question as to whether that will see the light of day in terms of ever getting before a jury.

Just one day after severe storms and at least one powerful tornado slammed the city and others nearby in Alabama and in Georgia. The governors of both declaring states of emergency in the impacted areas to help with cleanup efforts.Joining me now is Democratic Congresswoman Terri Sewell who is from Selma and has been in the area since yesterday. Welcome congresswoman. I'm glad that you're here because I'm so interested in hearing about what has happened down there. You've been there since yesterday and even got an aerial view. What did you see? REP. TERRI SEWELL (D-AL):  I have to tell you, Laura, that it was just heart-wrenching. You know, as the person who represents the city of Selma in Congress, it's much more personal for me because Selma is my hometown. And to see the destruction of homes and businesses, businesses that I frequented as a child, school -- elementary school that several of my friends went to. You know, these are my neighbors, these are my church members, these are my teachers. It was just really gut-wrenching. But I can tell you this. The fact is that in the light of day today, we were able to have the governor come and declare a state of emergency. I really do believe -- we had Senator Katie Britt come as well. You know, it's really about trying to make sure that we have a coordinated effort to bring back the city of Selma. And my hope is that we will continue to see these kinds of coordinated effort on the state and local level so that we cannot only, you know, rebuild, but we can build back better if you will.",

The Mega Millions drawing is in just a few minutes with the jackpot reaching an estimated $1.35 billion, yes with a B, billion, the second largest in history. Now, the last jackpot you remember was won at $502 million back in October, but in just a few minutes there could very well be another winner.And CNN's Harry Enten is here to break down the odds with us tonight. Harry, I already got my tickets. I actually have three of them here today. Thank you very much. I'm not going to tell you the numbers because I don't want to share it with you in case I do win, but it's a lot of money and a lot of people are waiting to see what's happening. We've been getting a lot of jackpots this large lately though. Why is that?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So, look, I mean, the fact of the matter is if you look at the top Mega Millions jackpots ever won, you'll notice something going on. They're all from 2018 or onward. You know, right now we're at the second largest at $1.35 billion. It was just earlier this past summer, right, where we had $1.337 billion in July 2022.So, basically, we've been seeing a lot higher jackpots recently. Now, why is that the case? Well, it turns out there was a rule change -- a rule change back in 2017 that made it more difficult to win. But of course, when it's more difficult to win and fewer and fewer are winning, it drives up the jackpot. So, what exactly happened? Well, what the Mega Millions folks decided to do was that they decided to take the Mega Bowl which must be matched to win and that went from 1 to 15 the potential possibilities to 1 to 25, and that took the odds of winning from 1 in 259 to 1 in 303 million. 1 in 303 million. Of course, maybe it is my lucky day to quote Clint Eastwood. So, here's some advice, though, if you want to win and want to get the largest jackpot possible, right, you don't want to have to share the money. So, what do you want to do if you don't want to share the money? Remember, you must share if more -- if two or more tickets win. So, pick a regular ball that goes all the way up the numbers well past 31. Pick a regular ball that's larger than 31. You want your regular balls to be larger than 31. Why? Because when people play, they tend to play dates and of course no month has more than 31 days. So, pick numbers 32 and up on the regular balls and that will give you the best shot of not having to share, which of course, Laura, I know you don't want to do even though it may be with me.",
