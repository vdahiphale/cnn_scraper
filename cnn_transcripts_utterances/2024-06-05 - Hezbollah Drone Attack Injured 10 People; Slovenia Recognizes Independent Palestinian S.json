Now, Israel's emergency service says at least ten people have been injured in the town of Hurfeish. These are the first images that we are seeing and looking at them right now from the scene. Now, the IDF says Hezbollah militants launched at least one drone, no sirens we've being told, warned of the attack, even before this happened, I think context is important here, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to open a new war front in Lebanon. He toured as you can see there, town in northern Israel hit by rockets fired from Lebanon earlier this week. And said, Israel is ready for very intense action to restore security to the border area. Our Jeremy Diamond joins me now for the very latest. So, Jeremy, let's just start on this breaking news. What more are you learning about this new attack on northern Israel here?",

      "sentences": "Well, as you said, Isa, at east, ten people were injured and the initial assessment from the Israelimilitary is that Hezbollah launched at least one explosive drone in this attack. This is a manner that they've used before to attack northern Israel, and one in which they have been successful in the past, including in an attack a couple of months ago in the northern Israel town of Arab Al-Ahram Shai(ph), which was struck in which multiple Israelis, including some reservists, had been injured. It's not clear as of yet the ten people who were injured, whether these are soldiers, civilians, some combination of both. We will get some clarity, I'm sure on that in the coming hours, but there's no question that it comes at a moment of extraordinary tension between Israel and Hezbollah. We have watched, of course, over the last eight months as these cross- border attacks have happened at a steady pace over the last eight months. But now, there's no question that there's been an uptick both in terms of the Israeli strikes in Lebanon targeting Hezbollah as well as Hezbollah's rocket and drone attacks on northern Israel. And this week in particular, that came into very stark relief as portions of northern Israel were on fire, thousands of acres burned by wildfires caused by those rockets being fired from Hezbollah as well as in at least one case, an Israeli missile interceptor that set fire to one area of northern Israel. And that has really brought attention to that situation on the northern border in Israel, to the tens of thousands of Israelis who have been displaced from their homes in northern Israel, and the pressure that is building on the Israeli government to bring some kind of a resolution to this situation. And today, we heard the Israeli Prime Minister saying that Israel is quote, \"prepared for very intense action in the north\", saying that one way or another, security will be restored there. When he's saying one way or another, he's talking about either through diplomacy or through military action, and there is very much a sense now that the clock is ticking on diplomacy and that military action may indeed be in the offing. Of course, there is no official indicator that Israel is preparing to launch some kind of massive ground assault on Lebanon at this moment. But there's no question that there have been preparations for that over the course of the last several months. This is not clear exactly what's going to tip the scale into all-out war if that even happens between Israel and Hezbollah.",

It says \"the United States remains incredibly concerned about the risk of escalation on the Israel-Lebanon border.\" Miller then reiterating, says an untenable situation for Israel right now. Let's play it. Have a listen to this, Jeremy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW MILLER, SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT:  So, we do remain incredibly concerned about the risk of isolation along the Israel-Lebanon border.

And that pressure is felt by all corners of the government, not only the Israeli Prime Minister, but also, for example, the war cabinet member Benny Gantz, Netanyahu's top political rival, who has also made clear that this situation needs to be resolved. He has talked about resolving it by the Fall, whether through diplomacy or through military action. Itamar Ben-Gvir; that far-right member of Netanyahu's government, today, calling for all-out war in Lebanon, saying that all Hezbollah strongholds must be burned and destroyed. But it doesn't seem like there is any kind of window for a diplomatic opening without a ceasefire in Gaza. And that's why those two issues are very much intrinsically linked. We know that Israel put a proposal on the table that includes several concessions from the Israeli government much closer to Hamas' own position. But we've yet to hear the response from Hamas, and there's no question that there's still this major gap. Hamas wants an upfront commitment from the Israeli government for a permanent ceasefire, something that the Israeli Prime Minister has made very clear he is just not going to do. And so, if that ceasefire goes into place, there is a heightened chance of a diplomatic solution to this conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. But if there isn't, on the other hand, then I think the chances of war between Israel and Hezbollah very much go up, Isa.",

Part of this is about parading through that area, commemorating the 1967 war when Israel captured east Jerusalem and brought it under its full control. Today was the 57th anniversary of that, but there's no question that another part of this is offering a pretext to many of these Israeli nationalists to make their presence known in Arab parts of Jerusalem. And in some cases, to instigate violence. And we saw today, small groups of some of these Israeli nationalists walking through the streets of the Muslim quarter in the old city, banging on Palestinian shops doors, in a couple of cases, at least, one journalist was assaulted by some of these young Israeli nationalists. What we also heard, of course, from the thousands of people who attended this march today was a lot of anti-Arab slogans, including a chance that has become well-known in far-right corners in Israel, which has to say, may your village burn. That was chanted over and over again. Now beyond that, it was relatively peaceful, we should note, compared to previous years -- last year in particular, there was a lot of violence in 2021, the violence actually prompted Hamas to launch rockets towards Israel, sparking that ten-day war between Israel and Hamas. So relatively calm this year, but nonetheless, there were some clashes, and again, an opportunity for these Israeli nationalists to make their presence known in Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem.",

And he made about 30 plus demands today, all of which, including carbon taxes, the end of coal, much more loss and damages for developing countries. But these things are just unpalatable politically in much of the world. But using the bully pulpit there under the whale at the -- in the Museum of Natural History, just trying to just point to the science. And all of this is motivated by this new Copernicus report that came out today that shows the last 12 months have been the 12 such hottest months ever. The northern hemisphere, hotter than it's been since Christ was born. And it's only going to get hotter as this Godzilla made of carbon in the sky gets bigger. But we're close to stopping feeding that big monster. Next couple of years could be the curve that would only went up about 1 percent emissions globally last year, it has to come down by 9 percent a year until 2030, but it's better than nothing, and it's a lot better than we were five years ago when it looked like we were headed towards maybe 3 degrees of warming. Right now, on track north of 1.5, but can be held around two if everybody works together.",

It came away with this verdict, that 81-year-old Biden is showing signs -- this is what they quoted, \"signs of slipping,\" and says, \"Participants in meetings said the 81-year-old president performed poorly at times.\" Former President Trump, who is just three and a half years younger, wasn't spared either. The piece noting that he too has slipped up on facts on multiple occasions, and that's perhaps an understatement. Let's bring in CNN's Stephen Collinson, live from Washington. And, Stephen, I mean, this article from \"Wall Street Journal\" really calls into question the mental acuity of President Biden here behind closed doors. Just talk us through what else \"The Wall Street Journal\" says, and those they spoke to in terms of political affiliation here, because I think that's important.",

They'vesaid that the \"Journal\" article didn't include a lot of testimonials to the president's sharpness behind closed doors and in key national security meetings of officials and Democratic members of Congress. So, you can see the way this is breaking down on partisan lines. I think what we can be sure of, the president put the age issue on the shelf a little bit with the very robust State of the Union address that he delivered earlier this year, but this will come back over and over again. He's just heading off on a very grueling foreign trip. He's crossing the Atlantic four times in the next few weeks with meetings in Europe. Any time that he appears that he's not fully on his game in public, this is going to come back and it's going to haunt him definitely until the election during the four years of his second term, if he gets one.",

And once it's applied to the body, the idea is that it will suppress the production of sperm in the body. So, in this particular study, researchers had 200 men apply this gel, about 200, apply the gel to themselves daily. And after 12 weeks, around by week 15, 86 percent of the men achieved that suppression of sperm production. And I will say the average male, a normal amount of sperm production ranges from around 15 million sperm per one milliliter of semen to about 200 million sperm per milliliter. But this gel is able to suppress it. So, it's less than 1 million per milliliter, and that's how it effectively can prevent pregnancy. But this is research that was just presented at a conference. It's early data. The researchers will have to do more trials to really look at safety and efficacy. But this early data is getting a lot of attention at the moment.",
