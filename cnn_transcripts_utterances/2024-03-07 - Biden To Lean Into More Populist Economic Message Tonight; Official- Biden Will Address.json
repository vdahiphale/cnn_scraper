      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, the performance of a lifetime. Hours from now, Joe Biden will deliver what could be the most pivotal speech of his political career. And it's not just the president's job performance that will be under the microscope tonight. It may be his actual performance that matters most.Plus, Donald Trump is calling for debates anytime, anywhere, anyplace after boycotting them all primary season. Biden campaign isn't saying they're in or out, just responding that Trump is, quote, thirsty for attention. And the agonizing choice to leave your home state to terminate a wanted pregnancy. A mother put in that position because of Texas abortion laws will be in the First Lady's box at the State of the Union tonight. But first, Kate Cox is my guest here this hour. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, every moment matters. Every word, every step, every pause, every reaction for an 81-year-old president who wants four more years in the Oval Office. It all matters big time. And Joe Biden may never have had a moment like this before and may not again in the next several months, at least. Tonight's State of the Union is likely the largest audience the president will have between now and the voter -- when the voters go to the polls in November. CNN's Kevin Liptak is covering all of the preparations from the White House. Kevin, I want to start with some new reporting on a very thorny foreign policy issue.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Certainly, this has been the topic that has consumed the president's time over the last several months. And we do understand that in his State of the Union tonight, President Biden plans to make a new announcement when it comes to getting humanitarian aid into Gaza.He will announce that he is directing the U.S. military to undertake an emergency mission to construct a port along the Mediterranean coast in Gaza to allow for the flow of humanitarian aid into the strip. They're likening this to a temporary pier. It will involve aid that's routed through Cyprus on major ships to this pier into Gaza. And they say this will increase the capacity for aid by hundreds of trucks per day. And very importantly, they say this will not involve U.S. boots on the ground. That is something that President Biden has made very clear that he's not willing to do. They say they are able to construct this port from offshore. And so certainly an important moment for the humanitarian aid, but also politically for President Biden as he's confronting this thorny crisis. So that will be a major announcement. But I think the real centerpiece of this speech tonight will be this focus on economic populism. President Biden calling for higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations going after corporate greed, talking about lowering costs for healthcare. Certainly, this is not a new playbook for Democratic presidents running for reelection. But certainly, President Biden wants to make clear the contrast with Republicans and the former President Donald Trump. He'll also talk about protecting freedoms at home and abroad, including calling on the restoration of abortion rights nationwide, talking about the IVF issue. In the First Lady's box, we'll see people affected by that issue. Interesting, we'll also see the prime minister of Sweden, that's the newest member of NATO. President Biden certainly will talk about his commitment to the defense alliance to Ukraine, all with the eye of providing this contrast with Trump. And certainly, those are the main topics he'll talk about. Obviously, the performance will be a main issue for the president as well, as he looks to combat those issues on age and fitness. That's why he's been rehearsing over the last several days. Certainly, a major moment for the president tonight.",

Kevin, thank you so much for that. As he was just laying out, the president and certainly the candidate part of his job tonight means that he needs to make a very good impression.I want you to just look at this chart. You can see how the president's standing with the American people has changed since his first address to Congress that happened soon after he took office. His approval ratings are hovering around the lowest of his presidency. I want to bring in my political panel, CNN's David Chalian, CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, and Carl Hulse of the New York Times. I want to start where Kevin started, David. And I want you talk about sort of the big picture in the moment, but specifically about this decision to make a very big policy announcement when it comes to -- first and foremost what is needed, which is humanitarian aid in the world. But what is needed for him personally politically, which is a nod to people in his party who are saying, do something, do more. [12:05:00]",

The President Biden has basically not been able to go give a speech anywhere over the course of the last several months without being shouted down by protesters, demanding calls for a ceasefire, demanding calls for more humanitarian aid. This is something that has bedeviled.The president -- the vice president, you just see it time and time again. So, does getting ahead of this a bit. Apart from the political piece of it in terms of the electoral politics, getting ahead of this -- putting this out, you know, there could have been a moment and maybe there still will be -- we'll see tonight with him at the rostrum and in the -- well of the House, you could have had members of Congress. Rashida Tlaib or what have you -- sort of embody what all those protesters have been doing to the president as he's been out on the trail, even in fundraisers this has been happening. And so, this now is trying, I think, to sort of be a release valve a bit of that built up political pressure on this specific issue, to give a bit of a policy victory to that side of the equation in hopes of I think, bringing down the temperature of this moment in the speech.",

So, it is going to be focused on that as well.But in terms of the substance, I mean, this announcement is significant because there are two things happening at once here. It's not just the administration announcing that they're scaling up aid. They're also tweaking their rhetoric a little bit. Remember, there was a time when we talked about humanitarian pauses. Now the president will go on to say temporary ceasefire. The vice president also forceful (Ph) ceasefire. Yes. The vice president doing exactly that in Selma on Sunday, and talking about the dire situation in Gaza, talking about women, children starving. So, there has been shifts here that I think are going to be reflected in his remarks to acknowledge that what voters are feeling and what they're seeing. And that is what I am hearing from my sources. If that is what the president has to do. It's also not just talking about what he's accomplished and what his vision is.
