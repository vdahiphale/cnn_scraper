It is a question of when and also if.I'm John Berman, in for Anderson. Remember, according to the former President's own social media posts this weekend, the indictment was supposed to happen today, but he had no proof of that, and so here we are. Yet all indications are that something is in the pipeline, but among the litany of things we still don't know about this indictment, apart from if it will actually happen is how we will find out about it. How will Trump? Will he be arrested? Will there be a mug shot? Will he appear in Court? What will the actual charges be? Will it be a misdemeanor about trying to keep an affair with an adult film star secret buy in and this would be the potentially illegal part, falsifying business records? Or does the Manhattan DA 's office believe it has the evidence to sustain a felony conviction about this alleged payoff being part of a much broader charge about trying to influence the election? So, that is what we don't know. We do know that many top Republicans are aghast that anyone would be investigated over a little simple hush money -- alleged simple hush money. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

Let's start tonight with Democratic Congressman Dan Goldman, a former Federal prosecutor who was the Democratic counsel to the House Intelligence Committee during President Trump's first impeachment inquiry. Congressman, thanks so much for being with us. Look, many of your Republican colleagues and you just heard Speaker McCarthy there are disparaging District Attorney Alvin Bragg and the probe downplaying the investigation before it's concluded. What do you say to their argument that an indictment would be partisan and politically motivated? REP. DANIEL GOLDMAN (D-NY):   Well, they certainly weren't saying that when Alvin Bragg a year ago decided to go against the recommendation of his very experienced prosecutors and not indict Donald Trump. But what they're trying to basically do is pick and choose what they view as political and what they view as reasonable and following the law, and that basically comes down to whatever the outcome is, as it relates to Donald Trump. It's very clear they're doing the bidding of Donald Trump and trying to undermine this investigation, even to the point of potentially obstructing it.",

Now, I don't -- I'm not saying that they have committed a crime here. But I think what is very clear, is that they are trying to interfere and influence this investigation without knowing the facts and without knowing the evidence.

It was clear that Donald Trump was trying to avoid having this become public and a political liability before his election. For a variety of reasons, the Southern District of New York, the Federal prosecutor did not charge this case, and so now, it is really up to Mr. Bragg to determine whether or not he thinks that it should be, though that fact pattern should be charged in State Court where the law is not as clear on campaign finance fraud as it is federally.",

I mean, it's not only because of what the former Congressman and his colleagues did in terms of sort of turning the GOP narrative against Trump, trying to give an off ramp to Republicans in terms of, you don't have to be with this guy to the arrest of a couple hundred people, which takes away your troops, the fact that Donald Trump is essentially de-platformed, he cannot give people a Get Out of Jail Free card, and also that he cannot fill the protest. I mean, we've already seen him try to and there's like a sort of a big yawn, all of those together over the two years means that he may be a lot of smoke and a lot of fire and a lot of anger, but he cannot deliver on the kind of incitement that we worried about, the sort of existential incitement, the kind that could really harm America that he could be for.

We can't grow numb to the fact that he has basically said, Americans are the enemy, not Russia. You know, we have to stop justice from occurring, in essence.I don't put anything past him. There's always times where I sit back, and I'm like, well, I don't think Donald Trump would come out and do X, Y and Z. I no longer believe that there's any restraint on him. So I think it is quite possible that in that intervening time between the indictment and the process, and I'm not sure why there would be a big distance, but you know, I'll leave that to the experts. But in that time, he certainly could gin up enough people to show up and try to block the way or create problems. Look, there's -- I don't think -- I agree with you. There's not a ton of belief that it's going to be like another January 6, necessarily.

He said, \"They were putting Lindell on air for business purposes. They knew Lindell was crazy, but they also knew he was their highest advertiser and they were just trying to assuage him.\" So you can see this argument taking place here and starting to take shape as they argue that a lot of the coverage at Fox was not based on what was true and what was false, but based on business decisions, keeping advertisers happy, keeping ratings up, not losing ground to competitors like Newsmax.",

And there were discussions about a new pipeline to take Russian gas to China. So Russia really redirecting its economy towards the east. And of course, they also spoke in some detail, according to the Kremlin, about that Chinese peace proposal, which is very controversial because it calls for talks between the two countries, Ukraine and Russia, but stopped short of demanding that Russia pull out of the areas it's conquered. And so, these were all the kinds of things that were discussed. As Xi Jinping left the meetings today, he, you know, he could be heard on camera saying to Vladimir Putin, look, together we're trying to bring about changes that haven't happened in 100 years, and we're doing it together. And Vladimir Putin said, yes, I agree. And then Xi Jinping drove off. So, the sort of precisely the kind of changes they're trying to bring about, it seems, are quite dramatic.",

And I think that underscored for U.S. officials I've spoken to, that the skepticism was merited. Now, I think they very much acknowledge the reality of a relationship that has grown significantly closer over the course of the last year. But they also frame it in a different manner than any kind of alliance or very close relationship between two similar world powers. They view it as a clear acknowledgment of Russia's dependency and growing dependency and reliance on China, on the economic side of things. And while they are not sending lethal support, at least at this point in time, U.S. officials believe Chinese officials are also very cognizant of that reality and playing it to their advantage. But they do make clear they understand the symbolism here. They understand the moment this represents.
