Conservatives on the six, three liberals sticking together on their side. And the dissents in both of these cases are very sharp, very pointed. And in fact, in both of these cases, the majority goes out of its way to really take on the dissents.I mean, Laura and I were talking yesterday about how I've never seen a back and forth like this between a dissent and a majority opinion. And there are other indicators of just how intense this footage (ph) -- first of all, it's uncommon to have dissenting opinions orally read aloud from the bench, we're seeing that now. I think that's the reason we're waiting so long for the next case. And also, it's, sort of, old Supreme Court decision that when you end a dissent you say, I respectfully dissent that we're respectfully as not in this opinion, just as I dissent. It was not in yesterday's affirmative action. Now, on the Obergefell opinion, which is the case that said there is a constitutional right for gay people to get married. On a practical level, there is some tension because you're saying, OK, you have a constitutional right to get married, but also certain vendors can constitutionally deny you services on their free speech basis.

And that's because Missouri talked about the agency within the state that actually services federal loans and how they would be negatively impacted if these loans were wiped out. So, the Supreme Court has agreed that the state does have standing. Because of that, they've also ruled that this HEROES Act that had given the secretary of education the power and emergencies to act that that act -- the federal law does not go far enough to encompass this very broad huge price tag of $400 billion, that's what it would cost this country to actually enact this student loan program. So, to take away here is that the states have standing to sue. And in so doing so, this court has ruled that the Biden administration does not have the authority to enact this debt forgiveness program.

      "sentences": "Yes. This would have been significant relief when you think of 44 million Americans with the student loan debt. And, you know, the typical student loan forgiveness was going to be $10,000, but half of borrowers have $20,000 or less, so that would have been a real big relief for so many people.But from the very beginning, there was also the discussion that it didn't do anything to address the root cause here, which is inflation in the cost of higher education, right? So, this would have been paying off a bunch of student debt, taxpayers paying off all the student debt but not addressing the core problems. So, that's some place where the White House and higher education can really try to fix the core -- the root of that problem. When you look at this as well, I mean, it's really important for people to understand that October 1st, those student loan payments resume. And that was going to happen one way or the another. The pause, the timeout is done. The three-year COVID timeout is done, and people are going to start to pay on average between about $200 and -- to $315 is the average student loan payment, and those are out of the door again. Interests begins accruing again in September. So, this is a really important budgeting moment for millions of families who have been using that money for other things. To pay down other debts, to pay for their housing costs, to pay for their car loan, to spend in a broader economy. So, we'll be watching very closely to see if this is something that maybe takes a little wind out of consumer spending because you're going to have millions of people who are now going to be using their money to pay for their student loan payments instead of using it elsewhere in the economy.",

While, this is a huge day for the legal decision, it's also a big day for politics, because certainly this will play into the 2024 presidential election. You already hear Biden making statements. He's going to try to fix this in some way. Jeff Zeleny, what are you hearing as -- after these two decisions have come down? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: There is no doubt that every end of the Supreme Court term injects things into the political sphere, and this absolutely has done that with this 2024 presidential campaign. And what we're going to see today, as Arlette was just reporting, President Biden continuing his fight against student loans. This is a key part of, really, his support and path back to re-election. He wants to show that he is indeed fighting and trying to do something about these student loans. But as Christine was also saying, this does not address the underlying cause of the high cost of education in America. But the president is going to continue to show that he is trying to fight this. But interestingly, when you look at polling, a Marquette poll out just last month show that 63 percent of Americans actually favored some type of student loan relief. So, this is popular across the board, independent voters, Democratic voters, and a splice of Republican voters as well. So, look for this to be certainly injected into the campaign. President Biden was slow to this. We remember from the beginning of his term in the White House, he was very slow to doing some type of a proposal on this. He was pushed along the way from liberals and progressives in his party. Bernie Sanders one, Elizabeth Warren was another. So, this is something that he has been slow to get at but something the White House believes is critical to building a coalition for his re-election. As for the Colorado case, this is yet one more example of why elections have consequences, as we always say, why these matters. So, the Supreme Court, once again, will be a central focus of this race. [10:50:00] But I think if you look at all of the decisions coming in as we near the end of this term, it really is a mixed bag in terms of, yes, this is a deeply conservative court. But in the coming days and weeks, as we study what this court has done, also on voting rights. We're thinking back to last week, how the court stopped well short of what some progressives and liberals feared that they would do. So, as we analyze all of this, this is a very fascinating Supreme Court term with Chief Justice John Roberts at the helm of many of these six-three decisions here. And certainly, politics, this will be front and center into the presidential campaign for the next year and a half. Guys.",

Remember, the House Republicans tried to advance legislation included in their debt limit proposal to try to block the student loan plan, ultimately, they had to drop that student loan provision and allow it to happen in the Supreme Court. And they got the ruling that they want. And a number of the Senate Republicans signed on to an Amicus brief calling for the end of the Biden student loan forgiveness program.But they recognized the politics of this as well. And that the fact that there are a number of students out there, many who are benefiting from this who could, essentially, take out their frustration. There could be some voter backlash at the polls given how potent of an issue student debt is, particularly among younger voters, and as we head into the 2024 election cycle. We're already hearing from Senate Republicans who are signaling that they plan to move forward to try to push for legislation that they believe would lower the cost of education, help deal with students in dealing with debt. There are number of proposals that out there, but that is one area in which Republicans are trying to message in the aftermath of today's ruling. Democrats, on the other hand, are furious. One angry statement Chuck Schumer in the aftermath of the Colorado ruling, calling -- attacking the Supreme Court itself. Calling this a MAGA right activist wing of the Supreme Court, and that Colorado ruling involving gay rights, he called it a giant step backwards for human rights and equal protection. As from the Senate Majority leader, Democratic Schumer also has been one of the ones pushing Biden to go even further on the issue of student loan forgiveness. We have now heard of an official statement from Schumer, we expect to hear so soon. But this is, like we saw yesterday, in the aftermath of the affirmative action case, Republicans celebrating the results of these rulings. Democrats outrage and attacking this court. They have seen one ruling after another go towards the Republicans. Today, no different. Guys.",
