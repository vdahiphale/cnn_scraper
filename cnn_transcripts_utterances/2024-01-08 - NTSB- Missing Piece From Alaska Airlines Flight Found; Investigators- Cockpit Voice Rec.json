GEOFFREY THOMAS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AIRLINERATINGS.COM: We're not really surprised because they had the exact location when the door came off and put an alert out to all the residents in that particular area. And so, I guess that it's start of bit of a treasure hunt, if you like, with folks checking their backyards. Luckily, the door didn't impact on a home or impact on a person or a car.

So that's the premise.But what they do have is they do have the flight data recorder, which can -- which records all the parameters and that will be obviously available. But I mean, the cockpit conversation here will really simply be the pilot's discussing the fact they've got a problem and getting down to 10,000 feet as quickly as possible so the passengers can breathe properly and then the flight back to Portland.

But the relevance of that country in the Indian Ocean is immense, especially with both China and India wanting to mark its imprints and footprints in the region, given the competition between the two in the Indian Ocean.Now, let's start with how this controversy emerged. Narendra Modi, India's Prime Minister visited Lakshadweep, which is off the southwest coast of India, it's a chain of islands there and he did promote tourism in the region. He spoke about the pristine beaches there. And after that, you had a lot of people from India and overseas talking about how that could be a tourist destination for Indians. Now, we all know the number of tourists from India that visit Maldives every year. In fact, it was the highest last year when it comes to Indians visiting Maldives, and that is according to the statistics available with the Maldives government. Ever since there has been the discourse, like I said, on how important Lakshadweep could be in making people ditch Maldives for India. And after that those comments were made by the three officials that you were talking about at the top who went on to make derogatory comments against India's prime minister. And that led to a huge backlash again, online and offline. Since then, the government in Maldives has issued a press release and I'm going to read from it. It states, \"The government of Maldives is aware of derogating remarks on social media platforms against foreign leaders and high ranking individuals. These opinions are personal and do not represent the views of the government of Maldives.\" So clearly, the government there was distancing itself from those three officials. Now, what we do know is that the president of Maldives has approached China approach compared to his predecessor who had an India first approach. And he's also after being elected to power last year as India to remove its dozens of troops in Maldives. In the near future, we still have to hear from the Indian government on whether they're going to do that. But that has been another issue between the two countries. Now talking about the relevance of Maldives and the strategic relevance of it, we spoke to Michael Kugelman, an analysts, and here's what he had to say about how important this nation is to both China, India and the Indian Ocean region.

The deal is that Israel would declare an end to the war, it would withdraw its forces, it would release all the Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons. That's more 8,000 people including 700 murderers of Israelis and they would get back all the hostages.Now this deal is what is probably going to be the price to bring all the hostages only Israel is not willing to pay the price. There are great risks with this deal, particularly with releasing 700 -- 800 Palestinians who have killed Israelis who could very well go back to killing Israelis release. My answer to that would be that they need to negotiate the best (INAUDIBLE) to minimize the risk. And to take into account that Israel could always re-arrest them or even take out anyone who is supposed to be a threat. The war effort can renew after all the hostages are home. But this has to be the first priority. Israel has a moral responsibility to bring the hostages home because Israel failed to protect its citizens on October 7th.",
