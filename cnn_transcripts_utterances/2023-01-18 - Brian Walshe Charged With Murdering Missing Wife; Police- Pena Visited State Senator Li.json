Some of it is just really unbelievable. On January 1, for example, 4:55 a.m. in the morning, how long before body starts to smell? Minutes later, how to stop a body from decomposing, 10 ways to dispose of a dead body if you really need to. Can you throw away body parts? How to clean blood from a wooden floor? The very next day, January 2, 12:45 a.m. hacksaw best tool to dismember. Can you be charged with murder without a body? 1:14 p.m., can you identify a body with broken teeth? Let's go to the next day, January 3, 1:02, what happens to hair on a dead body? Then he Googled allegedly, what is the rate of decomposition of a body found in a plastic bag compared to a surface in the woods? Can baking soda mask or make a body smell good? And that's just some of the Google searches. Then they went over some of the evidence that investigators found in this case, some of this evidence stained with blood, evidence recovered from a dumpster and from a trash facility as well. That included towels, rags, slippers, tapes, gloves, cleaning supplies. Remember, he bought those cleaning supplies, some of those cleaning supplies allegedly at a Home Depot, a hacksaw, hatchet. Ana Walshe's COVID card, one of her purses, boots, a broken necklace, some of these items, Erica, had her and his DNA on it.

And that gives motive. So, if he was going to argue that he's been framed or that, you know, she died of natural causes, and he just got printed the body, which we've seen, like in the Robert Durst case, things like that. Self defense, whatever, he's got up his sleeve. I've got to tell you, juries love forensics. They love DNA, and they love Google searches and cell phone pings.

They understand what DNA evidence is. They are very good at connecting the dots. Listen, CSI, you know, it's 50 percent fiction, but people do understand how people, how an offender could try to get rid of a body and think that without their body, there's no conviction. We've seen it, we see it time and time again. And it's not like this man has a good history. He was already as you know, and has left the white-collar crimes.

Could that say anything about intent? Or is these just, you know, like, cool keepsake? WILLIAMSNow, the question is, why is a president of the United States keeping the coverage of classified documents as -- it's a bizarre keepsake, to say the least. Now to this question of intent, what it suggests is that he's sloppy at a minimum with classified information, which could be a defense for him because I didn't intend to commit a crime, I'm just sloppy all the time. Now, if he's so sloppy, as to be seen as grossly negligent, and that certainly can be evidence of a crime because there are statutes at least one of the document mishandling statutes at issue here requires the defendant to be, quote, grossly negligent in their handling of materials. So it could cut both ways for him.
