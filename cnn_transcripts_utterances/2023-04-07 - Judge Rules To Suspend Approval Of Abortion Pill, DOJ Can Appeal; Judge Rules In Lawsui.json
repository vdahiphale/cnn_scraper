I'm Bianna Golodryga, in for Erin Burnett.OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news, and what is now the most consequential ruling since the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade. A Trump-appointed federal judge has just suspended the FDA's approval for a widely used abortion drug. That means the drug called mifepristone could soon be banned nationwide, even in states where abortion remains legal. Now, this is a hugely consequential ruling. The drug has been on the market for more than 20 years and used in more than half of all abortions in this country. We have reporters covering this story across the country for us, but first, let's start with Ariane De Vogue, OUTFRONT, live in Washington. Ariane, what else can you tell us so far about this judge's decision?",

Here, this federal judge has halted the approval of this popular medication abortion pill.Now what's important here is he's put this ruling on hold for a week. He knows it's going to be appealed. So he's put it on hold. But keep in mind, that this drug is used for terminating early pregnancies, and it was approved all the way back in 2000, and that's why the Biden administration had called this lawsuit absolutely unprecedented. It was filed by opponents for abortion. And let me just tell you a little bit about what this judge said in this long opinion. He said that the FDA entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem by omitting any evaluation of the psychological effects of the drug or an evaluation of the long term medical consequences of the drug. It's worth noting that some medical officials in medical organizations have absolute refuted what he has said there, and it's -- and it's worth remembering that medication abortion now is -- makes up the majority of abortions. So, now, they're going to go ahead and appeal but this is a big ruling tonight coming from this judge.",

Essentially, what this one judge has done is to substitute his own scientific judgment for 20-plus years of scientific judgment by the FDA. He essentially says they didn't do it right, even though this drug was approved 20 plus years ago. Also important to note, this is one judge in one of our 94 federal judicial districts whose you're issuing this ruling, which purports to suspend this drug throughout the entire nation.And finally, Bianna, this is the ultimate example of judge shopping. It's really one stop judge shopping because by filing the lawsuit in this particular district, the plaintiffs here assure themselves 100 percent they would get this judge, Judge Kacsmaryk, who is very conservative, a Trump appointee. It's a little bit of a glitch in the system, but he happens to be the only judge in that particular vicinity. So this is really one stop judge shopping, and it paid off for the plaintiffs thus far.",

And the other bad part and the thing that's really difficult to stomach here is that this is in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is one of the most conservative activist courts in the country.

A judge able to come in this far after the fact and essentially overruled the FDA, and he basically says, it's the FDA's fault, they've been delaying and dragging their feet.But we're talking about 23 years or 12 of those 23 years, by the way, the FDA was part of a Republican administration, eight years with the Bush administration, four years with the Trump administration. And so, this is really a glaring example of what some might call judicial activism. I know that's a phrase that get kicked -- gets kicked around in a political sense, but here we have this judge two decades plus after the fact saying, no, FDA, you got it wrong 23 years ago and you've gotten it wrong all along, and I'm going to come in as a judge, not a scientist, and I'm going to fix it.

Here you have one of one. This is the only judge who will be assigned. And so, we're seeing conservatives go back to that well over and over again. And again, we are seeing this judge issue what we call a nationwide injunction, which is if it stands and it very much will be subject to appeal. But you have one judge here in one of our 94 judicial districts across this country, saying, I bind you for the entire country. Now, that's not new.

And it's really personal choice.And what I'm afraid of is that I think first of all, there'll be a rush for the next seven days of people stocking up on this, but I also think I worry about, you know, we should all worry about the Black market and the safety of that that women are going to be ordering this -- these drugs from overseas or places that aren't necessarily regulated properly. And so there's a concern that women will -- will potentially put themselves harm's way. The other problem is, if somebody in these are extremely safe and any adverse reaction is extremely rare. But if there is a medical reaction to one of these pills that they get, I think there is also going to be fear of getting actual medical help after the fact.

Now, the way it will work is a panel of three judges will be randomly assigned. They will rule on the case. And then the losing party there can try to get the case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, which, of course, overturned -- overturned Roe v. Wade just last year. So I think the future of this ruling is very much in doubt. Now, there are some important indications if you look back at the Dobbs decision, which over overturned Roe v.

KATIE PORTER (D-CA) (via telephone):  This is an outrageous and wrong decision that is going to put women's lives at risk. I think it's ridiculous that a judgment unkempt to invalidate on the basis of this extreme political opinions, the science and the research of the FDA. The goal of the FDA is to make sure that drugs do not endanger people. And not only does this decision invalidate that, but it actually going to put women's lives in danger by limiting access to mifepristone. So I think it's a terrible decision and I hope the administration will appeal it. I'm confident that they will.

And we've seen at about box in November and all kinds of parts and pockets in places in this country that people want the right to make their own healthcare decisions. It's the FDA's job to decide if a drug is safe or not safe. It is every patient's own personal decision whether or not to use that drug.

But that they're not doing that. They're proceeding. He's been remanded in Lefortovo prison here in Moscow until May the 29th, while the prosecution builds their case. If they need more time, they can just ask for it and because it's top secret, they're going to get it. And there's an appeal hearing on his remand, which is being held in 10 days from now on the 18th of the month in which they'll try and sort of work out whether he should be kept in prison or whether he can going to house arrest.
