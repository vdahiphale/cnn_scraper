The truce between Israel and Hamas is set to expire midnight eastern time, unless it is extended once again. At this hour, though, there is no official word that will happen. When the pause ends, Israel has promised to resume its military campaign inside Gaza, which the Israeli prime minister has said will continue until there is no longer a threat to Israel, and that, of course, raises new questions about when or if the remaining hostages about 150 or so people would be released. Today, a total of 16 hostages were freed, most of them just arriving back in Israel moments ago. In fact, these are pictures you're looking at of their convoy. Among these released today, five children, and one American Israeli woman whose story we have followed closely on OUTFRONT.

But now, Erica, questions are beginning to turn to the future of this hostage agreement, and the ability of Israel to get more of its hostages out of Gaza as part of this agreement with Hamas. We are less than five hours away now from when we expect that this truce between Israel and Hamas, a very fragile truce, could potentially expire. And, as of now, that truce has yet to be extended. We understand that over the last couple of days, there have been extensive negotiations in Doha, Qatar, in particular among Israeli, American, Egyptian, Qatari intelligence officials. Hamas, on the other side, of course, mediated by the Qatari government. The aim is to still focus on those women and children, to try and seek an extension of one or two days, and Israeli official don't believe that Hamas has the ability to make good on ten additional women and children per day, perhaps for another two days. And then, of course, the questions will start to turn to the broader question of men as well as Israeli soldiers. But today, a senior Israeli official telling me that they will not turn to that question, not begin that next phase of a hostage agreement until all women and children are out, until Hamas has fulfilled that end of the bargain. Now, what we also understand is that extension of the truce likely would not be announced until Hamas provides that list of ten additional Israeli civilians who it is prepared to release the next day. But, again, we are less than five hours away from when that truce could potentially expire. And as of yet, we have yet to see that list, and Israeli officials have yet to receive that list from Hamas.",

You see, I'm talking to the president of the United States. Where is Prime Minister Netanyahu in all this? And the answer is obvious, of course. The conversation that my wife and I had with the president was very pleasant. We first and foremost thanked him for his efforts, the efforts of his administration in securing the release of our daughter. He invited us to visit him and his wife in the White House.

Hamas has said -- their stated objectives in their charter is to kill Jews and destroy the Israeli state. Then you have the American, President Biden, who is saying, hey, my objective is to get as many hostages out and prevent a humanitarian disaster in Gaza with the Palestinians. So those three things somehow are clashing, and it's causing some great emotional trauma on the part of families of the hostages for sure, and many people that are watching the citizens of Gaza being caught in the middle as Hamas uses them, purposely uses them as shields against attacks by Israelis. I think what we're going to see tonight, Erica, if the -- if the pause does end, if this kinetic pause regains momentum, you're going to see a lot of kinetic activity by Israeli defense forces against Hamas. Hamas has used the period of time with the pause to maneuver, to move the hostages, to find new ways to draw Israel into a fight that's going to put Palestinians in the middle, and it's going to be more of what we saw in the first six weeks of the operation.",

But it's a world of difference.In all those other operations, you did not have an enemy force in a subterranean environment using defensive operations in prepared positions that they've been preparing for years, and on top of with the population on top of them. So it's very difficult to say, hey, let's do a more precise campaign, let's do more precision attacks against Hamas, because Hamas wants Israel to attack them through the population and use that against the international community to put Israel, again, in a bad position. So it's going to be very difficult to have more precision operations.
