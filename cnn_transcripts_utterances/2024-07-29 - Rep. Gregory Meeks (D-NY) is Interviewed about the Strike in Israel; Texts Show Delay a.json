And he also vowed that the Israeli government, that its military will indeed respond, saying that \"the state of Israel will not and cannot put this to rest. Our response will come,\" he said, \"and it will be severe.\"The Israeli prime minister's visit to Majdal Shams comes on the heels of his meeting last night with his security cabinet to deliberate on a response. That meeting ending with the cabinet giving the prime minister and the defense minister the authority to determine the timing and the scope of an Israeli response. And that is now the question, when will this Israeli response come, first of all, and, secondly, how severe, how significant will that response be? And at this hour, it is still unclear. We know that the U.S. government, among other Israeli allies, are urging a measured response in the face of this, trying to avoid this dangerous escalation that we have feared for so many months now as this slow, simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is now entering its tenth month. We know that the Israeli government will respond. We do not yet know whether this will tip the region into that all-out war. But I can tell you, having just returned from the community of Majdal Shams, that this is a community that is absolutely devastated by the loss of these 12 children. Still suffering - still struggling to comprehend how this could happen, how children could be the targets of this attack. And they are still trying to put the pieces together, including the father of Alma (ph), an 11-year-old girl, who told me that he holds Hezbollah directly responsible for this attack. He called them his enemy, and he said that he wants to see a response. Sara.",

What, if anything, concerns you about the possible Israeli response to this deadly missile attack? REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY): Escalation. You know, let me first send out my condolences to the families that - of the - those that were killed and injured. It's horrific. And I know that what we got back from Secretary Blinken, that Hezbollah is behind it and Israel has the right to defend itself. But, you know, one of the things that have always kept me up late at night was having escalation in that area. It would be an all-out war. And I worry about the many innocent lives that could be lost on both the Israeli side, and the innocent citizens of Lebanon. And it's why I think that President Biden has been trying so hard to get a ceasefire, because I think some of this is related to what's taken place in Gaza also to get a ceasefire. You know, just last week, Secretary Blinken said we was on the ten yard line. We were about to get this deal done. So, I'm hopeful that we can get something done to prevent an all-out war in the Middle East in that regards. Hezbollah has many more weapons and artilleries there and Hamas has. And so I'm very concerned and very nervous about all-out war breaking out.",

And so people will see her character. We know that - that the other guy, the - her opponent, Donald Trump, his character is very bad. Has been indicated by just about everyone who has ran against him, including all of the Republicans, whether you go talk about Nikki Haley or you talk about the governor - well, the senator from South Carolina, don't want to call their names, and the senator from Florida and the senator from Texas, they all have called him unwieldy things. You see in individuals who were with - or in the Trump administration, some 24 of them, who have - did not show up to the Republican Convention. Many of them, like Vice President Pence and General Kelly, Mattis, and former Attorney General Barr outwardly speak against and say that this guy's character is not what we need to have as president of the United States. So, I think that the - you'll see on the road who and what and the character of the vice president. And that will make all of the people of America know what their choices are when they go to the polls this November.",

And just think about the fact that thousands and thousands of acres look very similar to what you're seeing here behind me, just destruction. And what fire officials are telling me is that the center of the fire is still very active and it's still in very steep terrain, areas that are very difficult to access for firefighters.But there are two things that were very beneficial this weekend. One, better weather conditions. And, two, more and more resources. We now have nearly 5,000 firefighters here in this area. And they were able to do two things. One, they were able to put boots on the ground, to do assessments here. And so they have changed the number of structures destroyed, but they're now saying about 100 of them have been destroyed. And then the other very important thing that officials have told me is that they were able to do this direct, very aggressive attack on those flames. And that really helped that containment number go up. The other thing that they're telling me is a priority is getting people back into their homes. Fire officials are very cautious about the fact that the people of this county, Butte County, have gone through a lot. They lived through that 2018 fire, which was the deadliest in California history. And so they want to make sure that all of the people of the county are aware of what's going on and can get back home safely. So, again, it's really the first time that I hear some progress, that I hear some optimism from firefighters. But there's still so much to be done here, Sara.",
