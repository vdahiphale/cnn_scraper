This is very likely to be charged even if he hadn't been on the golf course that day. So whatever Donald Trump says is not going to be interfering with this case. And it does appear the Justice Department is taking this quite seriously, just takes a little time.",

It could take just two days to strengthen into a category three hurricane before hitting Florida's Gulf Coast on Thursday. Sixty-one of Florida's 67 counties are now under a state of emergency. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): We don't know exactly. It hasn't formed yet. There's still some uncertainty. But I think the fact that this would be forecasted as a major at this point without formation shows that this has a potential to be a really, really significant storm. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Right now, three Tufts University lacrosse players are still in the hospital a week after an extreme workout with a graduate of the Navy SEAL Selection and Training Program that's known as BUDS, or Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL training.Initially, nine players went to the hospital after this voluntary 45- minute workout, all with a rare and sometimes life-threatening condition called Rhabdomyolysis. According to the Cleveland Clinic, Rhabdo, as it is known in short, happens when muscles break down, possibly even disintegrate after a strenuous workout. And those broken-down muscle fibers can contain large amounts of elements like potassium and phosphate that then can be released into the bloodstream causing complications with the kidneys. Tufts University says it has postponed team practice and appointed an independent investigator to review the incident. With us now is former Navy SEAL commander, Dan O'Shea. Dan, this is so troubling to learn about. What is your reaction? And what kind of questions does this raise for you when you hear about this? DAN O'SHEA, FORMER NAVY SEAL COMMANDER: Well, to be frank, I'm not surprised. The intensity -- the fact that nine college-age, obviously very fit young men, ended up in the hospital. It's pretty severe. But it's not outside the realm. You know, in training, the SEAL training, especially, Hell Week was designed for preparation for combat because of the stakes. And throughout training, you know, a class would start with 120, 150 students and typically graduate 20,25 over six months. So that kind of attrition rate is pretty normal and pretty standard for anyone who goes through Basic Underwater Demolition School or Navy SEAL training.",

This is a large number of students that this has happened, even after this strenuous workout. What do you think the lessons learned here need to be? O'SHEA: Well, number one, again, there are a lot of factors we don't know about, the humidity, the heat, were they dehydrated, had they not gotten a good night sleep the night before. We don't know all the parameters, so I don't want to read into that. I'm not a doctor. But the reality is SEAL training is very tough. It's -- it's to a standard for a reason because the consequences of what SEALs face in training and in combat. And I mean, the wars of 9-11 in the last 20 odd years, we lost nearly 120 SEALs in combat and in training. And about a quarter of those deaths were in training. So Navy SEAL training, conditioning, it's not for the faint of heart. And it's sometimes not even -- not even ready for college-age fitness as well.",
