But what we also know, as just laid out at the beginning of this show, is that this is anything but a conventional year. The front runner won't even be here, of course. And for reasons that you all just discussed, he will be turning himself in tomorrow for the fourth time in a fourth indictment this year. And in the meantime, there are eight other candidates that are going to be on the stage in the building right behind me that are hoping that this is going to be their moment to shine, that they can perhaps break out, use this moment to become the bone fide Trump alternative. So far, that has been very hard. If you look at national polling, polling in early states, the former president continues to lead these candidates by double digits. But the closest runner up, the person that's been running in second place in that polling is Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has had several resets of his campaign since he launched it back in May, is looking to steady the ship. His team really believes that he is going to be the target of a lot of incoming on that debate stage tonight. And the question for him is, if he can stand up to that and really make his case, is this a moment where he can really solidify -- solidify his place with voters. Now also there on center stage will be Vivek Ramaswamy. And he has lesser name I.D., but he has been rising in the polls and is especially becoming a candidate that people who are very hard right in the Republican Party are looking to. So we will see them there at the debate -- at the center of the debate stage. The rest of the eight candidates will fan out around them. All eight, of course, having to meet both polling and fundraising thresholds to get there on that debate stage. But Poppy and Victor, again, this is just really kind of an X factor. Trump continues to loom over the stage. He won't even be there tonight. And there are so many questions about how these candidates will or won't talk about him. Will DeSantis defend him? Will Chris Christie, who has gone after him numerous times, Asa Hutchinson, will they continue to do that? What will that dynamic look like? And what will it look like tomorrow morning? And so many of these candidates, Poppy and Victor, will be introducing themselves to the American people for maybe the first time.",

So that -- you know, that is a different category than a relatively -- a relative newcomer, who's doing very well in terms of the polls, in part because he is talking about policy and ideas.And I think that's part of the note. This is an opportunity. I've done debate prep. This is in part an opportunity to introduce yourself to the American people. You've got to plant a flag about what you believe. You've got to show some humanity, a sense of humor, but also dig into policy. If policy is too tough for you, don't run for president. Because that's actually what the job is about. That's the debate we should be having. And they -- if you can't take a shot at Donald Trump for trying to overturn a democracy, that's probably a disqualifier, as well. But lean into your own ideas. Plant a flag. Tell people what you stand for. And that will elevate the debate inside the Republican Party and the national as a whole.",

Because this is the kind of stuff that doesn't always get the attention it deserves.Trump yesterday floated this idea of a 10 percent across the board tariff with his formerly free-market advisors Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore. All right? This is protectionism on steroids. The kind of thing which they would have slammed and the Republican Party would have slammed across the board a decade ago, less, as some sort of, you know, Bernie Sanders fantasia. So if Republicans can't take a shot at Donald Trump for the -- you can embrace a more populist economic message. But if you can't take a shot at Donald Trump as a matter of policy on this, it's second only to overturning a democracy. This shouldn't be tough inside a Republican primary. So keep an eye on that.",
