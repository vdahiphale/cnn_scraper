I think it's probably the best way to frame things, but advisers have made clear and have been privately meeting and planning to announce on Tuesday of next week, and the reason that that's important, and it would be through a campaign video, it is not going to be a major rally, but an official start to things, a launch that we have long expected, long been told was coming, but never really had a firm timeline on. That seems to be shifting pretty clearly. That date, on Tuesday is four years to the day from when the President launched his 2020 campaign, the campaign where he defeated Donald Trump, the campaign, which he framed as a battle for the soul of the nation, a battle that the President and his team very clearly believe is still ongoing, and that is a big driver of why the President has long been pushing towards seeking re-election.And one thing when you talk to officials, they make clear behind the scenes, Anderson, there has been an intensive effort underway for several months to build the infrastructure of the likely campaign, there have been significant number of interviews with staffers, there have  been regular meetings between the President's senior team, the President and the First Lady planning for this moment, and they have very much been moving in this direction. The question has always been when, and there have been a lot of questions as to why the President who said late last year that he expected to make a decision early this year, waited this long. Aides have been very clear, they feel very comfortable about where they are, no clear challenges that they're worried about on the Democratic side of things, very happy to let the Republican primary in its nascent kind of place right now continue to play out. But especially with calling donors to Washington late next week, making very clear that the moment is now to start moving to build towards what they know will be a hard fought campaign.",

They recognize that it is an issue.Their view of it, though, is that it is not the prevailing issue for voters. It is not something that is a deciding issue for voters, and that what the President has proven up to this point is that experience matters and experience gets results. Now, they have made clear, they are going to model at least kind of the first year of this campaign, 2023, off of to some degree what President Obama did back in 2011. It is not going to be a full-on blitz every single day to swing States, traveling and the like. It is going to be a build into 2024. There will be a lot of testing on messages, testing on data operations, and on campaign operations. But what you've seen, Anderson, over these first three or four months of this year, it's a pretty good model of what you're going to see in the months ahead. The President has a legislative agenda that's been enacted, an agenda that is currently being implemented right now. You've seen him out in the country, including to a number of swing States talking about specific elements of that agenda that they feel like are underscoring what they've accomplished up to this point and can continue to accomplish. That is going to be a key component of the months ahead, but they're very cognizant of the fact this is going to be a very intense, very tough campaign in 2024 and they will certainly be building toward that.",

He's older than Ronald Reagan when he left office.ABBY PHILLIP, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR OF \"INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY\":        Yes. absolutely. I mean, look, this is going to be an unmistakable part of just who Joe Biden is today, but it also was when he ran for President the first time in 2020, when he was running in a field of all candidates who were younger than him on the Democratic side, some of whom explicitly made his age an issue. So there's clearly a desire in the American public and even in the Democratic electorate to see a changing of the guard, a generational change. But that has been something that Biden and his aides are cognizant of. But they also see evidence based on the results of the 2020 election and the 2022 Midterms that voters are willing to put that aside, even in the short term, if they feel like the alternative is a much bigger problem for them. If they are looking at an alternative to Biden and to the Democratic Party writ large, that they think is too extreme, that they don't think is heading in the direction that they want the country to go in, when you look at the polls in 2022, Biden was facing a worsening economy, people who felt like the country was on the wrong track and approval rating in the low 40s, and still, there was no Republican wave. And I think that's not to say that this is going to be in any way shape or form a walk in the park, but his advisers, I think believe that what that means is that there is a path that does not rely on Biden suddenly convincing Americans that he is a sprite 50-year-old. He is never going to be that. He is always going to be as old as he is, but it is about who and what he's running against.",

He is going to be older as time goes on. And so those things, you know, you have to be cognizant of that and trying to guard against those things. But Anderson, I have to say, you know, all the -- running a campaign is a billion dollar enterprise as Stuart Stevens knows, and it's very complex, it takes a lot of organization, it takes a lot of money, and it takes time to raise that money. So on the one hand, there wasn't any pressure for him to announce because he doesn't have a primary challenger, and the Republicans are kind of hurting themselves right now. But on the other hand, he needs to get going here in terms of doing the organizational things that are necessary to run a very tough and competitive campaign in 2024, and if that, as much as anything has provoked him to make the announcement now.",

You usually want more time in the campaign, and the one thing that every campaign has exactly the same amount of is time. So it's how you use that time. So I think this is smart. I've been very impressed with the whole operation that Biden ran. They reinvented campaigning, really and reinvented the convention. They did a good job. You know, I think Donald Trump is going to be the nominee. I think Ron DeSantis has proven to be smaller than life. You know, the model for big State Republican Governors if you think about it, they get elected President -- Reagan, Bush. They're positive. They're optimistic. They're expansive. And Ron DeSantis is clearly not having fun at this and say what you will about Donald Trump, the guy enjoys the fight. People go to his rallies because it's a spectacle. And there was a question whether or not if he was indicted, it would hurt him or help him. I was always under the impression that it would almost force people to be for Donald Trump in the Republican Party to prove that he was being victimized here, otherwise, they were validating the Big State. So I think this has the potential to shape up to be an unusually long matchup between an incumbent President and Donald Trump.",

If you look at the Wisconsin State Supreme Court referendum, just a few weeks back, even if you look at the 2022 Midterms, younger voters are voting on issues that really matter to them. That's on reproductive rights, on abortion, on guns, on the environment, and when they come out, they can make the difference in close races.But at the same time, what you see from the Biden White House is the window into how they view this. They spent really the first two years trying to make good on as many promises as they could, whether it's on student loans, whether it's on funding for, you know, HBCUs, whether it's on a whole host of issues, the legislative agenda, and in the last several months, three or four months, they've been moving to the center. So I think that what they see here is that they have tried to offer to the base promises kept to a certain degree, whether that will hold until next year, we will see. But they know that they now have to reinforce the middle. And for Joe Biden, that's going to be trying to stop the bleeding for Democrats among White working class voters and keep the suburban strongholds for Democrats in the last several cycles as strong as they possibly can.",

You know, that's the thing that people saw when they looked at him on that State of the Union Address night. That's what the conversation was about for the day's effort, frankly, people were a little surprised that they saw as much sort of cut and thrust from him in that moment.

And, you know, the one thing -- and I think he can be effective doing that. That's what President Obama did in 2011 and 2012, largely pushing an economic agenda that spoke to the kind of voters who Abby was referring to. So I think Biden can do that as well. One point on young voters and progressives, I think that one of their goals was to lock those voters down to the point where you avoid a serious primary challenge. He has been able to do that. I don't anticipate that he's going to have a serious challenge. And in terms of rallying those voters, I think the Republicans are doing a pretty good job of that, by pushing an extreme agenda on abortion, on the gun issue. These are the kinds of things that are going to galvanize younger voters, and they're unlikely to be galvanized in favor of the Republicans at this course and speed.",

In my polling, I've seen that when you give Republican voters a choice about would you rather see government punish businesses that are trying to be too \"woke\"? Or would you rather see businesses as long as they're not breaking the law, they kind of should be able to do what they want. And by a sizable margin, Republicans still do say, I think the free market kind of should just be allowed to do what it wants. And so it's a little bit of a dangerous gamble. Now within a Republican primary, if you can harness those most hardcore supporters, the ones who might be the most upset at say, at Disney, that can benefit you.

Instead, he's tried to push himself to the right of Donald Trump and it remains to be seen, can you actually peel voters off from Donald Trump's right flank?

He was shot in the head.According to a report today by the Louisville Metro Police Foundation, he remains in critical but stable condition. He's also now fighting pneumonia.
