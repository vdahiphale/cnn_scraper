If you look through kind of the course of the day by day schedule of the President, which seems maybe kind of boring or rather benign, it's actually a really good roadmap of what White House officials and their Democratic campaign counterparts are looking at right now.There is a reality, the President's approval rating remains low. There are avenues where Democrats feel like they have an opportunity to boost Democratic turnabout - turnout, boost Democratic enthusiasm. You saw that with the President really trying to elevate the focus on abortion rights earlier this week. You'll see that again on Friday, when the President really has his first major effort to highlight the student loan cancellation executive order he put into place as well. When it comes to the economy, you've seen them take the approach of pointing to kind of small rallies, not massive campaign rallies, but pointing to things that underscore the very real legislative achievements they have. Today, as you noted, the infrastructure bill showing up at that bridge that actually collapsed right before Biden arrived in Pennsylvania in January, you've seen events related to infrastructure, related to their major semiconductor manufacturing legislation as well, kind of across the board. They're not huge. They're not thousands of people, but they're really focusing on what has been delivered and then a somewhat small scale. But you also heard, and this is interesting on these visits, while they may not be major campaign rallies, Victor, you do have opportunities to catch the President as soon as off the record stop. Stopping at a standard sandwich shop with John Fetterman, with Bob Casey, with the Governor as well. And the reporters threw some questions at him and he raised another concern about what might happen if Republicans went. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN Senior Crime &amp; Justice Reporter, Katelyn Polantz, is with us now. So the one-six committee, of course, will be interested in this judge's ruling.

And what's so monumental about this is that the judge spells out emails that he has seen eight emails in particular that he believes could speak to evidence of a crime and believes that those should be released to the House Select Committee made public.John Eastman, Donald Trump's elections attorney should not be able to keep those confidential any longer. So what the judge writes here is he's saying that these eight emails they speak to two different possible crimes. One email regarding a part of a case that was going in Georgia that the Trump lawyers were filing, looking at potentially taking it to the Supreme Court. He writes this email read in context with other documents in this review, make clear that President Trump filed certain lawsuits not to obtain legal relief, but to disrupt or delay the January 6th Congressional proceedings through the courts. The court finds that these four documents are sufficiently related to and in furtherance of the obstruction crime and Judge David O. Carter there not only highlights obstruction as a possible crime that these emails could support, but also believes that these could support a case of fraud.",

We saw the Herschel Walker mentioning Joe Biden every two seconds in that debate with Raphael Warnock. So it makes sense for him to fundraise, focus on the larger accomplishments and then make promises about what would happen if Democrats can maintain power, codify abortion rights, create more jobs in the economy.

So do I want Donald Trump to go and campaign in these states, it probably doesn't help, maybe it hurts among some people. Is the benefit big enough to ask for it? I would say probably not.Now, his new super PAC is spending a little bit of money in some of these states, not a ton, but a little bit of money in some of these states. So I guess, finally, he's released some of the money that he's raised to help - so that's moderately helpful. But overall, it feels like the general wind is blowing in the Republicans' direction. And when that's happening, you don't want to do anything that could change that or get in the way of that. And you would have to ask yourself, is Trump - would Trump's presence there interrupt whatever momentum you might have. Same for Biden, if he goes in and makes a big rally splash in some state, there'll be a lot of people who hold him responsible for the economy that are reminded about why they may be switching back to Republicans this year.",

And in fact, it's interesting, because the time is going to run out on that subpoena very quickly when the Congress ends at the end of December. So it's - this suggests that maybe Trump would be fighting it, whereas if he just sort of were passive about it, nothing might happen.

They think about the double standard that that day represented.And so they have trouble with the relationship of the Republican Party to Donald Trump, even lifelong Republicans. And so I think that if you have those Republicans in that situation, I'm not sure that a bunch of black Democrats are going to be ready to make that switch, but they are saying what is next, right: What's next for the party?

Number two, Donald Trump gets the mob at the capitol to murder Mike Pence and so - or at least they were chanting they wanted to hang him, so I can also understand why you might not want to support somebody whose supporters were most recently seen at the Capitol chanting hang Mike Pence, hang Mike Pence.So look, I think he's running I don't know what lane exists for him. I think about half the Republicans want Trump and about half wants somebody else. The half that wants somebody else right now is pretty fragmented to see if this is the clear front runner on that side. But Mike Pence did his duty on January 6th. He's got a lifetime of service to the Republican Party. He's earned every right to run. I expect him to do that. I don't know how far he's going to get, but he's obviously a good man.
