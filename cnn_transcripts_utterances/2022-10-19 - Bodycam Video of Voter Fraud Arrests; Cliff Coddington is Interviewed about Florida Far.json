And then, if he does not comply with the return date, it goes to the Justice Department to prosecute as a criminal case if justice wishes to do that.

Five facilities in Lee County will resume classes in a host school today. Some of the schools will split between two host locations due to the number of the students there. Other students will temporarily learn virtually. And in the wake of Hurricane Ian, Florida farmers hit hard by the storm are trying to figure out how to move forward. Their lands, their livelihoods and crops are now among the storm's casualties. And that's on top of the pressure from inflation driving up the cost of business. Joining me now to discuss a Cliff Coddington. He's a sixth-generation farmer with cattle and citrus groves who saw floodwaters cover parts of his farmland during Iran. Cliff, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us today. I know you said shortly after Hurricane Ian that these -- this season's crop was completely destroyed.
