The Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security told congressional briefings on the Trump assassination attempt. There will be one briefing for all members of the House. Unclassified phone briefing for all senators were told.A short time ago, we learned that the Department of Homeland Security has opened up an investigation into the Secret Service and the lapse in security at the rally site. In an interview with CNN, the agency's director backed away from earlier claims that appear to blame local police. Here's what she told our Whitney Wild. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KIMBERLY CHEATLE, U.S. SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR: Secret Service respects local law enforcement and we could not do our job either investigatively or on our protective mission without them. In Pennsylvania, in fact, on that same day, they were also working the first lady trip and a vice presidential trip. So, I understand the constraints that they're under. And as I said earlier, we couldn't do our job without them. At that particular site, we divided up areas of responsibility, but this but the Secret Service is solely responsible for the design and the implementation and the execution of the site.

In just a moment, we'll go live to the crime scene in Pennsylvania.But first, let's look into the alleged assassination plot by Iran. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in London with the latest reporting, Fred, I mean, there's been so much news we've been drinking from a firehose that I mean, you do have to pause for a moment and consider the magnitude of this, this accusation by U.S. intelligence that Iran was plotting to assassinate a former president of the United States. How is Iran responding at this point?",

I think one of the things that was that was quite interesting about this alleged plot is that the U.S. apparently got this U.S. intelligence apparently got this from a human source unclear whether inside Iran or outside Iran, of course, absolutely unclear also, in what sort of stage this plot may have been the Iranians reacting quite angrily. They're calling this a malicious and saying that it's not true.However, the Iranians are also saying that they believe after the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, that they have every right to go after former President Trump and the others who organized that assassination. However, they say that they want to do that by going through an international legal system or an international court of law. I want to listen into some Iran's current foreign minister had to say in an exclusive interview with their own Fareed Zakaria. Let's listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALI BAGHERI KANI, IRANIAN ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): The Americans openly said that that they assassinated the senior Iranian military commander, so it is our natural rights in order to follow these issues, and those who are accused in this case, they should be brought to justice in a just court.

Obviously, also extremely important, confronting the U.S. in Iraq, some of the things that happened there.But at the time of his assassination, he wasn't only the top General of the Quds Force, which is, of course, an arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. But he was getting more and more involved in regional politics as well, whether it was Iraq, whether it was Syria and other places. So he was becoming more of an important figure on the political scene in Iran as well, when all of this happens. So as you can imagine, it was a huge blow to the Iranians and certainly to Iran's military leadership, Jim.",

In the meantime, he's in Butler, Pennsylvania, where all of this happened. Danny this morning, we're learning that the Secret Service is facing even more scrutiny from the Department of Homeland Security.

This is in addition to the FBI that is also investigating what unfolded at that rally over the weekend.Now, I should say, Jim, you noted this at the top this all comes as we are now hearing more from the director of the Secret Service. CNN's Whitney Wild spoke to her yesterday last evening, and the director of the Secret Service said that their agency is solely responsible for the implementation and execution of security at this site behind me. So as you alluded to, perhaps turning the temperature down when it came to that blame game that started towards the beginning of this week. But Jim, I also want to note that we're learning a little bit more about what was happening in the lead up really to this shooting that happened on Saturday. First, we know when we reported yesterday that there was a local counter sniper team that was inside one of the buildings in this complex behind me they were looking out of second story windows towards the campaign event. But then the other thing, Jim is we've also learned a little bit more information about the movements of Thomas Matthew Crooks. CNN's John Miller confirming through law enforcement sources that Thomas Crooks gained access to the roof by climbing hoisting himself up on an air conditioning unit, I believe you're looking at pictures, where you can see amongst this sprawling AGR complex where that air conditioning unit might be. And that's how Thomas Crooks was able to get up on top of that roof and get to his perch where he ultimately opened fire at former President Donald Trump. So again, still questions that we have about why that roof specifically was not secured. But we're getting at least a little more information as to how he got to that spot, Jim.",

What drove Thomas Crooks to that rooftop. The FBI and law enforcement agencies that we've been speaking with still do not have a clear idea, even after coming through a number of witnesses, interviews, his phone, his search history, but we're trying to piece together a little bit of what could have caused this motivation.One of our affiliates WPXI here in Pittsburgh, or just say just south of here in Pittsburgh, they were able to speak with a former guidance counselor, who worked with Crooks. Take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIM KNAPP, GUNMAN'S HIGH SCHOOL GUIDANCE COUNSELOR: At first, it didn't register until I saw the picture.

This element of he was quiet, he kept to himself. He was perhaps a bit of an outcast in his high school, at least, but still, none of that really giving any clarity to what the motivation was behind actually pulling a gun out and firing at the former president of United States. Jim. ACOSTAAnd tonight, Senator J.D. Vance will take the stage at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and introduce himself to the American people for the first time as Donald Trump's running mate. Sources tell CNN that his speech will focus on his life story the rags to riches memoir that he wrote documented in the memoir Hillbilly Elegy, it's a story the Trump campaign thinks could win over a key demographic. One source telling CNN quote, If you want to crack suburban women get them to watch Hillbilly Elegy his life story is so powerful, at least that's their take on all of this. Let's bring in CNN's Abby Phillip, she's on site at the RNC. Abbey, we're going to have to watch the speech unfold tonight. Because I mean, for all of the talk of let's unify the country and so on in the aftermath of the events last weekend. You and I both have seen the rhetoric coming out of the Republican National Convention and hasn't exactly always been unifying. And then Donald Trump's selection of J.D. Vance suggests that we are going to be getting back to some pretty hyper partisan, bitter personal attacks in the next several weeks of this campaign when you have J.D. Vance blaming Democrats for what took place this past weekend. Unpack it all for us. What do you think?",

Vance was trying to bring attention to his allegiance to Donald Trump by ramping up the rhetoric.Now, in the aftermath of this assassination attempt, does all of that change? He's going to have a massive audience tonight to address the American public to introduce himself. Does he take a different tone? Is this going to be an attempt to present J.D. Vance as the face of MAGA in a way that is perhaps more palatable than Donald Trump given, frankly, the baggage that Trump comes with? Jim, I have with me here, the Director of Strategic Communications for Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, Marc Lotter. Marc also, we should say, has been in the position that J.D. Vance's staff is in right at this very moment. He's been with the Republican nominee for the vice presidency, Mike Pence, back in 2016, when he was in this role. And in the lead up to a moment like this, Marc, what is happening in J.D. Vance's world, he's got to give a speech. He's only known for about two days now that he's the nominee. So how are they making that speech something that he can really deliver convincingly before this crowd? MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, TRUMP 2020: Well, as someone who works with a lot of speech writers, thank God, he wrote a memoir, you can just take his own words for that. But you know, most likely I don't know for sure. But going back to 2016, the campaign has already engaged a speech writer to begin work on that speech, they will give it to Senator Vance's team for review, and then it's up to the senator and his team to take a look at it, rework it, put it into his own words, add his own personal touches to it. But the challenge for any vice presidential nominee when you join the ticket is that at the same time, you're being announced suddenly, and then your record, all of everything that has been built over the course of your public life is now going to be used by the opposition, and who are trying to attack you for it. So you have to defend yourself against those attacks. You're also now, you know, everything you do at this convention is under a microscope, you now have a Secret Service protection bubble around you. You're meeting new staff for the first time --",

And he said so and now he has come over, he's actually looked at the policies, look at the records of President Biden, President Trump, their plans for the future. And I think being able to go into the swing states talk to undecided voters and say, look, I was one of you. I had my concerns.But when I look at these things, the records the policy, the vision for the future, I decided that the American first movement, the America first agenda, was the right way to go. And now I'm proud to be standing here. But I'm also telling you, it's OK for you to come on board now to. It's almost a validation for an undecided voter. Look, there are people who are single issue voters on both sides, especially on the abortion issue that are -- that that is their issue, I think, for a broad majority of folks in the suburbs. So they're also concerned about inflation. They're concerned about illegal immigration. They're concerned about the wars that are raging around the world right now.
