      "sentences": "Hey, Max, look, it seems like all the parties here have a vested interest in this truce being extended, but it seems quite delicate on the ground. Especially when you consider the fact that yesterday there was exchanges of fire between Hamas and IDF soldiers inside of Gaza.The Israelis say that there were two explosives that were detonated at two separate troop locations, and that Hamas opened fire as well. They returned fire, no serious injuries on the Israeli side. Hamas tells the story somewhat differently, saying that this was a field skirmish and that fighters dealt with it. It also says that Israel was clearly in violation of this truce. And that look, it is willing to go along with this truce so long as its enemy, Israel, is willing to do the same. Israel has made quite clear though that it is gearing up for the second phase of this war, which is obviously hanging over the heads of Hamas, who are pushing for a -- this truce, turning into a more permanent ceasefire. The talks to extend this obviously are as ongoing, as you mentioned, inside of -- in Doha, in Qatar. And the expectation, Max, is that if everything goes well today with the release of 10 more Israeli hostages held in Gaza that Hamas will offer another list of another 10 hostages for tomorrow, and this could be extended. But there are only enough hostages, women, and children, at least to extend this for another two days. Beyond that, we are talking about men, civilians and we are also talking about Israeli soldiers, some of whom are female. And at the moment Hamas says that there are no talks -- there have been no talks to actually exchange any soldiers. And it describes two different scenarios. Hamas says you could have a partial deal, which would deal with the civilians or a comprehensive deal which would deal with the soldiers. But it is demanding a much higher price for those soldiers, something that Israel has made clear it is not willing to pay at this stage, meaning emptying all of the prisons in Israel of Palestinian prisoners -- Max.",

But U.S. officials are urging Israel to be more precise when targeting Hamas militants and infrastructure amid growing outrage over a soaring death toll. Almost 15,000 killed, mostly civilians, in less than two months, according to the Hamas controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza. CNN's Alexander Marquardt reports senior officials have been in daily contact with their Israeli counterparts, urging more caution. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Could Israel start its military operations up in Gaza again, or will Hamas continue to release hostages?The hope by the Biden administration is that the pause does continue and more hostages continue to come out. The quiet goes on for a bit longer, they hope, and more aid goes into Gaza to deal with the really catastrophic humanitarian situation. Tuesday saw the CIA director Bill Burns in the Qatari capital of Doha, to work on just that. He has become President Biden's point man on all hostage issues. Meeting in Doha with Qatari officials and his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts. Burns's goal was also to try to broaden the negotiations to more than just women and children and to try to get men and Israeli soldiers out. Which everyone agrees will be much more difficult. The Biden administration is also urging Israel that if they start their operations up again militarily in Gaza, which they say they will, to be much more careful, to be more cautious, more surgical, and precise. To try to minimize the often-deadly impact on Gazan civilians, most of whom are now displaced. Alex Marquardt, CNN Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Yes, good morning, Max. I think you're right. You know, the challenge is Hamas does not hold all of them. But you know, as we've talked about before, information is being gleaned from all of the hostages that have been released. Every one of them is being debriefed by intelligence professionals. Information is being developed. Identifying and trying to locate each of those hostages, even the ones who are not present with Hamas, their absence indicates they're probably with another group.So, you can focus collection on Palestinian Islamic Jihad at that point. Or you can talk about any chatter that is going on amongst the guards or Hamas leaders as you're being held. So, all of those things are being elicited during debriefs. And will play into the intelligence picture.",

At some point, Hamas is going to run out of women and children -- if I can put it like that -- to release and we're going to move on to men, aren't we? And ultimately IDF serving soldiers. So presumably Hamas will ask for a higher price for those. An extension of the truce, perhaps, or more Palestinian prisoners in return.O'LEARY: Yes, so I think that's where we're going to get to the sticking point, unfortunately. Right now, it, you know, it's pragmatic and practical for both sides, both Hamas and Israel and the international community to try to get as many hostages out as we can. The women and children, I think we will probably accomplish and I think having Director Burns from the CIA over there, who's a consummate diplomat, knows the region. He's very effective. In this region and with groups like Hamas, I think there's a likelihood we're going to get it extended. We'll probably get all the women and children out. And I think it's reasonable to think we'll probably be able to get anybody with a medical condition out or who has been wounded. So, I'm hopeful to see that, especially American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who lost his arm during it. But I think we're really going to hit a difficult decision point with getting other men and IDF soldiers out. Because, you know, this is a commodity for Hamas and it provides them with power leverage and human shields and gives them the ability to protract this, this crisis.",

How do you think Israel, the U.S. may look at that sort of trade when it comes to the IDF soldiers?O'LEARY: Yes, I think you hit the nail on the head, Max. You know, that's their anchor point in this negotiation for Hamas. You know, they are -- will be asking to release over 7,000 Palestinians from Israeli jails, and we're talking about the worst of Hamas and other affiliated groups, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, PFLP. These are terrorists. These are not people who were detained because of maybe suspicious activity. These are people who've conducted acts. So that's a price that's going to be nearly impossible to pay for Israel. I would also advise against it. If Hamas comes out this victorious on the other side, it's only going to empower their movement, their ideology, erode any control that Fatah may still have on the West Bank and you know it's going to protract this, the Arab Israeli conflict for years to come. Israel needs to accomplish both of their stated goals, which is to find and release the hostage. And I think some are going to require rescue, but also the dismantling of Hamas. And as you were pointing to just a little bit earlier -- that requires discipline, precision targeting, a counterterrorism approach when they turn back on military operations. Where you're going after Hamas architecture and leadership. Gathering intelligence as you're doing that on each raid. You're doing sensitive site exploitation. You're interviewing the detainees you take off. You're exploiting all that material that you find that allows you to continue to target other Hamas leadership and also finding out the hostages during that process.",

But also, to make sure that the flow of trucks and supplies continues. That this is not -- that this becomes a new normal where we now have 240 trucks a day going in. That's still only a small fraction of the kinds of supplies that flowed in before this war began. So, sustaining that flow, increasing it further, getting more fuel, more winterization supplies as the climate changes. All of that is going to be absolutely critical.I convened my international counterparts from all around the world and implored them to increase the amount of funding they provide to UN agencies and non-governmental organizations so that cash and actual resources don't become a limiting factor here. It had been that the inspections and getting supplies in were the limiting factors. You'd hate to see it be just a shortage of money on the part of the World Food Program, or UNICEF for other partners. So that is key to getting again those that that flow going. But it will be ultimately inadequate without commercial traffic as well accompanying humanitarian traffic. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
