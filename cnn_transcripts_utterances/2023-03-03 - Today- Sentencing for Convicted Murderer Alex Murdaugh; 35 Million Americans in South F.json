SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Christine. Look, the White House says that there's no question that the two men will discuss how to ramp up, how to accelerate aid to Ukraine. And it seems that they need it. Things are becoming increasingly difficult in the eastern part of the country, particularly this strategically important and extremely well-fortified town of Bakhmut, where Russians now appear to have a toehold in the town itself. They have also managed to bomb a key bridge, cutting off one of the last remaining supply routes that the Ukrainians have in and out. And now, a drone reconnaissance unit, the Ukrainian drone reconnaissance unit has been ordered to withdraw from the town. The Ukrainians have vowed to fight in Bakhmut, but they say not at any cost. Now, of course, tanks, western tanks are on the way to Ukraine in coming months, but this aid package that you mentioned, Christine, is unlikely to have more tanks or fighter jets that Ukrainians have asked for. Instead, it is back to basics, more of the shells and ammunition that they will surprise the weapons that the Ukrainians already have. One of the concerns here is that the Ukrainians are actually firing ammunition on the battlefield faster than the West can produce it. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said last month look, production in the west of ammunition ought to be something that is constant, not reactionary, depending on the state of the war at any given point. This is actually Olaf Scholz's first trip to Washington since the beginning of the full scale invasion and a lot has changed in the last year. You'll remember that the Germans were pretty hesitant at the outset of the war to send any real significant weapons, now they are committed to sending tanks, but it seems that they are drawing the line at a fighter jets, and that is where the U.S. president seems to be at this point, as well. Though, Ukrainian defense minister said in an interview published yesterday that he believes that it is only a matter of time before the West comes around when it comes to fighter jets. Christine.",
