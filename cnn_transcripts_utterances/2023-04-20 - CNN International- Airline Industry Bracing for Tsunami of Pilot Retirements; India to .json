The head of the Regional Airline Association that represents the smaller airlines that operate flights between small cities and big hubs, says that in the next 15 years 50 percent of all airline pilots will be forced to retire. That means delays and cancelations, he says, will go up. The number of flights will go down and some cities will lose service entirely.There are some controversial solutions emerging here. And Faye Malarkey Black, the head of the Regional Airline Pilots Association, nods her head to the fact that there could be a raising of the retirement age right now. The mandatory retirement for airline pilots is set at 65. [04:35:00] It could go up to 67 or there could be a change at the bottom for new airline pilots changing the requirement be 1,500 hours that they need to start at a regional airline.

      "sentences": "Good question there, Max. And this is an undesirable global title that India clearly doesn't want, but it has come its way. And it's very important to understand and put this into perspective. It's not that India's population growth has been going up leaps and bounds, in fact, the population growth of both China and India have been going down. It's been decreasing at a slow pace, especially China over the last year. You've had those discussions with our correspondents there as well.But there's a stark contrast and it's very important to understand that and here's what it is. In India over 60 percent of the population is under the age of 30. That makes it a massive workforce community that's raring to go to work. But of course, opportunities need to come their way. But with China that labor force has been shrinking. They have people who are now of retirement age or beyond and that population of the older generation is only increasing by the year in China. Now very quickly, I just want to put up a few graphics for you. According to the United Nations, India's population growth will continue to increase until the year 2060. That's when it's actually going to cross 1.7 billion. It stands at 1.4 billion currently. Staggering growth fest, staggering numbers. But also, let's just try and understand what's really left to this and what are the numbers that we're talking about when it comes to India. Well, India's population has grown by a billion over the last 73 years. That's where it stands. Along with that, like I said, you have more than half of India's population under the age of 30. And more than 40 percent of India's population under the age of 25. The birth rate is going down. But this is the crux of it. India has an opportunity here to make the most of its dynamic young population under the age of 30 -- 60 percent like I said. But economists say this is an opportunity for policymakers to make or break when it comes to providing employment opportunities. Here's what an economist had to say to us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
