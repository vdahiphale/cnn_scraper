      "sentences": "Good day, I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. Welcome, it isMonday, October 9, 11 am here in Washington, 6 pm in Israel. And we begin our breaking news coverage there we are just learning that Israel says it's attacked 130 Hamas targets with dozens of planes over the course of the last three hours as a devastatingly bloody war has erupted. The Israeli Defense Minister says he's given the order to begin a \"complete siege\" three days after Hamas launched an attack by land, air and sea. Major blasts rocked Gaza just minutes ago. Israeli airstrikes raining down on the Palestinian enclave these days after the co-ordinated attack by Hamas, Israel says Islamist militants killed 700 people. The Israeli response to this weekend's attack also coming, on the ground heavy armor and troops have been moving south. But any ground offensive will be complicated by Hamas and its allies holding hostages. The Islamist militants in Gaza claimed to be holding more than 100 captives. And that's on top of Palestinian civilians on the ground, who will likely be caught up in any fighting. Palestinian officials say more than 500 people have already been killed in Israeli strikes. All this as rocket fire from Gaza continues. Many of the rockets have been intercepted, but some have landed in Israeli territory. You can see the damage here where charred vehicles litter this street in Southern Israel. And it's not just the south there are growing concerns Lebanese militant group Hezbollah will enter the conflict and threaten Israel's northern frontier. Israel says it's already killed armed suspects who entered from the Lebanese side. And it says its helicopters are striking inside Lebanese territory. U.N. forces have reported explosions near a town on the Lebanese side of the border. For the latest CNN's Becky Anderson is live in Tel Aviv, Israel. Becky, how have things been unfolding you and I last spoke around 5 am Eastern time. A quite a lot has happened since.",

I've got line of sight down the road towards Gaza from here about 50 milesand I've got line of sight towards Northern Israel here the Lebanese border and we are in central Israel. As I said in Tel Aviv, where we have continued to hear all day that kind of low level rumblings, booms, the Iron Dome, intercepting incoming rockets from Gaza fired by Hamas towards Tel Aviv in Ben Gurion Airport. We've got some evidence this morning when an engineer was coming in that there was an explosion just south of the airport here. Everybody hit the deck there. And so you know, the intensity of this, I think is really the story of the hour in and the fact that we have Gaza in play Tel Aviv and Jerusalem hearing sirens, because there are incoming attacks or incoming rockets from Hamas and then to the north here, the potential for something significant happening on the Lebanese-Israeli border. It is a ratcheting up there is no doubt in what is this very bloody conflict, Kasie.",

And there are reports coming from the Israeli medical service that several people were injured on the outskirts of Jerusalem. It's not clear if that was an impact, or, as I've seen myself before, when the Iron Dome intercepts incoming missiles, there's a lot of shrapnel that falls to the ground. So that may have been the cause for those injuries as this conflict intensifies. What we have heard so far today, for instance, that you have Golan to the Israeli Defense Minister has ordered what he called a complete siege on Gaza. Cutting off all food, electricity and fuel to a place where 2 million people are living now, according to the World Food Programme 63 percent of the population of Gaza is, \"food insecure\". The Israelis are of course preparing by all accounts for a massive ground incursion invasion into Gaza, sending lots of armor in that direction. Now, it's not clear how far they're going to go. But certainly in 2008, 2009, when there was a prolonged outbreak of violence between Gaza and Israel. The Israelis did cut the Gaza strip in half, but they avoided going into population centers in 2014, Israeli forces entered the Gaza Strip. But yet again, avoided going into population centers. Now the expectation is, this time, given the gravity of the situation, the Israeli operation in Gaza will be much more extensive. It may take time for that to happen. But of course, what we're seeing is that there are, according to the Israelis today. So far 130 strikes in Gaza, they say on Hamas targets, but what we've seen is that they seem to be having done away with what's known as the knock on the roof where a small explosive device is directed at the building, they plan on hitting a sort of a warning shot for people to leave. Sometimes the Israelis will actually call people in the building and tell them to evacuate. It doesn't seem to be happening. At the moment in Jabalia in the northern part in the Jabalia refugee camp in Northern Gaza. There was a strike earlier today the extent of damage from the videos we're seeing is massive. There's talk of as many as 50 people being killed in that strike alone. And I think the expectation people of Gaza are that this is just the beginning of what's going to be a very long and difficult period.",

And we haven't even seen all the pictures yet. That the mood in Israel is very different than it's been in the past. David spoke very well about the price that Israel would pay if it went in, and especially if it stayed there. But Israel is now willing to take prices to take costs and to also, you know, take prices also from the Gazans, unfortunately, that it wasn't in the past. And so we could definitely see a massive invasion. We might also see even an attempt to take down Hamas, which is something as well as never done since Hamas took over the Gaza Strip, taking -- and taking over the Gaza Strip. We've seen Israel live with Hamas, of course, an enemy, but at least in the dress they can deal with. Now, a lot of things have changed in Israel.

Usually, they've been so good at this, that they have picked out ships or a bomb maker who was you know, driving to work that failed. And finally, when the events actually happened, the response was strikingly slow. So you've got Israeli institutions at this moment that as an autonomous pointed out, you know, is bringing the country together.

Israel responded very badly. This was a debacle. But it's also going to come back it is way stronger than Hamas. And I say this with deep regret. It's going to be terrible in the Gaza Strip in the coming days. I say that was zero Glee, this is going to be absolutely horrendous.

We have now heard from some family members who say some of these hostages are as young as nine months old. So we're talking about babies that have been taken. Hamas says that these hostages are being held in locations across Gaza. But as we watch these very, very heavy airstrikes, literally flattened buildings in Gaza, you have to wonder, what is happening with these hostages? Where are they? Now essentially, by putting them in different locations around Gaza, Hamas is using them as human shields against these airstrikes. But you cannot watch what's happening in Gaza right now without wondering what will happen to these hostages. And also that makes it even more likely that there will be a ground incursion by the Israeli military. Because how can you rescue hostages necessarily from the air? I have a feeling there will be a ground incursion there. Meanwhile, actually out here in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, we've had our share of sirens again today, rockets were fired towards Jerusalem. And there were actually several injuries including a 10 year old boy who is in I believe, serious condition according to medical officials here. It is very strange to hear sirens in Jerusalem with this intensity. This is where the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is, or also known as temple mount to the Jews. This is where so many holy places are and rockets coming this way. Normally, Jerusalem is sort of kept out of this situation, or there might get a few rockets stored up to the suburbs around it. It is very unusual to hear rockets exploding over our head in Jerusalem, just because of the chance that one of these rockets could land on these holy sites in the middle of Jerusalem in the Old City.",

They often use this sort of early period of sunset, to try to use that little bit of darkness to see what they're doing. But also try to evade being spotted firing out rockets. It's not clear that they'll do it at this time tonight that might be just a little predictable. But it wouldn't be surprising if they did.

I think he needs to communicate that there's a vast difference between the two sides here. Terrorism has meaning. Terrorism means targeting civilians with violence to achieve a political end, intentional targeting, that is what Hamas has done. It is not what the Israeli Defense Forces were seeing these attacks in Gaza. Israel is trying their best to target military targets, as Nic reported, right, rocket launchers.

I want to bring in for you at this stage, Kim Ghattas, who is in Beirut. Kim, you know the ratcheting up of what we are seeing here in Israel, and in Gaza to this northern border of Israel.

So this is getting rather tense on Lebanon's southern borders, Israel's northern border, and it could develop. However, for now there's a sense that Hezbollah will not want to escalate further that this is still part of a very carefully choreographed dance, a deadly dance sometimes between Hezbollah and Israel, where Hezbollah can say that it is there in support of its Palestinian brothers. And it has issued statements to that effect, saying that it is there in support of its Palestinian brothers. But aiming very carefully and limiting the room of maneuver of the groups operating on the southern border in a way that is also understood by the Israelis.

We've had a lot of talk over the last few weeks about advancement in the talks between or the possibility of normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. This events, these events, these violent events over the last few days make very clear what Hamas, Iran and Hezbollah think of that. And all their statements have made clear that this is a response to those normalization efforts. However, as everybody's been reporting, there is no evidence of any Iranian involvement in the planning of the attack that took place by Hamas on Saturday. There is a long standing relationship that has been strengthened between Hamas and Iran over the last few, over the last year or so it gets weapons and arms and money from Iran. But it's been interesting to see even the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken say that although there is a long relationship between the two sides, there is no evidence of a direct involvement. I think everybody wants to try to stop this from spilling over. But the very immediate consequences, of course, are what is going to happen in Gaza. And it is distressing to hear the language coming out of Israel, talking about Palestinians as human animals, talking about a siege that is going to deprive Gaza of electricity, food and water. Half the population are children. The collective punishment approach does not work. And sadly, I see echoes of past campaigns going all the way up to 1982 in Lebanon, when then Defense Minister Ariel Sharon wanted to remove the PLO from Lebanon invaded all the way up to Beirut. But instead what happened, he invited Iran into the conflict. That was the birth of Iran's involvement in all of this.",
