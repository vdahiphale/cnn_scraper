That is all now part of the crime scene.We're seeing investigators coming in and out of the house. This weekend they searched all the cars. They're going through hundreds and hundreds of tips. They've interviewed about 90 people and you know, they're ruling people out. They say the people that made that 911 call, the roommates, they are not suspects. They've also ruled out a couple of other people, but of course, the question remains, who is responsible then? Police even saying that this has been difficult for them. Here is the captain overseeing this investigation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAPT. ROGER LANIER, MOSCOW, IDAHO POLICE: It's been very hard for members of the community, and it's been equally difficult for our officers and for the investigators. We will continue to put all of our resources towards investigating and bringing this to a resolution. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianna, and there's a number of really kind of troubling and challenging things that have taken place so far. So, you would have to first look at the misinformation, the kind of chaotic way they addressed things, like whether or not there was a threat to the community. They initially said there was not, and now course they've backed off of that. They initially stated that that they thought it was a crime of passion.It was a comment that was made very, very early on in the investigation. It caused many of us who have had time investigating things like this to kind of wonder how you could draw that conclusion. They seemed to have backed away from that as well. I've also been struck by some of the things they've said about ruling out some potential suspects. So, they've already made public statements that they've ruled out involvement by any of the other roommates who were present at the location at the time of the crime. The other individuals who responded the next morning before the 911 call was made, and I think the driver who brought the two girls home to their residence the night before just before. So, it's really curious. It at least raises the possibility that they have started this investigation, maybe been overwhelmed by it to some degree. They've certainly fired some stray voltage off in terms of their public statements and that's never a really good sign for a well-organized, well-executed investigation.",
