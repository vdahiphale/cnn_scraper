Some tornadoes could be strong, widespread damaging winds and large hail as well. Look out for that.

State media releasing video of Moscow's troops pitting a Ukrainian armored vehicle in Bakhmut, the city devastated by months of relentless fighting. Here, mercenaries from the Wagner private military company show off a destroyed U.S.-made M777 howitzer while Wagner foot soldier pose in a Bakhmut suburb.

PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Wagner mercenaries are the spearhead of Russia's invasion force in Bakhmut. Prigozhin claims they are making progress, but often lack the ammunition to advance. PRIGOZHIN (through translator):  I will say that a system needs to be worked out. I hope that the system will start functioning soon, and we will be getting ammunition regularly. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  The U.S. and Ukraine say the attrition rate among Wagner's assault groups, often made up of prisoners recruited from Russian jails, is as high as 80%.
