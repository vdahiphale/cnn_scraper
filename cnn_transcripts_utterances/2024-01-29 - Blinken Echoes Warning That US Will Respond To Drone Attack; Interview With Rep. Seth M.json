We are keeping them honest. Plus, convicted killer, Alex Murdaugh in court asking for a retrial. What a judge made of his evidence. Good evening. We begin tonight with the Biden administration promising a serious response to this weekend's drone attack in Jordan, which killed three American soldiers and wounded more than 40 others. This afternoon, the Pentagon identified the fallen soldiers: Sergeant William Rivers, 46 years old; 24-year-old Specialist Kennedy Sanders; and specialist Breonna Moffett who was 23. US officials said the drone that killed them may have come in just behind an American drone that was landing in the American outpost at the time. As for who is responsible, it is still unclear. Here is what a Pentagon spokesman said about possible Iranian involvement earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That could be a signal that they don't seek any direct escalation with the US.It is important for our viewers to keep in mind, Anderson, this is the first deadly attack where enemy fire has killed US troops. But there have been more than 150 attacks on US troops in Iraq, in Syria, in Jordan now as well, since October. So it's not clear if the intention of this one was to be more damaging or to be more deadly, or if it was simply bad luck, in a sense, as you explained that US drone flying low. We have also heard from a couple of Iran-backed militias in Iraq, one claiming responsibility for a number of attacks along the Jordanian- Syrian border earlier in those early hours of Sunday morning, another saying that there will continue to be attacks against US forces in Iraq and Syria as long as they remain in the region. The Jordanians, of course, who are an ally of the US have called it a terrorist attack. And while they have been very vocal in condemning Israel's military campaign in Gaza, they have also been vocal about their desire to try to contain this conflict to try to prevent it from spreading further. And so the emphasis now from most nations appears to be on trying to limit this and prevent it from becoming a full blown regional conflagration -- Anderson.",

      "sentences": "All right, Clarissa, stay with us.I want to bring in CNN military analyst, retired Army Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. So General Hertling, first of all, what's your reaction to this attack? Because I think a lot of people have the idea that this is Iran making this decision to attack this base? It may be much more complicated than that, right? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Oh, yes, certainly, Anderson. First of all, if you don't mind, I'm going to give our condolences to the families of Sergeant Rivers, Specialist Sanders and Specialist Moffett. It's horrible when you lose soldiers like that, and have so many of them wounded at the same time, but it gives you an indication of how this incident may have happened. Clarissa is exactly right. There are things that happen when drones are returning -- friendly drones are returning to a base. The air defense weapons go on what they call either weapons hold or weapons tight, which means the people who fire those weapons do not fire them, because they know there's an incoming friendly aircraft. Whether or not an Iranian drone or a proxy drone came into that following the US drone, whoever is suggesting that this early 24 hours after the investigation, doesn't know what they're talking about just yet. You know, first reports are always wrong. I'd say I've done hundreds of investigations on these kinds of things and what we learn in the first 24 hours isn't going to be sustainable throughout the entire investigation. But the third thing is, as Clarissa said, this is an extremely small base. Those soldiers are living something called CHUs -- containerized housing units. They're like a small mobile trailer. You can get anything through there. They're not armor protected. It's just not impossible to do that. So having this many soldiers injured or hurt or killed, the three soldiers killed mean that that drone struck in one place and had a blast radius that caused all of these casualties. You can't avoid these kinds of incidents. you know, a lot of people think the battlefield is perfect. You push a button and everything happens the way you want it to. That's not the way it goes in combat. And unfortunately, as Clarissa said, this is a small base. Those were all Army reservists from the state of Georgia. I'm sure that unit is suffering as well as their families back home, and it is just a horrific incident.",

Historically, we've seen them always go for the kind of Goldilocks option, that carefully calibrated, it's forceful, it's significant, it sends a strong message, but it doesn't escalate this conflict further.I think there's even more pressure in this moment because the entire region is on tenterhooks, but also because if you look at the sort of Biden administration's military campaign against the Houthis, which has been significant, which has been ongoing, but which really hasn't done anything to rein in the attacks that we have seen these Houthi militants carrying out on shipping channels in the Red Sea. And so there is a lot more pressure, if you will, on the Biden administration to really deliver a significant blow or have a significant impact. But again, do you do that by targeting an Iranian- backed militia in Iraq or Syria? Do you do it by sending a message to Iran and attacking Iranian soil? That hasn't happened, by the way since 1980, so that would be a significant escalation. Iran has signaled by sort of distancing themselves from this, that they are not seeking that kind of direct escalation. But it remains to be seen what kind of a message the Biden administration will send with this response.",

SETH MOULTON (D-MA): Well, I mean, look, the General and Clarissa are right that what we are trying to achieve is deterrence. Deterrence is hard, but war is worse, Anderson, and we don't want to get involved in a direct war with Iran. That would play right into our enemy's hands. So what the Biden administration is trying to do is find a way to send a clear and decisive message to these militant groups, that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated. We're not going to stand for it. But at the same time, we're not going to allow them to instigate a war that will not only play into our enemy's hands in the Middle East, but frankly, it's just what Russia and China want as well.

And you said, none of these nations want a wider war. But these militant groups, these terrorists, they do want a wider war and it sounds like some of these Republicans do as well. That's playing into our enemy's hands. That's not what we need to do. And let's also not forget that many of these Republicans, some of them actually served in Republican administrations over the last 20 years. Over 20 years, we've had Iranian proxy groups killing US troops in the Middle East. When I was on the ground in Iraq, we were losing hundreds of US servicemen a year to Iranian proxy groups. And under Democratic and Republican administrations, they all tried to find this balance, sending a message to Iran that you can't keep doing this while not starting a wider war.

Not unless there's a Trump victory in November. The former president posting on social media today: \"A border bill is not necessary to stop the millions of people, many from jails and mental institutions located all over the world that are pouring into our country. It is an invasion the likes of which no country has ever had to endure.\" It is worth noting this is not the first time the former president has said people from mental institutions are pouring into the country. He said something similar the night he won the New Hampshire primary. Our factchecker, Daniel Dale called the Trump campaign for evidence, they had none. As for the other language he used in that post that it's an invasion and an existential threat, but that Congress doesn't need to do anything about it. That's what he's saying. It doesn't make much sense unless he clears it up, which he does two postings later. Quoting again from the former president: \"I didn't need a big complex Democrat oriented border bill.\" And here's the key phrase, \"... which will make Republicans look bad.\" Now, there's no evidence that it would and there's plenty of evidence it would not, that is if you believe Senator Lankford, \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial board, President Biden, and plenty of Democrats unhappy with the harder line pieces of the proposed Senate deal. What the former president appears to be unhappy with is an actual solution to the broken asylum system and the problems at the border, because it might lessen his ability to use it against President Biden this election year.

So we actually locked arms together and said, we are not going to give you money for this. We want to change in law.
