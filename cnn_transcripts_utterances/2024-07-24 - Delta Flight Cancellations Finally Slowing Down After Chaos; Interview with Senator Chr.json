More than 500 Delta flights were canceled Tuesday. So far today, just 47 as it's looking, but the company is now under federal investigation after their meltdown continued well after other airlines were back to business as usual.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was on with me this morning.

The fact that a simple glitch like this ricocheted around the world is a real cause for concern. And again, I think the real watch word here is resilience. How can we make sure our systems are positioned to quickly recover when something like this happens?But I want to note, most of the airline sector did quickly recover. Things were different at Delta and that's exactly why we're investigating them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We also know from the flight cancellations, as you mentioned, Delta canceling about 1 percent of its flight schedule. That's about 50 flights.But what's not normal is the amount of baggage that is still out here. This is going to take several more days for Delta to get this together, reunite the baggage with their rightful owners, and get all those people that were canceled on those flights, those cascading cancellations to their final destination as intended. You mentioned the CEO of Delta, Ed Bastian, saying that today he's expecting minimal disruptions and cancelations and everything back to normal, regular Delta by tomorrow. I did speak with newlyweds, a pair of newlyweds who had to ditch Delta for Spirit Airlines in order to save their honeymoon. So the reputational hit here for the company will be longstanding.

Both with respect to limiting civilian casualties in Gaza, making sure more humanitarian assistance can reach the people in Gaza.And very importantly, on the West Bank where the retiring Israeli IDF general in charge of that area has indicated that extremist settler violence and the seizure of Palestinian lands on the West Bank is undermining the security of Israel and violates the values of Israel. I agree with General Fuks who made that comment, and I think that the Biden-Harris administration should continue to focus on applying sanctions to those who are committing those violent acts, violent extremist settlers on the West Bank.",

One, the creation of a two-state solution.This has been the Biden administration's policy. It's been a bipartisan policy of the United States to create some light at the end of this dark tunnel and to couple that with the normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel which would greatly strengthen Israel's security while we allow self-determination for the Palestinian people.

Celebrities were not publicly endorsing Biden because he was not a popular candidate.Well, now with Harris, I am hearing from sources that I spoke to, I spoke to publicists, agents, political strategists who are working with celebrities, they all feel like Harris is the right candidate at the right time. In fact, a major television producer, Greg Berlanti, had to tell me this. He said, quote, \"I haven't seen so many people that I know here and elsewhere so enlivened by a moment in politics since Obama's original convention speech.\" So that is the level of enthusiasm that we are seeing in the entertainment industry, Kate, comparing it to the Obama years, which of course were huge celebrity friendly years. Now today I hear that the Harris campaign has organized a briefing with the entertainment industry. Celebrities will be on that Zoom. They want to talk to them about how they can support because phones have been ringing off the hook with the campaign. Now, lastly, what I will tell you, it's very early for the convention, but I do hear that when it comes to the DNC, that there are pop stars who are interested in performing already.",

And what we can say is that we've seen a stark difference in Gen Z voters, right, before earlier this year. What we heard them say is only about 21 percent of them were excited about participating in this election.And of course, our work is to get Gen Z to turn out to vote. And what we're seeing now is that young people are excited. As you just mentioned that YouGov poll, we're seeing the same thing with our members. Gen Z voters are ready to come out, they're ready to vote, and they're energized about what's at stake in this election in new and exciting ways. And the numbers are in their favor, right? So when you think about Gen Z and millennial voters, they make up about 49 percent of the electorate this year if they all register and turn out to vote. There's 40 million, almost 41 million new members of Gen Z who are eligible. And as you noted, they are focused on social media. That's where they're getting their news from. They're really thinking about memes and how they can engage. And so this whole Brat notion and the notion of hot culture and this being the summer, if you will, of cool, easy breeze, but also getting things done is the epitome of what's going to be at stake from now until the election day.",

Meet Gen Z where they are and millennials for that matter, too. Don't do things that actually aren't what you do in the normal day-to-day life, right?What I want to tell you is make sure that you're showing up as you're true and authentic self, but also makes sure you're meeting the people where they are, right, because that's what they want. They don't want stale memes. They don't want you pretending you know about the cool trends.
