One Hezbollah commander says a -- quote -- \"battle without limits\" is under way.And a window into the mind of a suspected would-be assassin. Prosecutors say the man who allegedly tried to kill former President Trump detailed his plans in a letter, including an offer to anyone who could -- quote -- \"complete the job,\" that suspect, Ryan Routh, appearing in court today. And raking in the money, Vice President Harris' campaign flushed with cash, but new polls in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina are good news for former President Trump. We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. We begin in the Middle East, the world on edge as Israel launches a punishing aerial assault on what it calls Hezbollah targets in Lebanon,the U.S. announcing that it is sending a small number of additional U.S. troops to the region, a sign of the potential of an expanding conflict. The Lebanese Health Ministry says Israeli strikes killed more than 270, including women and children, and wounded more than 1,000, making today the deadliest between the two sides in nearly 20 years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that his country is changing the -- quote -- \"balance of power\" on its northern front, the border with Lebanon, where it has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah since early on in the war in Gaza, Hezbollah saying that it has been acting in solidarity with Hamas since that war began. The Israeli military announcing new targets in Eastern Lebanon. The IDF calls these strikes proactive, but Iran, which backs Hezbollah, is warning of dangerous consequences in the midst of this escalating conflict, as world leaders gather in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live for us in Northern Israel. Jeremy, what's the latest from where you are?",

      "sentences": "Well, U.S. officials continue to call for de-escalation. But one thing that they're concerned about this week is that the U.N. General Assembly isn't necessarily going to do that, isn't necessarily going to de- escalate what we are seeing with these increased tensions between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.And there's a number of reasons for that. So they are expecting the speech by President Mahmoud Abbas from the Palestinian Authority, potentially a speech by Prime Minister Netanyahu. They're also expecting the countries who have recognized Palestine as a state already to reiterate that they are doing that and potentially other countries to add to that chorus. All of these things, they don't think are going to de-escalate the situation. And the reason that that is unique, Brianna, is that, typically, heading into the U.N. General Assembly, you talk to U.S. officials and they're excited about galvanizing the world behind some sort of movement that the U.S. is for. And right now, they just don't see a world in which this week is actually going to de-escalate things in New York while the world is really watching all of these world leaders speak on the world stage.",

But the key here is that they're doing it because of these increased tensions. And that tells you all you need to know. The Biden administration, the U.S., is in this preparatory posture. They are concerned about this turning into a regional conflict, which we have heard them say for quite some time. But the fact that they are taking action now really tells you a lot. We also saw over the weekend the State Department renewed its travel advisory to U.S. military citizens, U.S. citizens in Lebanon, telling them once again that this is the time to get out of the country while there are still commercial options available. So they don't necessarily believe that it's inevitable that this is going to turn into a regional conflict. But they are perhaps more concerned than ever during this conflict at this moment in time that that is possible, given what we saw over the weekend.",

For more perspective on this latest escalation in the Middle East, let's talk now with retired U.S. Army Major Mike Lyons. Mike, what do the U.S. troops, this additional number to the region, signal to you, and what would you be expecting that they would reinforce? MAJ. MIKE LYONS (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  Well, Brianna, it's fundamentally a small number. And I have to think they're going to focus on potentially American evacuees that are going to be in certain locations and get them out, likely JSOC, special operators, special forces. They're going to focus likely on American citizens to make sure they're not in harm's way there, and then also provide ministerial support to the IDF as they continue what looks like the beginning of this offensive operation into Lebanon there against Hezbollah. So we'd like to kind of be on the ground, see what's going on. The tactical mission, again, will likely be getting Americans out, but we will keep our eyes on other things going on there.",

They have been fighting for almost a year, right? They are weathered, but still motivated by October 7, and also the fact that in this particular front of the conflict, you have a lot of Israelis who have been displaced in the north by these Hezbollah attacks. That has not gotten as much attention as the displaced Israelis in other parts of the country. And then you have Hezbollah hit hard very recently by the pager and the walkie-talkie attacks, but also very angry at Israel and motivated by wanting revenge. How do you see this?",

      "sentences": "Yes.Well, Israel would have to call up reservists. They would have to bring more people to bear. And some that had been released already from their duties in the south would likely get called back up again to fight this. No question that there would be battle fatigue for some of those individuals, but they're going to need 100,000 soldiers if they decide to go in offensively. So, perhaps these -- the airstrikes are designed, to your point, of escalating to de-escalate to keep them from doing it. I think Iran also plays here. If they could be convinced to tell their proxy to de- escalate as well, I think that matters, if they say -- because they likely will get destroyed. Israel does have the capability. But it's a classic conventional army versus a nonconventional one. Hezbollah is good at the asymmetrical warfare and they have capability. They have anti-tank rockets, and they have much more capability than Hamas had in the south, and it would be a much bigger fight. So we -- let's see what Iran does. Let's see what Israel does over the next few days, but they're going precisely at Hezbollah's capability to wage war against Israel, which doesn't surprise me.",

LYONS:  You know, it's hard to say what leverage is going to be applied to Hamas to get them to release hostages. We have seen them turn down every single negotiation so far. You saw the White House finally expressing disappointment or the fact that they are the problem here. I thought that was good. That was a good admission. I think it's something Israel already knew. I think Israel is working hard to find every one of those hostages. It's really a very impossible mission some level. And the longer it goes, it becomes even more problematic. So it's very difficult to predict what line of leverage that will be put on Hamas to get them to quit. Right now, not sure that will do it as well. Major Lyons, thank you so much for your insights.

Nobody can be coming out to tell us what's happening. What's going on in that hearing, though, as far as we know, is prosecutors are trying to convince a magistrate judge sitting in this federal court that Ryan Routh should stay behind bars. Right now, he's facing two charges around possession of a firearm, but they haven't taken the additional evidence through the grand jury to indict him. And all they have done so far this morning is file a -- this 10-page report of other evidence that they're gathering. They say it's not everything that they have, but what they think should be enough to keep him behind bars as they continue investigating, continue to consider additional charges against Ryan Routh, and the need to potentially take him to trial. They even said in their filing that they did not set forth all of the information and evidence they have known. And prosecutors are very likely pointing out to the judge all of this other stuff they have found about Ryan Routh, all of the planning he apparently did to place himself at Mar-a-Lago for quite some time, seemingly waiting for Donald Trump to arrive there.",

And in Ryan Routh's after they stopped him on the interstate, he fled in the car, they found six cell phones, including one with a Google search of how to get from Palm Beach to Mexico. They found extra license plates. They also found a list of Trump appearances that he had had. And then they looked into his cell phones and they show that he was around Mar-a-Lago for a full month before this incident occurred on September 15. In addition to that, a witness reached out to law enforcement and said, before the 15th, Ryan Routh dropped off a box at this witness' residence, at his home, and it had a lot of things in it, ammunition, a metal pipe, miscellaneous building material, tools, four more cell phones. So that's at least six cell phones in total that Ryan Routh had collected and had at various times, and then that letter addressed to the world saying that it was an assassination attempt of Donald Trump that he was trying to make here.",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, so their challenge -- today's challenge, of course, is Misty laid out, is to keep him locked up. And for all the reasons you mentioned, I think they will be successful in that effort.The longer-term issue is, what are they going to charge him with beyond these two firearms offenses? Excuse me. They certainly want to get to an attempted assassination charge. It's a little bit challenging under the federal code, because he wasn't the president at the time. So there's sort of different laws that you have to look to there. But all the evidence you mentioned goes directly to intent. They have to show that his intent that day was to actually assassinate former President Trump. He didn't take any specific actions. He didn't fire a shot and miss or try to attack him or something like that. So they have a little bit of a hurdle to get over there. The letter will be really devastating evidence against Routh in that regard. I think also of interest is the fact that we now know he was in the area for a month and was seen, of course, near Mar-a-Lago, which is the president's residence, and other places in the area. This goes to answering those questions we had on day one about, how did he know to be in that place at that time? And many of us suspected, he probably knew it from doing very rudimentary surveillance. It's not a hard thing to figure out. The president is very predictable in his movements and going to his golf clubs at the same time on Sundays when he's in town. So that picture, I think, is really starting to come together for prosecutors as well. And it answers the question to some extent as to whether or not he had any help with that intelligence.

So to the extent we're getting to an attempted assassination, you don't get off the hook just because you fail to follow through and actually commit the crime. But an attempt crime, because it's unsuccessful, has legal challenges to prove that intent factor. And that cell phone data, the fact that this was preplanned, those are going to be the allegations. And what happens is all of that goes before a jury, and a jury is asked to use their common sense and look at the totality of the evidence. So, the cell phone records, the letter, and just the actions of Routh that day, all of that is going to be in furtherance of establishing that intent element from the prosecutor's perspective.",

Maybe that exists and it's just not been disclosed yet. There's no question he was a dangerous individual. His run-ins with law enforcement, I believe in North Carolina, where he fled from a traffic stop and ultimately was -- took a felony charge for possession of a weapon of mass destruction, an explosive device, I mean, clearly, an unbalanced and dangerous person. You know, he pretty much dropped off the radar at that point by moving to Hawaii. It's not clear -- even though he was fairly visible in his support for Ukraine and his travel over there, none of that is illegal. None of that is aggression directed at a president or a political figure. So, at this point, I don't think we have enough information to say that a ball was dropped here, but it'll be interesting to find out the full extent of what the government knows as this case goes forward.",
