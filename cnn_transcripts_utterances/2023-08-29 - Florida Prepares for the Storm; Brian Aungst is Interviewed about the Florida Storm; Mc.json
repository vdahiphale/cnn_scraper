Could reach to the top of a bedroom or a bathroom. People in as-risk areas have been told to evacuate. That's why. Take it seriously. That is a lot of water.

      "sentences": "So, there is no time for you to get away, which is why there are now 20 counties that are in some state of evacuation orders. They're either mandatory orders or there are voluntary orders. And what that means for a lot of people in different counties is, you don't have to go, as we're hearing from officials, hundreds of miles away. You don't have to go to another state. Sometimes it's just a few miles away. Away from the coast. Away from where this storm surge is going to happen. It's in some capacity. It will be smaller in some places and larger in others. You don't want to be caught in it.You need to be thinking about that now. We understand that in St. Pete we're expecting to see some of those outer bands coming around 4:00 p.m. today. And by the morning, Wednesday morning, we are going to see the real strength of this hurricane hitting the west coast of Florida. Where exactly? Well, I have someone that can sort of talk to you about that. Our Derek Van Dam, meteorologist and reporter extraordinaire, who is right there on the beach. He is watching this from the sky and he is watching this from the ground at beach level. Let us know what's going on, Derek. DEREK VAN DAM, AMS CERTIFIED METEOROLOGIST: Yes. Yes, Sara, check this out. I'm going to have my camera man point towards the warm Gulf of Mexico waters. And, you know, I could walk literally for several hundred feet and I would only have water up to my knees here. This is a very shallow, shallow basin. And that water is so -- this coastline is so susceptible to storm surge, not only because the hurricane is going to be feeding off of those above average water temperatures, but because of the nature of this coastline. And I've got a drone shot to help put that into perspective. You saw Phil Mattingly's great representation of what 12 feet of storm surge. Well, let me show you why this coastal area is so susceptible to storm surge. Take you to the air and show you a little bit about why this area is just so prone to a storm surge event. And it is because of the fact that the coastline here just goes on literally for miles and it is so shallow all the way out into the - into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Now, eight to 12 feet, near Cedar Key, remember, Hurricane Hermine, that was back in 2016, that was a category one, and that brought six feet of storm surge to Cedar Key. Now we're projecting a major hurricane. That's a category three or higher. And that could bring significant impacts to that area. So, what you're looking at now is Tampa Bay. And Tampa Bay here, we have the official forecast of around four to seven feet. The air force base there just south of the city. We've got the coastal areas, the coastal waterways. This area near Clearwater. This is a very prone region as well. These intercoastal waterways have the potential to see that four to seven feet of water as well. But notice, as we move a little further north into the Cedar Key region, you're seeing a lot more oranges, a lot more reds. And that is indicating our eight to 12-foot storm surge that is potential into Cedar Key. Something no one wants to see. But that is the reality that we are facing here. And, Sara, you know, you talked about the force as you were tossing to me, about the force of storm surge. No one really talks about that. It's 1,700 pounds. That's what a cubic yard of water weighs. So, can you imagine, eight to 12 feet of water rushing in on to the shoreline with that amount of force, that amount of pressure. No one could withstand that. And that is why there are mandatory evacuations that line this coastline. Sara.",

We know your family is watching, so we want to tell them that you will be out of harm's way. We will not leave you out there as the storm starts hitting this area. We will be watching it together from a slightly safer space. Appreciate you. All right, I want to go now to the mayor of Clearwater, Brian Aungst. And we appreciate you, Derek. Brian Aungst is joining us now as we wait for this storm as it's coming closer. We expect to see it sometime this afternoon, at least some of the outer bands. What are you telling people in the community that they need to be doing right now? MAYOR BRIAN AUNGST (R), CLEARWATER, FLORIDA: Well, just like you said, and Derek said, take this seriously. If you're on level a evacuation, the beach or any low-lying areas, mobile home parks, please get out now. Don't wait until the last minute when traffic will be congested. Get out now. Take your pets. Take the things that you need. If you're here and you're not in a low-lying area, just hunker down. Make sure you have your hurricane kit, your water, your batteries, your radio, things that you need to just weather this storm. The good news is, it's a fast-moving storm. It's not a very wide storm. But as Derek said, four to seven feet of surge along the beach and along the entire Pinellas County coastline, much of it will be underwater for half a day or a day. It should recede rather rapidly. But, still, it's going to be a dangerous storm and do not be -- don't try to be a hero and ride it out. If they tell you to get out of there, please get out of there and do it now.",

What we know going forward, what we know at this moment with Hurricane Idalia, Governor Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, is scheduled to hold a press conference at 9:00 a.m. The top of the hour. We also know Idalia has strengthened just in the time we've been on air. Shortly before we started the show, it was given the title of the category one hurricane. Expected to reach -- intensify to category three. Right now we know it has strengthened to 80 miles per hour winds according to hurricane hunters and at least 22 counties are under mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders. So, we're going to have a lot more on that coming up. But we also know the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, just told me, Republicans are taking orders from their, quote, puppet master in chief as GOP leaders consider a push to impeach President Biden.

And I very much believe they will. I think that this is something that - I've been covering these House investigations very closely for months now. It's what the chairmen have been building toward. And I think everyone, particularly those on the more far-right section of the party and in the House have been expecting. And I think McCarthy knows that he needs to move forward with this.And it's interesting, though, just speaking about, you know, Leader Jeffries' interview with you, I was catching up with him, Elie and I, in the green room before he went on and he was saying that, you know, even though there's a lot of moderate Republicans who say that they do not want this to move forward, that they do not think impeachment is warranted, a lot -- or go against what McCarthy and some of the more far-right members say, they always -- almost always end up voting with them.",

So, we've slashed it by about a third. And, in fact, at this particular point, the average forecast trackerror at 96 hours this decade, 129 hours, is actually slightly better than it was for 24 hours back in the 1970s.

Sixteen miles per hour last decade. Now, look at this, we're at 12 miles per hour. So, one of the things that was so difficult to forecast, we are getting better at the further out we are.
