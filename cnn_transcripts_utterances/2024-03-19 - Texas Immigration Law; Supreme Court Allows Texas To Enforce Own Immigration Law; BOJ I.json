      "sentences": "A warm welcome once again to \"First Move.\" Here's today's need to know. The U.S. Supreme Court rulesthat Texas can enforce a state law that allows police to arrest and detain migrants suspected of entering the country illegally. The Bank of Japan raising interest rates for the first time in 17 years. And fancy letting A.I. pick your next holiday hotspot. Well, if the answer is yes, then travel firm Kayak may have you covered. The founder and CEO joins us to discuss their latest technology. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, controversial border security. The U.S. Supreme Court clearing the way for Texas to begin enforcing its own immigration law. It lets state law enforcement to arrest people they suspect of entering the nation illegally and they can also order deportations. Immigration advocates and the federal government have raised a whole host of concerns, including fears of racial profiling with Latinos comprising 40 percent of the state's population. And joining us now is John Sandweg. He's partner at the law firm Nixon Peabody. He's also a former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. John, great to have you on the show. We can argue the legality of this until we're blue in the face. I think at this moment, the practicalities matter more. How do you best avoid at this stage some form of conflict between federal border patrol and now state and local enforcement agents? And how do you do this in a, to my point there, non-discriminatory way? JOHN SANDWEG, FORMER ACTING U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: Yes, it's going to be hard, right? And it's going to be very interesting to see how the state actually implements this law in the coming days. First of all, though, the key is communication. We need communication between the border patrol agents on the ground and the state law enforcement. There's a lot of tension right now, obviously, between the political leadership, but these agents can't let that tension interfere with their core missions. We just need to make sure we avoid conflicts. But look, you raise a great question. How are you going -- how is the state going to enforce this in a way that is non-discriminatory? I think, you know, my bigger concern is especially as you get farther away from the immediate border, it's really hard to do that. And the federal government has access to a lot of databases and information that's not available to the state. They're also given a lot of training. So, I think there really are serious concerns that Texas is going to be able to implement this in a way, you know, in a non-discriminatory fashion.",

When I was at DHS and then at ICE, certainly, there were very limited, thankfully, cases and nobody wants to see this happen, but where U.S. citizens were arrested. My concern here now is you've empowered state local law enforcement who don't have the training of federal immigration officers, who don't have access to, like I said, those databases where they can verify nationality. And now, they're going to be making decisions about whether someone is a U.S. citizen or lawfully present or whether they cross the border. That's concerning, you know, obviously, because it's very difficult work to begin with, but when you have officers who are trained on things that are critically important, public safety type law enforcement, now doing regular immigration enforcement you can see very likely that we're going to hear about some, you know, horror stories here of U.S. citizens who were arrested.",

Imean, I hate to sound cynical, but this was a political action, you know, the passing of this bill. But the reality is on a daily basis, you know, when I was at the -- you know, working on federal immigration enforcement, we worked very closely with state prosecutors. When there are cases, smugglers who are apprehended, and we didn't have enough resources to prosecute them, federally, you turn to state prosecutors. You rely on your state law enforcement partners, state police officers, sheriffs, our members of task forces who work collaboratively with the federal government. But you're targeting the criminal actors who are exploiting our borders, right, drug smugglers, human traffickers, coyotes who are exploiting economic migrants. What's changed here now is what Texas has done is said, hey, no longer are we just going to focus on those criminal cases and the public safety cases, but we're also going to go after the economic migrants, the migrants themselves who are crossing the border and generally, are just looking to, you know, flee for a better life. Look, the problem in the U.S. and the problem at our border, of course, has been our failure to hire enough immigration judges and our failure to hire enough asylum officers to process everybody who's coming across and remove them if they don't make a valid asylum claim. Nothing about what Texas has done is going to solve that problem, and really all that's going to do is pull more resources, you know, away from these critical public safety missions, and argue -- you could argue potentially weaken border security as a result.",

Thank you. Now, it's one seemingly small step for the Bank of Japan, but one giant leap into the unknown for the Japanese economy and perhaps even global investors. The Japanese Central Bank announcing Tuesday that it's finally emerged from the global central bank basement, raising interest rates for the first time in 17 years and ending its eight-year run of below zero interest rates. It was the last central bank standing, by the way, with this policy. In addition, the Bank of Japan ended other economic support measures, including what's known as yield curve controls that held down longer-term interest rates. Then came the verbal intervention, telling the public and investors too that they will be very cautious about doing more tightening, reassuring news perhaps with Japanese equity investors with the Nikkei finishing Tuesday session above that 40,000 mark. Hanako Montgomery is in Tokyo, and joins us now. Hanako, a hugely symbolic step, 17 years arguably in the making. Important for investors, important for the Japanese public too.

I mean, this was the second condition, the second component that the Bank of Japan, Governor KazuoUeda, said needed to be met in order to actually end negative interest rates. So, as we know and as we discussed when you were here in Japan last month, Julia, wages in Japan have not really grown. I mean, they've stagnated for years and years. But on Friday, the Japanese labor union, RENGO, which is comprised of the country's biggest companies, decided to raise wages by 5.28 percent. The biggest pay hike it's seen in 33 years. Now, this is significant because, as I mentioned, Japanese workers in the country have not seen their wages grow that much compared to other OECD countries like the United States, the U.K., Germany for example. So, really, the fact that these two key components came together indicated to the Bank of Japan that it was finally time to end negative interest rates. Of course, now, you know, these movements were very, very conservative yesterday and it remains to be seen whether or not Japan will raise that interest rate to perhaps 0.2, 0.3 percent in the next few months. But again, this is a huge step for Japan, a symbolic one. And for the Japanese public it is, again, positive news, I believe, Julia.",

Its air quality was 23 times the WHO guidelines, followed by high IQAir rankings by the Indian cities of Guwahati, Delhi, and Mullanpur. The study looks specifically at fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, which is the tiniest pollutant but also the most dangerous and is linked to asthma, heart and lung disease and cancer. In Delhi, PM2.5 levels rose by 10 percent in 2023 with levels peaking in the month of November. Northern India struggles with smoke from crop burning, vehicle emissions, coal burning, and other toxic emissions. Every year annual crop burning pushes Delhi and neighboring areas into emergency level air quality days. People suffer from acute respiratory related issues for weeks.
