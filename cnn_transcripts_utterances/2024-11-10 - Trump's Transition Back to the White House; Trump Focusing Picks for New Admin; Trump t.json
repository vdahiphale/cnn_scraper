That means that despite the Harris campaign spending $1 billion, they failed to win a single battleground state.Now, Trump's total electoral vote count stands at 312 against 226 for Kamala Harris. Republicans will also take back control of the Senate and are bullish on their chances of holding on to the House. This all comes with the presidential transition process underway. Trump views the attorney general as the most important position he has to fill, and sources say Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt is one of the candidates at the top of the list. So, while we wait for more detail on who's in, we're also learning who's out for a second Trump administration. His former rival Nikki Haley and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo won't be asked to join the new team. CNN's Alayna Treene has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "President-Elect Donald Trump spent his Saturday locked down at Mar-a-Lago meeting with his transition team and going through a series of candidates that he is considering selecting for top cabinet roles as well as White House positions.Now, on Saturday he did not announce new people that will be serving in his second administration but he did announce who would not be. He talked about not wanting his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, or his former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, to have any part in his second term. I'm going to read for you some of what he wrote. He said, quote, \"I will not be inviting Former Ambassador Nikki Haley or Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to join the Trump administration, which is currently in formation. I very much enjoyed and appreciated working them -- with them previously and would like to thank them for their service to our country. Make America great again.\" Now, to give you a little bit of context on where some of this is coming from, Mike Pompeo is someone who many people in Donald Trump's inner orbit still are close to and believe that he did a good job as secretary of state. However, his relationship with Donald Trump has really soured in recent years, particularly because Pompeo had, in many ways, distanced himself from the former president after he had left office in January of 2021. I'd remind you as well that Pompeo did not endorse Donald Trump until after the Republican primaries this year, something that, as we know, Donald Trump viewed as not being as loyal to him. And in my conversations with senior advisers, they argued that, in private conversations over the past few days now, Donald Trump had asked them whether or not Pompeo would be loyal to him or whether he could trust him in a second term. Now, as for Haley's part, Donald Trump has said that he appreciates that she had gotten up on stage at the Republican National Convention in July, called for unity. And also, remember, she had actually been in discussions with the Trump campaign in the final weeks before Election Day about potentially meeting for a joint appearance and helping him campaign, that never materialized. But again, Donald Trump had said he appreciated that on some level. However, I am told that the president-elect still harbors a lot of animosity toward Haley for the attacks that she had lobbed at him during the Republican primary. But also, that she had remained in the primary for so long. Donald Trump has remarked that he believes that she hung on longer than was appropriate. Alayna Treene, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Biden extended this invitation to Trump in their phone call on Wednesday when the president congratulated the former president on his victory in the 2024 election.Biden has said that he directly told Trump that he is committed to a peaceful and orderly transition, which is not something that occurred when Biden beat Trump back in 2020. At the time, Trump put up many roadblocks in the transition process, never conceded the race and did not extend this same invitation to Biden. Now, Trump did come to the White House in 2016, days after he had beaten Hillary Clinton and it was hosted by then-President Barack Obama in the Oval Office. Now, we're also told that an invitation was extended to First Lady Melania Trump to come to the White House to meet with First Lady Jill Biden. It's unclear if and when that meeting will take place. But this is all part of the Biden White House's efforts to try to show that they will assist in this transition. It could be an interesting meeting between the two men, given the fact that one of their last substantive in-person engagements was back on that debate stage in June, which really derailed Biden's candidacy and eventually prompted him to drop out. The two men have spoken since then. Biden had called Trump following the assassination attempts against him and they were both at the same New York City 9/11 event a bit earlier this fall. But this will be an interesting meeting as the two men are set to meet face to face in the Oval Office. Biden is now facing this reality where the man who preceded him, who he had beat in the 2020 election, will now be returning to the White House in January. Arlette Saenz, CNN, Washington.

Voters in only two states, Arizona and Missouri, approved measures to expand abortion access. And keep in mind, even if the ballot measures in Arizona and Missouri improve access in those states, about 40 percent of women of reproductive age will still be living in states where abortion is either banned or restricted.Now, it's not clear what the new Trump administration's strategy will be around abortion.

I think you'll see Governor Gavin Newsom being the television talking a resistance leader for about six months, particularly when it comes to public lands and climate.

And some former Trump officials have floated the idea of pulling the U.S. entirely out of the U.N.'s treaty to confront climate change. Meanwhile, it seems the Biden administration is preparing for the worst. Hours after Trump was projected to be the winner of the election, the White House moved to limit oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the target in Trump's 2017 tax law which required an oil and gas drilling lease sale before the end of the year.

The resolution that Ukraine wants is membership of the European Union, membership of NATO, and protection from vulnerability in the face of Russia moving forward. It's not clear that that is the particular outcome, and anything short of that will ultimately be seen as a victory for Russia and as a real source of concern for states in the Baltics and for those like Moldova and Georgia, whose aspirations are to join the European Union on to be protected in that particular space.

One of these providers, known as TextNow, told CNN Friday the company believes this is a widespread coordinated attack. The hate filled messages have been reported in more than 20 states from New York to California and the District of Columbia. Students from at least three historically black colleges and universities in Virginia, Tennessee, and South Carolina have reported receiving messages. And according to Nevada's Attorney General's office, the text appeared to be robotext messages.One of the biggest questions here is how is it possible to do something like this anonymously? Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told CNN Friday that whether this is a single person or a group, they're using anonymizing software to obscure their location, which makes it very difficult to track them. As you can imagine, this is cause for great concern for those receiving the messages as well as parents and loved ones. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN has learned that another text messaging service called TextSpot was apparently able to stop a new user from sending racist text messages. TextSpot says that it was thanks to artificial intelligence that they immediately flagged the message and prevented it from being sent until they were able to conduct an internal review. The company says that they then blocked the message and banned the user from their platform and shared the information with local law enforcement and the FBI. Rafael Ramos, CNN Atlanta.
