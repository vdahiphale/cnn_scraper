This is not a name that had come up for almost anyone in any of the discussions or interviews or talks that they have been having about who was going to head the Justice Department? Obviously, one of Trump's biggest priorities, one that he's been thinking about for months now before he was even re-elected, he had been thinking about who he would put in this position. So, this one was a shock to essentially all of them and so that is really the big question tonight of what this looks like going forward. But, Anderson, it was about 24 hours ago that I had heard from sources that Trump was unhappy with basically everyone that had been brought to him as a potential candidate for attorney general. He had interviewed many them. One of the interviews was described as disastrous to me, and so essentially he was wish casting about for who he was going to put in this position. And the two qualifications that he wanted which was someone who is fiercely loyal to him and someone who would be compliant with what he wants to happen at the Justice Department and that is what he got in Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz and made that announcement today. But of all of the decisions that he's made about his Cabinet, Kristi Noem was made pretty quickly, to the surprise of a lot of people, this one maybe even half that kind of a timeline.",

It's not the same kind of Republican-led Senate that it was when he took office even in 2016.I mean, this is a Senate that is very much in his making. A lot of these are his hand-picked people that ran in races that he backed that are now going to be voting on this Cabinet nominees once he is formally in office. And so, that's really the question tonight. There are still some voices out there. People like Lisa Murkowski or Bill Cassidy of Louisiana who seem to have a lot of skepticism not just when asked about this pick for attorney general, but also Pete Hegseth to run the Department of Defense. So that's really going to be the question here because essentially as a Republican senator, is it viable to buck the Republican president on his pick, and if you're triaging and picking just one of them to break with him on, which one do they pick? That is going to be a real question that is facing Senate Republicans sooner rather than later. But also, I would note, you know, you saw all the Senate leadership fight that happened today with John Thune coming out on top.

That would have been all wheels off the rails with MAGA. So now, that responsibility is on Senator Thune to lead the troops into making good decisions, up against recess appointments. Remember, Trump earlier this week said to all three candidates who wanted to be Senate Majority Leader, will you all agree to do recess appointments and they all said yes. So will Senator Thune now backtrack on that with a Pete Hegseth up for Defense, with a Matt Gaetz up for attorney general.

So, I think everything he's announced which I don't really have a problem with anything that he's announced, this Gaetz thing strikes me as the most problematic, if you're looking at it from a political and legislative affairs matter.
