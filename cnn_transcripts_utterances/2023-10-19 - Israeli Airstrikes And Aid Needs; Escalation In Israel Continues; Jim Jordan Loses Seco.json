And as you know from here, it's a very short range to Gaza, so when the siren goes off, you have about six or seven seconds to take cover here.I think there were two salvos of rockets because we saw intercepts, probably intercepting rockets that were heading to the north, to Ashkelon and Ashton, and then the sirens went off for Sderot where we were, which is where we took cover, and we heard those rockets come over. It's been a bit like that this afternoon. Sorry, I'm a bit out of breath. We were just ducking for cover there because we know the damage that these rockets can do. One landed not far from here a couple of days ago and really smashed through the side of the house, through the inside of the house, out through another wall, wrecked the inside of the house.

Gates, then some other members, cursed at him. One member, Mike Boss, went after him as well, says, cussing at him several times, we're told. Also, a number of members calling on Jim Jordan, the Speaker nominee for the Republican Party, to drop out. That is something that Jordan is refusing to do.Basically, where this stands right now is that Jordan has said that he would support making Patrick McHenry the interim speaker, giving him more legislative power to move through the legislative process, take up bills that have been essentially paralyzed amid this fighting within the House. But he says he would not drop out of the race to be speaker. He said he would allow this process to be, Pat McHenry to be an interim speaker, to happen till January, at which point he'd be willing to move forward. But there's a problem. There has been furious opposition to this idea of propping up Patrick McHenry. One Republican member after another has come out here essentially saying that that is dead, that they will not support that, that it will not pass the House, and that ultimately they need to abandon that plan altogether here, raising even more questions about how they are going to proceed and whether Jordan will try to, will actually drop out of the race, whether a new candidate will emerge as speaker, and whether that candidate could even get the 217 votes he or she might, will need in this bitterly divided Republican conference.  And in talking to these members and leaving this room, it is very clear the tension is very high, and many members are very, very much on the opposite sides about how to proceed.

And Sidney Powell is extraordinarily notable here because she's a top lawyer around Donald Trump. She was in the upper echelon of people who was even inside the White House talking to Donald Trump one on one in some of the crucial days after the election, as she and others were leading that effort to try and sow disinformation around the results of the 2020 election. So, the immediate impact here of this guilty plea today by Sidney Powell in Georgia, it's that she's admitting to doing some of the things she was accused of, especially related to Coffee County, Georgia, a rural county where she and others were accused of tampering with voter equipment and data.The second immediate impact here, Brianna Boris, is that she's not going to trial. She was supposed to go to trial on Friday. Now it's just one other defendant in this massive case who is set to have jury selection begin on Friday. We're going to have to wait and see what happens there. And then the big picture step back. She is agreeing to testify against others in this case at future trial or trials. That includes very likely Donald Trump in Georgia, where he is set to go to trial at a later date after this first round of trial was set to start. But then also she's a person that doesn't know just about Coffee County, Georgia, what she is admitting to in the misdemeanours she's pleading too today. She's also a person who's privy to so much happening in the White House, including was at that December 18th meeting where she and others were trying to convince Donald Trump to appoint her as a special investigator, as a special counsel, to look into voter fraud and try and find that across the country. She was involved in court cases as well, trying to sow that disinformation of voter fraud that just didn't exist. And so, the likelihood she could be asked to testify about those things is possible.
