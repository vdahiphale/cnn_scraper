Congressional negotiators have reached a bipartisan framework to fund the U.S. government for a year and in doing so would avert a hurtful, harmful, damaging, whatever you want to describe it as, shutdown. Putting wheels in motion to complete work, to get it all done but the bipartisan work has put Republican leaders McConnell and McCarthy at odds. McCarthy line fighting McConnell and saying McConnell was wrong. This as thousands of migrants entering the United States each day in recent days. Those numbers are expected to grow even more when a Trump-era border policy expires next week. Lauren Fox is on the Hill on this funding deal, the bipartisan framework. Major progress, Lauren.

There's a lot of hiccups but right now what we expect is lawmakers will give themselves more time to write this bill, pass a short-term spending bill to get past that first deadline. Then we expect, next week, we will finally see the full legislation on this larger package that they had an agreement in principle on last night. That's when we'll see if they can get out of here by the Christmas holiday. It's significant that the statement included lawmakers from the Republican and Democrat side in the Senate and the Democrats in the House but not the Republican House. That gives you a bit of foreshadowing. Kevin McCarthy is not supportive of this omnibus. My colleague said yesterday in a private meeting he told his conference he's a hell no on this bill.

The reality is this crisis is growing, not going away. We'll see if it sparks more of a conversation in the divided Congress. I hate to be pessimistic about this but I think it's very unlikely that it will, largely because it's simply used as a political weapon against the party in power. That is simply what's been happening. But the White House is going to find a way to deal with this. This is all coming, of course, as House Republicans are threatening to impeach the Department of Homeland Security Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, who is charged with dealing with this.

We have a vaccine for flu and we're having a pretty bad and early flu season. It's almost a vertical line upward. But we have a flu vaccine that is matched well to the circulating strain. There's no reason at all not to get a flu vaccine. The same holds true for the COVID booster; that is the updated vaccine that's available. Unfortunately, only about 13 percent of the eligible people in this country have received that. RSV is a different story. We don't yet have a vaccine for RSV but with regard to respiratory hygiene and wearing masks appropriately at an indoor setting -- I'm not talking about mandating but the common sense of when you go into a congregate setting. And one of the encouraging things, as bad as RSV is, we have peaked there.

Giving the sheer volume and quantitative nature of the number of people who are infected, even if a small, small percentage of them get long COVID, that's a lot of people whose lives actually will be impacted in a negative way by the persistence of these symptoms. It's estimated about 1 million people in this country cannot work, go back to their former employment because of the post-COVID, long COVID syndrome. It's something, you're right, it's a bit mysterious, we don't know the precise pathogenic mechanism. If you want to do something about it, you have to understand what the underlying mechanisms are.
