And they say that there were seven of their employees who were killed in this Israeli attack.And they say that there were three vehicles that they were traveling in. Two of them were armored vehicles. One was a soft skin vehicle. And as you said, they were leaving a warehouse where they had picked up, unloaded some aid that had just been brought in by ship. And we also have new video from Reuters, which shows the aftermath of this situation. World Central Kitchen had made clear in their statement that these vehicles that they were traveling in were all very clearly branded with the World Central Kitchen logos. And also they had coordinated this with the IDF. And when you see the video, you can see one of the vehicles has a hole blown right in the top of it and right on that World Central Kitchen logo. So it's not like you could only tell that they were aid vehicles from the side. You could also tell if you were surveilling those vehicles from above as well. And so I think when you see this video and when you see this vehicle completely burned out on the inside, there are going to be some very serious questions here for the Israelis to answer. The World Central Kitchen said that it is pausing its operation in the region. It will make decisions shortly on the future of its operations there. And I've just gotten some clarity from the organization that that also means that the ships that are currently in route from Cyprus to Gaza will not, at least at this stage, be offloading their cargo in Gaza, a place that is in desperate need of more food for people. [03:04:53] And the CEO of World Central Kitchen was pretty blunt in their statement saying this, this is not only an attack against World Central Kitchen, this is an attack on humanitarian organizations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war. This is unforgivable. Rosemary, you mentioned that Jose Andres, the founder of World Central Kitchen, had tweeted about this saying that these victims are not nameless, not faceless. We have confirmation from one of the hospitals inside Gaza of the name of one of the victims, a Palestinian driver named Saif Issam Abu Taha. We also know that one of the victims was that Australian that you mentioned, Zomi Frankcom, who was identified by the Australian Prime Minister. And she had done plenty of work around the world in Australia and abroad with World Central Kitchen.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Iran says its consulate in Damascus, Syria, was attacked by Israel on Monday, leaving at least seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officials dead, including two senior commander. Now Iran's ambassador to Syria said the building was targeted with six missiles from Israeli F-35 warplanes, but the Israelis have neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the strike, which has raised fears of an escalation in the region as Iran has vowed to respond decisively. Now a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, told CNN that he would not comment on the attack other than to say that according to intelligence, the building that was hit was actually a military building being used by the IRGC rather than a civilian consulate. CNN cannot independently verify either Iran or Israel's claims, but State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the U.S. has been in touch with regional partners to determine what happened here, and he reiterated that the U.S. does not want to see the conflict between Israel and Hamas escalate beyond Gaza. But it remains to be seen whether and how Iran will retaliate here.

It was an incredible game and everybody was comparing it to last year's national championship game between these two teams. And it felt exactly like that with the pacing, with the fact that there was just scoring on both ends and of course the rivalry. I mean, let me tell you, Angel Reese actually put a crown on the bench while Caitlin Clark was warming up. And Caitlin Clark would hit a three, she would stare at Angel Reese in the face. It had all of those hallmarks, all of the drama. And in the end, of course, Iowa beat LSU, clinching their spot in the NCAA final four. And I got to say, Caitlin Clark really brought it 41 points in this game. And when I tell you that this place erupted anytime that ball was in her hands and when she hit those threes, it really did. It was just incredible to watch. She made an NCAA all-time record for three pointers made in a career. And let me tell you, she is a role model. If you could see all the young girls and boys who waited after this game to get her autograph, it was just incredible to see. It just shows you how much not only Caitlin Clark, not only Angel Reese, but other women basketball players have changed this sport for the better. In Albany, I'm Brynn Gingras, CNN.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After months of delay, the father of the atomic bomb's life story finally took to the big screens in Japan, the very country where his invention wreaked terrifying devastation. The film, highly praised globally, was met with favorable reaction from some Japanese viewers. KUMIKO FUKUDA, TOKYO RESIDENT (through translator): I was interested in this movie because it shows the expressions and emotions hidden behind the eyes of both Americans and Japanese who saw the atomic bombs. It doesn't just show the tragic story, which I think is easier to depict. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): But left others with a bitter aftertaste. UNKNOWN (through translator): Of course, this is an amazing film which deserves to win the Academy Awards in the United States. But the film also depicts the atomic bomb in a way that seems to praise it. And as a person with roots in Hiroshima, I found it difficult to watch. I'm not sure this is a movie that Japanese people should make a special effort to watch. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Omitting images of the ghastly wreckage caused to Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the atomic bombs, lethal weapons that killed over 200,000 people, was a conscious decision from director Christopher Nolan.",

During opening weekend in Japan, the movie grossed 2.5 million U.S. dollars. Abroad, the highly lauded film won seven Oscars this year, including the coveted Best Picture and Best Actor awards. Christopher Nolan, who also took home Best Director, will receive a knighthood in Britain for his services to film. But despite the film's global accolades, Japanese viewers tread lightly, wary of how the West remembers and depicts history from 78 years ago, a past far from forgotten in Japan.
