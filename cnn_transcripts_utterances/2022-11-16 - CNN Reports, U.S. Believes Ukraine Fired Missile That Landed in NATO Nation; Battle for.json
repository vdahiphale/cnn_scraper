NATO ambassadors are holding an emergency meeting right now to discuss the deadly explosion and how to respond to it.M.J. lee is live for us in Bali, Indonesia, and Melissa Bell is standing by at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. We're going to begin with M.J. M.J., hello to you. What are you hearing about this meeting? What are you learning about the incident? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, what we're learning from two officials who were briefed on the initial U.S. assessments of this missile this morning is that it appears that the missile originated from Ukraine even though it is Russian-made. Now, this would help explain why President Biden, after he emerged from an emergency meeting with foreign leaders earlier here today in Bali, said the preliminary information seems to suggest that it is unlikely that the missile originated from Russia. Now, the president also said that the U.S. would fully support Poland's ongoing investigation into this matter saying. He said, we must, quote, we must figure out exactly what happened. He also said that any next steps that are taken would be determined collectively by the United States along with its allies. Now, determining exactly where this missile came from, of course, is so critical because Poland, of course, is a member of NATO, and an attack against one of those nations is considered an attack against all.

The missile had been tracked. And that's what the ambassadors had been looking at here, the intelligence of exactly what happened.

But, listen, it may be a matter of time before a Russian missile finds its way into a neighboring country, especially given how far Russian attacks are being launched into Western Ukraine. So, this is a serious situation. Obviously, Russia understands that if there was an attack on a NATO member, that the United States has a treaty obligation to respond and to defend our NATO partners.

So, I hope that Congress takes a look at the Saudi's investment.Now, listen, maybe the conclusion is that this is a straight up money play by the Saudis. They actually think they're going to get their money back. They have no side deals with Elon Musk and the deal moves forward. But let's at least ask those questions. Because if Musk says that the reason he bought Twitter is to promote free speech, well, then the Saudis are a really curious partner because the Saudis have the exact opposite goal. They want to repress free speech, right? They want their enemies, political dissidents to be thrown off of Twitter. So, it just doesn't seem to be a marriage that makes a lot of sense unless the Saudis are getting something out of it for their goals, which are not the same as Elon Musk's stated goals.",

I think their decision to decrease oil production is just final confirmation that Saudi Arabia is not an ally in the normal sense of the word. There are times when our interests intersect. But more often than not in the last ten years, U.S. interests and Saudi interests are not aligned. And so I just think we need to be very careful about the ways in which we work with the Saudis. So, I think we need to downsize our defense commitment to the Saudis. I would rather see some of the missiles that we're sending to Saudi Arabia to protect that country be sent to Ukraine instead. I have suggested that, proposed that to the administration.I don't think we end our defense relationship with Saudi Arabia but I don't know that they need to be the preferred partner the way they are today, especially when a country like Ukraine could do a lot more with some of the advanced weaponry that we are sending into the Middle East.",

Last summer with several conservative Republicans, I wrote the first gun safety bill in 30 years. And some of those partners, retired, right, the folks on the Republican side that used to work with Democrats, they were under such withering assault from Donald Trump, that many of them left the Senate.I hope Republicans don't sort of learn the wrong lesson from the last two years. I hope that they stand for their beliefs but they continue to engage with Democrats when they think they can get something done that's good for the country. We're going to continue to do outreach with the Republicans. We're going to try to get deals done. And I think you'll see that we'll get one done this week. I think we will pass the marriage equality act, which will force states to recognize same-sex marriages. And that may be a signal that this era of bipartisan cooperation that we saw over the last two years is not over. At least I'll keep my fingers crossed that that's the case.",
