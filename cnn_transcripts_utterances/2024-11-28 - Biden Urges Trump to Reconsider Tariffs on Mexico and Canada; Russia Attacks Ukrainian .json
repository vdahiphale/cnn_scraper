The big one is immigration, and President Sheinbaum says she laid out a plan to attend to migrants before they reached the border. Donald Trump claimed she flat out agreed to stop migration through Mexico. She denied anything like that. And at the same time, the ECB President Christine Lagarde has addressed the threat of tariffs, saying she's warned that a trade war wouldn't be good for anyone. We'll talk more about what Christine Lagarde said in just a moment. Steve Contorno is in West Palm Beach in Florida. I want to talk about what President Biden said. He said, look, oceans on both sides, allies north and south. The last thing we want to do is screw up those relationships.

      "sentences": "Exactly. Look, it's clear that Donald Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tool, and he is wielding them like a cudgelmore or less, to try to get both Mexico and Canada to side with him on a totally unrelated issue to trade, which is immigration and he has said that he will have a 25 percent tariff on goods coming through Mexico and Canada, until both countries do more to stem the flow of migrants and drugs across the American borders. Now, already, it is unclear what that will look like, because Trump is claiming victory in this early trade war with Mexico, based on a conversation he had with the Mexican president, that she sees a totally different side to. He says that she has said what would effectively close the border, she is saying that she's not even capable of that. And what's really interesting to watch is how this relationship between these two countries especially developed because a lot of Donald Trump's immigration policies are, in part, dependent on Mexico either playing along or, in some cases, turning a blind eye to what Trump wants to do. He wants to build a border wall, parts of which may actually be on the Mexico side of the US-Mexico border. He also wants to put in place a \"remain-in-Mexico\" policy that requires migrants to stay south of the border before -- while they are processed, instead of on the US side of the border and that requires some allowances from Mexico as well, and he needs Mexico to do its part to prevent country -- people coming from South America and Central America to cross through Mexico into United States. So even as Trump is threatening a very or is putting forward a very threatening posture with Mexico, at the same time, he really doesn't need Mexico's president to play along with him, and it will be interesting to see this sort of cat and mouse game that they have started here and where it goes from here.",

I think this is a better strategy than a pure retaliation strategy, which can lead to a tit-for-tat process where no one is really a winner.\" Some of the goods she suggested Europe could buy from the United States include LNG, natural gas, which, of course, it needs for its energy needs, and also defense goods.

So you know, Trump, of course, put tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU. The EU retaliated with tariffs on Levi's jeans, Harley Davidson, American whiskey. And also it forced the EU's hand in that it then had to put tariffs on other goods, not even from the United States, to prevent this kind of flood of cheap imports, you know, being redirected to Europe.

So it's not good timing for Europe. And as you point out, a lot of people worry that Europe is really falling behind the United States and China in these areas of innovation, of, you know, technology, and even in some of the industries that it has historically led in like car making, automaking, Germany's automakers looking very weak indeed.

The Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the legislation aims to safeguard children from the dangers of social media. This is the world's toughest response to a problem that's seen other countries impose restrictions, but not actually are the companies accountable for breaches. Now, under the Australian law, tech firms must take reasonable steps to prevent under 16-year-olds from accessing social media services. There's a potential fine of up to $32 million if they don't. The law comes into force in 12 months. Clare Fernyhough is a psychologist and co-founder of Smartphone Free Childhood. She joins me from Hampshire in England. This is a fascinating law, because everybody can agree with the aim, goal, and desire, but at the same time think it's a load of nonsense, the way they've actually gone about it, because bans per se don't work. Where do you stand? CLARE FERNYHOUGH, PSYCHOLOGIST AND CO-FOUNDER, SMARTPHONE FREE CHILDHOOD: Yes, I mean, you know, the word \"ban\" we tend to try to not use because it's so divisive, as we know, but I think this is a really brave, bold step from Albanese. I think it's incredible leadership, you know, and he's an absolute pioneer. We don't know exactly how it is going to work, because we haven't heard full details yet, and there will undoubtedly be a big fight with tech companies. There will be a lot of teething problems. It's not going to be easy. I think what's really important is he's put a line in the sand here, and he sent a very strong signal to these companies that, actually, you know, our children are not the product. They're not something that can be manipulated. And they, you know, he's done it to support parents as well. You know, he says parents are worried sick, not just in Australia, parents everywhere are worried sick. So, you know, I think it's incredibly a bold move. And yes, we definitely welcome it.",
