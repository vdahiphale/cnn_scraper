I also have to also really understand this defendant, which means the judge has a right to require a person to undergo a psychological evaluation. And given how unhinged and incoherent Donald Trump has been, in speaking publicly, that kind of an evaluation might be merited, because for example, he could be dementing. So, these are all the kinds of information that a judge needs to make an informed, a reasonable and objective as best one can, a sentencing in any instance, and particularly in this case.

You will find all of that and more in the annual financial disclosures, out today, from the U.S. Supreme Court justices.Justice Clarence Thomas has now only just formally disclosed two 2019 trips that were paid for by the Republican megadonor, Harlan Crow, saying that he quote, \"Inadvertently omitted\" that trip to Bali, and another trip to a private club in California. It was the non-disclosure of those trips, which were first reported by ProPublica, in an investigation that raised major questions, about what gifts that Thomas and other justices may have been receiving. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson disclosed four tickets to a Beyonce concert, last year, a gift, I should note, from Beyonce herself. [21:20:00] And we also learned that several of the justices have received six- figure payments, last year, for book deals. That includes Justice Jackson, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and also Justice Neil Gorsuch. Now, these disclosures come at a time when there are a lot of ethics questions, for the Supreme Court, and as there are only several weeks left for them to decide, and we'll find out what they decide, on several politically-supercharged cases. That includes whether or not Trump has immunity from prosecution, and also about the nation's access to abortion pills. Those are just two of the decisions that we are waiting to come, this month, from the Supreme Court. My sources, tonight, are CNN Political Commentator, and former White House Communications Director for President Biden, Kate Bedingfield. As well as, CNN Senior Political Commentator, and former Senior Adviser to Mitch McConnell, Scott Jennings. Scott, I mean, just given, it was just last year that Justice Thomas argued he didn't need to disclose these kinds of gifts.

It was looked at by the Judicial Conference, and they found that he had done nothing wrong. Harlan Crow, by the way, is a longtime friend of Clarence Thomas. He's often described as a Republican megadonor. But they've been friends for a very, very long time. So, this is a personal friendship that he has. I would also point out, since you raised the cases, Harlan Crow is on the record, as saying he is pro-choice, and he's also no big fan of Donald Trump. And so, people often draw a link between Crow and Thomas, and these upcoming cases. But in this case, I don't think he's going to be finding a sympathetic ear, for his personal views--",

And I think that is where the questions have been, Kate.And so, on this issue, even if it's not something that is linked to what's happening here, there is a political perception issue with the court, and the credibility of it.

That is -- that is troubling. And the fact that he has a different point, said he wasn't obligated to disclose it or -- and then said he forgot. I mean, the sheer fact that he's not being transparent about it is problematic, is a perception problem. And I think, it's also important to remember that, at least for federal judges, the statute for recusal is not just actual conflict, but it's the perception of conflict, the perception of bias. So if you're the average voter, and you're looking at these really significant cases that are coming up, before the Supreme Court, and you have concern about whether the justices are being transparent and forthcoming about these kinds of things? Of course, there's going to be a political impact there, that's going to leave a bad taste in people's mouth. And so, I think, for the Supreme Court, they don't view themselves as political. They don't think of themselves as political. Maybe they should. And I don't mean that in terms of the cases that they're deciding. But in terms of how they think about their institution.

He has always been very, very careful not to use the power of the presidency, to overstep or to, in any way, suggest that he is trying to sway what the court's doing.I think, remember, he was on the Judiciary Committee for many, many years, in the Senate. He takes all of that very, very seriously, and views, the idea of the erosion of trust in the court, as a really fundamental problem for the country. And as he thinks about how to approach this, within the confines of a political campaign, he's thinking about how to not further erode that trust that he thinks is really fundamental to our system, continuing to work. So, I think there are, as we've been discussing here, I think there are legitimate questions, concerns, I think, when a Supreme Court justice views themselves as so far outside of the realm of politics, and this is what I mean by political, that they can take $4 million from a -- over the course of their career, from a significant conservative donor, and not have to disclose that, because they view themselves as so far outside of the processes that they're not obligated to disclose it.

It's very similar to Keynes' Animal Spirits, George Soros and reflexivity.It's just this idea, as you said, a disconnect between how people feel, and what the economic data is seeing.
