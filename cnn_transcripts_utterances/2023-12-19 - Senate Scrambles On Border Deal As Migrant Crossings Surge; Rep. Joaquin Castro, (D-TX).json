Let me show you the lay of the land here, Jake, because it'll give you an idea. That railway that you were talking about, this is the railway just over my shoulder, that is closed to lawful trade. And over here to my right, you see this other bridge, there's two bridges here in Eagle Pass, Texas, this is one of them. There's another one that is closed.And you see that the -- this is the trade coming in from Mexico. You see the long lines? Well, there's more long lines, again, because of its closure. Now the Biden administration has decided to close several ports of entry and reassign those agents to process migrants. I want you to look over my shoulder because you'll see that there are 1000s of migrants here waiting to be transported for immigration processing. I can tell you that from here, I can see women and children. At last check from sources on the ground and from the sheriff, about 5000 migrants are waiting here in Eagle Pass, Texas. Now in the last 24 hours along the U.S. southern border, about 12,600 migrants were apprehended. And just to give you a sense on December 8, I interviewed U.S. Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens, and he said that at that point in time 7,000 migrants had been apprehended within a 24 hour time period. So, that gives you a sense of just the overwhelming number of migrants that have crossed there who are waiting to be processed. Now, you were talking about the bottleneck, Jake, when it comes to the number of migrants who are actually in custody. So when we talk about these custody numbers, that 23,000 number that you were referencing, that doesn't include all the people that you see behind me. These individuals have not been processed yet. And from talking to the border patrol chief, he told me, Jake, capacity is 10,000. That's how much they can actually hold. And right now they're holding 23,000 migrants.",

Essentially, if you test positive for COVID, the guidance is you should isolate for five days, and including from people in your household if you can, of course, if you've got kids or you're caring for somebody that can be difficult.The guidance is to wear a high quality mask if you have to be around others either in your household or if you have to go out and if you have more moderate or severe symptoms, the CDC says you actually should isolate for 10 days. Of course, testing can change those limits. If you're still testing positive, you should still continue to isolate. And of course, if you start to test negative, that should give you a good go ahead as well.

So the judge says they're allowed.First of all, let's show everybody what names aren't going to be released. So it's a lot of them. First of all, alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein people that have done interviews or they testified in trial or somehow or other their names are in the public domain, alleged associates of Jeffrey Epstein. Those that he worked with maybe they testified at trial, maybe their names were in a police report, detectives and assistant state attorney some of those names have been redacted in documents. A public figure they say who was one of many names in the address book of Jeffrey Epstein, no salacious activity at all. A lot of the names are associated with they say no salacious activity. Journalist named to redacted. An individual who allegedly recruited young women to give massages to Jeffrey Epstein. That name was mentioned in the trial. So it can come out. An individual whose role has been widely reported in the media, they say that this person already was criminally prosecuted abroad for sex trafficking and that name and much media attention, they say that name will become public.",
