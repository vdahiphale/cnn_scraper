Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is attending just a day after a series of Russian air assaults killed dozens across his country, including at a children's hospital in Kyiv. Meantime, scrutiny of the summit's host, U.S. President Joe Biden, is expected to be intense after his faltering debate performance against Donald Trump last month. CNN's Kylie Atwood is in Washington for us. First, I want to get you over to Fred Pleitgen. He is at that children's hospital in Kyiv where a search and rescue operation, as I understand it, has now ended, Fred, a cleanup operation underway. And what can you tell us at this point?",

But certainly you can see -- and I'm actually at the actual impact site where that missile landed, just how bad the damage is. I'm going to get out of your way and you can see behind me just how much you of this building has been destroyed. This is just one of the buildings in what is the largest children's hospital here in Ukraine and also, quite frankly, one of the largest in all of Europe. And you can see that part of this building was just completely annihilated. And this is a really sturdy brick building with a brick foundation. And even that has been badly damaged and all but destroyed in all of this. Now I actually spoke, Becky, a couple of minutes ago to a doctor who was on hand here when this missile landed. And she said she was in one of the adjacent buildings. At first she saw a flash, then she felt this massive boom and heard that gigantic explosion. And she described the chaos that happened here afterwards. And she said the worst thing for her was to come to this area right here, see a building where a lot of her colleagues have been working in before, absolutely flattened. And wondering whether they had managed to save themselves and whether they had managed to save the patients who were inside. Of course, most of those patients being children. And the Ukrainians are now saying that the death toll for this particular site is two with dozens of injured. But for all of Kyiv, actually, 29 people. There were other impact sites here in this city as well. And then if we look over here, this just puts into context how powerful that explosion was, Becky. You can see over there, that whole building, which is a gigantic hospital building, also badly damaged by this explosion. Pretty much all the windows on that facade have been destroyed. The facade itself also as well. The Ukrainians are saying that this absolutely was a Russian missile. The Russians have tried to call that into question. They are calling this, Becky, an attack on Ukraine's healthcare sector and also an attack on the children of Ukraine as well.",

And that will sort of back up what is expected to be this commitment in the final declaration, that NATO is on an irreversible path to joining NATO.

GERSHON BASKIN, MIDDLE EAST DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES ORGANISATION; FORMER HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR:  Right, Becky. There is a major difference right now and that's in the apparent Hamas concession, that they're willing to enter into the first phase of the ceasefire agreement. That President Biden talked about a month ago, which would be a six-week period without having upfront an Israeli obligation to end the war. Apparently, from what we understand, Hamas has been assured by Qatar and by Egypt, probably with backing from the United States, that once the six-week theory began, even if they failed to reach an agreement on phase II, the ceasefire would continue and would become sustained or permanent. This is what Hamas is believing. But of course, the Israeli government, the prime minister's office in particular, have put out announcements that contradict the idea that the ceasefire would be permanent or that an agreement can be reached.

So if he can get through the NATO summit, we have the Republican National Convention next week. Trump will be naming his vice presidential nominee. I think some of the focus will get away from the president and he would have bought time. And that will make it much more difficult when everyone comes back together after the RNC for there to be time to replace him as the nominee or the momentum to do so. Having said that, any gaffes or slip-ups or senior moments that the president might experience over the next couple of days, they could undermine all the political work he's done to consolidate his position. I think what will be especially important is a solo press conference that the president is planning to hold on Thursday. This will be the most high profile, unscripted, spontaneous event since the debate, which was an absolute debacle. So he's under enormous pressure, not just domestically and inside his own party but the rest of the world is going to be watching this as well, with critical questions about the future of NATO on the line.",

He plays at Manchester City and who is arguably one of the best players in the Premier League. But without key players at the back, so that means, Becky, that we should be set up for an interesting game forward on the front foot, Spain; whereas France, with their more technical players at the back, hopefully should be able to unpick them.

But it doesn't matter exactly, right? It doesn't matter how you play. It's how far you get. I do want to just add a little bit to Seb's excellent insights there. I love the fact that Spain had got terrific team unity. There's no question about that. Yes, they're without three players tonight, a couple due to suspension. Pedri is out injured as well. But I love the Spanish's team unity and I love watching players like Lamine Yamal, just 16 years of age; Nico Williams just 21; wonderful, youthful talent. And they are building their foundations on that, are La Roja. But you're absolutely right about France, too. They, in effect, are a wounded beast. They have nothing to lose, in a sense that I feel they can only get better. They can only get better. They haven't scored a single goal, Becky, from open play; two own goals at this tournament and a penalty; one, Kylian Mbappe, penalty. They can only improve on that surely. And Mbappe, who by his very own high standards, has not had the best of tournaments -- yes, he's had the broken nose, of course. But let's hear now for more perspective from Didier Deschamps, the manager, whose team I feel can only get better. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DIDIER DESCHAMPS, FRANCE COACH/MANAGER (through translator):  Listen, if you're bored, you can watch something else. It's not a big deal, is it? You don't have to do anything else. Listen, this is a special European championship, where it's very difficult for everyone. So far the number of goals has been much lower than in the past. What I know is that we have the ability to share our emotions and make a lot of French people happy through the results we've been able to achieve. Especially during this complicated period in our country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It opens with pomp and pageantry, drums, horns and local dignitaries marching through the city. Then a nod of respect to gladiators past, for centuries of tradition come to life in the present.",
