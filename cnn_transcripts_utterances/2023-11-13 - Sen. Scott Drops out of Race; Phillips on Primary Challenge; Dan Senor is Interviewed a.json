But if it's because I was in New Hampshire speaking with voters here that that was disrespectful to black voters, I take exception to that because when I'm in South Carolina shortly visiting with black voters, that is not disrespectful to Muslim voters in Michigan.

Well, the Israeli decisionmakers view is, the outrage against Israel, both in the region and on the streets of the west is - you know, in Paris, London, New York, Washington, D.C., the protests, began before Israel even responded to October 7th. Their sense is, the objection - the outrage directed against Israel is that Jews object to being slaughtered. That's the - you know, that - that - we just - that we - that we're not OK with this. That's what they're outraged about. And they say, OK.So, then we responded. And many leaders around the world said Israel does have a right to self-defense. Israel does have a right to go in and take out Hamas. President Biden said it, I mean very clearly. In fact, he's very explicitly said recently no cease-fire. Israel says, OK, so the Hamas command and control centers and capabilities are underneath these hospitals. So, if you say we have a right to self- defense, and you say that we have a right and that we should go in and take Hamas out, how do we - how do we like reconcile this with the apprehension of us going into hospitals? At some point, if Hamas co- locates its resources and its top commanders underneath hospitals and mosques, and U.N. run schools, what are we supposed to do? And so the Israeli leaders are sort of throwing their hands up. I mean they'll make tweaks here and there, the pauses that we're hearing about a few hours a day. But at the end of the day, if Israel is serious about getting rid of Hamas, they're going to have to go into these facilities. And the Biden administration kind of knows it.",

Let's start with what a 2025 and moving forward, Kasie, immigration - I don't even want to call it immigration plan under Trump, what this would all look like, mass deportations, rounding many of them up in camps, holding them, completely changing, going back to Title 42.

And I think one of the things that we learned from the Trump administration is that you should take what they say they're going to do at face value and believe that they are actually going to - to do - to try to do these things. And it's clear that they are, and \"The Times\" reported, that they're trying to do this without requiring new legislation from Congress, and they're trying to use some of the same tactics that they used when they were in office previously, including, you know, reassigning money from the Defense Department, among other things.But I do think that this is a case where there's, I think, some mistakes made in 2016 when we were covering Donald Trump in that it was viewed often, the things that he would say, including policies like the Muslim ban, et cetera, as though these were just words. And I think the takeaway here, and, you know, these - these policies are pretty alarming what they're proposing here, and I think we should believe what they say if - that if Trump gets elected we're going to see some of this.",

They were actually hoping for a disruption. They were hoping for riots at the airports when they tried to impose the Muslim ban. I remember that. There was crazy coverage. But a lot of people rushed - a lot of lawyers rushed to the airports to try and block it. The courts were brought into it. It's a reminder that there were something like 10 million households in this country that have mixed status families, meaning, one is documented and one is not.They're trying to sort of impose this as a strategy on a country that has already seen a lot of disruption, a lot of uncertainty, not just with the economy, but, of course, with the pandemic. It was that level of disruption that helped to contribute to his defeat in 2020. It looks like they're going to try it again. I don't like it as a political strategy, but it sounds like that's what they're going to attempt.",
