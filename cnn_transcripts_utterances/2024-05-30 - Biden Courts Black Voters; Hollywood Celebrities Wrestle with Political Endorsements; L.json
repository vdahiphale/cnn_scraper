Perhaps Taylor Swift might move some people. I don't know. What do you think, Tara. PALMERI: Yes, I mean, that was the thinking in 2020 that Taylor Swift's endorsement of Joe Biden may have activated some younger voters to actually go out and vote. But I do think that celebrities are aware that Donald Trump, they - they came out pretty forcefully against him in 2016 and he still won. 2020, he still won a very sizable amount of the popular vote. Basically half the country still voted for them. And I do think ultimately they probably feel like this is also their careers and they're not sure if they're willing to put their names out on the line anymore to fight against this person that clearly half of the country is still behind. And it impacts them if you're trying to sell records. And it's just such a divisive, polarizing time that people just like, you know, country music stars, they don't want to go out against Donald Trump because they know so many of their listeners and followers are also supportive of him. I think it was easier around the time of Barack Obama because he was like truly a transformational figure. He's almost like a celebrity himself. It didn't feel quite as polarizing. But this time around, with Trump in the mix, I think celebrities are just like, we tried in 2016. We said we were moving to Canada in 2017. We didn't. You know, 2020, they came out, but now they're probably just like, it doesn't matter.",
