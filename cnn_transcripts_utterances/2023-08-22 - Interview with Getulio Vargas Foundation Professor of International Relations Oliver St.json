And a very warm welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Paula Newton in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. The leaders of Brazil, China, India and South Africa are gathered in Johannesburg for the 15th summit of the BRICS nations. The first, in fact, in-person summit of the group since COVID includes one notable absentee, Russian President Vladimir Putin. Now, he is participating virtually after his visit was shelved by an arrest warrant for alleged war crimes tied to the invasion of Ukraine. The warrant was issued by the International Criminal Court to which South Africa is, of course, a signatory. Now, there will be a lot up for discussion in a summit that could determine what the future of this bloc looks like. Correspondent David McKenzie has been following all of this for us, and he joins us now from Johannesburg with some details. David, an ambitious agenda here, that's including potential expansion. How does this grouping see its political opportunities, its priorities, especially given this started as an economic bloc?",

You did have the state media of China saying that the discussions betweenRamaphosa, the president of South Africa, and Xi Jinping did touch on the Ukraine war and that they called for a peaceful resolution. You, of course, have had African nations led by Ramaphosa trying to develop some kind of an independent broker between Ukraine and Russia in ending the war. At this stage, that really hasn't gained a huge amount of traction. But if you believe the South Africans, they say, their so-called nonalignment on the issue of the Russian war allows them to, in the future, play potentially a pivotal role. Because Russia is part of BRICS, it would be very hard for them to take a very strong stance on the war in Ukraine. And that plays into Vladimir Putin's hands. Of course, he blamed sanctions on the overall economic woes of some of the developing nations. And also said that it's not his fault that there is a shortage of grain and prices are rising, despite them pulling out of the Black Sea Grain Deal. So, as usual, Putin was putting the finger on everyone else. But he does have, in some cases, a sympathetic ear in this group of nations, whether they can lead to concrete policy and politics, that's another matter.",

And I -- you know, I don't think that, you know, India would like to have to craft its monetary policy incorporation with China. But I think that, certainly, we'll see some efforts to, for example, prioritize local currencies in intra BRICS trade. So, that's certainly is an issue. I mean, there's something there also that's a bit, you know, symbolic. So, Lula likes to say that he would like to reduce, you know, the use of the U.S. dollar. because that's also popular among part of his somewhat more nationalistic and anti-American voting coalition back at home. So, I don't think we'll see large steps into that correction. But clearly, I think, there will be a commitment towards using the Chinese currency more frequently, and that has mostly to do with the perception among BRICS countries that the United States is unduly using, that structural advantage of controlling of the international reserve currency to defend its national interest. Be it by imposing sanctions that have not been accepted by the U.N. or by using other -- its strength to, let's say, you know, spend more than others can.

I would agree with you. I think, right, there's no appetite among BRICS countries to let Russia down.

But the vote was overshadowed by the return of Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister who was ousted in 2006 and the country's most famous politician. Local media covering his every move from his arrival to the airport to his arrest over allegations he has said are political motivated. Now, he's linked to the same party as the new prime minister, adding to speculation that he has made a deal with the country's military and its political elite. Paula Hancocks breaks down all of it for us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  Cheers from supporters welcome Thaksin Shinawatra back to Thailand, bowing to a portrait of king amid speculation the ousted prime minister may seek a royal pardon. Briefly meeting followers, Thaksin was taken into custody and to court, where he sentenced to eight years on corruption charges brought during his 50 years self-imposed exile. Charges he denies. A doctor says he has underlying health issues and will be held in separate room under 24 hours supervision. The former prime minister was ousted in 2006 by a military coup but is still considered an influential and divisive figure. This supporter said, I am so happy and delighted because I've been missing him. I've joined his fight since it all began. The same day, Srettha Thavisin, the candidate for the Thaksin-backed Pheu Thai Party was voted in by parliament to become Thailand's new prime minister. Speaking to CNN before the election, he said, the economy was the priority. SRETTHA THAVISIN, THAI PRIME MINISTER-ELECT:  Thailand has been in a bad economic situation the last five to eight years. OK. We are kind of in a coma. HANCOCKS (voiceover):  Pheu Thai only came second in the election, but the progressive Move Forward Party, which won the most votes, was blocked from forming a government by conserve military-backed parties. Pheu Thai has now aligned itself with two of those military-backed parties, a stunning turnaround, reversing a campaign pledge to keep the military out of politics.",

It goes to contributing, aiding and abetting when we sell billions of dollars of weapons to the Saudi government that uses indiscriminately, recklessly, unlawfully to terrorize the people of Yemen for seven years, that's not just engagement, that's complicity, and that is something that we are responsible for. Many, many governments engage and have normal relations with Saudi Arabia that I encourage our government to have, but that's not what Biden is proposing. Biden is proposing an unprecedented security guarantee to a reckless sociopathic dictatorship, and that is not necessary to maintain U.S. interest. In fact, it endangers U.S. interests by embroiling us in the belligerent action of Saudi Arabia, including most recently, the invasion of Yemen. Now, those are not the only two options to us. There's a more sensible and balanced way to approach a normal relationship with Saudi Arabia that doesn't include giving them billions in weapons and security guarantees. And I think that the -- in terms of reforms, the main take away from Mohammed bin Salman's rehabilitation is impunity. He has proven to the world that he can murder a journalist, kidnap him from the United States, chop him up into body parts, jail and torture women, indiscriminately bombard Yemenis and yet, President Biden will show up fist bumping with him and chumming and pouting around with him and now, offering him a security guarantee.

Guy, I want to go to you first. This movie comes out just before the 50th anniversary of the war. You know, Golda, as she's named in your film, remains a controversial leader in Israel. Many still see her as responsible for the war and the immense loss of life. And I want you to note, which is an extraordinary scene in this film, that she said to a young Ariel Sharon that all political careers end in failure. What enduring image of Golda were you looking for with this film. GUY NATTIV, DIRECTOR, \"GOLDA\":  You know, she was the pariah of Israel in - - after the war. Everybody -- it was very convenient to blame her as an older woman who's not -- you know, who's coming from Milwaukee and, you know, she took the blame. She said, this is on me. And she resigned after - - in 1974. And I remember kind of like the news week of Israel with her face, with an unflattering photo of her and a big kind of a title saying, the debacle, you know. And her name was stained for so many years and, you know, until all the declassified protocols came out 10 years ago, and we understood that this is not the narrative that was told to us. She was not the only one in charge. She relayed on her commanders that were dysfunctional, and she actually saved us by dealing and willing with Kissinger.
