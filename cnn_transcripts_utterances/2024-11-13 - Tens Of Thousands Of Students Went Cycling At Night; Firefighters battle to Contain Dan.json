If you said Mount Vesuvius, put your hands up. It lies on the Bay of Naples on the southern end of Italy. It is typical for the famous ancient city of Pompeii to get loads of visitors, especially with Italy seeing record numbers of tourists traveling there during the summer season. Now, in order to preserve the archaeological site, Italian officials are limiting the number of tourists who can enter the city each day. CNN`s Barbie Latza Nadeau shows us how the plan could make your visit there safer and more sustainable. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The new regulation comes after a record summer of visitors with peaks of over 36,000. Visitors will also have to buy personalized tickets with their names on them in an effort to stop travel groups from buying up tickets to sell at higher prices. The changes are part of an effort to make important tourist destinations like Pompeii sustainable by focusing on the quality of the experience for the visitor rather than on the quantity of tickets sold. Pompeii was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D. and is an ongoing archaeological dig with just two-thirds of the site excavated. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
