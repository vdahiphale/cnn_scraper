Just over 100 people have been rescued so far with search operations still underway. At least 78 people are confirmed dead. But with hundreds more still missing and feared drowned.

As you understand, we're now about 30 hours in in an accident that took place 47 nautical miles from shore. And I was just speaking to the Coast Guard now. And we're starting to see the possible first reasons as to why this occurred.They are saying that there was a shift in the weight on the boat. We have seen images of this boat packed with people. We don't know if it was mechanical damage that initially caused people to panic and therefore move to system size to size and therefore this is what led to the boat capsizing and then eventually sinking. What we do know is that there were hundreds of people on board and at the moment we're looking at 104 who have been rescued so far. Most of them are right behind me in this warehouse. They're being sheltered here. We saw it late last night. And from what I understand also this morning, a number of body bags being carried from the port to a new place where they're going to be identified. DNA identification checks are going to take place. And authorities here are telling us that from now on obviously, the time is crucial. The helicopters have not been able to find any more people or bodies at sea. We understand that the relatives of some of the people are here. And also, from some of the survivors we're hearing accounts that there were many more people on board including women and children.

Well, the Wall Street Journal has obtained remarkable video showing what appears to be a Russian soldier on the battlefield of Bakhmut surrendering to a Ukrainian drone. You can see the soldier running in the trenches and dodging mortar fire. CNN spoke to the drone commander. He says the Russian soldier threw his weapon aside, raised his hands and use hand signals to say he would not fight.The drone then dropped a note telling him to follow if he wanted to surrender. The Wall Street Journal interviewed the soldier in the presence of a Ukrainian guard. CNN doesn't know whether he was speaking under duress. And we haven't seen the raw video. That video was edited and produced with music added. Well, now Russian forces are putting up a fierce fight in the early stages of Ukraine's counter offensive. Ukrainian officials say they're taking both offensive and defensive positions, as Russia uses shells, airstrikes and mines to try to stop their progress. Despite those difficulties on the battlefield, Ukraine says its troops are advancing slowly but surely, in the east and south. And this video exclusive to Reuters News Agency shows a village in the Donetsk region. Newly liberated from Russian forces. Every building is damaged that all the Russians are gone.

And from what I'm reading, in terms of expertise and analysis online, that second and third line is very tough indeed.So I think that what you will see is these continuing operations, trying to find those weak points. Once they've identified a weak point, they'll concentrate force and tried to break through. The risk, of course, is then that Russians can direct their firepower against that concentrated force and then cause greater casualties and greater losses. But the Ukrainians have to do this.

And that's absolutely vital. They have to take every inch of their territory back, including Crimea because if they don't, they leave the Russians poised to reinitiate the conflict down the track.So the taste of real victory I think will happen later this year if the Ukrainians can break through and if they can isolate Crimea, at the same time as holding off Russian forces in the Donbas then I think we're in striking distance of victory in 2024.",

He also is expected to reiterate calls for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. But a senior State Department Official went out of his way to manage any thinking out there and the prospects for a breakthrough. I want you to take a look at this statement. This is what the Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Kritenbrink said earlier, he said, quote, \"We're not going to Beijing with the intent of having some sort of breakthrough or transformation the way that we deal with one another. We're coming to Beijing with a realistic, confident approach and a sincere desire to manage our competition in the most responsible way possible.\" Now, Secretary Blinken is also expected while in China to raise the issue of the three wrongfully detained Americans in China. And to call for appropriate military to military cooperation and communication. Out earlier, there was that testy phone call that took place on Wednesday between Blinken and his Chinese counterpart, the Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang. Qin Gang urged the United States to respect China's core concerns including the issue of Taiwan. According to Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs readout it said this in regard to the meeting, according to the ministry he said, \"The United States should respect China's position on the Taiwan question, stop interfering in China's internal affairs and stop undermining China's sovereignty, security and development interests in the name of competition.\" At the diplomatic rift between the U.S. and China has been deepening over a slew of issues from access to sensitive technology like A.I. and chips to trade to Taiwan, to territorial disputes, including the spy balloon the list goes on.

But at this meeting, considering how far and how fast we've moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range stay, to allow the committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy.

So, we know that a couple of the smaller regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank most famously toppled. And the question was whether that would cause a broader credit tightening that we might see in the economy. And so, this was a case of a rate rise delayed rather than a rate rise for gone.

And what the Fed is saying has been saying for a while is this tightening cycle is not over yet. What happened was Wall Street got awfully carried away with its own recession talk. The economy kept chugging along, no matter what Wall Street kept saying.As Wall Street economists saw recession coming, they thought the Fed would have to respond by cutting rates. And so, time and again, Powell has said no, we mean it, we're going to keep rates high to try and crash inflation. But I do want to come back to what you said. I don't think that Powell thinks that his legacy is solely being about inflation. This is a guy who I think is took us through the pandemic. And was really willing to take some risks to make sure that people stayed in work. And that's actually the thing I admire most about the Powell legacy.",
