But to the extent that I do think that there is some appeal around Donald Trump, I think part of it has been really around his rhetoric, his sexist rhetoric. I think some of it has really been around he's a -- he's a caricature. And so he's constantly in the media.

I think it's a trap for Harris because she already has people who are worried about that, about Donald Trump. She's got to worry about people who think the economy's bad, who think that we can have four more years of this administration. I think she needs to be litigating how she's going to do things differently from Joe Biden. That's I think it's a trap to go backwards for both of them. KATE BEDINGFIELD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  But one of the things you have to do in a campaign is move the conversation to the places where you're strong and it is true that she has disadvantaged on the economy, doesn't mean she shouldn't talk about the economy.

That is something where it could be appropriate. Look, at the end of the day, the biggest thing we want is a continued -- continued use and an application of a peaceful transition of power.

But let's not talk about Donald Trump. You have elements of this Department of Justice under Merrick Garland that has targeted parents who are just simply concerned about their child's education, calling them domestic terrorists.

I'm not -- you know, I'm not denigrating the reach of Joe Rogan. It's significant. I'm not sure that's the best use of her time in the last three weeks of this campaign when she's trying to reach these particularly these swing voters in the key states. I do -- I do think the Bret Baier interview makes sense because if you look at the Republican -- Brad and I were actually talking about this in the break. If you look at the Republican primary, as much, as many as 20 -- 20 percent of Republican voters in the Republican primary process did not vote for Donald Trump. And those people are largely Fox News -- that's the Fox News audience. A lot of people watch Fox News, some of those voters are people she needs. So that to me makes a lot of sense. I will be honest. I don't know that doing Joe Rogan in the last three weeks of the campaign makes ton of sense for her.",
