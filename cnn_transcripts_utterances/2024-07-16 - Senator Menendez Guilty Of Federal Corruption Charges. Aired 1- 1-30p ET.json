Right now we now understand he has been found guilty on all 16 federal charges. He has -- he'd been facing charges of bribery fraud, acting as a foreign agent and obstruction. So that is something I just want to let my team know I'm not getting mixed minus. So if we can fix that. Otherwise, I'm just going to hear myself as I report out this news.But this is a trial that has been going on for weeks. And the jury now after deliberating for a couple of days coming to this conclusion, which is really a bombshell. He had been facing 16 federal charges, and he has been found guilty on all of them. With us now, we have former US Attorney Harry Litman. Harry, what's your reaction to this?",

This is a very short deliberation, they were obviously completely persuaded. This is going to go down as the trial involving the gold bars. They found nearly half a million dollars in cash stuffed in the senator's closet and big gold bars.They had -- one of the people who actually bribed him testify. The evidence was really overwhelming. And then we added to it the obstruction counts, he's been found guilty of everything. It's as sort of severe a judgment and a kind of you have to think to a long career in public service as one can imagine. But it was really seen very, very strong as the evidence was coming in. And in that sense, it's not a surprise.",

So, Harry, as you mentioned, obviously, this is something that he gained a lot of notoriety for, because as you had official searching his home, they were finding hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash stuffed in closets, stuffed in jackets. There were gold bars.But let's just talk about what he is now standing convicted of, using his influence in many different considerable ways to the benefit of the government of Qatar, of Egypt, trying to influence, you know, criminal prosecutions, for instance. These are serious charges for someone who was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It's really stunning.",

Look, in the question -- in the case of Egypt, I should say, there were allegations that he had used his influence to give them information about US interest in the country, so very much working against US national security, Harry, which has been -- and has continue to raise questions as he stepped aside, obviously, from that position on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but as he continued to be a senator.This -- now he's convicted of doing, putting US national security interests at risk.",

But, you know, Senator Menendez has been -- not the first time he's been in the crosshairs of the federal government. And in fact, are there any other ways where potentially the US interests were compromised.Now, look, this is -- this wasn't about selling nuclear secrets, it was about favoring commercial interests. Nevertheless, it's such a rank and down the middle betrayal of what he's supposed to be. And we have had, well, this case is very interesting, because it can joins the sort of down and -- most down and dirty sort of New Jersey bribery with also theft of honest services. That's a highfalutin way of saying he cheated the people -- the have the right to the honest government. They were able to expect and should have expected. Also obstruction, it's, as you say, 16 different counts. It's a really long and damning sheet. But this particular international feature is really a kind of a cutting edge feature. And that's what will, I think, really kind of the Department of Justice, really -- it really made me motivated to go pedal to the metal. Now, as you I think know, his wife was a co- defendant here and he tried to win few ways to sort of say it was all her doing the gold bars, et cetera. She now because it appears personal illness, her trial has been indefinitely postponed. So this really is the sort of culmination of this very long, serious investigation.",

In 2017, he was facing bribery and corruption charges, and the jury not being able to reach a verdict. The idea that being given that lifeline, he turned around and began on this other path that has brought him to where he is today, 16 charges that he is being held responsible for.I think a lot of people are surprised that he didn't take that as a sign to get his house in order.",

Senator Bob Menendez found guilty of all 16 counts that he was facing in his federal corruption trial.I want to go to Capitol Hill now for some reaction from CNN's Lauren Fox. He'd been facing among the 16 federal charges, Lauren, bribery, fraud, acting as a foreign agent, and obstruction. And I think one of the things, and you're not on Capitol Hill, you're here in our Washington Bureau. But I think one of the things that kept raising questions, I know you were asking about it, so many journalists were, is that he continued to have access during this time period to classified information, to classified briefings. He had stepped aside, was supposed to be temporarily, as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but he was still technically on the committee and able to access sensitive information.",

      "sentences": "Yes, the backlash even from some of his colleagues too, Brianna, was swift when he was charged last fall. There were more than 30 Democrats who were calling for him to resign his seat in the Senate, and repeatedly, our colleagues had been pressing Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as to why the senator was allowed to continue receiving classified briefings. And Schumer had repeatedly said that it was really up to Menendez to decide whether it was appropriate or not for him to be attending those meetings.I would also just point out that right now, we are waiting to see what decision Menendez wants to make about his Senate seat. Does he choose to resign this seat? Does he continue wanting to serve? And if that is the case, what are the next steps, what are the options for Senate leadership if they wanted to push this issue. One of the options is they could try to expel him. Again, we don't have any sense that that is the plan that they want to take right now. This is all breaking news. This is coming in very quickly. But it's just a good reminder, Brianna, that there is recourse that leadership would have if they wanted to force this issue. A lot of senators who were not calling him -- on him to resign last fall, said that they wanted to give him an opportunity in court. Now, obviously, given the fact that he has now been found guilty on these counts, that gives you a sense that perhaps Democrats may be willing to more forcefully come out those who didn't last fall to say that he should step aside. But again, Brianna, we are waiting, we are standing by as to what Democratic leadership's plans are and what Senator Menendez's plans are when it comes to his Senate seat and his ability to serve in that chamber.

And it wouldn't be uncharacteristic for him to continue to do that, as he maybe continues with an appeals process here. Can you just talk a little bit more about the political headache that that creates for Democrats? How does that look, if they don't move to expel him from the chamber?",

I mean, I think that this is going to be a question that leadership really has to answer for themselves, what is the process that they want moving forward if Senator Menendez decided that he did not want to resign. Again, we just don't know right now, Brianna, what his plans are, what leadership's plans are. But we are reaching out to sources trying to get additional information, because this is a very quickly evolving situation.And obviously, politically, going into the November election, you know, Democratic leaders do not want their members to be facing questions about why they are still working with a colleague who has now been found guilty of such serious charges.

Lauren, standby for us, I want to bring Harry Litman back in to talk a little bit about that.He is, based on what this jury found, a risk to national security, Harry. And we now understand that sentencing is going to be October 29th, so not that far around the corner here. Give us a sense of what you would expect with the range of possibilities are on that.",

And I want to read his brief statement in full. It says, \"in light of this guilty verdict, Senator Menendez must now do what is right for his constituents, the Senate and our country, and resign.\"And we should note that just a couple of weeks ago, you know, Senator Chuck Schumer had continued to be asked about Senator Menendez's place in the United States Senate, his additional receiving of those classified briefings that we were talking about a few minutes ago. And, you know, Schumer had said repeatedly that he was disappointed, but he had stopped short of calling on Senator Menendez to resign. So this obviously a very significant development, Brianna.",

I mean, as the United States senator, he still has classified status and can still receive classified briefings. I would point out that the other place of recourse if Senator Menendez chose not to resign is there could be a vote to expel him. That would take two thirds of the Senate.But it is just important to point out that right now, we do not know what Senator Menendez's plans are and therefore it's hard to predict what recourse Senate leadership has, of course, getting this new information now that Senator Menendez is asking for him to resign.

This is our breaking news that New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, of course, a Democrat, has been found guilty of all 16 counts in this federal corruption trial against him. That includes counts of bribery, of fraud, of acting as a foreign agent and obstruction.This was a trial that took several weeks. And actually let's listen in now if we can to Senator Menendez. Oh, this isn't this is not live, this is taped as we do await Senator Menendez. But he was convicted of all 16 counts. And I think, Kara, one of the most stunning things is this was the senior New Jersey Democratic senator, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Any senator obviously has such an important role, but Senator Bob Menendez's role has been huge. And he abused it, and the cost of his loyalty to his country, the cost of his patriotism, you know, a few $100,000 in cash, some of which, as you had reported, had his fingerprints on it, gold bars, a car, a no show job for his wife, Nadine, who is still awaiting her fate in this. This was ultimately the payoff that he is finally facing justice for.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna, that's right. I mean, the amount of evidence that came into this case showing the steps that the senator had taken, particularly when he was chairman and on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I mean, that is the part that seemed the most offensive to the prosecution, that he had betrayed his trust to the American public in order to benefit and enrich him and his wife personally.I mean, some of the things that the prosecution laid out before the jury that the senator did, was telling the Egyptians, through intermediaries, the number of staffs at the US Embassy in Cairo. That was something that prosecutors highlighted as something that was incredibly sensitive, and that could allow the Egyptians to track not only the staff at the embassy, but anyone else who was working through the embassy. So that was something that they underscore to the jury was a betrayal. The other things, giving the Egyptians a heads up about questions, pointed questions they would receive about the murder of the former Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He gave them a heads up in advance. Another thing, he wrote a letter for the Egyptians to use to lobby fellow US senators to try to get them comfortable with Egypt about human rights abuses to speed along the signing off of aid, military aid to Egypt. So those were some of the abuses that prosecutors underscored during the trial. And some of the things that they felt were the most egregious, the most offensive that the senator was willing to betray his country. And that is why they charged him as acting as a foreign agent for the government of Egypt. I mean, this also shows that the jury soundly rejected Menendez's arguments that these meetings were routine. I mean, another moment from this trial was Menendez at the Morton Steakhouse in Washington, DC sitting with Egyptian officials and his wife, Nadine Menendez. According to an FBI agent who testified in this case, had said to them, what else can my love do for you? You know, a sense that there was a transactional relationship between the senator and top military and intelligence officials, spies from Egypt. And that is what the prosecution had really homed in on in this, as well as the other alleged bribes in this case, interfering in the prosecution of some of his co-defendant and the associates of another co-defendant know all things that are very much offensive to the Justice Department prosecutors, and something that this jury had found the senator was guilty of doing.
