It gets dark at night, you can see very clearly, we're not in any flight path for any airlines or other craft. And you can look up in the sky and see these drones and the way that they're moving. They move forward, they stop, they hover, they move sideways, they stop, they hover, they move backwards. It's obviously not an airplane. It's not a helicopter because it's not making any noise. And so, you know it's a drone. And then there are multiple of them. And then they tell us, you're not seeing drones, you're mistaken identity.

He made it sound like none of the sightings were drones.And then, when he was called out on it and pinned down, he said, well, I didn't say all of them. Well, it's a game. They don't say that surveillance, but it's pretty obvious that you're not hovering the drones in these specific areas. They're going to specific areas, hovering for extended periods of time. Common sense would tell you that this is planned and that they're doing something and they're not just taking photographs to put up on their Web site of a beautiful installation, government installation. What they're doing is they're surveillancing. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out. And you know, the hard part here is that common sense dictates that they're doing something.

Kennedy Junior's campaign lawyer, Aaron Siri filed a petition in 2022, asking the FDA to revoke approval of the polio vaccine. Well now, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor himself, has a strong warning for anyone questioning the vaccine's efficacy. White House bureau chief for The Washington Post, Toluse Olorunnipa, joining us now. Good morning, Toluse. Let's start with Mitch McConnell's statement, and it reads in part, \"Efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed -- they are dangerous. Anyone seeking the Senate's consent to serve in the incoming administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\" Trump himself has also called the polio vaccine the greatest thing.

He's going to be stepping down from that post, but still going to have a lot of influence with his fellow senators. He's been a part of that body for quite a long time. Now, he is retiring, so he has a little bit more leeway to break from the party orthodoxy and potentially even oppose some of Donald Trump's candidate selections. And I think he is trying to send a shot across the bow, and let Trump and those around him know that not only is RFK someone that he is not very comfortable voting to support, but that if RFK is going to be confirmed by the Senate, broadly, he is going to need to moderate his position. He's going to need to clarify some of these controversial statements and positions that he's taken in the past and that his associates have embraced. And so, I think it's very clear that Mitch McConnell is sending a message to Donald Trump that RFK and a couple of these other controversial selections for the Cabinet are not a shoe-in. That the Republicans are not going to rubber stamp everything that Donald Trump wants to do when it comes to some of these more out of the mainstream choices. And so, this is one of the few statements that we've heard from McConnell since he has decided to step aside from his role as the Senate Minority Leader.

And so, it seems to be working Hegseth's fortune seems to be getting much better. He seems like he is more close to getting confirmed than he was just a week or a couple of weeks ago. And I think, the other part of this is that Trump realizes that he has slim majorities in the Senate and definitely in the House. And if he allows, you know, one or two senators, or one or two House members to tank his Cabinet picks or his legislative agenda, it's going to make him a weekend president. He is already a lame duck, and he wants to make sure that his Republican Party is in lockstep behind him, because it's going to be necessary in order for him to get anything done legislatively. And that's why you're seeing this pressure campaign. So far, it seems to be working, but I know a lot of these senators are very independent minded, and they don't like being pressured, so, we'll have to see whether it lasts.

General Kellogg, who is his Ukraine negotiator, designated, has written articles on this. But the problem is, if you want to have a negotiation, you have to have both parties interested.
