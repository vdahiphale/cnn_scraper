I'm Wolf Blitzer, back in the CNN Election Center. We're standing by, to see if there are any new shifts, in those key races. As more votes come in, from the pivotal battlegrounds, of Arizona and Nevada, those States, home to two undecided Senate races that are crucial to determining the final balance of power in the U.S. Senate. Right now, Democrats hold 40 - 48 seats in the U.S. Senate. Republicans have 49. That's a two - that's two seats short of the 51, they need, to win majority control of the Senate. The fight for control of the House of Representatives also remains undecided. Right now, remember, 218 seats are needed to win the majority in the House. Democrats just won some more of seats. They now have 195. Republicans are holding 209. 31 - 31 House seats remain undecided. They're still in play, right now. To win House control, Republicans must win seven seats, in those competitive contests that are still playing out, right now. Republicans, very optimistic, about their prospects, since they, are currently leading in 11 races. Democrats have more of an uphill fight. They must win, right now, they must win 21 competitive seats to hold on to the House. They are currently leading in 16 races. Right now, our correspondents are standing by in Arizona and Nevada. First, let's go to Kyung Lah, in Arizona, first. Kyung, we're closing in, on getting some new results, from Arizona, right now. I know they're working on it, right behind you. What's the latest? KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they've been working 14- hour, 18-hour shifts, a day, to try to get through what the Board of Supervisors is calling just a historic number of early ballots that were returned, on Election Day, so, and these early ballots also received just before Election Day. So, it's a tremendous amount. And they're working through them as quickly but as accurately as possible. What we are waiting for, in just one hour, we are going to get another picture, into how this race stands, the U.S. Senate race, as well as a critical Governor race, here in Arizona. Approximately 60 to - 60,000 - 60,000-plus votes will be released. These are votes from Saturday night, Sunday night and Monday. We should get a bit more of a picture, of how those early ballots, before Election Day, are going to fall. But Wolf, it is very important to note that these are not the same day Election Day votes. That is also going to give us a different picture. But what we are looking for, in the next hour or so is to get a better idea of where these races stand. Wolf?",

We've been promised once, at night, there will be updated results. We haven't been told exactly what time. But we anticipate it will be soon, because it was exactly this time last night that we got the results.There are still tens of thousands of votes to be counted in Nevada, 17 counties, including this one, Clark County, the most populous county in the state, about three quarters of Nevadans live here. This building behind me is where we were just inside a short time ago. The tabulating is still going on. We're not allowed to show live pictures inside there, because of security reasons. We are allowed to take pictures. We're also not allowed to show the faces of the workers inside, for those security reasons. But we know we've been told today that there are at least 63,000 ballots, still to be counted, in this county alone, and includes 50,000 ballots that were either mailed in, or put in drop boxes, on Election Day, on Tuesday, and then another 5,500 provisional ballots, and 7,100 ballots that need to be cured. Those are ballots that sometimes don't have signatures, people are called, \"Give us your signature,\" and then the ballot will be counted. But either way, there's still a lot of ballots to count. Two very close high-profile races, the Senate race, and the gubernatorial race. Tomorrow is Veterans Day. But the tabulators will be here, tomorrow, like it's any normal workday, because ballots are allowed to be mailed in, until Saturday, as long as they're postmarked by Tuesday. So, they will be counting through Saturday, no matter what. Wolf?",

      "sentences": "Yes. And first, with the total outstanding vote, statewide, you see there, our estimate is that approximately 120,000 votes are still outstanding statewide. Now, Gary Tuchman just said, 63,000, in Clark County alone, Las Vegas area there. So, half of this is in Clark County, which will be key to watch.But what the Decision Desk did here, at CNN, was sort of calculate what each candidate would need to win, what percentage of that outstanding vote, in order to win this race. So, Catherine Cortez Masto, the Democratic incumbent, who is currently behind, in this race, she would need 53 percent to 56 percent of the remaining 120,000 votes, roughly, in Nevada, in order to win this race. Adam Laxalt, who, you know, Wolf is ahead in this race, he needs a smaller percentage. He only needs between 41 percent and 44 percent of the remaining votes. But obviously, since such a huge chunk of the outstanding vote, is from Clark County, this percentage, 53 percent to 56 percent, is not entirely out of the realm of possibility, for Catherine Cortez Masto. So, that's why we've got to count more votes, before we can see which way this race will fall, Wolf.",

This is what we've been waiting for. It's the largest county, and it's the largest place of outstanding votes, Clark County, right here.Let me just pull up our chalkboard here, and make it easier to do this here. Let's bring this up right here. All right, you have Senator Cortez Masto. She's the Democratic incumbent. You see her on the top. Blake Masters is the Republican challenger. He is trailing. These votes have just come in. It's a decent number of votes. Now, there are tens of thousands of votes out. So, this is not going to get you to the finish line by any means. But 7,480 votes in Clark County. 4,195 votes, for Adam Laxalt in this. So that's 61 percent. And that's 34 percent. And so, you're looking at these votes, right now. And again, so, in Clark County, she was running at 52 percent, if you round it up. He was running at 46 percent, if you round it up. In this one new installment? There are others to come, right? But this is what you're looking for in a campaign. And if you're with us in 2020, you watched us go through this math, right? So, she's at 52 percent. She wants every - whether it's 10 votes coming in, or 11,000 votes coming in and change, 11,500 votes and change coming in? You want to be in the lead. She's getting 61 percent. That is encouraging news for the Cortez Masto campaign. And this makes his math harder. That's simply straight up. You see that right there. So, if this is one drop, but it's 11,500 votes - and 11,600 votes and change, if you add that up, right there, she was at 51 percent. Let me come out to the statewide number. Just more important, he was leading statewide. So now, what you have is she is gaining, right? She is trailing, statewide. She gets these votes. That's at a higher percentage than she needs. Now, she needs that consistently. Throughout the night, she needs in the 50s. She's getting 61 percent.",

And let's just look at the races that we have called. This is where we are. Republicans have 49 seats. Democrats have 48 seats. Those numbers, they will not go down. That's what they have, now. The question is can they go up? Democrats need only 50, right, because they have the Vice President of the United States. We're not going to know this until December 6, and the count after, all right? And so, you make the point. Senator Kelly is leading here, right now, over 100,000 votes. If you're in his campaign, you're somewhat optimistic, but you have to keep counting. That would get Democrats to 49. The Republican is leading here, right now. That would get Republicans to 50. Republicans need 51, right? So, in this scenario, Republicans would still need Georgia. Because, in this scenario, if Democrats win Georgia, it's a tie again, like it is right now, and the Vice President breaks the tie. If she keeps closing the gap, and can take the lead, then the Democrats can get to 50, with Arizona and Nevada, and then Georgia is a trophy. It's critically important to the people of Georgia. You'd rather have 51 than 50. But that's - that would be the challenge. So what - how much Georgia matters? Of course, it does. It's a big state. It's a big Senate race.",

It's where Las Vegas is. ABBY PHILLIP, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN ANCHOR, \"INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY\": Yes. And I think Democrats, going into this week, were hopeful, but really nervous, about this race. She was very, very vulnerable. But a couple of things that we've been seeing in the numbers, first of all, what David just described, which is that where the votes are coming from, are where Democrats expect that they will do pretty well. There's that. But when we looked? We talked a little bit about this yesterday. We looked a little bit into the exit polls. One of the big concerns for Democrats, with Senator Cortez Masto was whether she would hold her own, with Latino voters, a huge chunk of the Democratic electorate, in that state. And she largely did. She performed about as well as Biden in 2020, and about as well as the Democrat - as the Democrat, four years ago, in the other Senate race.

Now, I mean, one of the things that I think is driving this too, is that I mean, this was a pretty generic - it was almost as much of a generic ballot test as she could get, with a Senate race, right? Cortez Masto not necessarily a character that's well-known outside the beltway, for anything in particular. It's not like there were two characters, like the Fetterman-Oz race, or the Herschel Walker-Raphael Warnock race.

This is the current balance of power in terms of leading in the races. But in the races that we've called it's 49-48, right?So, one party - Republicans, for a majority, need to get to 51. Democrats, only 50, because they have Vice President Harris, to break the tie. So, you have it, right now. The Republicans have 49 seats, right? So, the Republicans need two of these three, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia. Georgia runoff is December 6. These will be settled in the next couple of days. It may take a couple of days, before we can call them. I want to come back to a follow, on that point in a minute. But so they're critical - absolutely critically important, because if the Democrats - if the Democrats can win them both, that gets the Democrats to 50. And this would be to get to 51. But if the Democrats can win both of these western States, then they keep their majority, and this is an added number. If Republicans get one of these, they still need this. If they get both of these? That would get Republicans to 51. That's important to remember. Democrats only need 50, for a majority, because of the Vice President. Republicans need 51. So, think - you always have to remember that, in the context. Now, if you want to come into the States, one of the things we're looking at, as Brianna just smartly went through the counties that are left, do we have to wait till we get to the very last vote to call these elections? We don't know the answer to that. It depends on the margins, right? If somebody is ahead by 100,000 votes, and there are only 90,000 votes to be counted? Well, that's simple math you can do at home. But one of the things we look for, as we go through this? And this is preliminary. I want to make clear, this is preliminary. Joe Biden won this state. Joe Biden won this state. Let's go back and just show you the margin in 2020 presidential election, 10,457 votes. This is a very competitive state. This state hadn't gone for a Democrat for president since 1996. So, Joe Biden won it very narrowly, right? So, come forward to the Senate race now, and come here, Senator Kelly, leading by 104,000 votes. That makes you happy, if you're a Democratic candidate, knowing how competitive this state was, just two years ago. But we've got about a quarter of the vote to count. That's an estimate. But one of the questions you ask? And this is preliminary. So, Joe Biden won it two years ago. Is Senator Kelly, at least running equal as Joe Biden? Is he running in a way that would get him a 10,000 or 15,000 vote victory? Well, right now, let's look - he's over-performing Biden, just about everywhere. Only down here, in the southwest corner of the state, is he underperforming Biden. And again, I want to stress, this is preliminary. When we have 100 percent of the votes, then you can run that analysis, as a final analysis. But right now, where we are at the moment, Senator Kelly is running ahead of President Biden, Joe Biden, in every county, meaning he's getting a higher percentage of the vote, in every county, except this one, except for Yuma County, in the southwest corner of the state, right? So, let's ask the question then of Blake Masters, because Donald Trump was very competitive, in this state. He lost it by, we just showed you, a 11,000 votes. So, let's ask the other question, right? Is the Republican over-performing Donald Trump anywhere? And the answer is only in that tiny county, where Joe Biden is not. So, if you're looking at this map, and again, it's preliminary, if you're Blake Masters, you're underperforming in every county, but one? That's not a good sign. If it stays like this till the end? He'll lose. The question is does it stay like that till the end?",

But also noticing a change for Donald Trump, from when just two years ago, he was president.So, in the exit polls, across the country, people who voted in the House of Representatives election, this year, 39 percent, according to these exit polls, had a favorable view, of Donald Trump. 58 percent, an unfavorable. That is a significant downgrade, from where he was two years ago, when he had a 46 percent favorability, and 52 percent unfavorable, when he lost the presidential election. Now, among Republicans, this year, 73 percent of Republicans still have a favorable view of Donald Trump, those that voted in this election, 23 percent unfavorable. And then, we asked, was Trump a factor in your vote, in this election? A slim majority of voters, across the country, 54 percent say no, Donald Trump was not a factor. But where he was a factor? He was a negative factor. 28 percent said they voted to oppose Trump, in their vote, for the House of Representatives, 16 percent said, to support Trump. And we look at this among Republicans as well. This, I think, maybe one of the most interesting numbers of the night. 62 percent of Republicans say Donald Trump was not a factor in their vote, a non- factor. When he was a factor for Republicans, it was more in support. 31 percent voted to support Trump. Only 4 percent of Republicans, Anderson, voted to oppose Donald Trump.",
