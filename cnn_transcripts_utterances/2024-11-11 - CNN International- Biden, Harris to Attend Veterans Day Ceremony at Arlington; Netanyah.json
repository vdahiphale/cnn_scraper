It is 09:00 a.m. in Washington, D.C., it is 06:00 p.m. in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson, you're watching \"Connect the World\". Also coming up in the next couple of hours at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Donald Trump is at work assembling his future government. A short time ago, he said he is nominating Elise Stefanik for the role of Ambassador to the United Nations. Then Ukraine says thousands of North Korean soldiers are now in combat in Russia's Kursk Region. And as Trump vows to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement, again, COP 29 kicks off in Baku. And the stock market in New York opens about 30 minutes from now, and the indications are at least that stocks will have a decent start to the trading day, extending the decent period sessions that these stock markets had on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday last week, of course, in the wake of the Donald Trump victory. All right. Well, back there at 09:30 Eastern time. Well, it's Veterans Day in the United States this hour, President Joe Biden, the First Lady, Jill Biden, are hosting Veterans and Members of the Military at the White House. Now, later this week, Mr. Biden will meet Donald Trump there to discuss the transition of power. No such meeting happened after Trump lost the 2020 election and refused to accept the results. So, a lot of revolving doors effectively over the next, what two and a half months. Arlette Saenz at the White House for us this hour. And it is a very different atmosphere, and it seems a very different process this time. Could this meeting, though be all could, given the circumstances?",

      "sentences": "It could be Becky, but for President Biden his part, this meeting that he's planning to have withPresident-Elect Donald Trump is really a key step in a symbolic part of his commitment to a peaceful transfer of power. As you mentioned Trump when he was President in 2020 and lost to Biden in that election, he completely shunned this tradition, never conceding the election or inviting Biden here for a meeting at the White House. Biden is handling things a bit differently. And when these two men, who were once former competitors just in this past election as well, when Biden was still running, when they meet, it will give them a chance to talk about some of the most pressing domestic and foreign policy issues at play in the world right now. One issue of important significance to President Biden is the war in Ukraine. President Biden is expected, in this meeting and in the coming weeks, really, to make the case to the American public and the Trump transition team that aid for Ukraine should continue beyond his presidency. Biden has already directed his team to surge as much of the approved aid and weaponry directly to Ukraine, so they have this before he leaves office at a time when Donald Trump has really cast doubt about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine going forward. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan yesterday said that one of the arguments that President Biden plans to make during this transition period is that not furthering aid for Ukraine would essentially lead to instability, not just in Europe, but could also lead to instability for Asian eye allies. So that is an issue that President Biden is hoping to try to exert some influence with Trump on, though it's unclear whether Trump will listen. Now, President Biden, a bit later this week, is also set to depart for two foreign policy summits down in South America, the Economic Summit in Peru, followed by the G20 Summit in Brazil. And that will put him in front of the many world leaders who are grappling with what a Trump Presidency will look like. But for today's focus, President Biden is focused on Veterans Day here in America, as you mentioned just this hour, the President and First Lady are hosting right now veterans, their families, survivors, for a breakfast at the White House. Then they will be traveling to Arlington National Cemetery, where President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. This is the centennial anniversary since that portion of the cemetery was created. President Biden is then slated to give remarks. It's also notable, this will be Harris's first public appearance since she gave that concession speech last Wednesday. She's not expected to speak, but she will be on hand with Biden there as they celebrate this Veterans Day.",

In the past, he had some initiatives at the University of Delaware that was focused on domestic policy. He also had another initiative set up at the University of Pennsylvania focused on foreign policy. So those are all realms where Biden could play down the road. For Vice President Kamala Harris's part, it's really unknown what she will do, likely returning to California, but it's unclear if she might try to position herself down the road to seek office once again. These are all discussions that are playing out over the coming weeks as they prepare for this transition period, not just here at the White House, but also their own transition out of public service as well.",

Now Homan served as Acting Director of what is known as Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE in the previous Trump Administration. And Trump today nominating New York Representative Elise Stefanik as to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Meantime, the vetting for key positions goes on at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, with Elon Musk apparently involved in many of the discussions.

Ambassadors was Nikki Haley, someone who became, ultimately his Republican rival for the GOP nomination this go around, and is not part of his cabinet, he has said going forward. And Stefanik is someone who has grown increasingly close to Trump over the years, even though she had originally sort of emerged as a moderate Republican, ultimately became one of his strongest MAGA supporters in Congress, and even was on the short list to be his running mate, though, obviously, she ultimately was not the pick. And then Tom Homan is going to be Donald Trump's Border Czar, which is sort of an unofficial role. It won't have to go through any sort of Senate confirmation process. However, he has been very influential in Trump's immigration policies over the years, serving as his ICE Director during the first term of in Congress. And he has been a person who has been advising him on immigration policies all throughout his campaign for re-election. Take a listen to what Homan had to say just now on Fox News about how he foresees his enforcement mechanisms to take to address the migrant issue in the country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM HOMAN, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, U.S. IMMIGRATION &amp; CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: Under President Trump, he was suing the sanctuary cities. DOJ sue sanctuary cities, pulling federal funds, of course, day one, when Joe Biden came in office, he stopped that lawsuit. So that's be put back in place. And look, I've seen -- I've seen these, some of these Democratic Governors say they're going to stand in the way. They're going -- they're going to make it hard for us. Well, I know a suggestion, if you're not going to help us, get the hell out of the way, but we're going to do it. So, if we can't get assistance from New York City, and I may have -- you know we may have to double the number of reasons we send in New York City, because we're going to do the job.

Well, according to the source that spoke to CNN with the U.S. within theU.S. government, apparently, we're talking about more than 10,000 North Korean troops that appear to be on the ground there in the Kursk Region. They're speaking of about 11,000 of these troops. The Ukrainians have also commented on this matter as well. They also acknowledge that there's a great number, a large number, of Ukraine -- of North Koreans who are on the ground there, fighting on the side of the Russian military, and that there have already been skirmishes and battles between North Koreans and Ukrainian forces there, and that the Ukrainians have put it that there have been casualties. Now the exact number, no one really knows that. The Russians so far have not commented on exact numbers, but it's been quite interesting. Vladimir Putin has been asked about this, or the Kremlin has been asked about this. They did not deny that there were North Korean troops on the ground fighting on the side of Russia. And of course, one of the things that Vladimir Putin has said is that relations between North Korea and Russia are very good at the moment and continue to improve. So certainly, they aren't denying that North Korean forces are on the ground. The Russians also Becky not denying that obviously, they want to take back the parts of the Kursk region that are currently in the hands of the Ukrainians. However, the Russians have also said that for them, taking back this Kursk region is not necessarily their main priority. Their main priority of right now, of course, right now is the offensive that they're conducting in the Northeast of Ukraine, where the Russians have been able to gain a good amount of ground over the past couple of months, and Ukrainians have somewhat been on the back foot. At the same time of course, the Ukrainians do hold that area in curse. They say they want to continue to hold on to that or they don't want to occupy it forever. They see it as a possible bargaining chip, if and when possible, negotiations come around for them to possibly exchange this area for areas of Ukraine that are currently occupied by Russia, Becky.",

But it doesn't seem as though to the Ukrainians. It's clear yet what exactly the strategy is, or the plan is for the incoming Trump Administration. Here in Russia, I can tell you, I've actually just come back from the streets of Moscow and asked people about this. There does seem to be a lot of optimism about the incoming Trump Administration. There are a lot of people who view Donald Trump very positively. Obviously, believe that he's positive -- positively inclined towards Russia, and that relations between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have been very good in the past. And of course, Vladimir Putin, last Thursday, came out and called Donald Trump courageous, obviously, for the way that he reacted after that assassination attempt against him, but also saying that he believes some of the ideas that Donald Trump has, especially trying to end the war in Ukraine, are worth listening to, as Vladimir Putin put it.

One major question hanging over COP 29 how will the fight against climate change look with Donald Trump back at the White House? Will Trump pulled out of the -- pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement during his first term, and he has pledged to withdraw again. That's causing some anxiety at COP 29.

And really, it's the important piece of work that UNICEF is doing here isreally to make sure that people understand two things about climate in their effect --- the effect on children. One is that children are impacted directly in a different way from adults. And this is something that a lot of people, even delegates here, don't know. And I can give you a couple of examples. One is, you know, they're more susceptible to heat. They're more susceptible to air pollution because their bodies are smaller, they're not able to process these things as easily. They're also more likely to have preterm birth because of the impact of especially air pollution and heat. So, we're making the point here that this impacts children directly. It also impacts all the services that children rely on, and children are so dependent on services, so education, health care, and we've seen it just recently in Lahore, Pakistan, where schools are closed. It's because of such high heat, rain, it is all these things that make it very challenging for children. So, our job here is to say to the countries and the delegates, there is a special challenge that children face, and we need to make sure that children are at the center of these responses. And that hasn't been the case up till now, and I think we're making some progress. We are getting countries to understand that, and that goes across all political sort of divisions and differences, really, to put children at the center of it.",

It's really saying, understand what this is doing to the children of the world in all countries, all countries. And I think when we make that argument, people do listen to it. And it really does just really cross all barriers of countries politics. And I'm optimistic that if we continue to make that argument, if we show people what is happening to children, people care about that. And I'm hoping that that will help motivate people to do what we're asking, which is to spend more money on children, because right now, only about 2.4 percent of global spending on pollution and climate has anything to do with children, and that's way too low when you look at the special impact it has on children.",

More on that, as we find out more on policy, some anxious Americans are apparently using their election stress with a little retail therapy doom spending, as it's called, is on the rise. It's how many of us try to cope when anxiety bubbles up. Everything is like politics, the economy of the future generally. But experts say treating yourself now may not be great for your long-term financial health. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich joins us now from New York. Doom Spending, this is an actual term.

VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, this is not a new trend, but of course, it's taken off on social media, and it's become a term that's trending now. And essentially, as you mentioned, it's when people are feeling doom and gloom about something. Maybe it's the economy. They feel like they're never going to be able to afford that house, so instead, they spend on something a little bit smaller a pair of shoes, or they don't feel great about the results of the recent presidential election here in the U.S. We heard anecdotally from some people who were doing a little bit of shopping leading up to the election just to take the edge off emotionally. Or there could be something happening in their personal life and they want to distract they feel out of control. Spending is control. It's that dopamine hit that people get when they spend to take their mind off of things that are going on. The only problem is, is if you do that regularly, you could be putting some of that spending on credit cards. And about 50 percent of Americans report that they're carrying some sort of debt on credit cards, and the U.S. has about a trillion dollars of debt on credit cards right now, and that is a record.
