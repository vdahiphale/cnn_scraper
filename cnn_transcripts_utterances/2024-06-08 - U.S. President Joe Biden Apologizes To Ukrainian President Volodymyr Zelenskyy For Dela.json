Mr. Biden also went to Pointe du Hoc, the site of a brutal battle during the D-Day invasion in World War II. He used it as a backdrop to send a message about threats to democracy, saying that's what U.S. soldiers died for in Normandy (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They're not asking us to give or risk our lives but they are asking us to care for others in our country more than ourselves. They're not asking us to do their job. They're asking us to do our job, to protect freedom in our time, to defend democracy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There was that, there was really a message there that isolationism doesn't work. That was perhaps a domestic message to Republicans and Donald Trump, who perhaps will seek to cut ties with NATO partners, which is something that has a lot of concern in Europe. But this was a message really that was intended for a domestic audience. But the message for President Zelenskyy was that one that you heard, an apology there.

President Macron has mentioned that in the past. The United States has been very careful to say that's not a position they have at the moment. And President Macron will be very mindful of the fact that the next time he meets a president on French soil, it could be president Donald Trump. Again, remembering that when Donald Trump came into office, President Macron hosted him and carefully tried to sort of build that relationship. But it was still very bumpy and difficult. And for President Macron, there's a clear recognition that an isolationist United States, which is something that Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, could bring, leaves, countries like France and Germany and the U.K. very much in the lead and alone in supporting Ukraine. And that will undoubtedly be somewhat of the conversation as they discuss those dual challenges of peace in the Middle East and how to bring stability to Ukraine. But more importantly for Macron, what can be sealed in any deals now, with a -- inside a Biden presidency, that can last and endure during the next American presidency.",

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted this on social media, \"The U.N. put itself today on history's blacklist when it adopted the absurd claims of Hamas. The IDF is the most moral military in the world. And no \"flat earth\" decision by the U.N. secretary general can change that.\" Also on Friday, Israel struck several locations across Gaza, including a school. Well, Gaza civil defense says that the school was being used as a shelter for displaced Palestinians. Three people were killed. Israel says it used precise munitions to target a container on the school grounds that Hamas was using. Next week, U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken is heading to the Middle East next week to increase pressure for a ceasefire and a hostage release deal.
