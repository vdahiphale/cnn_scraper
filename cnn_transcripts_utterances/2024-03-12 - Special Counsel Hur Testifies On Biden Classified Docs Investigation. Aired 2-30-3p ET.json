In 2010, it came to the attention of the vice president's staff that classified briefing books had not been returned, maybe even if they were -- they were returned, some of the content was missing. The same year, the executive secretary raised that nearly 30 of the classified briefing books from the first six months of 2010, were missing. In August of that year, then-Vice President Biden failed to return top secret sensitive compartment -- compartmented information contents of a classified briefing book from a trip that he took to the Hamptons.

But what we did in our report was to try to walk through exhaustively -- you know, well, as a prosecutor, you need to assess with a very cold eye the strengths of your case and the weaknesses of your case, and try to anticipate arguments that defense counsel might well present at trial.

But then soon thereafter, forgot about the documents. And therefore, it would be difficult to convince a jury that actually he willfully, he knew that it was illegal to keep the documents and he continued to do so. A second argument that we considered is that perhaps this these documents never actually were in Virginia in his private rental home there. Perhaps the documents were there by virtue of staff or himself having those documents at the Delaware home from the time that he was still vice president all the way through the time of their being discovered. And finally, another theory that we walked through in the report is that there were two folders with marked classified documents related to Afghanistan found in the box in the president's Delaware garage. One of them contained national defense information and the other, it would be a more difficult task to persuade a jury that it did contain national defense information. So that -- that argument would be premised on perhaps the president was referring to the one folder that didn't contain national defense information but was not -- it would be difficult for the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed the one that did contain national defense information.

And I think he ran an extensive and really impressive investigation. I think his fact- finding left very little uncovered. And I think his analysis was sound and fair. However, he did find some evidence of criminality. He did find evidence, pretty clear-cut evidence, that Joe Biden retained classified documents, knew he retained them, as evidenced on that tape, and did not immediately turn them back over. The other thing that I think is important to note is that Joe Biden did mislead the public, as did other members of Joe Biden's team. Because for the past year or so, the talking point -- and we've seen this repeated many times -- has been it was entirely unintentional by Joe Biden. He had no idea he had any of these documents, things get moved around. Whoops, what are you going to do? It turns out that is somewhat fair when it comes to some of the documents, but not others.
