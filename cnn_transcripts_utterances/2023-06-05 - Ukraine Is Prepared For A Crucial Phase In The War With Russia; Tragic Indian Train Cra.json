And this is ONE WORLD.Ukraine is refusing to say when or where or how its long-awaited counteroffensive will begin or even if it's already underway. But Kyiv is again making it clear there won't be an official announcement, even as it suggests the highly anticipated attack is yet to come. The Ukrainian military is denying claims that Russia repelled a large-scale offensive in the southern Donetsk region, accusing Moscow of spreading lies for propaganda purposes. And Ukraine's deputy defense minister calls it an attempt by the Kremlin to divert attention away from its own military challenges, particularly in Bakhmut. But Moscow maintains, without providing any evidence, that hundreds of Ukrainian troops were killed in Donetsk over the weekend while attempting to break through Russian lines. Russia's war meantime continues, creeping back onto its own territory. A group of anti-Putin nationalists aligned with the Ukrainian army claim they carried attack on the Belgorod region. All right, turning now to a CNN exclusive, sources tell us Ukraine has cultivated a network of agents working inside of Russia to carry out acts of sabotage and enemy targets. And they're likely responsible for strategic drone attacks, including this one in Moscow just last month. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is joining us live now from the Pentagon. So just walk us through what we know about these saboteurs and how they gain access to drones and other weaponry as well.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And so, what we're learning from U.S. and Western officials familiar with the intelligenceabout this is that Ukraine has, for the last year, been cultivating a network of sabotage agents inside Russia to try to wage attacks on Russian targets there. And this is a mix of pro-Ukrainian sympathizers as well as agents, we're told, who are actually very well-trained in this kind of warfare. And what we're told is that they are being given drones by the Ukrainians, so that they can use them, of course, to target things like oil refineries, Kremlin buildings, as we saw last month, and other high value targets that the Ukrainians feel will basically knock the Russians off balance, distract them from the Ukrainian counteroffensive and divert resources, as well as, of course, kind of strike fear into the heart of ordinary Russians and make them believe that they are really not safe anywhere and that the war has come home to them. Now, we don't know exactly how the Ukrainians have been getting the drones to these pro-Ukrainian actors inside Russia, but we are told that there are several well-practiced smuggling routes that the Ukrainians have been really using since Russia invaded Crimea in 2014. They have been kind of practicing this for and doing this for about nine years now. And so, they have their ways of doing this. U.S. officials say that they do believe, at this point, that this is a smart military strategy because it is distracting Russia and forcing its devout resources to protect its own territory. But, of course, there are the questions of whether Russia has a red line and whether it will retaliate in a way that we have not seen before for these kinds of attacks on Russian soils. Zain.",

So we talked about not only Ukraine, but China as well, sort of issues facing the Defense Department back home. But, of course, much of this focused on Ukraine. We specifically asked about the counteroffensive. First, is Ukraine ready? He said they are as prepared as they're going to be, not only from the weaponry and the training the U.S. has sent in, but many of the other European countries as well. So they have the military at this point that is as ready as it will be to counter out this counteroffensive. But we pushed him here a little bit and said, how do you know if it will be successful, what will determine that success? And here, he was much more careful. He has seen and studied military operations and he knows there is an element of probability, of chance, and all the different possibilities and outcomes that could come from a military operation. So because of that, he wouldn't go as far as to make a prediction about how this counteroffensive would go. Instead, here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN, U.S. JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: So I think it's too early to tell what outcomes are going to happen. I think the Ukrainians are very well prepared. As you know very well, the United States and other allied countries in Europe and really around the world have provided training and ammunition and advice, intelligence, et cetera, to the Ukrainians. We're supporting them. They're in a war. It's an existential threat for the very survival of Ukraine.

Is it possible that Russia chooses to escalate because of these attacks? And he basically said, essentially, yes, Russia could make the decision to escalate because of attacks within their own turf. But he pointed out that this is the part of war. If Russia was going to attack Ukraine, there should be at least some sort of expectation that Ukraine could bring the fight back to Russia. The key here is where and how Russia chooses to escalate, if it does so. So far, this is a war between Ukraine and Russia. And if it remains that way, this is something the U.S. is watching closely and will decide how it affects U.S. and foreign policy. But if Russia chooses to escalate outside of Ukraine, that, he says, is an entirely different situation. Zain.",

For example, CIA Director Bill Burns was just in China, and a senior state official is there right now.

Clashes between opposition supporters and police have claimed at least 16 lives since Thursday. The latest unrest was sparked by the sentencing of opposition leader Ousmane Sonko. His supporters took to the streets in protest. Some threw rocks and set tires on fire. Those caught in the middle say it's the worst violence in decades. Sonko, who was accused of corrupting the youth, was sentenced years in prison that will likely end any chance he has of running in next year's presidential elections. And this weekend, the government cut off mobile internet service to stop what it called, what it's referring to as hateful and subversive messages. Groups like Amnesty International are pleading with leaders to respect human rights and stop what they say is the excessive use of force. Let's get some perspective from within Senegal, where joined live now by freelance journalist Borso Tall. Borso, thank you so much for being with us. Senegal has been traditionally seen as a bastion for stability in West Africa. That image is being challenged right now.

Let's catch up on the headlines.Ugandan troops have discovered the bodies of 54 of their soldiers who were killed during last week's attack by the militant group Al-Shabaab. It happened on an African Union base in Somalia, southwest of the capital. The discovery came as Ugandan forces recaptured the base from the Islamist group. Al-Shabaab has been fighting Somalia's government since 2006. In Afghanistan, police are investigating the suspected poisoning of nearly 80 students, mostly girls, at two different schools. The students were taken to hospitals for treatment. At this point, officials are unclear about who's behind the incident, the motive, and the potential type of poison that was used. Peruvian authorities tell CNN Joran Van der Sloot will be extradited to the US later this week. He's the prime suspect in the unsolved 2005 disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway. Over the weekend, Van der Sloot was transferred to a different prison in Peru ahead of his extradition set for Thursday. All right. We are going to turn now to one of our main stories, the tragic train crash in India that took at least 275 lives. Crews have now cleared off the tracks, allowing train traffic to resume in the Indian state of Odisha. The image of trains moving past the wreckage is certainly a sobering one. Trains are a way of life in India. State run Indian railways carry 13 million people per day on tracks that were originally laid down in the 1800s under British colonial rule. The rail system is in desperate need of upgrades. More than 16,000 people were killed in train accidents in 2021, many of those due to ageing tracks and bad signaling equipment. But India's crumbling infrastructure includes much more than trains. A suspension bridge collapsed late last year plunged hundreds of people into the water below, leaving at least 135 people dead. India's highways, trains, bridges and tunnels are woefully inadequate for the world's most populous nation. The Indian government says it needs to invest $1.5 trillion into infrastructure improvements over the next decade. But many analysts say the figure should actually be higher than that. Time now for the exchange, joining me now is CNN's Transportation Analyst Mary Schiavo. She's a former inspector general in the U.S. Department of Transportation. Mary, thank you so much for being with us. Obviously, it's early in terms of the investigation with how this train crash on Friday actually occurred. But the belief, at this point, is that there was an error in the signaling system, some kind of error in the signaling system that led one of the trains to switch tracks when it wasn't supposed to. Just explain to us how this happens.",

And that tells you if it's green, it means your block, the miles ahead on your track are clear. And you just let that train fly at its speed limit. If it's yellow and green, that tells you, you have to slow down. If it's yellow, you have to slow down even more. And if it's red, you must stop. But again, you might need a mile or two to stop. So there are signaling systems. And the question is, in addition to the decision or the signal that said to put this train over on the siding where there was a parked freight train, was there another malfunction in the signaling? And the signal may have been out a mile or two or even longer back of the track. It wouldn't have been out right there. But yes, there are literally traffic lights for trains.",

They're going to be looking at first at who and when that decision was made. It was made at the very last minute then there really wasn't any way to avoid the disaster. But who and when that was made, and if there were signaling problems in the signaling and warning systems. And finally, they're gonna wanna look at that track. It's also, of course, possible that, you know, there was manipulation of the track or vandalism of the track.

What's the balance in your party, do you think, of people who want to turn the page and move forward versus turn back to Donald Trump? SEN. JONI ERNST (R-IA): I think there are a lot of folks that want to move forward. I know that President Trump has a great base here. It is strong. But at the same time, people don't want to hear about what has happened in the past, because we've had two years of a Biden administration that is just destroying our nation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There was a hope that if they were able to get through the openingstatements quickly enough, Prince Harry might well be able to give evidence on the first day of what is said to be a three-day hearing. It has to be said that the claimant's legal representatives actually went on quite a bit longer than was anticipated or was allocated, and there wasn't, in fact, time forever than today. But there was certainly some frustration, the defense lawyers describing it as an extraordinary decision for Prince Harry first day, what is really a highly watched legal proceeding here at London's High Court. But we did hear those opening statements from both sides, the claimants of course, Prince Harry is amongst four representative claimants due to give evidence in the court, amongst more than 100 claimants total, putting forward this lawsuit against the Mirror newspaper group. Now, as you said there, those allegations are focused on the illegal obtaining of information, private information through phone hacking, through the interception of voicemail messages as well, as to the hiring private investigators, as well as other unlawful means. And we heard from Prince Harry's legal representative in Sherborn speaking in the court today. He said that there were 147 articles submitted in support of Prince Harry's claim published between 1991 and 2011 featuring details which show in his words signs, telltale signs that this information was obtained illegally, information about his private relationships as well as his own private activities.
