He used that huge platform to jab at his predecessor and current election opponent, former President Trump, no less than 13 times. He also used the bully pulpit to make the case for America's global leadership. He called out Republicans for failing to deliver aid to Ukraine, and he turned up the heat on Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, both during the speech and in a hot mic moment afterwards.We have CNN's MJ Lee with brand new reporting on the strained relationship between these two allies.

Brianna, our reporting goes back to a phone call that President Biden had with Prime Minister Netanyahu back in mid-January, when sources tell us that at one point in the phone call, Prime Minister Netanyahu bristled at the President, talking about some recent media reports that cited anonymous U.S. officials that basically said that the U.S. was planning actively for a post Netanyahu government. And what we are told by our sources is that the President essentially sort of brushed aside that idea and that suggestion, essentially saying why are we even talking about this, you are the leader of the Israeli government and the U.S. government is going to work with whoever the Israeli leadership is.Both men, we are told in this exchange also agreed that these kinds of anonymous quotes from government officials were irritating. This was a brief exchange, we are told, and obviously a lengthy phone call, which the two leaders has - have had many of since the October 7th attacks, but speaks a lot to that tenuous relationship that we have seen growing increasingly strained in recent months as the war has progressed. And we got such an interesting glimpse into those tensions in this hot mic moment after the State of the Union remarks last night, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we're also told that the campaign is just going to be bulking up a lot in terms of opening new offices, making new hires and also launching a new ad campaign to the tune of some $30 million over the course of six weeks.

And by that they are saying that it is casual, that there is no agenda. It is just two people having a friendly meeting.But, of course, it is a little bit hard to believe that Orban and Trump are going to sit down with absolutely no agenda. Now, I am told that the White House did not extend a formal invitation to Orban, who is the equivalent of Joe Biden in Hungary. And Orban didn't reach out to them either. This is significant for a number of reasons. One, Donald Trump is a former president. He's also the GOP presumptive nominee, and he could be president again. And this meeting gives us somewhat of an insight into who Donald Trump might align himself with if he were to be reelected to the White House in November. Donald Trump has often been a fan of the strong man. And in fact, he said about Viktor Orban, some people don't like him because he is too strong, but it's nice to have a strong man in control of your country. So something he has said that he admired. The two also appear to line up a lot politically. They agree on immigration. Sometimes when you are listening to either one of them speak, it kind of sounds as though they are saying the exact same thing, their treatment of the free press, they call it fake news and they have both said that Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if Donald Trump was in the White House. Now, in terms of what we're going to learn about this meeting, it is still unclear. His team said that they are going to put out some sort of statement that we might see pictures. We don't expect either of them to actually come out and speak, but the thing to pay attention to here, this is not the same as what it was when Donald Trump was in the White House. This isn't two world leaders' meeting. Essentially, Donald Trump is a civilian for all intents and purposes. He is the former world leader, but there's no obligation for his team to take notes or to provide notes to someone else to share what kind of diplomatic conversations might be happening between Biden - excuse me, between Trump and Orban. So it'll be interesting to see what they do give us. I am told a couple of Donald Trump's closest advisors will also be in that meeting. So we'll be reaching out to see if in fact there was no agenda, Boris.",

But when you think of the actual societies that these leaders, Putin, or even though he's different than Orban or an Orban is governing over, it would really raise questions if people had the experience to live in those societies about whether they would consider that to be a better option.",

Now, interesting to ask the question, whether or not Orban has truly been tough.I mean, the rest of NATO for all of its divisions and so forth had - came together to push back on Putin's invasion with an organized force that I don't think any of us had predicted NATO would be capable of, who was resisting that throughout? Orban. And Orban has been the one who really has not contributed. Germany's contributed. France has contributed. Britain has contributed. The Netherlands have certainly Poland and all of the former Soviet states, not Orban. I would argue the strength here has come from everybody except Orban.",

Maybe you haven't heard this, but we just got this information. Apparently, President Biden was asked on his way to that event in Pennsylvania about the moment and he said, I didn't say that in the speech. You guys, speaking about the press, are eavesdropping on things, but he did say that Netanyahu has to allow more aid into Gaza. What do you make of that moment?

It is the worst kept secret in D.C. that the relationship between Prime Minister Netanyahu and the President has been strained at best and pretty deeply fraught at other moments.We've heard stories of the President after these phone calls are over referring with some pretty vivid language, which Joe Biden is capable of to Netanyahu and his inaction. The come to Jesus moment, it's pretty clear what that would be about. It would be about whether or not they are using American weapons for what the President once described as indiscriminate bombing. He was very clear in the speech yesterday - last night - that Prime Minister Netanyahu has to allow aid in. But think of how we're doing it. The United States and others are putting together this sort of temporary port and the Israelis have not said whether or not they're going to cooperate in getting that into their territory, neighboring them. I think that it's pretty clear that Biden cannot wait for Netanyahu to move out of that job, but there is no indication that that's coming anytime soon.

So you have two major challenges. There's the disinformation and then there's the collection of literally files information on 150 million Americans who are using TikTok, right?So we know they have access. If you have it on your phone, you're giving permission to TikTok and the parent company ByteDance to access anything that happens on your phone. It's part of what you agree to in the terms and conditions.

And, obviously, he probably saw some of the information that this president has seen to raise the alarm or sounding the alarm on this and raise concerns.So I don't understand why he would change his position on this. I mean, the bottom line is handing over the keys to Russia, to China, to North Korea, to Iran, to our enemies to be able to pump disinformation and collect information on every American who's on the app, 150 million Americans. Again, number one news source, if you're under 30 right now, is TikTok, right? So the idea they'd be able to pump this disinformation, and we've seen the effects of this disinformation out there. I don't understand why anyone would be comfortable with that. You see why it's bipartisan out of the Energy and Commerce Committee overwhelmingly. And I'll tell you on the Intelligence Committee, there is deep concern as well. We've raised the alarms on this. Mike Gallagher and Raja, the two lead co-sponsors with us, that was an original leader of this bill. We all - we sit on the - we all sit on the intelligence committee.
