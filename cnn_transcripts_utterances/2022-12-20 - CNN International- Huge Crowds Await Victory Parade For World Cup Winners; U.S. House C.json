We're live in the capital just ahead of their homecoming parade.Then the U.S. Chief Justice leaves Trump era border restrictions in place for now, but thousands gather in Mexico at the U.S. border, hoping they will lift. Plus, more historic strike action in the U.K. as thousands of nurses walk out. We'll look at why they're on the picket lines. Argentina's World Cup winning squad is receiving a hero's welcome in Buenos Aires. Today has been declared a holiday across the country. You can see here people already celebrating as they wait for the victory parade in Buenos Aires. These are live pictures. How is the bus going to get through that? The team arrived at the airport just outside the capital very early this morning. Captain Lionel Messi stepping off the plane first with that trophy. Large crowds cheering, fans lining the streets. This was just the bus ride from the airport. We can expect to see much bigger crowds in the coming hours as the country gears up for a massive victory parade. Stefano Pozzebon there in Buenos Aires joins us live. I mean, the scenes are just insane, aren't they?",

And the noise that reverberates from the street already makes me, for me, difficult to sometimes hear the -- speaking with you.I think this is a third day of collective elation from the Argentinian people, Max. It's really been an experience that I would have personally, I would have never imagined to live through, as I'm telling you, like, this is our hotel and we are just a few hundred meters away from the Obelisk, which is the center of Buenos Aires. And people have been partying at the Obelisk for three straight days. You can tell, you know, why so much? Well, it's three decades, more than three decades since Argentina won the FIFA World Cup back in 1986. And this country is just buzzing with excitement at the idea of giving its national team and its captain, Lionel Messi, the hero's welcome that he deserves, Max.",

The team, we understand, is coming from the very avenue that we are from our vantage point here at CNN, coming from the south, from the international airport.They will do around the Obelisk. And from here, they will try to get to the presidential palace, which sits at my right. And, of course, those who will be lucky enough to be very close today to the bus itself will be able to see their idols. But for the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people that have been packing here since the early hours of today, Tuesday, it will probably be just an amazing street party yet again, just like Sunday and just like yesterday, Monday as well. It's three days of collective celebration. And, by the way, today is a national holiday here in Argentina to celebrate the victory of the World Cup. So you can expect that really -- that all of Buenos Aires will be here later today. Max?",

The lawmakers said a there's sufficient evidence to suggest that former President Donald Trump will be charged with at least four crimes, including giving aid or comfort to an insurrection.Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid joins us from Washington, D.C. We've got to be careful here, haven't we, because Trump hasn't been convicted of anything. That will be a separate decision.

I mean, here, legally speaking, this is just referral to the Justice Department suggesting that this committee believes that there is enough evidence to charge the former president with at least four different crimes.Now, the Justice Department is already investigating the former president and his associates related to their roles in January 6. That investigation has been handed off to a special counsel. But there's no guarantee, just because this referral was made, that charges will actually be brought against the former president or his associates. Now, politically, as you noted, there are some people, including the former president, who believe that this could work in his favor. You did see a little bit of a resurgence of support for the former president after their search warrant was executed on his Mar-a-Lago residence. But here yesterday, after these recommendations, these referrals were announced, we're not really necessarily seeing this. In rallying around the former president, he did release a statement suggesting that this is the kind of thing that brings his supporters to back him, to really bolster him. He is, of course, running once again for the White House, but it's unclear if something like this will really help him in the way that he is trying to spin it. A much bigger question, legally speaking, is what happens with the investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago? I speak with members of the former president's legal team. They're much more concerned about that investigation.",

One into the former president's role on January 6, and also into this question of whether classified information was mishandled at the former president's Mar-a-Lago residence, whether he tried to obstruct that investigation.The thing with the January 6 investigation is his lawyers will argue that it would be very difficult. They argue the prosecutors face an uphill battle if they really want to try to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the former President knew that he, in fact, lost the election. But it's interesting because yesterday you saw lawmakers, they were already trying to blunt that defense by presenting previously unseen video clips of top White House advisers who said, yes, I told him, I didn't believe that there had been any election fraud. So they're much more worried about the Mar-a-Lago case than they are January 6, just based on the evidence that they have at this point.",

It allows officials to swiftly expel migrants over the U.S. border, and was set to end on Wednesday. But some Republican led states have sued to keep it in place. The Supreme Court has asked for a response today from the Biden administration. Meanwhile, border cities like El Paso, Texas are still bracing for the policy to be lifted, as thousands of migrants gather, stones throw away in Juarez, Mexico.

The Russian President, meanwhile, made a rare trip to Belarus. During Monday's visit, Vladimir Putin vowed closer cooperation with his key ally, Alexander Lukashenko, amid fears that Belarus could join the fight against neighboring Ukraine. And in recorded remarks today, President Putin addressed Russian security services in a clear acknowledgment that the invasion isn't going as planned. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): I would like to call attention to the security agency units that have begun their work in Russia's new regions. Yes, you are faced with difficult tasks now. The situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics and the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions is extremely complicated. But the people who live there, Russian citizens, are counting on you and your protection. And your duty is to do everything in your power to ensure their safety and respect for their rights and freedoms. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But nurses say they can't keep the National Health Service going the way things currently are. They are asking for 19 percent, government's offering 4. 3 percent.Keep in mind that inflation is above 10 percent, so anything below is seen as a reduction in the real value of those salaries. They are angry and they accept that services are being affected by these strikes, but they're basically saying the health service will collapse if they don't get the money that they need or deserve. It's front-page news across the U.K. It has been for days, even weeks. Rishi Sunak there on the front of the Daily Mail, the British Prime Minister, saying he won't back down over these strikes, but the nurses won't back down either. They say the strikes will continue and get worse. Nada has been following all of these. At the moment that critical emergency care is going ahead, isn't it? But there's some concern that major operations, major events could unfold if the nurses escalate their strikes.",

And, of course, while nurses are going on strike today, we are also expecting strike action by numerous ambulance services as well on Wednesday. So there is significant concern of how this will impact that urgent patient kept.Look, this is a dramatic show of opposition against the government's policy from the nurses. This is perhaps the most dramatic industrial action we've seen within the NHS's own history. And we are expecting around 100,000 nurses to take part in this industrial action, calling for those pay rises to go ahead. But essentially, they're also now issuing an ultimatum to the government, threatening further strike action in the new year if they don't respond to calls for negotiations. And, of course, we've seen that take place in Scotland. Strike action has been put on hold in Scotland in response to the government's willingness to negotiate. They're calling for the government now to come to the negotiating table with the unions, with the health care workers. But as you said there, we've heard from Rishi Sunak, he said he was disappointed, but he also said that this was essential in order to get a grip on inflation.",

It is one of the most severe cost-of-living crisis we've seen in the U.K. in years. We're seeing energy prices rocketing, people really struggling to make ends meet, and that is really feeling quite intense now over the winter months. Of course, people are at the end of their tether (ph) and are calling for further support to be offered by the government. Rishi Sunak did speak yesterday. He acknowledged that it was a difficult time for many people working in the public sector. But he did say that the government's approach to pay in the public sector would be fair and responsible and that this was essential in order for the government to get a grip on that rising inflation rate. But of course, we are still expecting further strike action. It could be a winter real disruption in the United Kingdom.",
