Officials confirming the 42-year-old was a U.S. citizen born and bred in Texas. He was also an Army veteran. He reportedly had fallen on hard times personally and financially, which debunks President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion that the attacker was an illegal migrant.CNN's Alayna Treene is in West Palm Beach, Florida, this morning for us. Has Trump or his team acknowledged this false accusation and some of the reporting that has come out since that this man is actually from Texas?",

We have not seen any other, you know, public reaction or response from Donald Trump since posting yesterday morning, weighing in on the attack.Now, look, when I talked to Donald Trump's team about this, they said, one, that Donald Trump was getting real time updates on what was happening in New Orleans. But still, we did see Donald Trump weigh in on Truth Social yesterday morning, as we, of course, were still learning more information about who was behind this attack. I want to read for you what he wrote. As you mentioned, he did suggest that perhaps the suspect was an illegal immigrant. This is what he wrote. He said, quote, \"when I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country, that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the fake news media, but it turned out to be true.\" He went on to say that his heart - \"our hearts are with all of the innocent victims and their loved ones, including the brave officers of the New Orleans Police Department.\" Now to be clear, and I know you said this, Sara, but we now know that the person behind this attack was a U.S. citizen. As you mentioned, the FBI identified him as a Texas man and an Army veteran. And that also he was killed in a firefight with police officers and that he had made videos before the attack in which he said that he had joined ISIS. Now, again, when I also was, you know, chatting with some people close to Donald Trump around all of this yesterday, there was a video that was circulating and being posted and shared by people in Donald Trump's orbit, people like Charlie Kirk, that had suggested perhaps that the suspect had driven over the border. Again, that was not confirmed. And of course, we now know that that is not true, that this suspect was a U.S. citizen from Texas. All to say, you know, this was posted, I think, before we had all the information, but we have not heard Donald Trump correct himself or his team make any further statement on this.",

It's going to be held at the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., home to the Washington Wizards and the Washington Capitals. And it can hold, we're told, about 20,000 people at max capacity.But look, when I talked to Trump's team about this as well, they recognized that tens of thousands, if not more supporters, they are anticipating to come to the inauguration to go to Washington, D.C., for his swearing in. And really, we know that Donald Trump wants this to be a massive event. He has invited global leaders. He wants this to be a huge event as he is entering the White House. And part of that and part of this rally, were told, is really to try and energize his supporters right before that happens. And so, this is really a way to try to draw bigger crowds to D.C. and also kind of get them excited just one day before he is set to be inaugurated. Sara.",
