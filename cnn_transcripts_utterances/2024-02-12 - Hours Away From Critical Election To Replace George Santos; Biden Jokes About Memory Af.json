A source close to the first lady telling me that she felt that the attack on Beau was beyond the -- or relating to Beau was beyond the pale, and that the age attacks were flat inaccurate. That is part of what prompted First Lady Jill Biden to write this response that was sent out to supporters over the weekend where she called the special counsel's report, quote, \"inaccurate and personal political attacks against Joe.\" She also went on to defend her husband's age, saying, \"Joe is 81, that's true. But he's 81 doing more in an hour than most people do in a day. Joe has wisdom, empathy, and vision. He has delivered on so many of his promises as president, precisely because he learned a lot in those 81 years.\" Now, I'm told that this email that was sent to supporters was actually the second best performing email that they sent to grassroot donors since the launch of the president's campaign. And what's especially noteworthy here is that the first lady made no explicit ask for people to donate money. There was a button at the very bottom where people could turn to the campaign website to give money, but it highlights how they're trying to use this to try to galvanize grassroots supporters, at least. Of course, the Biden campaign has a long road ahead of them. They will have much to do to convince voters in the coming months that the president is up for a second term at a time when many have expressed skepticism that that's actually the case.",
