      "sentences": "Here is today's fast-forward look ahead.The impeachment trial of Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton starts this morning. The Statehouse will consider whether he abused his office to help a donor, among many other accusations. Jury selection begins today in the trial of former Trump adviser Peter Navarro. He is charged with contempt of Congress for failing to comply with a subpoena from the House January 6 Committee. Former Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio will be sentenced this afternoon for seditious conspiracy connected to the Capitol riot. Prosecutors have asked for a sentence of 33 years in prison. So we've got a lot of different legal angles to unpack on those stories, and to help us get to it we've got Lis Wiehl, a former federal prosecutor, joining us this morning. She's also the author of \"A Spy In Plain Sight.\" Lis, we know we've got to go through a few things and we appreciate your help breaking all of this down for us. We'll start with what's been lengthy sentences for other Proud Boys ranging anywhere from 10 to 18 years, but prosecutors seeking more than 30 years for Tarrio. What do you think the likelihood of that happening is? LIS WIEHL, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, AUTHOR \"A SPY IN PLAIN SIGHT\" (via Skype):  I don't think he'll get the first -- the whole 33, David, but I think look for at least 18 years. Because the guys who were sentenced before them, with the exception of David Rhodes, were mostly foot soldiers. I mean, they were there. They were carrying out the orders of the conspiracy. But Tarrio has been charged with and been found guilty of seditious conspiracy, you know. He was the chairman of the Proud Boys. This guy was not there on the scene of January 6 but orchestrated it, right? And the only reason he wasn't there on the scene is because he'd been arrested for burning a Black Lives Matter banner. So this guy looking at a harsh sentence -- at least 18 years, David.",

They're even broadcasting a message from her asking her son to surrender. Officials say there have been four sightings of the convicted killer since he escaped an eastern Pennsylvania prison and that was last week.CNN's Brian Todd brings us the latest on the manhunt. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  An escaped convicted murderer who police say is desperate, who they now say they have had four credible sightings of, still remains on the loose. The most recent sighting of 34-year-old Danelo Cavalcante was on Sunday when a Pennsylvania state trooper had eyes on him. LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE:  It was a trooper, actually, that observed him at some distance and gave chase but was unable because of the terrain and some other obstacles there -- was unable to get to him before he disappeared. TODD (voice-over):  Officials say all four sightings of Cavalcante have been within a 1.5 to two-mile radius of the Chester County Prison in eastern Pennsylvania, which he escaped from on Thursday morning. A residential surveillance camera picked him up at 1:43 a.m. Saturday emerging from a wooded area less than two miles from the prison. Police say they've also investigated two burglaries in the area, while they can't confirm the burglaries were committed by Cavalcante. Residents nearby are getting increasingly nervous.

Residents near the prison are hearing a message from helicopters and patrol cars -- a message recorded in Portuguese by Cavalcante's mother from her home in Brazil urging him to surrender peacefully. ROBERT CLARK, SUPERVISORY DEPUTY U.S. MARSHAL:  As desperate as he is, maybe he has a change of thought and hears his mother telling him to surrender and his family cares about him. He's desperate. He's hungry. He's been in the woods. He's dirty. Perhaps this is what puts him over the edge where we can get a peaceful surrender. TODD (voice-over):  Cavalcante was recently sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 2021 murder of his former girlfriend, Deborah Brandao. Prosecutors say he stabbed her 38 times in front of her two young children. The motive for that killing, according to investigators, Brandao had discovered that Cavalcante was wanted for another murder in Brazil.",
