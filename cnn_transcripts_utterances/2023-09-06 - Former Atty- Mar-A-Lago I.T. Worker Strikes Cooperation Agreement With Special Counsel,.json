      "sentences": "That's right, Wolf.Listen, CNN reported earlier this morning that this prisoner, Danelo Cavalcante, was able to climb up onto the roof and that was how he escaped, a law enforcement - a source told me that earlier. But, Wolf, I mean, we all just watched that video. I don't think anyone expected it to look as stunning as it just did. Danelo Cavalcante crab-walking, putting his hands up against one part of the wall, his legs up against the other, and basically shimmying up that wall to the top of the roof. And, Wolf, what's incredibly interesting about this is the prison warden says when he got up there, there is still razor wire on top of that roof, and Cavalcante basically just blasted through that razor wire and ultimately escaped. Now, Wolf, I really want to drill down on this because this is a very important point. To understand this moment that happened seven days ago at this prison behind me, you actually have to go back four months. Because four months ago, in May, another inmate at this prison behind me escaped from the Chester County prison the exact same way. And I want to actually read from the affidavit that we got our hands- on, CNN obtained just a few hours ago. Let me ask you if it sounds familiar, the defendant said he was a rock climber and he was able to climb the wall in the narrow area by putting his legs on one wall and his arms on another wall, and from there, he was able to scale the wall to the roof and pulled himself onto the roof of that prison. Wolf, that is an affidavit four months old. Now, the prison says that they put in security measures to prevent that from happening. They added that razor wire, but again, clearly seven days ago, that razor wire was not enough. And I should note of that particular inmate, he was captured about five minutes after he got off of the prison roof and started running towards the town, but Cavalcante now has been on the loose for seven days. And another thing that we learned is that there was a bit of an hour - about an hour delay in actually realizing that Cavalcante had escaped, and that is perhaps why this issue has escalated the way that it has. Now, Wolf, one of the other, I should say, things that we've learned today is that this search area has largely expanded instead of being towards the south, where one of the more prominent sightings was on Monday evening, we're now looking towards the east of the prison, kind of the southeast area. And the lieutenant colonel from the Pennsylvania State Police, you just heard right there, Lt. Col. George Bivens, he says, still emphatically at this point, he believes that Cavalcante is in the area. He said there was a sighting not too far from where we are right here, but again, to our southeast last night. But again, the manhunt still very much underway and that stunning video, Wolf, I think surprised a lot of folks seven days after the escape.",
