What they call law fair are now saying they should respond in kind. And Charlie Savage joins us now he's one of the\" New York Times\" reporters behind the start. So Charlie, a large number of Trump allies wants elected Republicans to take retaliatory action right now even before the election. What specifically are they pushing for? CHARLIE SAVAGE, NATIONAL SECURTY &amp; LEGAL REPORTER, 'THE NEW YORK TIMES\": The idea here is that Republican district attorneys and prosecutors and states around the country should be looking for opportunities to bring charges against Democrats, especially high level Democrats to fight fire with fire. The premise being that all the indictments against Trump, including that one which has now been converted into felony convictions are simply a conspiracy by Joe Biden in the White House to invent cases out of thin air.

I think they want to go after anyone who had anything to do with the Trump cases. And so, that would be one starting place.In addition, of course, they -- Trump himself keeps saying he's going to, you know, appoint a real special prosecutor to go after Biden and his son and the whole so called Biden crime family. Again, that's a little hard to square with the fact that Hunter Biden is currently on trial by a special counsel and a special counsel looked at Biden's, you know, mishandling of classified documents and concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring charges over that matter.

And especially since this verdict, we're seeing this sort of mainstreaming of this rhetoric, and this notion that if Democrats aren't equally persecuted with politicized investigations and prosecutions, then this will just get out of hand and there needs to be mutually assured destruction, so Democrats will stand down.Again, the premise of all this is the cases against Trump were not based on evidence.

The thrust of the article is this, quote, some who have worked with him, the President, including Democrats, and some who have known him back to his time as vice president, described the president, who appears slower now, someone who has both good moments and bad ones, unquote.

Knox, now a mother of two, returned to Italy from Seattle to attend a hearing on Wednesday, hoping a court in Florence would clear her of a slander conviction for falsely accusing the manager of the bar where she worked, Patrick Lumumba, of Kercher's murder, sending the innocent man to jail for two weeks.

Knox later petitioned the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in 2019 that Italian investigators violated Knox's rights by garnering the false accusation without the presence of a lawyer or adequate translator. They also ruled that Italy should pay her nearly $21,000. Knox said she felt sure the Italian court would agree with the European ruling. Instead, the court upheld that Knox is guilty of slandering her former boss. She had already served the original slander sentence when she spent four years in a detention following her wrongful imprisonment for murder.
