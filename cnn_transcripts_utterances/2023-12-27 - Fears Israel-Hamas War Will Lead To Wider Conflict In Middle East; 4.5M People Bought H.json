The U.S. is dealing with an increase in attacks in the Red Sea. Yesterday, the Navy intercepted more than a dozen missiles and drones -- Tuesday.All of that coming out of Yemen. U.S. Central Command says they were fired on by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. That's the same militant group that has launched over one hundred attacks in the Red Sea against 14 different commercial and merchant ships. I'm joined now by CNN military analyst and former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, General Wesley Clark. Thank you so much for coming in on this holiday week. When you look at the scenario that is happening with the Israeli war on Hamas, and then you look at what's happening surrounding that area in the region, what are your biggest concerns about whether or not this is going to actually expand into a wider conflict?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's been the policy of the administration that we don't want it to expand and grow wider conflict. And so, when that's your public policy and you're arguing, please don't let it escalate, you're inviting the enemy to attack you, and dare you to escalate. The problem that we have is what's the decisive target if we do escalate?Now, we know all of this is being orchestrated by Iran. And we know it's backed by Russia. And we know what helps Russia distract from what there is going on in Ukraine. And so, from the administration's point of view, they're under attack from Russia in Ukraine. You've got Iran. You've got a problem getting military assistance to Ukraine. You've got the defense budget. You've got a whole lot of issues out there. So, I think the issue that I see is, how do we get escalation dominance enough to shut off the attacks from the Houthi in the Red Sea. How do we do that? We bring our allies in. We've got to use diplomacy, maybe there's some economic measures we can use. Maybe we know the right targets to strike if we go into the Houthi -- into Yemen and strike the Houthi. Maybe we don't. But it's a real conundrum. Because normally an attack like this -- a battle like this, you wage it by, you think you can go tit-for-tat. No, you don't want to do that more than once or twice. So, you want to get dominance. You've got the dominant airpower. You know they can't resist that. But what is the decisive effect that the airpower will bring when you strike on the ground in Yemen? I think that's the dilemma that the administration faces on this particular issue. Do you know the launch site, you know, the command and control, what are the regional consequences, repercussions. Do you want to instead go against Iran, maybe take out that Iranian intelligence-gathering ship that's targeting the Houthis? And if so, then what's the consequence of that? It's a really -- it's a really difficult conundrum. And one thing is clear is it's not stable.",

But also recognizing that we don't want to have to insert more troops to protect what's already there. And we can only do so much from the air.It's a delicate balance. We don't want to pull out of the region. We've got real equities in that region. We need to stay there. But on the other hand, we don't want our troops exposed. And so, all of us, I think, who look at this thing from a military context, recognize we're going to have to do more militarily. And the question is, and we can't answer it on this program because we don't have detailed intelligence, what are the right targets? And what will our impact be both tactically and diplomatically if we strike those targets? And ultimately, of course, the question is Iran. And -- you know, we don't want to go to war with Iran. But Iran has been at war with us for over 40 years now. They've been behind all the mischief in the Middle East. And we have danced around the edges of it. We've taken limited actions. They hit our troops when we were in Iraq. They took out the Marine barracks in 1983, killed 280 some odd Marines with a car bomb, suicide bomber. It's a long, long, painful story. And we've managed to use America's overarching power diplomatically, economically, and militarily to maintain our -- the international order that we seek and minimize the disruption that Iran is able to cause. And my concern is we're looking toward the new year I'm thinking about how things are. We're reaching the end of this era with the fighting in Gaza, with what's going on in Ukraine where we can simply strategically defer addressing critical issues. And instead of handling them on, strike here and a strike here and a little bit of assistance here, and a little bit of diplomacy or paces. The world -- the boiling -- pot is starting to boil in a way that is adverse to American interests, and we need a broader, stronger strategy to deal with it.",

Add that together with some more and the ability -- the ability for people to afford a home hit its lowest point since 1984. Yet, 4.5 million people still bought a home this year.CNN's Rahel Solomon has much more on this. Rahel, what is the big takeaway then from -- on the housing market from this year? RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT &amp; ANCHOR: Yes. It has certainly been a rough year for a lot of people in the housing space. Whether you were a buyer, whether you were a seller, whether you were even an agent, 2023 was a rough year. And yet, four and a half million people still manage to buy a house in 2023. And it seems like when you talk to folks in this space, it really came down to one being clear about what your goals were. So, if it was location, if it was affordability, that would have been a tough goal. But whatever your goal was, would have been clear about that strategy, being prepared to essentially wait it out if you might because it was a tougher year than it has been in a really long time, and then also being willing to be flexible. It wasn't exactly the type of year that you would call a buyers' market. So, if you were looking, you had to be a little bit creative, you had to be a little bit more compromising --",

And take a look at November of 2020 and you can see they were practically at zero.They were between two and three percent. And so, a lot of people had either bought mortgages or bought homes with mortgages in this range or refinance. So, most people were locked in at these really low rates. And then as of course the Fed started to raise rates, you see them steadily climb higher until they reach sort of highs that we haven't seen in a really long time. And so, that created an -- a real affordability challenge. Because even though we saw sales fall, we didn't see a lot of people buying as many houses, home prices continued to go up. And we can show you home prices. And the reason why it's just there was just a real lack of supply. Supply was very tight. And so, that kept the prices elevated. Moving forward, if you will not one of the four and a half million people in 2023 who bought a home in 2024, is actually looking better. So, no matter who you're talking to, whether it's the Mortgage Bankers Association, whether it's Redfin, listings are expected to go up. So, we're expecting to see better supply in 2024, and rates are expected to go down. Now, I say that with a huge caveat because of that chart that I just showed you. When you say --",

Which is not twos, it is not praise, but it is certainly better than that 7.7 that we had seen within the last year.So, I think buyers will appreciate any decline.
