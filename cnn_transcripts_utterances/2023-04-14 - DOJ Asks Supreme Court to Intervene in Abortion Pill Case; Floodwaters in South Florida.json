So, as I understand it from your reporting - I should note also your brand new book gets into all of this and how it's relevant to the court, \"Nine Black Robes: Inside the Supreme Court's Historic Drive to the Right and its Consequences.\" This is sort of at the crux of that. You start that book out talking about overturning Roe versus Wade. And now the justices are going to decide today, Joan, right, gathered, just them, just the nine, no clerks - : That's - that's right.",

And yesterday Attorney General Merrick Garland vowed that the Department of Justice would be going to the court to try to protect women's reproductive rights and preserve the ability of the FDA to review and approve drugs. Not just -- not just this abortion medication, but all existing and new drugs. This case really goes to its authority.But they're -- you're right, they're back at a -- at a court that just 10 months ago eliminated all constitutional rights to abortion and said it should be left to the states. And this is a major case that will test just how available abortion still is in the states that keep it legal. So, the court will have two main options. They can do a variety of things, but two main options when they privately consider it, as you noted, Poppy. One is to just grant the stay. That is to suspend all litigation for a second - or, not a second, but for a couple weeks so -- while these appeals play out rather than have this rushed situation that we're in and have a -- kind of a more reasonable judicial consideration of the merits of the case, just put everything on hold. That's one option. And that's what the Department of Justice would like as the appeals play out. The other option is to deny it. And if - if the Supreme Court denies the Department of Justice's request, what will be in effect is that Fifth Circuit ruling that came yesterday, or actually into the evening going into yesterday, that said that FDA approval of Mifepristone could stay, but with these new restrictions that you mentioned. So, it's a very momentous time in terms of access to the main way that women end their pregnancies in America today.",

And this year the convention is just days after a gunman in Louisville killed five people at a bank he worked at and just weeks after a shooter killed three nine-year-old children and three adults at a school in Nashville.Last year the meeting happened just days after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at Rob Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. Our Kristen Holmes is live in Indianapolis. This is actually like just 100 miles from Louisville. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Poppy. Well, that's right. And you mentioned Uvalde and that forum last year. And I want to note one thing, which was after that shooting, when they had this conference, we saw some Republicans handwringing. Some of them actually canceled speaking at the event. This year, in the wake of these two shootings, not so much. And it really goes to show you two things. One, that these frequency of these shootings has become really part of our lives, but, two, just how important this voting bloc is to Republicans, particularly in a primary year. We have to remember, when we see these 2024 candidates, these hopefuls, up on the stage today, are delivering their message via video, as some of them are doing, they are trying to appeal to a group that opposes even the most moderate limitations on gun rights. So that's something to keep in mind here. And so let's take a look at who's actually going to be here and who's speaking today. We have Vice President Mike Pence, Asa Hutchinson, Ron DeSantis will give a video message, Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, who obviously just launched that exploratory committee, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, Vivek Ramaswamy and Donald Trump, of course, is that keynote speaker. And one thing to point out here is that Donald Trump actually got the NRA's endorsement back in 2016. Something that his team is really working for now. They want that endorsement again. But I talked to a number of sources close to some of these other candidates, some of these other 2024 hopefuls who think that there might be an opening on gun rights, that some of these gun owners actually don't think that Trump went far enough when he was in office. So, something to watch here. We don't expect the NRA to endorse anyone in the primary at this point. Poppy.",

And what ended up happening with Nike is they ended up winning any awards for that particular commercial with Colin Kaepernick. And this goes to what experts have told us, Don. They say that there have been many cases of brands growing their business as a result of taking a strong stand that result in some criticism, but even stronger engagement with a key audience. And that key audience for Bud Light is younger demographics and people like Dylan Mulvaney. They want to bring in new audiences.
