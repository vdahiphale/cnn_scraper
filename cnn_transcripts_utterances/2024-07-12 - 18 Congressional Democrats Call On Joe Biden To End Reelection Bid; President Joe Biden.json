And today that will be moving here to the battleground state of Michigan.Now, for the president's part, he is looking to convince Democratic voters and voters across the country that he is fit to serve a second term in office a while also trying to ease some of those concerns within the Democratic Party from top officials and donors as well. Now, for the president's part, he really wants to try to turn the focus back to former President Donald Trump. Aides say that the president will really lean into trying to draw a policy contrast with Trump specifically bringing up that Project 2025 conservative blueprints that Democrats are quite eager to tie to the former president. But the president also is facing significant pushback within his own party. His advisors had hoped that that press conference last night would really try to stop the bleeding of support that he has seen in recent days, there have been a few lawmakers who have joined the chorus of those calling for the president to step aside in the wake of that debate. But then there are also some within the party who are simply saying it is time for move -- to move on and accept President Biden's decision. Now, Michigan, where the president will be in just a few hours is a key part of the Biden campaign's formula as they are planning how to win this election in November. Just yesterday, top campaign officials argued that the president's most direct path to victory was through the so called blue wall states, states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. That is why President Biden has repeatedly traveled here over the course of the campaign. Now, the president today will be joined by a number of elected officials from the state of Michigan, including the state's Lieutenant government -- Governor and at least three Democratic lawmakers from the house but one person in Michigan Congresswoman Scholten has called for President Biden to step aside, signaling some of the pressure that he could be facing in this state. Now, it's also worth noting, Biden traveled to Michigan often in this campaign and also in 2020. And it was here where the president made a pledge back during that 2020 run, he will be visiting that same site where he made this pledge that he would be a bridge to the next generation of Democratic leaders.

He said he was naturally concerned about Biden's approach to that debate and his performance in that debate. And he's heard in the two weeks since from his constituents, which is only in essence thrown the alarm for him, which led him to his statement today.Now, those sentiments are certainly likely many of the top concerns that the House -- the top House Leader Hakeem Jeffries took in this private meeting to President Biden last night. Now, we know that he has been hearing an earful from his caucus over the last two weeks, both privately and publicly Democrats concerned about what this effect this has on them potentially trying to really take the House, concerns about the next four years, concerns about potentially not winning the White House and likely, those are the things that Hakeem Jeffries sat down face-to-face with President Biden last night and discussed. Now, CNN's Jeff Zeleny, one source telling him that important to note that in this meeting Hakeem Jeffries did intentionally did not offer an endorsement of Biden or publicly say that the decision is Biden's to make. And Jeffries in his own words in a letter to House colleagues this morning, he called that discussion candid with Biden last night going on to say, \"I expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward that the caucus has shared in our recent time together.\" Now, notably, Jeffries has said that he plans to sit down and talk to House Democratic leaders at some point potentially soon. We are unclear on the timing of that. But that's certainly an important marker here. And it comes as the White House is increasing congressional outreach. We know that Biden has a series of these smaller meetings with congressional Democrats, Congressional Hispanic Caucus in the last hour, he's also due to meet with the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and the Progressive Caucus. It certainly comes amid rising concern for Biden and his ability to stay on the ticket.",

Now, to the report about whether or not should be Kamala Harris or Joe Biden, you know, of course, America would want a Black woman to step in with four months to go and run a historically short presidential race. That's what some of us called the okey-doke. Kamala Harris is standing behind Joe Biden, because she believes that he can do the job. And so, Joe Biden last night went to the test. Folks said, show me you can have a command of the issue. He got up to answer questions for 59 minutes. And so, we need to turn the page. Now, I'm not saying people who are concerned are wrong to be concerned. We all watched the debate. It was not a good performance by any stretch of the imagination. But what I am saying is that in three days, we are going to have MAGA Republicans go to a very Black city of Milwaukee and talk about Project 2025. Talk about how they want to dismantle the Department of Education, talk about how they want to get rid of political appointees for right-wing extremists that could potentially never be replaced, talk about how they want to replace more Supreme Court justices onto the court to get rid of things like DEI and affirmative action, and abortion rights. So, Black Americans are saying wake up Dems, we don't have a lot of time, we need to protect our democracy, we need to protect our community. And right now Joe Biden is the person at the top of the ticket that's going to get the job done.

If for some reason the Democratic leadership is going to change, we need to change it immediately. We should not wait until August 19th, that feels like -- that to me honestly feels like poor leadership.

Part of the reason this is being pushed so close to the convention, is because Donald Trump and his campaign have wanted Joe Biden and the criticism surrounding him and Democrats themselves, questioning whether he's fit to serve for another four years. They want that to be the story. You've kind of seen Donald Trump be uncharacteristically quiet over the last two weeks since the debate. But at the same time, I am told that it is impacting his decision, ofcourse, what happens with Joe Biden, if he ultimately steps aside, that will factor in into who he thinks is best to serve beside him. And so, all of that is weighing very heavily I'm told on Donald Trump's mind but also that of his team.",

I love politics.But the fact is, if you ask voters what's extremely important to their vote, get this, guess how many percentage say it's extremely important in their 2024 vote, 15 percent. Compare that to preserving democracy 51 percent, 45 percent who say the economy. The fact is people vote for the top of the ticket, they don't vote for the bottom of the ticket. Very few Americans care, but it is, you know, a nice little game of \"The Apprentice.\" And you know, I thought that was a pretty entertaining show myself.",
