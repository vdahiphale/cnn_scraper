It could seek to launch attacks directly from Iranian territory, using precision missile strikes, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles; also, drones, of which it has many. It has quite a sophisticated and diverse arsenal. It could choose to activate its militias in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere. It could go after softer Israeli targets, like diplomatic missions and besieging (ph) third countries and, of course, use cyber attacks and so on. So it has a number of options at its disposal and it will, I think, choose a combination of options that allow it to save face and retaliate and do good on its commitment without risking an all-out confrontation and war with Israel. If this attack comes from Iran directly and from Iranian soil, then that obviously becomes a very risky scenario, because Israel could very well respond against Iranian soil and against Iranian Revolutionary Guard's interests within Iran and assets within Iran. And that would obviously be the riskiest scenario that could more likely than not blow up into a broader confrontation. A lower risk scenario for Iran would be to use its partner militias in third countries. So Iran has developed these partnerships with Hamas, with Hezbollah, with the Houthis or Ansar Allah in Yemen and a number of other militias in Iraq. It has advisors and troops that are forward deployed with these militias. And so a less riskier scenario would be for Iran to activate these militias in order to respond and retaliate against Israel's attack on its diplomatic mission. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And whether it comes from Iran directly or from Iran's proxies.One thing the U.S. has seen, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence, Iran moving around weapons and assets internally. And that's to include cruise missiles and drones, according to two sources familiar with the intelligence. According to one of those sources, Iran has readied at least 100 cruise missiles. Now the question, of course, is, what's the purpose of this? Is this part of Iran's response to that attack in Damascus? Or are they simply posturing and trying to send a message to Israel and the U.S.? That is a key question here, because Iran's actions and the actions of their proxies could be on quite a wide spectrum. The U.S. believes that Iran is trying to avoid a wider escalation in the region and trying to calibrate their response, to send a message without igniting a wider conflict here. As for the U.S., they have sent additional assets to the region, likely air defenses, because that's the threat here coming from the air, whether it's cruise missiles, rockets or drones. So that's what the U.S. is looking out for and bolstering its own force posture. Worth noting that the U.S. has been on high alert since basically the beginning of the Gaza war and especially since an attack in Jordan that killed three U.S. service members. The U.S. very much preparing here as well. Officials have also said that the U.S. will intercept any launches or attacks that it can directed at Israel. And we've seen that happen in the past. The U.S. Navy has intercepted missiles launched from the Houthis in Yemen toward Israel, those over the Red Sea. There are also U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria that could intercept launches from Iran, depending on where they're launched from and what route they take. Still a very big open question as to what this will look like. Of course, the U.S. and Israel watching very closely.
