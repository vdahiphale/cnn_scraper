      "sentences": "This morning, two Pennsylvania parents are facing multiple felony charges after their seven children were found living in what police describe as unsanitary and unsafe living conditions. Authorities say the children were clinically underweight and malnourished.The refrigerator of their homes, padlocked. And according to a police affidavit, the mother said she had to lock it because the children were \"stealing everything.\" She also referred to them as garbage disposals with legs. CNN's Brynn Gingras is following this for us. This is just an awful story.",

There's reports that one of the children -- one of the children actually gained a couple of pounds. So, listen, there is an upside to these kids.",

      "sentences": "But what a terrible story that police stumbled upon. Let me explain how they got there. So, they went to this house that was in a trailer, sort of mobile home community where they were -- the kids were actually going through an abandoned trailer trying to find some food.And police went to them and basically said, where do you live? They happen to live next door. They brought them back to their home. Talk to the parents. That's when they came upon this refrigerator with a padlock. The mother made that comment to police allegedly. They saw that the kids couldn't really communicate well. They were disheveled. They were wearing clothes that didn't fit them. Police left. Came back with a state and that's when they found four more kids in the back bedroom who were hidden. So, seven kids in total ages four to 16, malnourished, didn't know their own birthdays, had no education. There was also just a disgusting situation that they were living in. We have a list I think of all the animals that were found inside this house, two dozen caged rats, dogs, rabbits, snakes, I mean, just incredibly horrible situation for these kids. But they are in the custody of the state. Those two parents were arrested. Charged with seven felony counts of endangering the children. They did get out on bail. Those kids are not going to be back with them. Hopefully in good care. But yes, just a horrific story.",

      "sentences": "Well, now we're waiting to find out when the lieutenant governor here in Texas, also a Republican, is going to schedule this trial on the Senate side. We have no clear indication as to when exactly that's going to happen. So, many people waiting to see how the calendar here is going to unfold in the coming months.But the math on the Senate side for Ken Paxton is interesting. There are 31 state senators, 12 of those senators are Democrats, and then his wife is a sitting state senator here. So, depending on what she does, there are calls for her to recuse herself. And that could affect how many votes will be needed to convict Ken Paxton. This so it could be they need nine Republicans or eight Republicans, depending on how this works out in the-- in the coming weeks or months to determine Ken Paxton's fate. But all of this really kind of laying bare the very tense politics in Republican circles here in the state of Texas as many people trying to like figure out exactly the best way how to handle this politically. But there are 20 Articles of Impeachment that Ken Paxton is facing. And, Kate, as you mentioned, there was overwhelming support for this impeachment on Saturday in the Texas House. About an equal number of Republicans and Democrats voting for this impeachment. So, a rather stunning number I checked, which I think surprised a lot of people. That vote was 121 to 23. But as I said, you know, we're all eyes now on the State Senate and figuring out exactly how this case will continue to play out in the months ahead. And what the senators on the Senate side are going to do.",

He likes to point out that if you're an American service member, you are not fighting for land or to conquer. It is for an idea. The idea of freedom, which is a theme he set before.And as you said, he did note that he, of course, is mourning the loss of his son Beau. Tomorrow is the anniversary. His son served in the military. The president talks about burn pits. and I think he partially blames burn pits in Iraq for the death of Beau, so that's something very important to him as well.",
