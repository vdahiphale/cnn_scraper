First upthough your headlines are up Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke today at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin deserves to be sentenced for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. Police in Belgrade are searching for the motive for a school shooting in the Serbian capital that left nine dead they say a 13-year-old boy opened fire killing eight children and a security guard on Wednesday. Israeli forces have killed the Palestinian militants who last month killed a British Israeli settler and her two daughters. And later this hour Sudan's economy on the brink we speak with the Head of the International Monetary Fund for the region. Welcome to the second hour of \"Connect the World\". I'm Becky Anderson. Russia has accused the United States of directing Ukraine to fly two drones into the Kremlin. The attack described by its press service as and I quote here, an attempt on President Vladimir Putin's life for the entire incident is shrouded in mystery quite frankly. The Kremlin one of the most heavily guarded government complexes in the world, while its border is also fortified questions now arising over Russia's defenses, or is the attack even real? So tonight, we ask who if anyone sent drones to the Kremlin? Matthew Chance back with us this hour from London and Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. So let's start with you, Matthew, what do we know, at this point?",

And we've got these dramatic images, which we've been seeing all over our screens. But which more importantly Russians have been seeing all over their screens as well, showing these drones apparently striking the Kremlin Senate Palace, which is one of the main buildings inside the red brick walls of the Kremlin Citadel in the center of Moscow. It's extraordinary to see these explosions take place, because this is the geographical and the symbolic heart of the Russian state. And so it's whoever did this. This has exposed the weakness, the vulnerability of the Russian state to attack if the idea was to have been to tell Russians that the war in Ukraine won't touch them, and then this has given a light to that absolutely. In terms of the damage that was done. Well, it doesn't seem to have been significant at all. In fact, you can see from the explosions on the video, that they're not big explosions. It's more like a giant firework than anything else. But the Kremlin has said that a couple of copper sheets have been damaged, which they are being already have been replaced. The flames on top of that dome there are believe to be the burning drone, rather than the roof itself. And so there was no significant damage done. And of course, Vladimir Putin, the Russian President to the Russians say this was an assassination attempt against wasn't even in the building at the time he was outside of Moscow, when this attack took place, and so no significant damage, no one injured, it seems. But nevertheless, the Russians are treating this with the utmost seriousness.",

Could the Americans be behind it, same issue? I think the balance of probability is that this is a pro Ukrainian partisan group or pranksters, pretty much.

American intelligence assessments currently are that they're not capable the Russians are not capable of launching their own offensive. So this is the moment now they have got a lot of new weapons from NATO, very sophisticated weapons, they will have to use those to go over the heads of the Russian defenses and break the structures that support the Russian front line, if they can do that. And then bring pressure to bear on the Russians who have been fortifying then they could possibly break through. But the problem is that this is a really big, ugly war.

Serbia is in shock after Wednesday's deadly school shooting in the capital of Belgrade. People have been leaving flowers at the scene of the attack. Eight students and the security guard were killed. And police say a 13 year old student opened fire. A spokesperson for the White House says the Kremlin's claim that the U.S. directed and alleged drone attack on the Kremlin is ludicrous. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov made that baseless accusation. They're also saying that Ukraine was acting at the bidding of Washington. John Kirby of the National Security Council says U.S. had nothing to do with the strike and called Peskov a liar. A diplomatic source tells CNN that most Arab League members are willing to include Syria in the group's summit later this month in Riyadh. The source adds that members will meet before then and decide whether to send an official invitation. That was unclear if President Bashar al-Assad would lead the Syrian delegation there. The Arab world is looking of course to normalize relations with his country. It's been frozen out of the league since Assad's violent crackdown on protests in 2011, which led to the Civil War. Well, joining me now live from Amman is Jordan's Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Al-Safadi. And for our viewers who may not be across the machinations of this region's politics as much as you are, foreign minister, just remind us the significance, if you will, of this Arab League moment for Syria, whilst largely symbolic. Why is it important to Syria that the Arab League bring it back into the fold? AYMAN AL-SAFADI, JORDANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER &amp; DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER: Good evening, Becky. And as we discussed before, the whole movement in the Arab world to try and have a leading role, and efforts to bring about a political end to the Syrian crisis took place against the backdrop against the reality in which really, there was no effective effort to solve the crisis. It was pretty much the status quo politics and status quo politics only resulted in more elves and more pain and suffering for the Syrian people and in growing threats to the region, including Jordan. So as we've discussed earlier, Jordan a while ago, came up with a paper that developed into a Jordanian initiative that was predicated on a leading Arab roll on a step for step approach, coordinated with our partners and allies and consistent with the resolution to fight for, to progress towards a solution. Dynamics in the Arab region have shifted and it looks now that yes, you're correct. The Arab League will consider very soon serious return to the Arab League.",

What we're doing is to have a new process led by the Arabs to get us to an end to that solution. And look Becky, there's symbolism and there's real work on the ground. The return to the Arab League will be symbolic; it will usher in a more active Arab elbow involvement in efforts to end this catastrophe. But ultimately, in order for us to really end it, we'll have to make sure that the whole international community is on board. Because by the end of the day, there are sanctions, there are European sanctions, there are American sanctions, and there is going to be tremendous need for a global effort for reconstruction. So I think everybody realizes here that success in this --requires the international community being on board. And the international community being on board would require steps from Syria, supported by us that address the challenges that the crisis has produced so that we move forward. Other than that, yes, the return to the Arab League would happen symbolically, it will be important. But realistically, we will not be able to solve the crisis without the support of the international community, and hence the very, very close coordination that all of us, Jordan, Saudi, Egypt and others, Emirates and others, Qatar, everybody is having with the international community.",

Can we stop it to reverse it, or at least start with, with a process that will ease the suffering of the series and put us on track? I think that's what we're all about now.

AL-SAFADI: Becky, as you said, we're a bordering country to Syria, we have 378 kilometers of borders of Syria. We have received 1.3 million Syrian refugees, only 10 percent of whom are in refugee camps. We have, we had the threat of terrorism, now we have a very dangerous threat of drug smuggling. So it is in our interest to solve that, that to help solve that crisis, to create conditions conducive to the return of refugees, in cooperation with the U.N. voluntarily, and I stress voluntarily return of refugees, to counter drug trafficking. So for us, it is a must that we end this crisis, because we've suffered tremendously from its consequences as the Syrian people and others, we cannot live with the status quo anymore, we have to do something. And yes, we'll be working within the Arab League. But we'll also; we'll be working within our own bilateral channel and our measures to make sure that we mitigate any threat to Jordan and security. And we are not taking the threat of drug smuggling likely if we do not see effective measures to curb that threat. We will do what it takes to counter that threat, including taking military action inside Syria, to eliminate this extremely dangerous threat, not just in Jordan, but through Jordan to the Gulf countries or Arab countries and the world.

Those suffering most are civilians already operating within a broken economy. Even before the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir in 2019, Sudan's financial system had been in chaos, crumbling even more since then.

And we were expecting that this will trigger certain number of reforms that will improve the huge potential that Sudan has in terms of resources in terms of also large market. ANDERSON (voice over): But that aid was suspended after security forces staged a coup, detaining Hamdok and dissolving the civilian government. Army Chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan took control and the economic outlook didn't just worsen, it fell off a cliff. Currency devaluations and subsidy reforms drove up prices, the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down growth. And then Russia invaded Ukraine and Sudan which imported nearly 90 percent of its wheat from there or Russia took the hit. The World Bank estimated that before the coup, more than half of Sudan's population was surviving on less than $3.20 a day, a figure that is likely to have only become worse. Now the focus has shifted from rebuilding the country's economy to survival.",

Now the regional lender says it is exploring all strategic options, their words not mine for its future. That comes as a separate $13 billion bank deal for another struggling bank fell through and sent stocks tumbling. Regional lenders have struggled as the Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates in an effort to tame inflation. And it has happened again, the Fed voting Wednesday for a quarter point hikes. CNN's Matt Egan is joining us from New York. Look, Matt, clearly investors aren't convinced that this banking crisis is over. We know that these region there are a number of regional banks who quite frankly, were exposed to the rate rising cycle perhaps they should have known better, but they didn't. But we certainly haven't seen the end of this, have we?",
