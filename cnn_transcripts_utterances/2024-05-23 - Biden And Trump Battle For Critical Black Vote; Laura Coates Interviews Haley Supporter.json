Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"You know, just this month, President Biden told a room full of Black supporters that their way -- they were the reason he won in 2020. Without them, he wouldn't be president. Now, he says he needs them again. But winning him over in the same numbers isn't looking easy. And Biden knows this, by the way, and so does Donald Trump. Tonight, Trump went to one of the most diverse and democratic counties in America, also my husband's hometown, the Bronx. Now, there's no chance Trump will actually win New York.

But when you get to check out, the price is nearly 100 bucks more. So, let's break it down. $303.90 for the tickets, $59.80 for a service fee, $9.50 for a facility charge, $6.35 for an order processing fee, and then $21.28 for tax. That brings your grand total to $400.83. So, what does Live Nation have to say about the suit? Well, they're calling it -- quote -- \"baseless,\" saying, in part, the DOJ's lawsuit won't solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows.

We're a very uniquely woven quilt at this point.I call Sherita (ph) my sister. We cook and have fun. We joke with each other. Brian (ph) and I share a couch. Whenever we got Sherita (ph) out on bail, I gave up my bedroom so that she'd have a comfortable place to sleep. Bless her heart. After being chained to a chair for three nights in a row, sleeping on a floor, she deserves a bed. And so, these people are like family to me now. And it's the strangest fraternity I've ever been in, but I will love -- I will and support these people until I die.",
