So, indeed there were six people arrested just the other day in Kyiv for sending real-time information on that subject on social media.So, in that context, though, we only have the words of Ukraine and the words of the Russians to go on effectively. We do see some of the effects, and you've seen them on the screen there, of what happens when debris falls. In the -- Odessa, for example, a missile or the remnants of a missile killed somebody in the industrial area of that southern port city. Now, the Russians are saying that they were successful in their campaign against military targets and logistics nodes across Ukraine. We haven't seen any evidence of that. We have, in the past, there is no doubt that the Russians do occasionally successfully attack military targets and cause massive explosions, particularly in ammunition dumps. That said, the Ukrainians are saying 29 of these 30 missiles were taken out by their air defenses. But, at the same time, for example, the Ukrainians are rather coy, almost tongue in cheek when it comes to operations behind Russian lines. So, in Crimea now we've seen this derailment that the Ukrainians say is a consequence of wear and tear they say effectively with their tongues firmly in cheek on the main line between the two biggest cities in the Crimean peninsula, of course illegally annexed by Russia. The chances are very strongly indeed that this was blown up by Ukrainian special forces or partisans working for Ukraine behind Russian lines. We've seen that it the past when the destruction of aircraft in the Crimean peninsula has been put down to a smoking accident by officials here, including the minister of defense here, again, with a rye (ph) smile. They won't confirm or deny the operations that go on behind lines, but they can be seen as part of the ongoing attacks by the -- Ukraine against Russia's logistics just as the Russia are trying to attack Ukraine, Sara.",

But White House advisers are very clear, the president has very consequential issues on the agenda and he plans to focus intensely on those issues. And there's probably none more so front and center than, obviously, the Ukraine war. The G-7, the most consequential, kind of cornerstone western alliance behind the support of Ukraine over the course of the last year and a half and has been the durability of that support, really the closeness of the G-7 alliance that has driven what we've seen internationally over the course of that period of time. And it's something the president is going to make a very significant effort, both rhetorically, but also with, as diplomats would call them, deliverables over the course of the next seven days. And there's perhaps no country that has been more steadfast than the support of the efforts in Ukraine than Japan, dramatically shifting its defense posture, its willingness to apply economic sanctions. This is something the president made clear as he met with Prime Minister Kishida earlier today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's asked by his supervisors to look into someone who was suspected of being part of the January 6th rioters. He says he can't find any open-sourced information. Another FBI employee looks into it and it turns out this person assaulted a Capitol Police officer. That's one of the witnesses we're going to hear from today. The other one is someone who declined to participate in a SWAT team arrest of someone who, again, was alleged to participate in January 6th. This person believed that it was excessive force. Again, according to the FBI letter, this person had other issues with their credibility. They brought an unauthorized flash drive into the FBI buildings, used it to download documents from the FBI computers. So, the FBI is laying out in a letter ahead of this hearing what some of the issues are that they believe were very credible issues for stripping these folks of their security clearances.

Democrats had wanted to force a floor vote on a resolution that would have expelled him, but Kevin McCarthy came up with essentially an off ramp in order to shield his members from having to go on the record and take what would be a very potentially tough vote for some of them. So, instead of voting on the resolution itself, the House voted yesterday to refer the resolution to the House Ethics Committee. They voted along party lines to do that. So it now heads to the House Ethics Committee. Essentially this is a delay tactic.But, look, the House Ethics Committee has already been investigating George Santos since March. This committee, it is bipartisan, made up of equally Republicans and Democrats, but it is not known to move very quickly. And, in fact, John, typically when a member is indicted, the DOJ will ask the House Ethics Committee to take a step back, to not interfere with their work. However, in this case, sources told me and my colleagues Manu Raju and Lauren Fox that the House Ethics Committee is planning to move ahead. But that doesn't mean necessarily that they are going to move quickly. So it could be weeks, if not months, before we make them -- see them make a recommendation on whether or not to expel George Santos. And even then the full House would still have to vote on expulsion, which requires a two-thirds majority. So, all that to say, it could be a while before we see any punitive action against George Santos. But, in the meantime, Democrats are making clear that they are not going to let Republicans live that vote down and they are going to remind voters that George Santos is still, as of right now, a current member of the Republican Party. John. BERMAN: And Republicans -- what happened as you so apply point out, they bought themselves some time where they don't have to say whether they think George Santos should be in or out of Congress. Melanie Zanona, keep us posted. Thanks so much. Sara.",
