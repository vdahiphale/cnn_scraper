I'll speak to two survivors about what they witnessed and their call for justice. All right, let's start the show.Well, first of all, if you're an undecided voter, first how, right? How are you at this point, still undecided? But all these rallies and the speeches and the television ads and the mailers that everybody is being inundated with those are for you, and there's more still coming over the next 10 days. Now, next week is when we'll see Vice President Harris, former President Donald Trump. They're going to focus on this so-called closing message. The latest CNN poll shows the race right now straight up, even 47 each. So both campaigns are searching for something that really seems hard to find the people who are undecided. As the New York Times reported this week, \"Both campaigns are digging through troves of data to find these crucial Americans, and they both think that many are younger, Black or Latino. Now, maybe you are one of those undecided voters. You haven't decided on a candidate, or maybe you haven't decided whether you're even going to vote. Vice President Harris is trying to reach those voters with a focus on reproductive rights. Beyonce and Kelly Roman, let's not forget Kelly, because Kelly was there too. They backed her up at a rally in Houston last night. She's also focusing more on Trump's authoritarian rhetoric. Harris will speak Tuesday at the site where Trump gave his infamous January 6 speech. The former President started his day in Texas yesterday, hammering home his anti-immigration message, and he wrapped up in Michigan, which starts early voting today. So which messages are working and who are they reaching? Here with us now are leaders of groups doing their own work to reach voters. Edward Ahmed Mitchell is National Deputy Director of the Council on American- Islamic Relations, also a graduate of Morehouse here in Atlanta. Leslie Palomino is the Georgia Director for Poder Latinx. And Jennifer Lee is the Policy Director for the group Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta. Thank you all for being here. And I start with the first question, are there still significant numbers of undecided voters? Are there? JENNIFER LEE, POLICY DIRECTOR, ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE- ATLANTA:  So what I would say is, what we've seen is, as a nonpartisan organization, the biggest challenge is not being undecided, but is getting people to come out to vote. Groups like Asian Americans who have traditionally not felt like they've been seen or heard or included as part of the process, our message to Asian American voters is to say your vote really matters in this election, and it is significant whether or not you come out and vote. And that message has been working. We've seen this fast-growing community that has traditionally lagged behind in their participation really increase their participation on elections.",

And so Gaza is the top issue for the American-Muslim community across the board, whether you're black Muslim, Arab-Muslim, that is the top issue is stopping what our community views as a genocide, and they feel that neither major party candidate has laid out a plan to do that, and that's why third-party candidates are polling so well. Our focus is not on telling people who to vote for. That's not we do. It's making sure they don't become disillusioned and say, I don't want to vote for anyone. I'm just so upset about seeing children being killed every day, and I don't want to be involved at all. We want to make sure you turn out to vote no matter who you're voting for.",

So those states, because the narrow margin victory, it is quite possible the Muslim community voting for or against a candidate could influence the result of that race, and that is why I think you see Vice President Harris belatedly making more concerted effort to try to address the concerns of Muslim voters. You can see Donald Trump reaching out to Muslim voters, trying to meet with them, and Jill Stein and other third parties have been doing that consistently.So I think there's a recognition that the American-Muslim community has a big role to play in this election.

Israel carried out a series of airstrikes and retaliation for Iran's attack on Israel at the start of the month. CNN's Chief Global Affairs correspondent, Matthew Chance is in Jerusalem.

But you know, at the same time, it's tried to convey the Iranian regime a sense of normality inside the country. Schools have been accepting students back into classrooms. The sports ministry, for instance, has announced that sporting events will continue as as normal.And so there is a hope that, because these strikes were relatively limited to military targets and didn't appear to cause kind of like really deep, widespread damage, then you know that might mean that the Iranians can avoid sort of getting into a further tit for tat cycle of strike and retaliation that would drag both countries, Iran and Israel, into a much more kind of difficult war. Certainly, that seems to be the intention on the part of the Israelis. They could have gone for a much broader set of targets to involve fuel infrastructure, energy infrastructure, like oil facilities and nuclear research facilities. They didn't do that. They focused narrowly in on missile production facilities and air defense sites, partly because this is a symbolic message, partly because they say they wanted to show that they would retaliate and could degrade Iranian air defenses for the future.",

So we are going to share what they're saying, what they saw, what happened.First, the important history. Sapelo Island is home to what historians believe is one of the last surviving Gullah Geechee communities. The Gullah people are descendants of Africans brought to coastal plantations in 1802 as slaves. For decades, that community has been fighting to preserve their culture and their property, fighting with city officials over zoning laws impacting their land. The hog hammock community on Sapelo Island is also isolated. It's only accessible by boat, and one week ago, dozens of people were on the island for an annual cultural day festival. Georgia officials say as many as 40 people were on the gangway last Saturday afternoon when it collapsed. There's video of the chaotic aftermath, and I have to warn you, this is both hard to watch and for people who are listening on radio, it's hard to listen to as well. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We continue in our communities to ask, where is the federal investigation? Where is the outrage over this tragedy? Where are the resources, the mental health counselors? It's almost as if, when you think about this situation, these senior citizens try to teach young black people about the history of the Sapelo Island and importance of remembering our African heritage. Well, when they were tragically killed, it's so ironic that they're being marginalized as well and forgotten about, and so we are demanding a federal investigation. It's heartbreaking when you hear Regina and Katrina and the other victims talk about how when they went in that water. Her uncle was trying to grab on to her, and she had to make the decision that she had to release him, or both of them would die. And now she is haunted by the image of his face going down in the water. I mean, the psychological trauma the PTSD is on a whole different level but yet, you're not hearing about this on the front pages as if their lives didn't matter, but these black seeing citizens lives did matter.

She's the president and CEO of the National Black Women's Reproductive Justice group In Our Own Voice. Doctor, good to have you. Maternal health is more than just abortion care. I want to just start here with the framework of how we have the conversation. Is maternal care holistically enough of the conversation? Are we having the right conversations around these round tables and these panels? DR. REGINA DAVIS MOSS, PRESIDENT AND CEO,IN OUR OWN VOICE: No, we're not, because maternal care is only one piece of this puzzle. If we really want to address the staggeringly high black maternal mortality rates, we need to talk about things like access to contraception. We need to talk about the implicit bias, the inadequate health care system, the things that we have been sounding the alarm bell on for over 30 years. This is, unfortunately, what happens. We talk about these things. Because, you know what, black women are usually an early indicator of something that is happening larger in our society, and certainly when there's a breakdown in our system, in this case, it's our health care system. So in order to really address this issue, we're going to have to talk about things like, what happens when I go into the doctor's office and they don't listen to me, and when it reaches a crisis situation, and then I'm nearly at the brink of death, and then someone says, oh, let's rush in.
