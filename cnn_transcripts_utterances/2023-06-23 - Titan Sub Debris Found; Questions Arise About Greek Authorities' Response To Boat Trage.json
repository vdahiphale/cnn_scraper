      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, I'm Zain Asher from New York and this is ONE WORLD. Questions are mounting following the catastrophe thatended the lives of five people in a submersible deep in the North Atlantic Ocean. The U.S. Navy says it detected sounds consistent with an implosion on Sunday around the same time the Titan tourist vessel went missing on its way to view wreckage from the Titanic. A senior U.S. Navy official tells CNN it informed crews on the scene that the information helped narrow down the search area. He added that any chance of saving a life was worth continuing the mission. However, all hope was lost four days later on Thursday when debris from the submersible was located just a few hundred meters from the Titanic wreckage. Since the Titan disappeared, we've learned about warning signs and concerns over the submersible's experimental design and the development process, as well. Some members of the scientific community say that it's time for a pause. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We need to do it least that now. Paula Newton has been following the story from Halifax, Canada, and joins us live now. So, Paula, what a difference a whole day makes. I mean, this time yesterday you and I were talking and there was still so much hope. There was also concern about how much the people on board that submersible may have suffered. We were talking about the fact that it may have been cold, it may have been dark, that there was dwindling supplies of oxygen, of course, and food as well. The fact that they likely did not suffer, Paula, the fact that it happened just so quickly, obviously talking about the implosion here.

Having said that, there are still so many questions for the families. And as you just pointed out, for the wider community at large to figure out, should this have been a submersible that was actually launched this way to that kind of extreme depth? With what is really an innovative type of submersible made from carbon fiber and titanium and some have questioned whether or not that could really be bear the pressure of so many dives that had been already down there dozens of times. I want to point out though, Zain, that as you -- we were talking about at the top here, given what we know now that it was a catastrophic implosion until they confirmed that that's what happened, there was no reason to stop what was a robust international effort. What really was the turning point here and we all knew it yesterday morning when that remote operated vehicle went more than two miles to the bottom near that Titanic wreck and could say categorically either they would see the Titan there or, in fact, unfortunately they found the debris. What is going on now? Well, everyone has pulled back in terms of the search and rescue effort that is aircraft that was in the air and that is also ships. There will be certain ships including the so-called mother ship of that Titan, the Polar Prince, which should be back in St. John's either late tonight or tomorrow morning. Again, a lot of information to be gained from that shift because they are the ones that lost communication with the Titan in the first place. But obviously, a pause here, right, for the families, for the victims, for thinking about what their lives meant and obviously their commitment to deep-sea exploration and what that meant to them and what it has contributed to our understanding at what happens at those depths in the sea.

COHEN (voice-over):  Will Conan, who chairs the Submarine Committee of the Marine Technology Society, says he wrote to Rush concerned Ocean Gate wasn't following the same safety standards as other vessels. In his 2018 letter, first obtained by \"The New York Times\", Conan warned Rush about what he called the company's experimental approach that could have serious consequences. CNN has previously reported that two former Ocean Gate employees, who were not engineers, separately raised safety concerns years ago about the hull of the Titan sub. The hull was made of carbon fiber composite, the type of material used in spacecraft. Filmmaker James Cameron, who's made more than 30 dives to the wreckage of the Titanic himself, says the danger of using carbon fiber composite is known within the engineering community. JAMES CAMERON, DIRECTOR, \"TITANIC\":  We always understood that this was the wrong material for submersible hulls, because with each pressure cycle, you can have progressive damage. It's quite insidious, and that I think lulled them into a sense of confidence and led to this tragedy. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
