And people made this assumption that they were talking about Joe Biden, when, in reality, they were experiencing something else because that red wave that everyone assumed was going to happen didn't happen, because they didn't like the direction. But it was just because they didn't like the direction the Republicans were actually going. And they were able -- and Biden was able in that election to use democracy as an anchor point. I think this is what Kamala Harris is doing now, using freedom. They pivoted a little from democracy and the word freedom to refresh it, because freedom, it is freedom to be able to make money, freedom to be able to be in a union, freedom to be able to love who you want to love and build a family the way you want to build it. Those are all economic issues, freedom to make choices over your body. When you talk about it in that way, I think it resonates with the folks.

And we have heard a little bit of it, but I'm certainly not convinced that we have heard enough of it. Now, I'm going to look at the state of Pennsylvania because I think that's the state that's ultimately most critical for the former president. I think a lot of Republicans are spending a lot of time there, a lot of money and resources there. If you're looking at Bucks County or Luzerne County or Erie, Pennsylvania, some of these real crucial battleground counties within the state, and you look at cost of goods and complaints from the residents there., it is the number one issue. I mean, let's look at the stats,. Electricity up 32 percent. Groceries up 22 percent. Eggs up 47 percent. Car insurance up 54 percent. Gasoline up 51 percent. And so I understand the motivating factor of saying you have the freedom to choose, et cetera, who you love, who you like, et cetera. But freedom to have money in your pocket, I think, is still a missing theme here. And how you're going to bring that, how you're going to actualize that, we haven't really heard. I mean, the vice president did release a plan. I will give some credit there. But a lot of individuals, experts have been skeptical of that plan.
