It would become the only way to retain verified user status. According to internal Twitter planning documents viewed by CNN, users who are currently verified by Twitter, with that little blue checkmark badge for no charge, will have 90 days to subscribe to this new Twitter Blue plan or have their verification revoked. Starting today, many employers in New York City will be required by law to advertise what they pay for a particular position up front. A similar law to improve pay transparency will take place in California in January. Let's bring in Jessica Kriegel, chief scientist of workplace culture at Culture Partners. Jessica, so nice to see you. Let's talk about -- the problem here is that some of these companies, especially big companies, have huge ranges in salaries for people doing the same job, and that's a problem.

Right now, women still make 77 cents to the dollar for -- on average across the nation. So this is a first step in trying to combat that.
