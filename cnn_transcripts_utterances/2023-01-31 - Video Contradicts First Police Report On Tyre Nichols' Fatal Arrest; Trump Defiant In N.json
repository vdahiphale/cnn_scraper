We're breaking down initial claims made by police officers and how they don't match up with videos of Nichols' arrest.Also tonight, CNN's exclusive one-on-one interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He's revealing whether he would consider acting as a wartime mediator between Ukraine and Russia. And we're getting our first look at former President Donald Trump's defiant deposition in a fraud investigation in New York, this as he is facing a new criminal probe of hush money payments over his alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin this hour with the glaring discrepancies between the initial Memphis police report on Tyre Nichols' case and the videos of his arrest and beating. CNN's Nick Valencia is covering all the new developments. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A bundle of contradictions between what the world witnessed in the video showing police beating Tyre Nichols and what's reportedly found in the initial police report about the incident. First reported by The New York Times, a photo of a police report was posted online by a Memphis talk show host. The district attorney's office tells CNN the D.A. does have a report that has that same account of events. The report suggests Nichols was pulled over after police say he veered into oncoming traffic. It says he was violent, sweating profusely and irate when he exited the vehicle and, quote, started to fight with officers, at one point, grabbing one of the detective's guns, things not seen in the body camera and sky cop street camera videos but the very things officers talked about during the encounter.",

We have the police chief who takes this, what is being called swift action in terms of firing these officers, putting these others on administrative leave, but yet we have not seen this police chief come out and answer questions, questions about these two officers who were on administrative leave. Has many people in the block community asking was the white officer, who were now learning about, is he being treated differently? Is he being shielded in a way that these black officers are not? And what happened with this police report? They say it's an official document that can't be released, but surely the chief can come forward, stand up before news reporters and answer questions about what was in that police report and what they know about the discrepancies in the report.

There's nothing to put any threat behind law enforcement officers for simply writing up a report. We've seen it in the George Floyd case. We've seen it in the Tamir Rice case. We see it all across the country.But this department appears to have a pattern and practice. No one sought to assist when you are seeing the victim there suffering. The Fire Department didn't assist. Other officers who came on the scene didn't assist. They allowed this young man to languish for over 20- plus minutes before getting him to the hospital.

But the United Kingdom and the United States for now, at least, have ruled out the supply of any fighter jets and fighter bombers, which the Ukrainians have been calling for.The French is still saying nothing is off the table. A lot of this is to do with the ability to supply, not so much from the perspective of the United States, but the United Kingdom just doesn't have any aircraft to spare. The French potentially do, because they've got some older mirage aircraft that they could possibly allow Ukraine to get their hands on. And, of course, elsewhere in Europe, there are also Soviet-era MIG fighter bombers that could be made available. But these are strategic weapons, like the long-range rockets that they've also been repeatedly asking for.

And then moments ago, McCarthy responded to that to one of our colleague saying that President Biden just doesn't get it.So, that back and forth is a pretty strong indication that tomorrow's meeting is not going to be very productive or fruitful but it is an important first step in what is going to be a very lengthy process. And both men are walking into the meeting tomorrow with very different goals in mind. For Biden, he wants to show that Republicans aren't unified just yet over a single plan to cut spending, and for McCarthy, he wants Biden to at least acknowledge that they are going to have to find some common ground with Republicans to resolve this issue.

And in these charging documents, we get a sense of what led to the district attorney's decision to give, you know, Alec Baldwin these two counts, charges of manslaughter, same with Hannah Gutierrez Reed, who was the armorer on the set of \"Rust\" in 2021. We have not heard from Alec Baldwin's team and Hannah Gutierrez Reed denying that she did anything wrong. I just want to read to you some of the allegations against AlecBaldwin in these charging documents. So the district attorney said that Alec Baldwin did not take part in the necessary firearms training, that he only did about 30 minutes of a 90 minute session and on the phone with his family and not paying attention and safety protocols and checks were skipped and that Hannah Gutierrez Reed failed to inspect the gun. She maintains that she should have been called back into the church for this rehearsal filming and she would have prevented this death of Halyna Hutchins, had she been called back in. And then they also claim that there was no gun malfunction. Now, Alec Baldwin has claimed that he did not pull the trigger and that the gun went off. He said that to me over the summer when I sat down with him, Wolf. But the district attorney is saying, no. We don't believe that. We believe that he pulled the trigger. We've seen videos and photos from behind the scenes that clearly show his finger on the trigger at different points and that the FBI never found that the gun malfunctioned. They also claim that they found five more live rounds on the set. And remember, there were never supposed to be live ammunition on the set, Wolf. How did the live rounds get to set? We may never know. It's not explained here and the district attorney said to our CNN Josh Campbell the other week that we may never know and that many safety complaints were not addressed. They say in the charging documents that if Baldwin had not pointed the gun at Hutchins, that this tragedy would not have occurred and that he should always assume that the gun is a loaded gun and that Alec had worked on over 40 movies with guns. But again, we've reached out to Baldwin and haven't heard anything back. But as of now, he is still expected this spring to go back and film, finish the movie and that is still to be seen. But a lot is at play here. This could go to trial.",

How bad is it there now, Ed? ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, the roadways all across north Texas and in central Texas as well, this is a complete mess. This is central express that cuts through the heart of the Dallas area and you would see how light the traffic has been and it's been like this throughout the day -- millions of people staying home from work and from school today because of this winter warning and this winter storm which brought in a heavy amount of sleet and freezing rain earlier today, and more is expected tomorrow. And it has really blanketed the roadways and made moving around and in the area very treacherous. You could see that is the highway, intersections like this are really kind of hardened up with this sleet that is fallen here. And that in the overnight hours is expected to continue to harden up which will make driving even more treacherous tomorrow. All of that coming as forecasters are predicting more freezing rain and sleet to continue falling on the area. So, it is something that this -- that the people who live here in North Texas and in Oklahoma and Arkansas will have to brace for more of this winter weather in the day ahead. In fact, forecasters, Wolf, are saying that the worst of this might not be over until Thursday morning before we get a clearing from the intense cold temperatures that is freezing everything here on the ground and making moving around and driving around so treacherous -- Wolf.",
