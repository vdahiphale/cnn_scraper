If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.Donald Trump is expected to appeal two decisions to remove him from primary ballots in Colorado and Maine today. The Colorado appeal will be filed to the U.S. Supreme Court and the Maine ruling to the Maine Supreme Court. The death toll from the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck Japan's west coast on Monday has now risen to at least 48. Rescuers are still working to reach people trapped under collapsed buildings. U.S. President Joe Biden has some busy months ahead of him as we all know. In addition to the war in Gaza he's hoping to get more aid approved for Ukraine and address the immigration crisis at the U.S. southern border too.

The collision was so powerful it launched both vehicles through pedestrian crossings the street.It took firefighters nearly an hour to put out the flames from the resulting fire. A bomb squad and arson task force were also called to the scene after at least a dozen gas canisters were found near one of the vehicles. More Americans with diabetes will get a break on their insulin costs in 2024, with another leading drugmaker now capping costs to help lower the price. CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell has those details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, the first of the year marks a major change in the way people who depend on insulin will pay for it. Now Sanofi becomes the third major U.S. manufacturer of insulin to offer a $35 per month price cap, at least on what people are paying out-of-pocket for their medications.Now, this may be kind of complicated for people to access. They may have to go to the drugmakers' websites and download a coupon. But at least this now becomes available across the board from these three major manufacturers. Now, more than 8 million people in the United States depend on insulin to live. And according to the American Diabetes Association, a quarter of those people have at one point needed to ration their medicine in order to pay for it. And that can have really severe health consequences. Another thing going into effect starting January 1st is decreases in the list prices of insulin of more than 70 percent. And now the list price is the actual price of the medicine before insurance kicks in or any rebates or discounts are paid back into the system. And now the reason that is actually happening is because of a Biden administration 2021 law, the American Rescue Plan Act. Essentially, that changed the way drugmakers have to pay rebates back to Medicaid for drugs on which they've raised the price a lot over the years. Insulins have been going up for decades. If you look at this graph we have here. This one actually comes from a congressional investigation into drug prices. And you can see how much those list prices have increased. It's Now, because of this change, which goes into effect January 1st, companies that have raised the price of medicines a lot over time could actually end up paying Medicaid for drugs, so losing money on those medicines. So, by reducing the list prices by 70 percent or more, these companies are actually avoiding having to pay these rebates back to Medicaid. Some analysts put this at hundreds of millions of dollars a year in savings these companies will have because they're reducing the list prices of their drugs. And so, while across the board it's hoped that insulin prices are coming down for everyone, there's a lot going on beyond the surface here. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And that is over the unwanted kiss that he gave her last August after Spain won at the Women's World Cup. [04:40:17] Hermoso is expected to speak during a closed-door sexual assault hearing that's part of this investigation. FIFA has banned Rubiales from all football-related activities for three years, a ruling that he's vowed to appeal. He's described the kiss as mutual. Hermoso denied that, saying she did not consent and was not respected. She said in November that she's received threats over her stance. Plus, after 52 years, Europe's longest-serving monarch is about to step down and one result will be the first Australian-born queen. That story when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

And the prime minister says first responders are in a battle against time to rescue people who are trapped under rubble.At least 48 people have died and dozens are wounded, according to officials. Tens of thousands of homes still don't have power. The central city of Wajima appeared to be among the worst hit. You're looking at images there. Entire buildings collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude quake. And Japan's public broadcaster, NHK, reports that a fire broke out, destroying more than 100 shops and homes. All tsunami advisories have now been lifted. But the threat of aftershocks isn't over. The U.S. Geological Survey has recorded at least 35 of those so far. More on that and how this earthquake unfolded from CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

When you look at these pictures, you're not going to believe that 367 passengers and 12 crew members on board this plane all got out safely, according to NHK.So let me just describe what happened. This plane was coming in from Sapporo. Sapporo is packed this time of year with tourists who are here for skiing, for sightseeing, flying back into Haneda Airport, which is about 20 minutes from where I'm standing right now. As the plane was coming down the runway, according to NHK, what they think happened is that there was some sort of a miscommunication with the air traffic control tower on either the part of this Japan airliner, JL516, the flight number, an A350, or a Coast Guard aircraft. The Japan Coast Guard has a base near Haneda Airport. The airport is actually right along Tokyo Bay. And so, these two planes, for whatever reason, collided. And according to what their initial assessment is of this, of course, obviously, this is just less than an hour ago when this happened, so they're still going to do a very extensive investigation. But what they believe is that there was some sort of a mix-up, miscommunication possibly, and this Coast Guard plane and this airliner with around 400 people on it collided on the runway. Both of the planes in the footage that has been coming in from the airport were on fire immediately. And so, the passengers and crew inside would have had literally seconds to collect themselves after the shock of such a major impact, get themselves up, get off the plane, not from the back because there was a huge fire that started in the back of the plane. The engines were scraping the ground. But apparently, they managed to get everybody out through the front emergency exits of the plane. And now that plane is still burning as we speak. The plane is on fire, completely engulfed. But the miracle of this tragic event in a country that has just been rocked by a major earthquake hours after ringing in the new year, 367 passengers and 12 crew members got away from this alive, according to NHK and Japan Airlines. Extraordinary, remarkable, some might say a miracle -- Bianca.",
