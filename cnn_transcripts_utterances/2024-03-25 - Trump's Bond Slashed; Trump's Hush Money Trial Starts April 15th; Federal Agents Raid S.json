But Donald Trump still continuing to play that line, to say that it was, in fact, election interference, to say he was angry. But what was really strange about this is that they were fully expecting for him to go to trial starting today. In fact, his team had planned for it. They were pleasantly surprised when they did get this original extension. But clearly, Donald Trump, knowing that that trial was going to come, was angered by that. But on the flip side of the coin, there was a lot of relief within not only Donald Trump, but within his entire orbit over the fact that they had lowered that bond to $175 million and given him this 10-day extension. Now, you heard Donald Trump really going on and on about how much cash he had, in fact, saying that he didn't want to have to use his cash for this bond, instead wanted to use it for his campaign.

So, again, I wasn't in the courtroom, but from the reporting, I haven't heard anything that suggests that there was anything that was untoward here.

And two, I think that there may be some actual concern and anxiety among some of the judges above Judge Engoron about the size of this fine.

And so, it just couldn't happen. And so, to the extent that the bond is supposed to maintain the status quo pending resolution of the appeals to make sure that the state will have its remedy once the judgment is final and upheld.

That means that we're not speaking of a grand jury having rendered or conclusion, not as to guilt. That's not what grand jurors do. But that's the reason to believe that a crime was committed and he committed them. Having said that, whenever you have a raid and an investigation, these things need to be really predicated upon, right, the precursor for this to happen would be some probable cause.What is that probable cause? We don't know. But let's go back to what Josh Campbell talked about, which are those various lawsuits. Now lawsuits or civil actions in nature, they're not criminal at all. But what they do is they give authority some guidelines and guideposts with respect to alleged conduct that was engaged in with regard to who it was engaged in, what activities there were, what it involved in, so that if there is an investigation could serve as a source of plentiful information, that information could be further investigated, right, by certainly the Homeland Security Agency. And as a result of that they can work with their local law enforcement partners. What does that mean? It means that they collectively, law enforcement try to determine whether there's reason to believe that crimes were committed. And, you know, what those crimes carried out and associated in any way we don't know, you know, with Sean Combs. And so that remains to be seen. But before authorities will can get into the home or property of anyone, you have to establish some firm basis to do that. And that is what at least we can conclude that they had reason to believe that there were crimes involving sex trafficking, apparently, and that these areas potentially can give more information with respect to the specifics. And I think they would be looking for computer devices and other devices, which would seem to indicate or give information as to whether there was any criminality very early in the process. But certainly we know that these have been carried out and we'll see what if any information is glean to be suggestive of any criminality.",

And so as a result of that, once they are armed, not only armed literally, but armed with respect to a warrant, you know, that would suggest that they have reasons to be there that there's criminality that would be afoot.Potentially, they go law enforcement does, and they made sure that the areas secure such that they can get any information from that warrant, so that they can continue to investigate. Very important to note, Wolf, that these investigative stages, warrants are typical in any type of investigation, right? This is the United States of America, everyone has right. But you don't get into someone's home without establishing that there may be some what we call indicia of criminality. They now, law enforcement will evaluate whatever they find in connection with this search. And if that search bears fruit with respect to any potential criminality on any computer devices, any cell phone devices, any, you know, thumb drives or anything else, then they will connect the dots and if it's appropriate, they'll move to the next level.

We do know that there were various lawsuits against Mr. Combs. And as a result of that lawsuits, a civil in nature, they're for monetary damages, but they can give critical information with respect to allegations. And sometimes when lawsuits are out there. You can have federal authorities investigating in this case, they did. And at least it was determined, again, we don't know where they got their information or how they got their information. We just know that federal authorities do have information, how do we know because you don't get to go into someone's home based upon the rights that we have in this country, right, Fourth Amendment freedoms against unreasonable searches and seizures, unless you have specific information that would establish that there's reasonable cause to believe, right, probable cause to believe that a crime was committed. And it in fact, right was committed by the source of whatever that particular warrant was. And so we'll see what if any information, Wolf, is gleaned from these investigations, what authorities take, they'll evaluate what they take, they'll see whether there's any indicia of criminality there, and that would heighten it to the next step, maybe there's nothing there.

So you have to presume, Wolf, that there's some work in coordination being done with the U.S. Attorney's Office, right, the United States Attorney's offices, Department of Justice arm, and as a result of that, you would expect that whatever is gathered, as a result of this investigation is going to be analyzed very thoroughly in the labs that the federal government has, they'll make a determination as to what if any criminality, right, was found as a result of this, we don't know what they will find.We do know, right, that they're looking for something and have reasons to believe that something of a criminal variety could be at these locations. That's a presumption, that's what warrants investigations are all about. It's the first step in the process. Once that process takes place, which it's taking place now, you gather and glean what information you have, you then go if you're one of these agents, and you assess that information to determine whether and what's there. You then of course, work closely with attorneys who are prosecutors to look at and evaluate what's there, what it establishes whether or not it's criminal, who with anyone would be depicted on any of these devices, what ages are, are they're on to age, et cetera, and then you take it from there. And if it's appropriate, you would get an indictment far away from that. But that certainly will be the process moving forward.",
