It isn't just strategically important town, it is that crucial symbol as well.Now, what we're hearing tonight is Ukrainians saying that they have not given it up. You imagine how controversial a decision it will be if and when Ukrainians decide to do so given the amount of Ukrainian blood that have been spilled trying to defend it. For now, they continue to defend despite those terrible conditions, despite those Wagner fighters. One Ukrainian commander describing that Russia has not achieved all that it wanted on the ground and so it is simply blitzing it from the sky and trying to reduce this town to molecules. That is his word. And it is worth remembering tonight, Wolf, that there are some 4,500 civilians still trapped inside the town, including 48 children, entirely inaccessible at this stage to be rescued and one considers the kind of trauma that they'll feeling. This is a siege that after all may have worsened these last few days but has been going on, Wolf, for seven months.",

I'm not sure that the Chinese economy can sustain in addition to the disruption of COVID opening, a disruption of trade relations with the United States.

One of them is possession of an explosive in an airport or attempting to place an incendiary device on an aircraft. And according to the FBI, this is a very serious thing, obviously bringing explosives on to an aircraft, again, even if by accident, is a very, very serious thing and it describes that the powder that they found in these explosives are susceptible to ignite from heat and friction and pose a significant risk to the aircraft and the passengers.

And this is the property of Moselle. It is about 1,700 acres where the murders took place at the dog kennels on that property. So, they were able to see the feed room where Paul Murdaugh was killed, also this grassy area where Maggie Murdaugh's body was found and there was some media that was allowed to go and they reported back that there were only 12 steps between those two scenes. So, that is how close the two of them were to each other when they were both killed. They also saw the quail pen, which still had bullet holes in it, and they talked about that during this testimony.Then the jury returned here to the courthouse and the prosecution, lead Prosecutor Creighton Waters, delivered his closing arguments. And the general theme was, Alex Murdaugh is a liar. He's lied for decades to family, friends, co-workers and he's lying to you, the jury. At one point this prosecutor laid out what the state believes happened that night, painting the scene of Paul Murdaugh in the feed room being shot with the buck shot from a shotgun by his father allegedly and that they said that Alex Murdaugh would have believed that his son was dead and was bending down when he was startled, according to state in this closing argument, and was picking up another weapon, startled by his son, Paul, and that is why the trajectory of the bullet is going upward and there are pellets in the ceiling at that feed room. It was an incredible description listening to how he says this all went down and then he describes what Maggie Murdaugh would have been doing in that very moment. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
