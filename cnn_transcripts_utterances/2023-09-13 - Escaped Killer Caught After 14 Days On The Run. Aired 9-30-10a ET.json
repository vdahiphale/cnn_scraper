They did not give specifics as to which one at this point. There are a number in the area and, of course, a number in the state. But that's the most immediate information that we'll have of where, you know, we've watched in this motorcade of this big armored van taking Cavalcante. That's where he's heading to continue to be in PSP custody. And then he'll be medically assessed, and then he'll be on his way to SCI, a state prison.",

And one of the ways that they establish their legal authority to do that is by obtaining what John referred to earlier as a warrant for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. That is a federal crime.If you're fleeing some jurisdiction to avoid being prosecuted, we call it a UFAP warrant. So the feds will have obtained the UFAP warrant that enables them to come in and help tactically, do the searches, do the investigation, help out vetting potential contacts of the fugitive and maybe putting surveillance on different locations and family members in hopes that the fugitive will make contact to those folks. And then once he's taken into custody, typically the UFAP warrant gets dismissed, so you're never actually prosecuted on it. And the prisoner is, you know, remanded to state custody and either prosecuted on the crime that he was running from or, in this case, will likely be prosecuted newly for his escape from prison. And of course, he has a very, very long sentence, probably, a life sentence to serve out for the homicide he's already been convicted from. So the federal assistance, it's pretty much finished at this point. State authorities are perfectly capable of taking this guy the rest of the way. And I would suspect that he'll be held under very different conditions of confinement in state penitentiaries now that he's got a record of successful (INAUDIBLE).",

You're listening to other team members telling you what they're seeing in their field of fire, their direction that they've been assigned to look. Someone comes over that radio with, I think, you know, there may be something in the tall grass, you know, ahead of us to the right, whatever that might be.

And you can imagine that he is then, you know, likely raising his hands first, following commands. That's the first thing you want to look for, as you're shouting out to him to raise your hands. If he does that, that's an indication that he's cooperating. But as soon as he gets up and you see that there is a rifle right in the same spot where he was lying, that's one of those moments, that split second moment where you have to decide, am I in danger here?

Because, you know, again, there's been a show of force in terms of law enforcement out here for many, many days. It seems this area was actually on the very edge of this search perimeter and, frankly, not close to where he even stole that gun on Monday night. So I'm curious what led them to this particular spot.And one other thing, John, I know again, we're waiting for this presser any moment now. But I'll just note I've been talking with you on camera for, you know, a little while now and I didn't even realize, if you look behind me, the police presence is gone. All those troopers, all of the intense perimeter setups, checking the trunks, checking the cars, they're gone. We saw them. Many troopers come from the site where this capture happened. They went home. It's just another signal that things are getting back to normal here already in Chester County after 14 days of fear, of uncertainty and concern because this convicted murderer was on the loose. And now he's back in police custody. And as I reported earlier, we understand that he's going to stay in Pennsylvania State police custody for a little bit, then he's going to get medically assessed, then he is going to go to a state facility where he will remain for a life sentence that he's already been convicted of.

And there are a couple of pictures from our vantage point, they're a little bit hard to see. I think I see a vehicle with him standing, looks like next to it. But we will get details on why those pictures are there. What happened exactly? We have heard from our John Miller, from his sources, that he was found. Cavalcante, the convicted killer, was found lying in a bunch of tall grass, sort of laying low on top of a rifle. Don't know if he was sleeping or if he was just literally trying to stay out of sight of law enforcement, but that is how they found him. Two different teams. One, Pennsylvania SWAT team, another BORTAC, which is the Customs and Border Controls Elite Unit. We are waiting for that press conference to begin. But we still have Andrew McCabe, who is with us. Thank you, sir, for staying around. Can I ask you just a little bit about what we are hearing now from John Miller's sources about how he was captured? What does it tell you about him and about how perhaps they found him? Because if he was found near this pile of wood, which is near a home, clearly there are cars there. What sort of clues does that give you as to how he was captured?",
