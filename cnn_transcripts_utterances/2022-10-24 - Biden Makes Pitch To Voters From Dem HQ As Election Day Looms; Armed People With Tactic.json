The president, though, isn't in the battleground states where you might expect him to be delivering that kind of closing argument.Instead, he's at Democratic Party headquarters where he said that his goal was to try and energize the organizers who are calling into those battleground states, the staff at the Democratic Party, who was working tirelessly to try and make sure the Democrats hold on to the House and the Senate. And the president said that he wants to make clear that this is what he termed a choice election and not a referendum on his presidency. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's not a referendum, I should say, it's to choose. Democrats are lowering your everyday costs like prescription drugs, health care premiums, energy bills, and gas prices. Folks, Republicans have made it clear at least they're being honest around this time. They're telling you exactly what they want to do if they win. They're going to increase everyday costs.

The president is also talking about a number of other issues, trying to set up a contrast here, whether it was taxes for corporations, talking about fiscal responsibility, Social Security and Medicare, or abortion rights.The president making very clear what the stakes are in this election should Democrats retain control of Congress or should Republicans win back one or both Houses of Congress? But as I said, the president is delivering this message here in Washington, DC. And in large part that's because as we're seeing in some of these new CNN poll numbers, the president is underwater, his approval rating underwater in several of these key battleground states. And that's why a lot of these candidates don't necessarily want to be seen campaigning directly with the president. There is one state though where the president has been repeatedly traveling to and that's the state of Pennsylvania. On Friday, we expect the President to return there once again for a fundraising reception for the Democratic Party. In Philadelphia, the President certainly will be making his case as voters head to the polls in less than two weeks. Victor, Bianna.",

Now there have been some of these watchers outside of these ballot boxes -- there have been some here in Phoenix. And there's nothing wrong with watching. What is wrong, say by election officials is showing up being armed and intimidating voters and they believe this is in fact voter intimidation. They are concerned about voter safety, and even more concerning that election officials say they believe that some of the candidates running here in Arizona are egging them on specifically the Republican Secretary of State candidate Mark Finchem who's urging people to show up at these drop boxes. And election officials also say that on its face, this is simply ridiculous behavior because yes, these drop boxes are outside but there are almost 30 places where voters can drop off ballots early.

Experts are also worried about a potential flu surge. Joining us now, Dr. F. Perry Wilson. He's an associate professor of medicine at Yale University Medical School.

What are the chances of that happening this fall and winter? DR. F. PERRY WILSON, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, YALE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: Hi, Victor, I think we're pretty much already there. The reason I'm so concerned is that both flu and RSV seasons aren't supposed to be happening yet. Flu season really gets going late-November and goes on through about February or March sometimes later into the spring, RSV season similarly, December, January is when we see peaks. And we're seeing RSV cases at peak levels right now. And we're already seeing a fair amount of influenza cases starting to come in as well. So, the upswing is starting.

They are at the highest risk for complications from RSV, and they don't tell you that they're sick. But those kids less than one year of age are going to be lethargic. They might be inconsolable crying. Even if you're holding them, they don't get better. Those are concerning findings.
