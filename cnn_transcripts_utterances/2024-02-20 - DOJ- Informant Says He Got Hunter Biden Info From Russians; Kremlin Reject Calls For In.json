Plus, President Biden vowing to punish Putin with major new sanctions after the death of Alexey Navalny, as Russia has now detained a Los Angeles woman on suspicions of treason after reportedly donating to Ukraine. And we take you inside one of the most dangerous prisons, one overrun by terror groups and gangs and where at least one gang leader has his own courtyard, fridge and queen-sized bed. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Brianna Keilar, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news, Russian interference, the former FBI informant charged with lying about the Biden's business dealings with Ukraine is tonight making a stunning admission, telling the FBI Russia was feeding him false information about the president's son and the president. Remember, Alexander Smirnov was the Republican star source of information into President Biden and Hunter Biden, someone they repeatedly touted as, quote, credible and most respected. Here's Republican Jim Jordan just weeks ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): The most current operating evidence we have is that 1023 form from this highly credible, confidential human source. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Special counsel David Weiss, he's the one overseeing both criminal prosecutions of Hunter Biden and here in this court filing, he's advocating to the court why Smirnov should be detained, why he presents a flight risk.Now, as you noted, he has been charged with lying to investigators about the Biden's business dealings. But in this new filing, Weiss reveals that Smirnov claims, he claims that Russian intelligence officials shared with him some of the information that he had about Hunter Biden. Now, this was revealed after he was arrested and he also told investigators that he had, quote, extensive and extremely recent contacts with foreign intelligence officials. He had we learned in this filing previously told the FBI that he had many contacts and foreign intelligence. What they learned in the subsequent interview after his arrest, that he kept up those relationships. Now, prosecutors did not independently verify, Brianna, if he did have these contacts, if they were legitimate, and if they provided him with information about Hunter Biden. But in this filing, they also talk about the impact that is false statements about the Bidens have had on U.S. politics, on the election. They said, quote, his lies targeted the presumptive nominee of one of the two major political parties in the United States. The effect of his false statements and fabricated information continued to be felt to this day because, of course, these false -- alleged false statements are part of what has boosted Republicans in their effort to try to impeach President Biden. Smirnov has not gotten to the point in this process where he would enter a guilty or not guilty plea, but in a statement to CNN, his lawyer said that he, quote, is presumed innocent.",

DOUGLAS LONDON, FORMER CIA COUNTERTERORRISM CHIEF FOR SOUTH &amp; SOUTHWEST ASIA: Well, there's still a lot we don't know including how much of what he's telling us is true and how much is a lie. But if he's been in touch with the FBI since 2010, it has to inevitably be because of his contact with Russian officials and Russia intel ties. We still don't know much about him. He's described as a globe trotting, Russian speaking businessman. We could assume at least the U.S. person, some residency here, but that's a long time for a confidential human source relationship, which by their definition is essentially what we would call a CIA, an agent. The FBI's primary interests would be criminal, or counter-intelligence. So it would be those contacts would make him of interest. But the challenges even if that access was legitimate and it might be what was his agenda was always under hostile control.
