First, Israel says that it has recovered the bodies of three hostages who were killed on October 7th. And CNN has exclusively obtained very disturbing videos showing rap star \"Diddy\" assaulting his former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura back in 2016. Those stories and much more ahead. We begin though with breaking news this hour on the Israeli-Hamas war, and the Israeli military announced that its forces have recovered the bodies of three hostages from Gaza. The IDF says they escaped from the Nova Festival on October 7th and went to a Kibbutz where they were killed. Chief military spokesperson Daniel Hagari says the hostages were celebrating life at that festival when they were brutally murdered. He delivered the somber details at a news conferences just a few hours ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It was four or five and friendly fire in an operation that's actuallyescalated and got bigger in northern Gaza who were killed, others injured, a tank fired twice on their position. So, you know, if the majority of the population want the hostages returned in a deal and want the fighting to stop, then you have to understand behind that, people are saying, well, why are our soldiers dying? Now, they're very patriotic. The country is very patriotic, people do national service. They all understand their duty and their role, but they're able to show that they actually are delivering, are bringing some of the hostages home. That's a very key political thing. Although, we heard this from the IDF, but it's a key political thing for the government to need to be -- seem to be achieving. But, this is not what the families want. They want -- they do want the fighting to stop. The vast majority of them, and they do want a deal. And Hamas two weeks ago, beginning of last week indicated that there might be a deal that they'd signed a version of a deal that made it tantalizingly close, that the hostages could be released. They talked about not by name, but specifically the categories of hostages who might be released, how many, how far they'll be spaced apart, and how many Palestinian prisoners and what category of Palestinian prisoner they wanted released in return. So, it all became you know, much more real for the families that a deal seemed to take shape, and therefore, perhaps, be even closer. But I think one thing you do hear, and I've heard from talking to hostage families a lot, is they have no trust for Hamas, they know that it's a psychological warfare that's being played on them. And in essence, taking the bodies of those three people into Gaza along with other people that Hamas had killed, and holding them and treating. And in the discourse, sort of treating them as hostages and therefore, potentially alive, but them, actually being dead. It has been a form of torture for those families and a real form of manipulation.",

And in essence, that is the position of the Netanyahu government. Mr. Netanyahu and the far-right ministers surrounding him. Other people are saying the war against Hamas has been going on for seven months, eradicating Hamas will probably take you more months at the very least. And we haven't at least -- angle we're doing. Everything that we need right now, take a break and focus on bringing back the hostages. This is a debate that is tearing apart Israeli society. A very complicated debate, because you sign right now an agreement to end the war and bring back the hostages, and that's Hamas' key demand. What does that mean for the Israelis living in the southwest of the country along the border with Gaza, are they going back to their homes with Hamas on the other side of the border fence, they blame Hamas that committed the atrocities of October 7th. For me personally, just from my opinion, I support going for a deal right now because I think our hostages are running out of time, that should be the highest priority.

I hope now all of those people will be quiet. \"Diddy\" is famous for saying, I thought I told you that we won't stop. I hope everyone stops defending this man because that video in the hallway shows a deranged, abusive person taking out whatever his frustrations or madness is on a defenseless woman. It is sickening as Areva said, it is horrifying to watch, and I hope personally that it is the nail in the coffin for abusers everywhere. We need to start believing women face value when they raise these allegations because of the strength it takes to walk away from an abuser, someone as famous as \"Diddy\", then you said it, if it can happen to Cassie, it can happen to anyone. I would furthermore say it is happening more often than we'd like to admit, and this footage shows that not only was Cassie truthful and what she was alleging, but that \"Diddy's\" up -- \"Diddy\" is a monster.

And people didn't believe those women, and we were talking about under age women, and the same kinds of allegations, the same kinds of rumors have swirled around \"Diddy\" for decades as well. And we have this really sick thing that we sometimes do with powerful men, and that's put them on a pedestal, that's believed them, that's revered them. And we do so at the expense of women and particularly black women who are more likely not to be believed, more likely to be maligned when they come out to report abuse by powerful black men. And we've seen too many examples of black women being marginalized and being vilified themselves when they do make reports. So, again, I just want to thank Cassidy or Cassie for opening this can of worms, for showing the world what \"Diddy\" is, what he is about and what he has done to her, and that lawsuit has so many explosive incidents of violence.

The PGA of America now confirming the name of the man who lost his life, a worker in connection with this tournament, one of golf's big four men's majors, a huge global event this is in the world of golf. But the PGA of America paying tribute to the life of and the tragic loss of life, basically, when he was passing away after an incident with a shuttle bus. That was in the 5:00 a.m. hour before the Scottie Scheffler incident.

He's looking to win his third straight tournament. He's looking to win his fifth tournament victory in six starts. He just won the Masters Championship for a second time, the coveted green jacket. And I tell you right now, he's out on the course as we speak, Zain, and he's having a very, very good round. Indeed, his second round a short while ago, he was within two shots of the leader at this tournament. So, he really has come out in spite. He got out onto the course after he was detained. And we had that video of him being handcuffed. He made it for his tea time. The tournament play here was delayed by an hour and 20 following the tragic death that I referenced earlier. He made his revised tea time and he came out. So he got a birdie and a bogey, then a birdie. And a short while ago, as I said, he's just two shots off the pace.

And today, too, in broad daylight, what witnesses told us were three strikes hit one part of the city and there was thick black smoke pouring out across the skyline here. A small number of dead and dozens injured from that particular attack say, local officials. And it's a sign of how Russian forces are focusing on Kharkiv. You said there how Russian President Vladimir Putin said in China that he has no plan today to try and take Kharkiv city. I mean, obviously, I think many people would say taking a city of this size, nearly a million people, with the force he's arrayed would be a very steep challenge, almost impossible probably. But it seems like that 25,000 strong force, according to Ukrainian intelligence officials, a huge number of Russian troops committed to this new offensive. Their goal is more to make life here exceptionally unpleasant, if not deadly, for many Kharkiv residents to get their forces within firing distance. There's one key village Lyptsi to the north here of Kharkiv under intense pressure from Russian forces because they know if they can get into it and put their artillery pieces there, they can just rain fire down onto this huge population center here. So, Putin's comments you heard there about this being forced upon Russia because of Ukrainian attacks on Belgorod and the buffer zone they required will obviously ring hollow with many Ukrainians who have seen their cities hammered over the past two years or so by indiscriminate, at times, Russian attacks. But still, the news not good for Ukraine on those frontline areas, particularly to the north of where I am, where Ukraine's military today suggested that in fact Russia had pushed deeper into territory. Looking at the map, they appear to be trying to swoop around and perhaps cut off some of the villages I was referring to earlier on where they want to put their artillery. So a steep challenge ahead for Ukraine's military without doubt. They've had to rush forces from around the country to here from frontlines that have already been seeing fatigue, ammunition shortages, stress and significant Russian advances too. And so ultimately, I think many are assessing this move in Kharkiv as perhaps the Russians seeing how far they can get, how much trouble they can inflict on Ukraine's biggest -- second biggest city and also too --how much distraction they can create to force Ukraine to take overstretched forces from frontlines where they're already losing and rush them to here. So a very steep challenge ahead and Ukraine's military today warning that it's really heavier battles are due ahead.",

Thank you.Slovakia's prime minister remains in serious condition in hospital but he is conscious and we do know that he is able to speak. Robert Fico underwent more surgery today after he was shot on Wednesday. A 71-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder there. Fico is being dragged into a car just after he was shot. The country's deputy prime minister said doctors will have a better idea of how Mr. Fico is recovering in the coming days. He is also adding the running of the government was continuing in his absence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT KALINAK, SLOVAK DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (through translator): His condition remains very serious, but this procedure allowed for monitoring and improvement of the healing of the individual gunshot wounds in the medical area. I think it will take a few more days before we can definitively understand the direction of his recovery. It is also true that all tasks assigned to the various ministries continue as usual. The functioning of the country is not frozen or halted in any way. All processes are continuing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The top U.N. aidofficial in Sudan is calling on the international community to give greater attention and resources to the country where millions are trapped in brutal conditions as a result of civil war. The Sudanese Army and paramilitary group RSF have been locked in battle since April of 2023, and in recent days, deadly violence has escalated in the capital of Sudan's north Darfur state, which had previously been relatively safe. For more on what Sudan is facing, I want to bring in Oliver Behn. He's the Director of Operations, rather, for Doctors Without Borders, or Medecins Sans Frontiere, and has just returned from Darfur. Oliver, thank you so much for being with us. My question to you is how do you support a collapsed health care system? Because obviously a lot of health care facilities in Sudan are simply no longer functioning. You've got skyrocketing prices in terms of food and medicine. And then you've got this sort of humanitarian void that continues to persist in the country. Just explain to us how you guys are navigating that.",

It is not easy to work in Sudan for nobody, but as Doctors Without Borders, we are able to supply our projects from various directions. We are coming by a chart. We are coming also through Port Sudan in the east of the country, and particularly the cross-border supply that we are doing into chart allows us to run very large-scale projects in the region. And that's also how we can support our colleagues in the country, our international colleagues and Sudanese colleagues. It is a particular challenge because the Ministry of Health, whom we are in very close contact with and work in partnership with in the Darfur region, is cut off from the supply of the central level from the government, and they haven't received any salaries or funds or medical supplies coming in from their side and are purely relying on what we can bring in as Doctors Without Borders because we unfortunately also see a lack of response from the wider international humanitarian system.",

I mean, I think what's heartbreaking about this particular crisis is that Sudanneeded humanitarian assistance even before the war began, let alone after the war began. And unfortunately, a byproduct of the war starting is that a lot of humanitarian aid agencies left the country. And so how much more pressure is there now on your organization, on Medecins Sans Frontiere, to sort of step in where other aid organizations have decided to leave?",

They need help too. Just in terms of actually distributing humanitarian assistance. I mean, obviously, it's difficult for Medecins Sans Frontiere throughout the country, as you point out, especially in Darfur. But for people who have been displaced, people who have had to flee their homes, many of them are sort of sheltering in abandoned buildings with almost zero access to humanitarian assistance.

But not only medical care, we can also provide support for water and sanitations. We are distributing non-food item support in order to cover these first needs. It is, however, also not easy for us, both for security reasons, so one has to be very careful, everything has to be very well planned, and we are not always getting the travel permits that we need.",
