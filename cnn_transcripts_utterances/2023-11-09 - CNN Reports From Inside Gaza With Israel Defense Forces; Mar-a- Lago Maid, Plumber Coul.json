Some are living a life of luxury a thousand miles away. A special report coming.Plus, exclusive CNN reporting on the Mar-a-Lago documents case. A wide-ranging list of potential witnesses, including maid, a plumber, even a woodworker, all on that list. And Trump is, quote, ballistic over it. And an OUTFRONT special report. China, a superpower with a stunning message for Chinese women: Quit your job, stay home. Go have babies. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in tonight for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, a firsthand look at Hamas training camps. And these are new pictures from inside Gaza. Our Oren Liebermann was embedded with Israel's military as they made their way to a Hamas training camp. So, the camp, as you can see here, include several buildings. It's important to note, CNN reporter from Gaza under the escort of Israel defense forces at all times. CNN does maintain full editorial control, and we'll have much more from Oren in just a moment. According to Israel's military, they are now fighting Hamas block by block, house by house, closing in on what they are calling the heart of Hamas's intelligence and operational activities. According to Israel, an estimated 80,000 people traveled south today alone, to escape the fighting. This mass migration coming as the White House and Israel is agreeing to pause its military operations in northern Gaza, for four hours a day, so people can leave. Just moments ago, though, the Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made it clear this is not a cease-fire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER:  One thing we haven't agreed to a cease-fire. A cease-fire with Hamas means surrender to Hamas, surrender to terror, and the victory of the Iran's axis of terror. So, there won't be a cease-fire without the release of Israeli hostages.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Israel's 162nd division in urban combat in central Gaza. This video was provided by the Israel Defense Forces. They say their troops are now well inside Gaza City, where they found Hamas command and control as well as weapons-making facilities. We are now fighting a ground offensive that will only deepen, the IDF spokesperson says, in the heart of Gaza City. We will reach more and more Hamas strongholds. Gaza's civilians continue to suffer, as Israel presses on with its offensive. Tens of thousands fleeing the northern part of the Strip in recent days according to the U.N., while the Palestinian ministry of health says thousands have been killed or wounded in Hamas-controlled Gaza. Still, tough talk coming from Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh threatening the Israeli army. They are drowning in the sounds of Gaza, he says. This will cost them a lot on all fronts, including the life of their hostages. But Ismail Haniyeh himself isn't even inside Gaza. Like much of Hamas's political leadership, he's in the safety and comfort of Qatar, recently meeting with Iran's foreign minister there.

Hamas's leadership making clear, again, from outside of Gaza, they are willing to sacrifice more civilians in Gaza. Do we have to pay a price, he asks. Yes, and we're ready to pay for it. And Hamas leaders in exile are calling on citizens of nations in the region to sacrifice as well. This is former Hamas boss Khaled Mashal who was also not inside the Gaza Strip. I call firstly on the surrounding countries, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt, all of its sons and daughters. Your duty is bigger because you are closer to Palestine. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera):  Now, Erica, one of the things that Hamas leadership in exile is doing is traveling around the region, obviously trying to further their agenda. In fact, Khaled Mashal who we saw at the end of our report there, he was part of a Hamas delegation that's also included the head of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, which traveled to Cairo in Egypt today. Now, all we know from that meeting is that they met with the head of Egyptian intelligence, and spoke about the situation inside Gaza, of course, as the suffering there continues -- Erica.",

He only returned half them to the storage facility. So, who would know about that? Well, he went ballistic when he foundout that the maid who cleans the bedroom suites was speaking, or could be speaking, was asked if she could the FBI. Why would you go ballistic? Probably because he is worried about something that's not good for him and that she knows about it. She should maybe identify if there were 64 boxes in his private residence, and if this takes time as a several day period in which he's maybe going through them.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): China's communist rulers face a looming population crisis, a crisis some say, they helped create. Now, they want women to help solve it, by staying home and having more babies. The one-child policy, decades of forced abortions, and other draconian measures imposed on Chinese people, preventing an estimated 200 million births may be backfiring, experts say. For the first time since the post-famine years of the 1960s, China's massive population is shrinking. It's maybe too late to turn things around, 1.4 billion people, living longer, getting older, aging faster than the social welfare system can keep up. China's birth rate also falling fast -- far fewer babies, a baby bust that could cripple future growth. Adding to Beijing's biggest economic charge in four decades, youth unemployment skyrocketing, many Chinese young people struggling to find decent paying jobs, unable to financially support themselves, never mind their aging parents. Marriage, children, forget about it. The male-dominated government says the solution is simple. A return to traditional family values.
