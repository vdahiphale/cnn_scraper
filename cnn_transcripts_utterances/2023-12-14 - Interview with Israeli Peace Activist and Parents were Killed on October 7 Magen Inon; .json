      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, and welcome to \"Amanpour.\" Here's what's coming up.Horror and pain in Gaza. CNN witnesses firsthand the intense suffering at a hospital inside the enclave, and we'll have a special report. And, amid the anger and loss, a beacon of hope. I'm joined by two new friends who've lost loved ones to this war, a Palestinian and an Israeli, who now fight together for peace. Then, is this the end of dirty energy? COP26 president, U.K. MP Alok Sharma, reacts to that landmark deal on fossil fuels. Plus, \"The Upcycled Self,\" renowned rapper Black Thought, on his new memoir, a story of tragedy and resilience. Welcome to the program, everyone, I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Tonight, what we've reported on for two months, we see through the eyes of our own correspondent for the first time, the desperate humanitarian disaster in Gaza. Since Israel lost 1,200 citizens to Hamas slaughter on October 7th, their counteroffensive in Gaza has had a catastrophic effect on Palestinian civilians. More than 18,000 Gazans have been killed, according to the Hamas run Ministry of Health there. And today Israel's Defense Minister informed the visiting U.S. National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, their war on Hamas will last \"more than several months.\" Sullivan's meetings with government officials, including Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, come as the White House pushes them to be more precise in reducing the risk to civilians. Scores of brave Palestinian journalists have been bringing the horrors suffered in Gaza to the world. Many of them have lost their lives doing so. Now, CNN is the first western media outlet to gain access without Israeli military escorts. Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward witnesses the severe crisis on a visit to a field hospital facilitated by the UAE. And of course, it is painful to watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLARISSA WARD, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): You don't have to search for tragedy in Gaza, it finds you on every street, strewn with trash and stagnant water, desolate and foreboding.",

But 20-year-old Lama (ph) understands it all too well. Ten weeks ago, she was studying engineering at university, helping to plan her sister's wedding. Today, she is recovering from the amputation of her right leg. Her family followed Israeli military orders and fled from the north to the south. But the house where they were seeking shelter was hit in a strike. The world isn't listening to us, she says. Nobody cares about us. We have been dying for over 60 days, dying from the bombing, and nobody did anything. Words of condemnation delivered in a thin rasp. But does anyone hear them? Like Grozny, Aleppo, and Mariupol, Gaza will go down as one of the great horrors of modern warfare. It's getting dark. Time for us to leave. A privilege the vast majority of Gazans do not have. Our brief glimpse from a window onto hell is ending as a new chapter in this ugly conflict unfolds. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the orphans of this war will be the soldiers of the next war. So, if we need to eradicate Hamas, I mean, genuinely and successfully, we have to change the circumstances. We have to show people a different vision. To tell people, yes, you will have a state, you're entitled to human rights, you're entitled to equal rights. And then, we can, you know, come and talk about unity, about tolerance, about acceptance and all of that. But people are threatened. People hear Israeli leaders saying in the Knesset podium that there will be another Nakba, that Palestinians will never have a state. And then, I come and talk about peace with them, I don't sound authentic. I don't -- I have tried this over and over, and I have tried it and told them and explained to them, I do it for you. You have to live without resentment and victimhood for yourself. But it doesn't come naturally to people when they're threatened all the time. And the world has abandoned them. President Biden, which I admire, when he came, I was so relieved, you know, that Trump is no longer president. And I was really hoping at least he will do small things. He promised to open the concert in Jerusalem, he couldn't. The Palestinian office in Washington, D.C. is still closed, he did nothing. And then, he put all his energy in normalization with Saudi Arabia, which is nice, but Palestinians are there. Why they're invisible? Because they're quiet? Why Palestinians have to, you know, do something so crazy to be seen? And only then, you know, start talking about -- like, what I felt in Washington, D.C. this summer, that Americans are waiting for a crisis to step in. But as long as situation is under control, which was not under control for Palestinians, for Israeli wars, you know, settlements are expanding, settlers are going crazy, that they will step in.
