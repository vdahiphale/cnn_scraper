If you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.In the coming hours President Biden is expected to announce that an additional 15 million barrels of oil will be released from the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve. The White House says it's an effort to ease rising gasoline prices but the amount of oil in the reserve is already at its lowest level since the 1980s. And Ukrainian officials say they've shot down 13 kamikaze drones over the southern Mykolaiv region. Russia's continued attacks on cities across Ukraine have also led to power outages in the Dnipropetrovsk region. More on both of these stories ahead on \"EARLY START.\" Now New York City is opening a new facility today to serve 500 asylum seekers. The tent center on Randall's Island cost $325,000 to set up. But the city is still calculating the day-to-day operating costs. While some New Yorkers are not happy about the influx of migrants, others are doing what they can to help. CNN's Miguel Marquez has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MANUEL CASTRO, COMMISSIONER, NYC'S MAYOR'S OFFICE OF IMMIGRANT AFFAIRS: This is an historic moment.

Demonstrations erupted last month after Mahsa Amini died in the custody of the morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.CNN obtained this video from the pro-reform activists outlet IranWire. It shows protesters gathering around a fire at Amini's birthplace on Tuesday. She's become a symbol in the fight for women's rights and freedoms in Iran. These are university students in northern Iran chanting for freedom and equality during their protest march on Tuesday. Meanwhile, an Iranian rock climber is now back in Tehran after competing without her hijab in South Korea on Sunday. Elnaz Rekabi told Iranian state media on arrival that she accidentally competed without her head scarf. There's growing concern she could face repercussions given Iran's current political climate. CNN's Nada Bashir joins me now here in London. A huge response from her fans in Tehran there but they also believe that she's only saying her hijab fell off to avoid being arrested.",

Stronger than expected earnings from Johnson &amp; Johnson and Lockheed Martin help drive a rally on Wall Street on Tuesday. The Dow gained nearly 340 points more than 1 percent on the day. The Nasdaq finished 96 points higher, just under 1 percent. And the S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 1.25 percent.Shares of Netflix soared 14 percent in afterhours trading after the company reported its third-quarter earnings. The streaming giant said it added 2 million -- 2.4 million, in fact, subscribers reversing recent declines. But Netflix says it wants investors to focus less on those numbers and more on revenue. The company claims its main competitors had combined losses of over $10 billion this year while it turned a profit of $5 to $6 billion. A new report shows the U.K.'s rate of inflation rose more than 10 percent in September. It was driven by big increases in food and drink prices which are up more than 14 percent. Britain's new finance minister during his fifth day on the job said he understands families are struggling and that the government is working to deliver stability and growth. But the U.K.'s leadership seems anything but stable. Liz Truss is in a fight for her political life as she prepares to face Parliament for the weekly Prime Minister's questions and it's not at all clear that she'll show up. I'm sure she will show up, Scott. She eventually showed up the other day when everyone thought she wasn't going to show up. SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it was a bit of a weird scenario. On Monday, I guess when Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, deputized for her and she was asked after Liz Truss had come into the Commons and sat right behind her, whether she could guarantee that Liz Truss would actually be there to answer questions today. And she said, yes. So, yes, we expect Liz Truss to be there. Yesterday she put out a statement saying that, look, she wants to be honest with the British people about the tough times that lie ahead and, in that statement, -- that written statement that she put out after meeting with her cabinet turned out to be pretty prescient given the new inflation numbers we're seeing now, 10.1 percent. Ticking up slightly from August numbers at the end of September year-over-year. As you mentioned though, Liz Truss's political life may well be on the line here. A junior cabinet minister was asked yesterday, how many chances she has left? And he said, frankly, not very many. And a new poll shows that she's dug herself a deep hole. So, I'll run you through it. The poll found that only one in five people think that the Conservative Party should keep her on as Prime Minister, 3/4 think she cannot regain the trust of the public and 2/3 think that she cannot win back the trust of the markets. This on top of polling showing that the Conservatives would be absolutely trounced by the opposition Labour Party if an election were to be held today. So, if that's the case, then the question is why hasn't her own party moved to try to boot her out already? Well, here's how the Foreign Secretary James Cleverly explained it this morning.
