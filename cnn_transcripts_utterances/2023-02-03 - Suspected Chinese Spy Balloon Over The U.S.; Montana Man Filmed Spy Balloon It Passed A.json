Of course, the question tonight is where is that exactly and when will it come down? And, by the way, how will it come down? The it, of course, a spy balloon. The Pentagon refusing to say whether they are considering shooting it down what looks like a Chinese spy balloon floating high above some pretty sensitive sites in this country. But officials telling CNN they haven't ruled it out either. Meanwhile, this balloon, which is the size, by the way, of three school buses, is just meandering along thousands of feet up in the sky. It was spotted twice on Wednesday over Montana and twice over Missouri today, including in Columbia, Missouri, this very afternoon, where this exclusive footage was shot. Now, it's flying about 60,000 feet up, about 18,000 feet higher than a commercial airplane does. And now the Pentagon says there is another Chinese spy balloon that is currently somewhere over Latin America. We will talk about what the heck is going on in the skies tonight. And here to help us figure all of this out, CNN's Tom Foreman and Military Analyst Colonel Cedric Leighton. I'm so glad to have both of you here. Let me begin with you, Tom, at the magic wall, because where has this balloon been and where is it going?",

      "sentences": "Well, if we trust what the military thinks about it, where it's been was China flying over the Aleutian Islands, coming in over Canada and then drifting down in here to Montana, where we had these sightings that you mentioned a minute ago, of course, a sensitive area because there are missile facilities up there, I used to live in South Dakota near a missile facility, and now sighted down here around Missouri. Last we heard maybe somewhere around Saint Louis. So, where is it going? That's a great question. If it's being purely pushed by the jet stream, which travels about 110 miles per hour, if that is what it's doing and if it's keeping pace with that, then you might say that if it traveled along this predicted route that it might be right now somewhere between Nashville and Louisville, Kentucky. That's just a guess on math.The math could be completely wrong. The winds can change. The speed can change. And how much the balloon is reacting to that can also change. But the idea is that if it continued on this path, it would reach the coast over here near the outer banks. Obviously, it could be further south, a little bit further north. But that's what the jet stream is tending to push. And at that speed, nine, ten hours, something like that, from where we last had a sighting of it, that is no guarantee, whatsoever, but that's where might it be now and that's where it was making its way there, Laura.",

The balloons that NASA does that like this, in terms of high performance like this, are made of polyethylene, basically no thicker than a sandwich bag. They are filled with helium typically, some of them are made to stay up for a very long time, and they can lift several thousand pounds if you are doing this and controlling it for scientific purposes.Eventually, what you would do is you would release the balloon. It would let the helium out, separate from the payload, which would drop by parachute back down to Earth. That's how you retrieve your equipment if you wanted to. That's what we know about the balloon. We know it's visible to the naked eye. Even though as you noted, it's way up there. It's high enough up around, you know, 11 miles up or so that you can see it if the lighting is just right, if it's bouncing off it just right. It's in an area where, I tell you, you can't survive, I can't survive because you are not in a pressure suit or something, way too cold, way too little oxygen but a possible threat if airplanes went through the general area, although they're, again, as you noted, much lower than that in a common sense. But when you don't know what it is and you don't know when it might start coming down, obviously, a lot of safety there. That's what we know about it. Other than that, a lot of questions about exactly what it was doing here and where it's going to wind up.",

At some point, if it continues on this path, it will no longer be above our airspace and in the control and the domain of the United States.

Is there a particular area where it could be brought down perhaps in a controlled manner where, really, to minimize any disruption to what would be on the ground? FOREMANAnd I will note, I always love having Colonel Leighton with us because he always has great insights into all of this. But when you talk about this area right here, let's say, the outer banks here, really, the part that is the territorial waters, if we put it in statute miles, it is only about 14 miles. It's not far. If you want to drop it right at that point, I have no doubt that the U.S. military could take it out of the sky right when it cleared the safety zone as long as they had no boats in the water there. But it's still a narrow band there and I don't know how you guarantee it doesn't sink when you drop it. So, the problem is there has to be, as the colonel suggested, you either have to somehow take over control of it and trigger it to do this the way it's supposed to do it, which is tricky, or you have to try to shoot it down in some fashion that either doesn't bring it down dramatically or quickly or you just take your chances and you drop it here in that little narrow band and hope that that works. Now, I will point out my finger here is making a band that is much, much, much wider than that 14 miles would be.",

And I agree. I mean, depending what's in this balloon, not the most high brow level of technology. Senator Mitt Romney did today, though, talk about TikTok. He talked about that as being a bigger source to be concerned about than a balloon. In fact, he says a big Chinese balloon in the sky and millions of Chinese TikTok balloons on our phones.

Would that solve the problem? But, yes, there is something I think that is very real. It's very new. It's a kind of cyber war or cyber intelligence that we don't quite know how to handle. And I would be all for a serious investigation into it. But, by the way, Laura, I still don't believe that these kinds of things should shut down communication between the United States and China. The secretary of state of the United States does not go to China to meet his counterparts as a favor to China. He does it in order to secure the interests of the United States, to clarify the United States' position in the world, to achieve some degree of stability and guardrails in that relationship and to preserve peace between the two largest economies in the world, and, increasingly, the two largest military powers in the world.

The very fact that it's veered so far off course tells us that it's not particularly well controlled at this point.So, I think that more than anything else this whole episode has revealed to me the degree of anxiety and insecurity, particularly on the right, where there is a kind of paranoia about what is going on in China, what the Chinese can do. And it's very troubling because, look, this is a very, very serious relationship that we need to be able to approach in a way that secures America's interest, preserves the peace, make sure that we deter China, and it doesn't help to have a kind of collective freak-out over a balloon.",

Columbus' statement for example says, after -- it's the chief, ElaineBryant -- after watching the videos released of the violent arrest of Tyre Nichols from the Memphis Police Department, I am deeply heartbroken and saddened. The actions of these former officers do not represent the standards we hold here at the Columbus Division of Police. Our officers are trained to treat every individual with dignity and humanity. We respect our community's right to voice their frustration and we will give them the space to do so peacefully.\" And talked about, \"continuing to listen and work together to build trust.\" Miami similarly did so as well. Their chief of police, Manuel Morales, also talking about the idea of wanting to show support. I wonder what your take is? DONELL HARVIN, FORMER HEAD OF INTELLIGENCE, D.C. HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT:  It's certainly tone deaf. I'll try to give some deference to these police departments. These things don't happen in a week. They probably commissioned these things months ago. But certainly, they could have pulled that back and waited for a better time. We have seen these types of wraps, emergency response vehicles for other types of months. So, breast cancer awareness and things of that nature. The problem is that I think it minimalizes particularly during Black History Month the impact and the positive type of contributions that Black History Month is supposed to represent. And so, to do that on the heels of Tyre Nichols' death I think is poor taste, it's a horrible coms issue for them and it certainly, I think sparks a conversation about rethinking what Black History Month means. Is it just wrapping in a police vehicle? Is it being prospective and looking at what contributions can be made or looking backward?

It's a lost opportunity to not talk to the community and say we want to do something special for Black History Month. We want to do something for LGBTQ awareness. We want to be good allies. What can we do?How -- if we -- you know, these cruisers probably spent $5,000, $10,000. What can we do with that money? Is there a community event that they could do to show their allyship that actually help to build a stronger bond and a stronger relationship between the community and the police officers.

Police all say that he is linked to the tampering of the langur monkey's habitat as well, but has not been charged in that incident. The zoo's president speaking this afternoon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Back with me again is wildlife biologist Jeff Corwin, host of \"Wildlife Nation.\" Jeff, I'm glad to see you this Friday night. You and I have been talking since this all began, the incident after incident after incident after incident, and now here we have a suspect who is -- has been arrested after being seen at the Dallas aquarium near animal exhibits there as well. And police believe that he may have been trying to commit another crime. What do you think is the motive or going on here? JEFF CORWIN, WILDLIFE BIOLIGISTanimals have paid such a horrible price. The great news is they've captured this gentleman and he is being held, I think, on $25,000 bail and I think he's in jail right now. There are also other crimes. So, we're looking at the state and the local crimes in Dallas. A lot of people don't realize that since the 1900s, we've had some very strict regulatory laws that are designed to protect species, especially endangered species and when they cross county lines or other states. That's known as the Lacey Act. That could come up with five years in prison and I think upwards to $100,000 in fines.",

I will say we don't have any reporting whatsoever that there is a connection to that vulture, but you raise the possibility of course of the investigation is likely ongoing, especially because the Dallas Zoo did say today that the staff is still even having somebody who is a suspect and has been arrested, they are still on high alert. And I'm wondering, I mean, if this is maybe part of a larger operation, do you foresee that one person could have been responsible for these excessive acts that we've seen so far?",

And their City Central Park Zoo officials are saying that they are trying to recapture a Eurasian eagle owl named Flaco. Apparently, he escaped last night after the stainless-steel mesh of his exhibit was cut.And this is, I mean, it's one thing for the Dallas Zoo and you see the concentration of different events happening. There was the one in Louisiana. There was the missing squirrel monkeys. And now in New York City, you mentioned the copycat aspect of this. I mean, are people becoming emboldened to see if they can try to accomplish something as well. And you've got to wonder what the end game will be in these instances as well. CORWIN:  I think there definitely is that sort of underlying component here of someone wanting to try to get away with this. We often see this with crimes like this. We see the copycat echo effect. In this case, this beautiful species, I mean, the Eurasian eagle owl is absolutely spectacular. It's as big as an eagle, even though it's an owl, hence, its name, eagle owl. The only thing that's the saving grace here, Laura, is that this is a species that can thrive. They are incredibly hearty. They survive from Siberia to north Africa. So, these vicious cold spells we're having in New England and New York, I'm confident this owl will survive these elements until they can get into a position to secure this animal, this owl, and get him back to the zoo. Again, they found that its enclosure had been vandalized, had been tampered with. One note I want to tell people, a lot of people are so worried about this eagle owl and millions of people flock, literally flock to Central Park every year to see the incredible birds that are there. If you see this owl, you want to give it space. We don't want to push it off into traffic or harm's way. Once they have this animal secure, they will grab it and put it back into its home where it belongs at the zoo. But the saving grace is that this is an owl that lives in a cold environment. So, he should survive the cold harsh conditions of the Big Apple.",

Thank you so much, Jeff Corwin.I certainly hope that this is a lesson, although, for other zoos around the area as well, but if people are trying to duplicate and be copycats, that is not just Dallas, it's not just New York, it's not just Louisiana, there has to be precautions almost in a national way.
