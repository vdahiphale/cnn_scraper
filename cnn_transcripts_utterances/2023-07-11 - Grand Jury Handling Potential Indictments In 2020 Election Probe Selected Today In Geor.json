We're going to talk to a former player, as well as one of the student reporters who broke the story, detailing the alleged hazing rituals that allegedly involved sexual coercion.Plus, one state has spent 20 billion of your tax dollars to try to fix a growing problem. But instead, the problem has gotten worse. How does that even happening? And leading this hour, there is a brand-new grand jury being empaneled that could be tasked with whether to indict Donald Trump. Twenty-six men and women in Fulton County, Georgia will now decide if the former president and his allies will be charged with trying to overturn the 2020 election and related crimes. This is in addition, of course, to the federal charges for his handling of classified documents. Those charges have already been leveled, the pending New York trial and the Storm Daniels hush money case, and then, of course, there's this potentially other special counsel indictment connected to January 6. So, where does Georgia fit in with all of that? Among other allegations, there's the now infamous Trump phone call to the Georgia secretary of state. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Jack Smith says, look, I want a speedy trial. He suggested that this should go to trial in December, which, given the complexity of this case, that would be speedy, indeed. But the Trump team has said, look, we want to raise a lot of different legal questions.You should expect a lot of litigation around this case. They want to raise questions, including whether the special counsel even has the authority to bring these charges. Questions about whether these documents were actually classified. Now, Jake, it's unlikely they're actually going to succeed on the merits of any of those questions, but those questions, even being raised and litigated, will have the effect of delaying this. And each delay gets this closer and closer to the presidential election, which raises a whole new set of constitutional questions. It is an unprecedented issue, Jake, but at this point, they're making the legal argument that, look, it's his right to raise a lot of these questions, and they also have a significant amount of discovery evidence to go through. At this point, they already have nine months of surveillance footage and hundreds of thousands of documents. And they say, you know, December is not likely that they're going to be able to do it by then. And at this point, they believe it's premature to even be able to name a date when they might be able to be ready to bring this to trial. So this is going to be a constant tension, right, the desire to move this along quickly, versus the Trump team desire to at least push this past the election. And the referee here is Trump appointed judge, Aileen Cannon, and the parties will go before her for the first time next Tuesday in a hearing that was delayed just a few days.",

But we also know from our reporting that they're still scheduling interviews with witnesses.So while all signs and all of our reporting suggest that they are nearing the end of this investigation, we also have reporting that suggests they're not quite done yet.

Tom, let's start with this argument being made by Trump and not his defense team that they don't think it would be possible for there to be a fair jury to be convened during a presidential campaign where Donald Trump is running. The question here is not if that's philosophically accurate. It's -- is it a solid legal argument that the judge might find convincing? Is it? TOM DUPREE, FORMER PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTY. GENERAL: In my judgment, Jake, no, it's not. I don't think the judge would throw this case out or postpone this case on that basis. For one thing, look, choosing a jury is going to be a challenge, no getting around it. You've got to find jurors who at least claim that they can be impartial, who don't know all the ins and outs of these cases and who haven't been following the case. But at the same time, I wouldn't go so far as to say it is impossible to select a jury during the campaign season or before the election. And even if you were to postpone this trial until after the election, I'm not sure I see how the political concerns would dissipate. People who would have difficulty adjudicating this case before the election, I think, would still have the same problem after the election.",

They may or may not be meritorious, but they would say, look, any criminal defendant is entitled to raise these, and we have a right to our day in court to careful consideration of these motions and to give us ample and adequate time to prepare these arguments.

He seems, number one, to be trying to make the point, look, Putin went into this war saying I'm going to stop Ukraine joining NATO. So, he's saying this just incentivizes Putin to keep the war going at some level, because if Ukraine can't join because there's a war, therefore keep the war going, and Ukraine will never become -- never get into NATO, there's that. And there's this other issue that Zelenskyy seemed to outline where he seems to be genuinely concerned that somehow that when there comes to this final negotiation with Russia, and let's just say it's not going -- the war is not going as well as he wants it to and he's being pressured now by his NATO partners to say, look, make a deal with Russia, end the war. His concern that there'll be some part of the negotiations at the end of the war ahead of perhaps where he and Ukrainians want it, which says look, you can come into NATO on this path but you've got to pause and stop the war here and make peace. So he seems to be really concerned about that. Or there's another administration let's say in Washington or somewhere else at NATO that drags its heels on Ukraine becoming a member of NATO.

And a reminder for viewers right now, if you or someone you care about needs any help, please call or text the Suicide and Crisis lifeline at 988, that's 988.In our Money Lead, days after Russia invaded Ukraine, more than a thousand companies pledged to stop doing business in Russia. Did they follow through? CNN's Tom Foreman takes a look at some companies that appear to be breaking that pledge and why pulling business out of Russia might be more difficult than it seems. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): When Russia marched into Ukraine, hundreds of companies from other nations announced plans to march out of Moscow, hitting Vladimir Putin's government in the pocketbook and hobbling his war effort. But one year, four and a half months after the invasion, some others are still doing brisk business in Russia, according to Yale Professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld.",
