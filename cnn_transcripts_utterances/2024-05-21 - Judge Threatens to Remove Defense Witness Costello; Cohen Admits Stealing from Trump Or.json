Just before 6 a.m. here in Washington. A live look at New York City, where this trial gets underway in just a few hours. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. The trial's end is near but not before an explosive admission from Michael Cohen and some disorder in the court. The prosecution's star witness admitting under oath that he stole tens of thousands of dollars from the Trump Organization by requesting a reimbursement far greater than the payment that he had made on the company's behalf. Trump's son, Eric, taking notice in real time with this tweet declaring, quote, \"This just got interesting.\" Cohen under redirect explaining he stole the money because his annual bonus had been slashed. He described it as \"self-help.\" And then there were the fireworks. Robert Costello, a former legal advisor to Cohen and now a Trump defense witness, was scolded, shall we say, by Judge Merchan for uttering comments under his breath and rolling his eyes during testimony. The judge clearing the courtroom and threatening to have Costello removed, warning him, \"When there's a witness on the stand, if you don't like my ruling, you don't say 'jeez.' You don't give me side eye, and you don't roll your eyes.\" To be continued. This morning, our panel's here: former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams; Republican strategist, former Trump administration official Shermichael Singleton; and former Biden White House communications director Kate Bedingfield.

Kate Bedingfield, that's a way to put it. They say that this was posted while Trump was in court yesterday. The Biden campaign said this: quote, \"Donald Trump is not playing games. He is telling America exactly what he intends to do if he regains power: rule as a dictator over a 'unified Reich.'\" Again, this is something that they reposted. The A.P. says at least one of the headlines flashing appears to be text copied verbatim from a Wikipedia entry on World War I: quote, \"German industrial strength and production had significantly increased after 1871, driven by the creation of a unified Reich.\" But this language is -- is quite specific. BEDINGFIELD: Yes, well, look, the problem here is this comes in the context of other things that Donald Trump has said along these lines. I mean, the -- you know, this is a video the campaign didn't create. It got retweeted, or whatever Donald Trump's social team calls posting it. You know, that's -- that's all well and good. But, you know, in the context of somebody like Trump, who has, you know, said that there were very fine people on both sides of a rally where, you know, people were carrying tiki -- tiki torches and chanting, \"The Jews will not replace us.\" This word in that context is incredibly -- it's incredibly upsetting, and it's very dangerous. And so I think, you know, it's less about this specific instance of using the word and more about this word in the context of these other things that Donald Trump has said, you know, from his own mouth. You can't argue -- you know, if you're the campaign, you can't argue, Oh, well, someone just accidentally reposted it, when Donald Trump is out saying it himself.
