I've talked to people on all sides of this issue. That's what we should be doing and having that constructive conversation. I know Israel is our most important ally in the region. They were attacked by Hamas on October 7th. They have every right to defend their nation, to protect their citizens, secure their borders, and rescue their hostages. That's what I'm working, too. But I'm also working as hard as anyone to get aid into Gaza and make sure there's a future -- a peaceful future for all the people region. But these protesters coming in, they're coming into intimidate. They are chanting anti-symmetric slurs. They are burning the American flag on the Fourth of July, truly un-American demonstration. Not calling for peace or calling for a better path, but calling for destruction, and really I think not doing their -- what they say -- their cause, any good. What we saw in my office on July 4th is we put posters up of the hostages shortly after the attack on October 7th. We want to show the world and the hostages that they are in our hearts. They're not forgotten. And we're doing everything we can to bring them home and bring them home as quickly as possible. The attack in my office wasn't an attack on me. It was an attack on all my constituents on the Capitol, saying we're not going to let you put that display to show solidarity. These are eight Americans are held hostage. As you said, five thought to still be alive, three that we know are dead, but their bodies are still held. There's more than 100 people being held hostage. Hamas should release them.
