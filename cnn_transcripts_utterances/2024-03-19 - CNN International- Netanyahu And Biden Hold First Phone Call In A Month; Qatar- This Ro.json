Well, Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu hold their first phone call in a month. We are live in Doha for the very latest on the ceasefire talks this hour.Plus, Hong Kong passing a controversial new national security law. What does it mean for the city's future? We'll have a full report. And CNN inside Haiti. A rare look at Port-au-Prince where people are living in fear of gangs. And you'll hear from two aid workers about their harrowing evacuation. Qatar says the current round of ceasefire and hostage release talks have now ended in Doha but adds negotiations will continue. According to Qatar's foreign ministry, a counter proposal from Israel is expected to be sent to Hamas. A pause in fighting, of course, can't come soon enough for Gaza. A new U.N.-backed report is warning of imminent famine in northern Gaza any time between now and May. The crisis is being described as entirely man made and preventable due to the widespread destruction in Gaza and throttling of aid. The White House, for its part, says Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the urgent need for aid in their first phone call in more than a month. President Biden also warned that Israel's plans for a major ground offer operation in Rafah to go after Hamas would be, in his view, a mistake. Take a listen to the National Security Adviser. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Anytime I hear an argument that says, if you don't smash into Rafah, you can't defeat Hamas. I say that is a straw man. Our view is that there are ways for Israel to prevail in this conflict to secure its long term future, to end the terror threat from Gaza and not smash into Rafah. That's what we're going to present in this integrated way when this team comes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So we're really starting to see this back and forth once again, but he says he's cautiously optimistic because the talks have resumed, the latest rounds before this here in Doha, the Israelis didn't send a delegation.

Benjamin Netanyahu has been very clear, again on Sunday, saying the offensive would happen. It was necessary. Once it starts, it would likely take several weeks.But we've heard now that he has agreed to Biden's proposal that he at least sends an Israeli delegation, a military delegation to Washington over the next few days to discuss the alternative. There is a sense within the Biden administration that there doesn't need to be this major ground offensive in Rafah. In fact, President Biden, according to his administration said he has deep concerns. They believe this operation would be catastrophic. And so they want to convince the Israeli military officials that there is a second way of making sure that they can make sure October 7th attacks do not happen again, that they can defeat Hamas and that they can secure that Israeli Gaza border without having this major ground offensive. Now, the main concerns that President Biden has at this point, according to Jake Sullivan, his national security adviser spokesperson is that they don't know where these people are going to be moved to. You've got up to 1.5 million Palestinians sheltering in this area. They also say that Rafah is the main entry point for humanitarian aid. There is woefully inadequate amounts of humanitarian aid coming in, but what is coming in is coming through Rafah and also Egypt just on the other side of the border has some serious concerns as well. Erica? [08:05:08] HILL: It'd be interesting to see what comes ultimately up that meeting, but important that that phone call did happen in that conversation. On Monday, there was also an operation launched at Al- Shifa Hospital, the largest hospital facility in Gaza. What more do we know about that?",

We know certainly from the Israeli side, they said that they did arrest some 200, what they called terrace suspects from the area itself.We know at least one of them was an Al Jazeera journalist who has since been released. But what they have been saying from within the hospital complex when we could get through is that there is still fear inside there, that one of the surgical buildings was on fire, that they couldn't get to patients who were within that building because of the intensity of that fire, saying it had four missile strikes against it from Israel. The Ministry of Health said that there were casualties, that there were wounded. We're trying to get an account of how many people may have been affected by this. But close to 30,000 people, we understand, were in this vicinity. And it's not just the wounded who, of course, it is very difficult to move. Some of them having undergone major operations. It's not just their families, the medical staff, the doctors, it is also many people who have nowhere else to go. They're displaced from other areas in Gaza, who believe that being close to a hospital would offer them some kind of protection. So we're trying to get more clarification as to exactly what happened. The Israeli military saying that they had to go in because they were Hamas operatives that were operating out of this particular area. So that was their rationale. Erica?",

Abortion could be on the ballot in Arizona and Nevada in November to an issue that the campaign believes will really galvanize voters and mobilize them to the polls, but also about protecting democracy that has been a reigning theme for the president over the course of his campaign stop. So all of this is expected to come together in these stops today to Reno, Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada, and also Phoenix, where he's also going to launch an initiative that is focused on Latinos. And, of course, Latinos do make up a sizable portion of the voters in Arizona and Nevada. And in talking to Latino organizers, what they tell me is that what needs to happen on the ground is the president essentially making the connection to voters as to what his administration has done and how voters are feeling it. That's what they say will help bolster support in a moment where there is waning support among Latino voters. But again, Erica, as you noted there at the top, the president won both of these states in 2020, but it's going to be a close race in November.

And they -- he accepted that the public needed some information, but he wasn't going to reveal it at all, he saw it as private, so they set up this plan that they'd say she was in hospital.They would give an update saying that she was well. And then they would say when they expect it to appear back at work, which is Easter and they're just not moving from that plan. I think that is the reality of their view. Of course, in the meantime, we've had these doctored pictures released. First one that you talked about was from Mother's Day.

This, of course, comes amid that surge in gang violence we've seen in recent weeks and a deepening humanitarian crisis, with communities quickly running out of food and basic necessities. The U.N. says that gangs in Haiti now control 80 percent of the capital and they're fighting to seize more. Meantime, a Florida based non-profit organization that's been working to rescue Americans says there are still a large number who remain stranded and are asking for help.One of the Americans who was evacuated from Haiti, Miriam Cinotti, best known as Doodle, joins me now. She's the social media director for Mission of Grace, and she joins me along with one of the founders of that organization, Lynn Joseph. They are both joining from the Dominican Republic. It's good to have both of you here with us. And you were both recently evacuated. You know, I wonder if you could, Doodle, walk us through a little bit of that. You had spoken with CNN about how harrowing things were getting. This journey was described, you had a plane, a boat, a bus. You had to walk on the beach on Project Dynamo, who helped with it, said it was complicated. How frightening was it? MIRIAM \"DOODLE\" CINOTTI, MISSION OF GRACE, SOCIAL MEDIA DIRECTOR: You know, it's frightening, but at the same time, when you have a chance to get out, you just do it. We -- the unknown was fearful. When we saw the size of the plane and then where we landed and then the walk to get to a boat and then the wait for a bus to come. We just have to trust the process with the trust Project Dynamo that, you know, they're going to get us out and just to save place (ph). And so that was a little -- it was a little fearful with the unknown, but, you know, we're safe, we're here. And, yes, we're just waiting for the others to come out with this.",

The second, wages are rising are finally going up. So right now, the rate of inflation in Japan is hovering at about 2 percent for its core consumer prices. That includes everything besides food and fuel. Now, 2 percent is that magic number you want to see that indicates the economy is healthy and growing in the right direction.

Its air quality was 23 times the WHO guidelines, followed by high IQAir rankings by the Indian cities of Guwahati, Delhi, and Mullanpur. The study looked specifically at fine Particulate Matter, or PM2.5, which is the tiniest pollutant, but also the most dangerous. And it's linked to asthma, heart and lung disease and cancer. In Delhi, PM 2.5 levels rose by 10 percent in 2023, with levels peaking in the month of November. Northern India struggles with smoke from crop burning, vehicle emissions, coal burning and other toxic emissions. Every year, annual crop burning pushes Delhi and neighboring areas into emergency level air quality days. People suffer from acute respiratory related issues for weeks. According to the report, millions of people die each year from air pollution related health issues. Air pollution from fossil fuels is killing 5.1 million people worldwide every year, according to a study published in the British Medical Journal in November.

For years, critically ill Palestinians have been treated in Israeli hospitals, and that continued following the terror attacks of October 7th. Now, however, Israeli officials have ordered some Palestinian patients to return to Gaza, among them cancer patients and babies.Here's CNN's Jeremy Diamond. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Little Sarah is barely six months old. Born in East Jerusalem, all she knows is the safety of this hospital room. This week, that will be torn away. War will become her new reality. I might go back and they invade Rafah, her mother Nima says. I'll be the one responsible for anything that harms them. NIMA ABU GARRARA, PALESTINIAN MOTHER (through translator): If I go back with the twins, where do I go with them? Where would I get diapers and milk? Gaza is not the same anymore. DIAMOND (voice-over): For nearly six months, these three mothers have been living, sleeping, and nursing their five babies in this hospital room together. Before the war, their high-risk pregnancies made them eligible to leave Gaza and give birth in Jerusalem hospitals. But now, they've packed their bags after learning that the Israeli government is sending them back to Gaza, where Israel's brutal military campaign has made survival a daily struggle. Hannan, the mother of twins, says she's scared of going back to Gaza without a ceasefire. There are diseases spreading, infections, she says, it's not a normal life. They will be among the 22 Palestinians set to be bussed on Wednesday to the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south. But her husband is in the north. And Hannan is still trying to find a place to live. Despite that uncertainty, Asmaa wants to return to Gaza. My daughter is there. She needs me, Asmaa says. Every time she speaks to me, she asks when I'm coming back. Every time there's an airstrike, children go to hug their mothers. Mine has no one to hug. At nearby Augusta Victoria Hospital, nearly 50 Gazan cancer patients have been receiving treatment since before October 7th. Watching from afar as their families endure the horrors of war. For Mohammed, one of the 10 who are in remission and being sent back to Gaza, being far away from his son Hamza, who is blind, has been the hardest to bear. But going back is also terrifying. I'm torn, he says. The only wish I have in life is to go back home. I regret even coming here for treatment. I wish I could be with them, because I know how they need me. In a statement, the Israeli agency in charge of their returns said patients who have received medical treatment and who are not in need of further medical care are returned to the Gaza Strip. After more than two months of pushing back on Israeli demands, Dr. Fadi Atrash says he was ordered to compile a list of patients to be sent back to Gaza this week. DR. FADI ATRASH, CEO, AUGUSTA VICTORIA HOSPITAL: We don't want to send them back. It's not our call at the end of the day. DIAMOND (voice-over): Now he fears for his patients.",
