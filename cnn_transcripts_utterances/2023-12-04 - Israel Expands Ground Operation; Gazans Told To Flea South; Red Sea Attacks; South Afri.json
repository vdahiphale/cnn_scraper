But you know, poor internet and communications in Gaza means it's unclear if those warnings are getting through.

He made the comments November 21st at a climate panel event. He said phasing out fossil fuels was inevitable, but that the world needs to be pragmatic about it, suggesting the shift could negatively impact global economies. While some countries at COP 28 are calling for a fossil fuel phase out, others want a phase down, which was weak language though the head of one climate advocacy advocacy group says Al Jaber's statements raised deep concerns over his ability to lead UN climate talks. It's finance day at the COP 28 Climate Summit that means more financial discussions and the potential for climate action and disaster support funding to be announced in the coming hours.

But the United States is only 14% of the world's emissions. So equally good news is that 50 major oil companies announced that they are pledging to within just five years by 2030 reduce their emissions by 80% to 90%. With accountability built in their measuring and monitoring will have to go to an independent third party, international agency. And beyond that, the Environmental Defense Fund is launching early in the new year, a satellite called methane sack that is able to look at their emissions multiple times per week. And that will -- the information will be posted on the web, every human on the planet will be able to see if these pledges are made, because we can't count on it without robust accountability.

But keep in mind that before October 7th almost 500 trucks made it into the Gaza Strip every day. Right now, the U.N. estimate is that they would need it least 200 trucks coming in every day, for two months continuous to meet the needs of the people there. But that is not what is coming in. And for a lot of people across the Strip, they are out of options with the fear that nowhere is safe for them. Listen to this man who is completely appears to be out of options. RAFIK AL-REKEB, DISPLACED RESIDENT: Provide means, grant the people tents, and designate actual safe areas. The safe areas should be equipped with all necessities. But simply indicating that some areas are safe, where are these safe areas? There aren't any safe areas in Gaza. Am I supposed to sleep on the streets with my children in the rain in this designated safe area?",

But what remains unclear, is whether that could even be done in the immediate future, as those talks between Israel and Hamas have completely broken down.Now those talks broke down due to differences of opinion when it came to the release of female hostages. Israel, insisting that Hamas still has more female hostages to release while Hamas was arguing that these women who are being held, should be considered as IDF reservist, something that Israel and the U.S. have both very forcefully pushed back upon. A senior administration official saying that the onus is on Hamas to live up to the terms of the deal and release all of the women they have without delay. But the U.S. even as these talks between Israel and Hamas have completely collapse, the U.S. is still remaining in contact with their counterparts in the region, trying to get people back to the negotiating table. The special envoy for hostage affairs Roger Carstens met over the weekend with his Israeli counterpart in Israel. And then Vice President Kamala Harris on the sidelines of a climate summit in Dubai had phone calls and meetings with Arab leaders including the Emir of Qatar, as well as the Egyptian president. And in those conversations she once again stressed the need to try to get these hostages out.

The Israeli military say that they also used warplanes on Sunday to strike suspected Hezbollah targets. The Israeli military said an anti- tank missile hit one of its vehicles on Sunday, likely wounding some of its soldiers and damaging that vehicle. Now this conflict has not been as intense as the fighting and the extreme civilian death toll in that Palestinian enclave of Gaza but it has been deadly here. More than 100 people killed thus far, most of them Hezbollah fighters but also more than a dozen civilians as well as several journalists. When Hezbollah carries out strikes against Israeli military targets, it says, it is quote, \"in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. And in support of their valiant and honorable resistance\". Neither the Israeli military nor Hezbollah are using their most powerful weapons yet.

We have significantly degraded their enemy capabilities. As the reports have stated before, we have destroyed quite a lot of underground infrastructure, tunnels and shafts, more than 500 of them. And we've taken out a lot of combatants from the battlefield. What I think we need to do and to make very clear is that until we get all of the Hamas battalion strongholds, and until we work on them and take them off the battlefield, there will be active fighting. And we said from the beginning to Israeli civilians and to anybody listening in the world that this unfortunately will take time. It won't be a quick and easy operation.

The Houthis have claimed responsible for attacking Israeli commercial vessels in the Red Sea and said it launched ballistic missiles into Israel itself. The U.S. deployed two carrier strike groups to the region in an effort to deter Iran and its proxy groups from expanding the conflict.

It's land that Venezuela has long laid claim to but the borders of which were set back in 1899 by an international tribunal. So of course, leaders in Guyana very concerned in the run up to this election calling it an existential threat and an attempted annexation. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro for his part had been campaigning on the issue for several weeks calling it an opportunity for Venezuelans to reclaim a part of the country that, he says was essentially stolen from them by colonial powers back in the 19th century. Now, voters were asked five questions and in preliminary results released by the country's National Election Authority on Sunday evening voters overwhelmingly supported the initiative voting more than 95 percent of the time, yes in those five questions. Now of course this is Venezuela, it's an authoritarian country with no independent election monitors present at the ballot box on Sunday. So these results have to be taken with the large grain of salt. Now analysts say do not expect an invasion of Guyana anytime soon and that's because if Nicolas Maduro were to actually try to create this state within Venezuela it would likely have to involve the use of armed troops to move in to Guyana. And that's not something that he has any support for from even his closest allies. Still it has raised the threat level considerably in the region. Brazil which shares a border with the region sending some troops up last week. And the U.S. actually sending some senior military leaders down to Guyana in recent days in a bit of a show of support for that country. Now Guyanese leaders calling it, as I said, an existential threat to their country and the vice president there, in recent days actually invoking Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine saying that all the options are on the table when considering how to deal with this threat.
