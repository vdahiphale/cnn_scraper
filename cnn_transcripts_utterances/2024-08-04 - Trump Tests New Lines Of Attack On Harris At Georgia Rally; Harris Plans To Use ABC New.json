And that's something that we're actually continuously going to hear from Donald Trump's campaign. I'm told when I talk to seniors -- senior advisers, they say that's a new line of attack. That they want to try and paint her as someone who is fake. And he said that last night as well, that she's fake, fake, fake, and I will fight, fight, fight for you. It's a line we've heard Donald Trump use before. He's going to continue to use that. What I also found interesting was at one point, just talking about the performers, he actually tied Harris to Hillary Clinton. And this is kind of what we're seeing now. Donald Trump has really reverted back to his 2016 playbook. His attacks have become nastier. He's now has another woman that he's facing off with. And we're seeing kind of the same parallels from then now creep into this current campaign. And he argued that Clinton had Bruce Springsteen perform for her back up in the lead up to 2016. He said that was phony as well. He also made a comment that he has a, quote, \"bad trait,\" which is that he only likes people who like him.

There could be friendlier moderators toward him. Harris is team for the -- their part, though, is saying that, look, you had already agreed to this September 10th debate with ABC News. That is the debate that we will be showing up to. She's also indicated herself and her team said this as well, that regardless of whether or not Donald Trump shows up, she plans to use that time herself. But, you know, Trump has been saying, and his advisers have said this as well, which is that, you know, their agreement to go to that ABC debate on September 10th was with Joe Biden, not with Harris. And so he has no obligation to show up. But what I found fascinating is taking a step back, you're seeing both sides now attack the other. Trump is saying Harris is too afraid to show up to a Fox News debate. Harris's team is really pointing to his past line of, I will debate you anytime, anywhere, any place.

We are also watching as multiple airlines are canceling flights into and out of Tel Aviv as well as Beirut's airport as well. Last night, we witnessed the latest barrage of rocket fire from Hezbollah directed at northern Israel. Approximately 30 projectiles were identified by the Israeli military crossing into northern Israel. At least one of those struck the town of Beit Hillel in the north. But that was not the retaliation that we are waiting for from Hezbollah to the killing of Hezbollah's senior-most military commander earlier in the week. Instead, this seems to be simply a continuation of that cross-border exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah that have gone on since October 8th, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel. What we are bracing for right now is going to be something much larger, much more significant and potentially much more devastating. We recall that the last time Iran carried out a direct attack on Israel was in April, and now this region is bracing for something similar, perhaps even something larger in scale. As all of this is happening, the Israeli prime minister is set to hold a security assessment later this evening at the Kiryat in Tel Aviv, Israel's military and defense headquarters. And he is also vowing that Israel will exact, a quote, \"heavy price for any act of aggression against us.\" But all of this is happening as Israel's security chiefs appear to be increasingly turning against the Israeli prime minister, accusing him in private meetings, according to Israeli media, of not actually being serious about reaching a ceasefire and hostage deal.

In past years, it was always sort of a routinely given an exception, you know, the legislature passed an exception to the law. Nobody heard about it. Nobody cared about it.This year, the Republicans in Ohio got into a little bit of a fight over this, and they were at each other's throats and they didn't pass it until very late, after the governor had said, look, I'm going to call you into special session to do this. Along the way, the Republican MAGA party especially started to threaten lawsuits and this and that and the other thing to keep the Democratic candidate off the ballot. And so, with all this confusion going on, the party decided, you know what, the safest thing would be to nominate our candidate officially before August the 7th. And so, we gave authority, those of us on the Rules Committee, to do this. And right now, there's an electronic vote going on. I cast my ballot on Friday. The ballots came out on Thursday. I cast my ballot on Friday, and we are voting the roll call vote that you usually see on the floor of the convention. We're voting it right now.

That is what Katie Ledecky said dubbed it anyway, and rightly so, after claiming a fourth straight Olympic gold medal in the event here in Paris on Saturday. Incredibly, on the same date, she won her first all the way back in London in 2012.I was there watching on last night, actually in 2012 as well. It was awesome to see her again in action. The power and the speed holding off Australia's Ariarne Titmus to join the great Michael Phelps as the only athletes, male or female, to have claimed gold in the same event at four straight games. It's her 14th Olympic medal overall. So, what does she plan to do next? Well, apparently, some ping pong, a visit to her grandma, and take a breather. And why not? I think she absolutely deserves it. Over in the Athletics Stadium with the rain pouring and historic run and night for St. Lucia, a first ever Olympic medal of any color in any sport for them and Julien Alfred, and what a medal. The women's 100 meters. The world indoor 60 meters champion who's talked about how she used to run barefoot in her school uniform at a rundown track who lost her father the age of 12, moved to Jamaica on her own at the age of 14 to chase her dreams. She took the biggest prize of all. Look at what it meant. She finished ahead of Sha'carri Richardson who took silver. And Noah Lyles will be hoping he can get things back on track for Team USA in the men's race a few hours from now. No surprises. Guess who took the gold in the gymnastics women's vault? Of course, she did. Simone Biles reigning supreme once again, displaying just a superior level of difficulty to the others and nailing it to take victory ahead of Brazil's Rebeca Andrade and U.S. teammate Jade Carey. So, it's three golds down, potentially still two more to go for her. And how about this for exciting news? She is not ruling out sticking around for the next games in L.A. in 2028.
