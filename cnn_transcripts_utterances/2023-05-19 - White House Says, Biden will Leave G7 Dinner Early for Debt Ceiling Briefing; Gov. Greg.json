We're now learning also this morning that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is also going to Japan to meet face-to-face with President Biden and the other G7 leaders. Sources tell CNN he's going to arrive Saturday evening and meet with them on Sunday. Just this morning, the G7 leaders put out a statement vowing to support Russia -- vowing to support Ukraine against Russia's brutal invasion for, quote, as long as it takes. And we're told a big topic of discussion will be whether or not to send those F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine's Air Force to potentially help them turn the tide in this war.

Thank you so much for being here. Obviously, the F-16s is something we've been talking about for so long. Whether or not they are going to be able to get them, develop this air superiority, Ukraine has not been able to do so far. But the pushback we've heard from the U.S. has been it takes so long to train the Ukrainian forces on these F-16s. What's the sense of how it could help though? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, that's a great question, Kaitlan. So, let's take a look at the F-16, because what you're looking at here is a very versatile aircraft. And, you know, when you see what it can do, I mean, it can fly at 1,500 miles per hour. It uses what are known as radiation detections to target air defense systems. So, this is very important, because what it's going to be able to do is it's going to be able to go after Russian air defense areas, such as the S-300, the missile system that is there, the S-400, potentially, but those are also dangerous weapons for this kind of aircraft. It is not a stealth fighter. It has a 20 millimeter gun. It is basically an air-to-air and an air-to-ground combat platform. And that is a main reason because of its versatility that the Ukrainians want this aircraft.",

So, these countries are critical for this.One country that has made that transition very effectively from Soviet-era fighters to the F-16 is Poland. Another one is Romania. So, these two countries would be the most likely ones to help with that transition because they're also interested in getting newer generation fighters that are even newer than the F-16 and this will be one way to do that, provided their F-16s to Ukraine and then to -- for the Ukrainians -- be able to use them against Russian targets.",

The city of Denver saying they received a bus of 41 migrants yesterday. Texas Governor Greg Abbott writing, quote, until the president and his administration step up to fulfill their constitutional duty to secure the border in the state of Texas, will continue to bus migrants to self-declared sanctuary cities, like Denver, to provide much needed relief to our smaller border towns. Now, Texas has previously bussed migrants to Washington, D.C., New York, Chicago and Philadelphia. And here in New York, New York City Mayor Eric Adams says the city is bracing for the arrival of 15 more buses carrying asylum seekers in just the next few days. A new arrival center opens today with hundreds of rooms held for those migrants at the Roosevelt Hotel. It is the ninth humanitarian emergency response and relief center in the city.Our Polo Sandoval is live in New York outside of that hotel and migrant arrival center.

And for important perspective here, that drop in migrant apprehensions that we witnessed along the southern border just about a week ago, that is not translated to any sort of relief in terms of what the city has been doing to try to keep up with the number of asylum seekers arriving in New York City. In fact, that number has only surged.There are two city council source that's were invited to participate in a closed door meeting with the Adams administration tell me that that number now has increased to close to 600. That is a dramatic increase over the 200 to 300 that were arriving here just a couple of weeks here. Mayor Adams sharing with the city council that he expects at least 15 buss to arrive in New York City from Texas in the coming days. We saw one such bus arrive at Port Authority just a few moments ago. The migrant families aboard that bus transferred on to an MTA bus that came to this welcome center that was just opened up today. In fact, we may have some footage to show you. It shows some of these families now. This is that welcome center that the city has been working to open this. Basically, the main hub where many of these asylum seekers had come in from the southern border will make their first stop in some cases, especially those families with children, will potentially be able to shelter here. As for those migrants that do not have children, they will likely end up in more common spaces in terms of the shelter system. But, really, what we have is the city trying to still keep up with the demand as they expect these numbers to continue to rise. There is a possibility that we could see them drop eventually. But that, at this point, is not the case, as the city continues to, again, keep up with shelter needs. Now, finally, I can tell that you that the city continues to ask city officials throughout the region to look for other options, and for now, this is going to be one of the solutions to housing here in addition to well over 100 shelters that have opened up.",
