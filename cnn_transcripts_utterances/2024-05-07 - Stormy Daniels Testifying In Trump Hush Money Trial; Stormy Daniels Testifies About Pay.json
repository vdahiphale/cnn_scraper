      "sentences": "And welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.It has been the most compelling day so far in Donald Trump's criminal hush money cover up trial, because for the very first time today, we heard testimony from Stormy Daniels who's alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump is at the very heart of this case. Remember, the rendezvous itself was not a crime, not in Nevada, and nor would be any alleged hush money payments tough to Stormy Daniels. The crime according to the New York district attorney is the falsifying a business records that were used to conceal the payments to keep Stormy Daniels from telling her story publicly in the days leading up to the 2016 election. But today, Stormy Daniels told her story under oath, explaining how she met Trump at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. Then, got a dinner invite where the meeting location turned out to be Trump's hotel room. Mr. Trump allegedly greeted her at the door in satin pajamas and to spare you the details that she revealed in court, we'll just say one thing led to another, another being the alleged sexual encounter. But the defense took major issue with much of the explicit content and moved for a mistrial, saying that all those details that she had been told that the prosecution and Stormy Daniels have been cautioned not -- not to tell had nothing to do with the case itself. And the defense attorney said that her testimony had gone over the guardrails that the court had set. Judge Juan Merchan has denied the motion for mistrial. Stormy Daniels right now is being questioned by Trump's attorneys. Let's get straight to CNN's Kaitlan Collins. Kaitlan, you were inside the courtroom all morning. What were those moments like in the room as Stormy Daniels testified, especially about some of the details that the judge had cautioned the prosecution from steering away -- to steer away from?",

And that was what it was just the prosecution questioning Stormy Daniels, that was before the cross-examination started that's happening right now, but it was kind of this moment in the courtroom where there was actually another witness who testified before Stormy Daniels got on the stand talking about Trump's books and quotes from him, of how frugal he was, and how involved he was in his business.No one even remembers that because, of course, everyone at that point understood the Stormy Daniels was going to be the next witness on the stand and she testified that she had not seen Donald Trump's since 2007. So it's been 17 years and now here they are coming face-to-face inside this courtroom as she walked behind him at the defense table and took the stand, and then about 10 or 15 minutes into her testimony, the prosecutor asked her to stand up and identified Donald Trump. And she kind of had to lift up out of her chair. She pointed to him, noted that he was wearing this navy blue jacket, but -- Jake, I mean, it was just remarkable to see how Trump was reacting as Stormy Daniels was testifying. And as you noted, going into those explicit details about how they met. You know, he was kind of grimacing at points when she talked about what he said about Melania Trump. The only time she was brought up that he noted to her that she said they did not even sleep in the same bedroom. He had a scowl on his face for most of the time. But he was paying attention, Jake. There was a period for a sustained amount of time where he was closing his eyes like we've seen in other instances, as this travel has been going on, he was paying very close attention. At one point, that seemed to be now in denials when she was telling stories about that night they met, but certainly paying attention, Jake.",

Stormy Daniels said, yes, absolutely, he existed. Necheles said, is the story made up? Stormy Daniels said none of it is made up. And the court is taking a brief afternoon break.I wonder, Kaitlan, if you could describe Stormy Daniels' demeanor. Do you think she came across as credible from the excerpts we were given from inside the courtroom, it sounded like she tried to make some jokes, even X-rated jokes at least once and they didn't seem to go over particularly well with the jury.

And obviously causing the defense to move for a mistrial, which was denied, but who knows what will happen on appeal, assuming Mr. Trump is found guilty, which is far from a forgone conclusion.

He was noticeably uncomfortable as she was going into some of the details.Really, it was Stormy Daniels's prerogative here though. I mean, the prosecution was asking her pretty open-ended questions. Tell us about that interaction with Trump or explain what the two of you talked about there and she would take those opportunities to go into intense detail. I mean, it was incredibly detailed. I'll say that Jake and so there was a question where the judge was there was intense moment, a few moments where they were asking her if she was going into this really uncomfortable detail. You could see Trump in his attorneys talking he was passing notes to them. Finally, Susan Necheles, his attorneys started objecting repeatedly and instead of doing what he has been doing through a lot of this trial where the judges rejected their objections. He was sustaining them. He was going along with them and he took a moment to say something to them and to ask after the brief morning break to ask the prosecution to make sure that they were keeping her to answer just directly what is at the heart of this case, clearly did not want it going out. And then of course that is what Trump's team was complaining about, Jake, when they got back in the room. CNN's Paula Reid has been watching all of this and reading all of these updates with us.

They've gotten Stormy Daniels to concede she hates Trump. That she said that she would dance if he went to jail. They have pointed to the fact that she has said she will never pay him hundreds of thousands of dollars that she owes him. They've effectively undercut her credibility by getting her to talk about conversation she had that at pitching her with her own book.

You know, what we were just saying, though, is that -- look, I think the biggest test for Trump going forward for the next slide, 45 minutes, is what he's going to do when he comes out because that's usually when he unloads on his frustrations for the day. I think like the most significant legal threat that she poses to Trump right now is that he's going to go off the rails because he's frustrated and violate the gag order. And the judge might have to make good on his threat to send them in jail. I think if he can keep it together for the next 48 hours, however long Stormy Daniels is on the stand, that would really be an accomplishment because this is a test for him.",

But right now, the defense has been pointing out the fact that Stormy Daniels has refused to pay legal fees she owes Donald Trump. He sued her, right, for defamation, something like that, and at what point the defense attorney says to Daniels -- let's bring this quote up -- you hate Donald Trump. Stormy Daniels says yes. The attorney says you want him to go to jail. Stormy Daniels says, I want him to be held accountable. The defense attorney, you want him to go to jail. Stormy Daniels says, if he's found guilty? Yes.

The idea being that if you can show she harbors massive personal resentment against Donald Trump, which she clearly does, that potentially would undermine her overall credibility in the eyes of the jury. That she's not calling it as she sees it, that she has a bias, that she has an agenda here, that she's trying to accomplish.I will say this. I thought the way the prosecution handled her direct examination this morning in my judgment, it went too far. I think the prosecutors made a mistake in diving into the details, the salacious details. They turn the proceedings this morning into kind of a not safe for work event, and they didn't need to. This is a case about alleged fraudulent business recording, about, you know, how they characterize these payments, what she testified today has no relevance to any of that. And I think the jury very well could say this is going a little too far. Did we really need to hear all of this? What is the prosecution thinking and putting all of this stuff in before the jury?

And that seems annoyed him because that's a very -- that's a very electrifying allegation, doesn't seem to be one she's willing to stand behind. It should not have come out.I will say her testimony about the relationship, it is relevant. It became relevant when Trump denied that the encounter occurred and it became doubly relevant when his lawyers opened on that, when they said that this never occurred.

Necheles is saying and basically questioning Stormy Daniels' ability to tell the truth given the financial stakes. You are looking to extort money from President Trump, Nicholas asks. False, Daniel says, raising her voice. This has to do with the fact that Necheles is questioning whether or not Stormy Daniels was actually threatened by someone who told her to keep her mouth shut. This is a story that Stormy Daniels told Anderson Cooper in 2018, I believe, also said on the stand under oath today, and I think is at the heart of when Donald Trump sued her for defamation. There is no evidence that of anybody threatening her, which is not to say it didn't happen, just to say she did not report it to the police and there's no evidence of it. Necheles returns back to the story from 2011 actually, asking whether she authorized Keith Davidson to have the story taken down. All I know is I wanted it down she said, I was much braver person in 2016 than I was in 2011. A lot of this back-and-forth about whether or not she has been honest in her testimony before Stormy Daniels testified today, Kristen Holmes, the prosecution spent some time introducing excerpts from two of Donald Trump's books, and they were trying to get the heart of Donald Trump's character. Let's read some related to his business dealings. One, as I said before, I always sign my checks, so I know where my money is going. I don't know if were going to put up that, this -- the graphic. And, also pay attention to the small numbers in your finances such as percentages and cents, numbers that seemed trivial add up and have enormous implications.

Could Donald Trump had actually been in charge? We saw one of the records keepers they had yesterday asking questions. Do you actually know what happened once Donald Trump received the FedEx of the check? She said, no, I just know that it got signed and sent back to me. I just received it.

The truth is you saw that opportunity to make money, Necheles says. Susan Necheles is Trump's attorney. I saw the opportunity to get the story out. Stormy Daniels says, I didn't put a price tag on it. The jury is now seeing some texts between Daniels' manager at the time, a woman named Gina Rodriguez, and Dylan Howard who was the editor in chief of the \"National Enquirer\".

No, he's slightly leading in national polling averages, but he's trailing in a good number of polls, especially those that have come out in the last week or so. There are at least a few. He refers frequently to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, the prosecutor behind this case, as a Soros-backed district attorney. Now, I'd say there's some arguable basis for that, but I think it's important to clarify the facts. So Mr. Soros, who's a liberal billionaire philanthropists, also a frequent target of antisemitic conspiracy theories, did not make any direct contributions to Mr. Bragg's election campaign. He also says he's never spoken once to Mr. Bragg. What did happen was he donated to a liberal PAC that then in turn donated to Mr. Bragg's campaign, as well as other reform minded prosecutors. So this is at best a one-step or move relationship. And lastly, Jake, I think its important Mr. Trump keeps invoking Germany before World War II as an example of what inflation can do to a country -- well, we had March inflation in this country of 3.5 percent, certainly higher than its been in recent years. But when we talk about, you know, pre-World War II Germany in the 1920s, we're talking about 500, 700 percent.

Although we should note this afternoon, Mr. Trump abided by it and did not criticize the witness, Stormy Daniels, no matter how much he may have wanted to. But he has previously said, I think it was yesterday. He said that he would go to prison for the First Amendment, meaning he wants to be able to speak his mind and he'd be willing to go to jail for that.
