      "sentences": "I mean, there has always been, Rahel, somewhat of a difference in what his advisors encouraged him to do and what Donald Trump does, and part of that is because he is very unpredictable. He always has been. And often, people who know him best argue that he is a 78-year- old man. He is not going to change. He is going to do what he wants to do. But, at times, his campaign, which has been pretty disciplined, has been really trying to convince him to stick to the themes that they think are working, and one of those themes as well, what I'll say here is, a lot of the times, we talk about Donald Trump's rhetoric all the time, the rhetoric that I just mentioned about whether it was relating to the press or how he shouldn't have left the White House that he made yesterday.That is the type of rhetoric when I'm -- particularly in recent days, when I've been talking to Trump advisors, that they say that women do not like. We know that Donald Trump currently has a problem with the gender gap, that women are favoring Kamala Harris more than they are Donald Trump. On the flip side, I will say men are favoring Donald Trump more than they are favoring Harris. But, part of the reason when I talk to Trump's team that they think women go for Harris more is because they acknowledge that they don't actually like Donald Trump's rhetoric, but they do think that they should be able to like him and vote for him on the policies. And that's why that push to really keep him on message is so important, particularly as we analyze this early voting data, which his team is also analyzing very closely, and you've seen that women are outpacing men. Unclear if that's going to be the case tomorrow for in-person voting. But, that's part of why this idea of staying on message has been such a touching point between Trump and his advisors.",

You can't imagine an easier path for her than through Pennsylvania, if she is to win, and her schedule today very much reflects that. She'll start the day in Scranton, that's obviously President Biden's hometown, and she'll be talking with canvassers, those volunteers who are out doing the hard work of knocking on doors and trying to get her voters to the polls, then heads on to Allentown. The campaign is emphasizing the heavy Latino population in that area of Pennsylvania, trying to consolidate support in that group.She'll also be in Reading. She'll be campaigning with the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which is interesting. She is one of the most progressive members of Congress. We've also seen this cycle, Kamala Harris campaigning with Liz Cheney. So, you do get the sense of the range of the voters that she is trying to reach. Then it's on to big campaign rallies in Pittsburgh. And then finally tonight at 11:00 p.m., literally the 11th hour, she'll be doing her final campaign rally in Philadelphia. She'll have Oprah there. She'll have Lady Gaga, a host of celebrities to cap off this campaign, which really only began 106 days ago. That's when President Biden dropped out of the race. This has been an extraordinarily abbreviated campaign for the Vice President, and it's interesting to see what her message is in the final day, you mentioned last night, she didn't mention Donald Trump at all, which, after a campaign that has been so focused on drawing this contrast, trying to sharpen her attacks on Trump is notable. She essentially believes that the time to litigate Trump's rhetoric, his character, his record, is over, and now is the time to really consolidate support among these various constituencies as she heads into Election Day.",

We are joined by Democratic Strategist Chuck Rocha, good to see you, a senior advisor for Bernie Sanders presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020, and May Mailman, a former Trump White House Associate Counsel. She is also the Vice President of the group \"Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections.\" Great to see you both. I want to start with this poll, Chuck, in Iowa, Iowa not exactly a battleground, usually reliably red, not expected to be a competitive state, or it wasn't expected to be, and yet, you have this Des Moines Register poll shows no clear leader, but Harris up three percentage points. Chuck, what do you make of that? CHUCK ROCHA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, &amp; FMR. SR. ADVISOR, BERNIE SANDERS 2016 &amp; 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS: I've done a lot of work in Iowa. I was really flat. It's got a lot of corn, and it has a lot of white people. Keep that in mind when I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you. Now, Ann is this standard of the industry. She does really good polling. This poll before Biden got out of the election, showed Trump up 11. And then after Trump got out of the race about three months ago, it showed the Vice President closing the gap, where she had made up like six points and was down only four or five. And then what this shows today, or what it showed a couple days ago when it came out, was what a lot of us, Democratic strategists, thought we were seeing in a lot of the numbers, which you can't prove, which is like this silent woman vote. We know that Democratic women are voting overwhelmingly for Harris but what we didn't know were the independents and Republicans. The only way this poll can be anywhere near right and track in the right way is for her to be overperforming with those two electrics that we were planning on but couldn't prove. This poll really proves that if you dig into the cross tabs.",

This is, I think, why people are frustrated with the media oftentimes, is because Trump is just having a conversation and talking the way a lot of people talk, and it is treated as a five-alarm fire.

OF POLITICAL SCIENCE: Well, it certainly matters, because the overall direction of the election will be determined by how much people are voting one way or another. It's just that it's filtered through this Electoral College system. So, there are instances, just as recently as 2016 where the person who won the popular vote was not the Electoral College winner.",

It would take over a month to travel by boat. There was no road. And so, each state was -- that would become a state was, each had its own political culture and way of doing things.And so, when the founding fathers were trying to devise a national way of running our elections, they couldn't come to agreement, because all the states had different ways in which they did their own elections. And so, the states -- the founding fathers just sort of punted everything back to the states. They did this on how they run their elections, and that's really important as we understand like early voting going on in different places, and how the votes are being counted. That varies according to state laws. But, it also mattered for the Electoral College, because the founders wanted to balance out the power of the states versus the federal government.

Lots of other places within the country that are off the battleground, well, they lean one way or the other very heavily. And so, we know with a great degree of confidence how those states are going to play out. So, the campaigns focus their attention, the voters focus their attention, and of course, the news media focus their attention on these critical battleground states. So, we know turnout is going to be higher there because of higher interest.But then, how do we figure out like how high the turnout is going to be versus past elections? Then we start looking for other clues, and one of the clues that we have available to us is the early vote. We've had over 78 million people vote so far in this election. And that's a good clip. It wasn't as high as the pandemic, when lots of people were voting by mail in 2020, but it's still a good clip. So, we can kind of use that as some indicators of what's going to happen. But, we've had some wrenches thrown into the works this time around. One is that what we have fewer mail ballots because of the pandemic, but the other is that Republicans are voting in-person earlier at larger numbers than they have in any previous election, and that's largely due to Trump, who, as you've noted earlier, likes to say that there is vote fraud. Well, he was saying all early voting is fraudulent, but this election cycle, he said maybe that in-person early voting, that's OK. And so, his supporters have been listening to them.

Right there is anxiety. There is anticipation. There is definitely excitement as well. But, I think the bipartisan thing mostly is for those ads and just the chaos of this campaign perhaps to stop.But, again, if you need to know how seriously these two candidates are taking Pennsylvania, all you have to do is look at where they're spending their time on election eve, probably the most important day of the entire campaign cycle. Vice President Harris is going to be here. She was earlier in Scranton, going to be in Allentown, going to be in Reading. Then she is going to have a huge rally in Pittsburgh, and then close out her entire campaign in Philadelphia on the Ben Franklin Parkway later this evening. Meanwhile, Trump, former President Trump, also going to be in Reading today, also going to be in Pittsburgh today. That just shows you how crucial the campaigns feel this battleground state, this Commonwealth really, really is. It is nine million voters up for grabs here, Rahel. 3.9 million Democrats, 3.7 million Republicans, about 1.1 million no affiliation in this state. That's what this tug of war is about. And listen, we've talked about perhaps all of the counties that viewers will know. We've talked about the Philadelphia suburban counties, Bucks County, one of those purple states, Erie, Northampton counties on the opposite ends of the states. Those are the main bellwethers. I'm here in Lancaster County, though, and the reason that I'm here and looking at this particular county is this is the largest red county in the entire state. So, this is a county that former President Trump is expected to win. But, I'm particularly looking at the margin that Democrats might be able to get. If they can crack that 41 percent, maybe get 42 percent, 43 percent, this could be a bit of an early indicator of where this Commonwealth is heading. So, again, when it comes to mood, like you know, you're from here, it's all over the place right now, because it's game time.",

For those who remember, four years ago, there was a lot of sort of drama in Pennsylvania four years ago. It took days to ultimately call the race.

That particular sound from former President Trump is fascinating, because he was complaining about extending hours. It was the RNC and the Trump campaign that sued Bucks County last week to extend the days and hours that folks could apply for these on-demand mail-in balloting. So, again, a bit of a mixed messaging, to say the least, when it comes from the campaign of the RNC and what former President Donald Trump was saying on the stump over the weekend.Listen, former President Trump has continued talking about accusations of fraud, continuing to stoke those particular fears. Here is what I'll say, is that elections, people from the top of the state to the county levels, they're saying they're investigating if there are any problems, but as of now, in their perspective, the system is working, and that's what they want voters to remember as we go into tomorrow.
