Most of the G20 members wrapped up their meeting earlierby strongly condemning Russia's war in Ukraine. Indonesia's leader says in his words, the most debated section of the Joint Declaration was on the conflict in Ukraine. The G20 also focused on what it calls the immense human suffering that the war is inflicting on people in Ukraine. And we have a team of correspondents covering this story. Our Sam Kiley is in Ukraine. Melissa Bell is at NATO Headquarters in Brussels. Good to have you with us. Let's start with you first, Sam.

So it's been updated since then, but it's a leftover piece of technology, from the old days, effectively not a piece of very sophisticated modern weaponry. They used it yesterday to good effect around Lviv alongside no doubt other, NATO supplied weaponry to take down 10 of the 13 missiles that the Russians fired just against that city among some 85 or more cruise missiles that were fired in a storm attack right across the country by Russia yesterday. Now it would appear that the Ukrainians are beginning to accept. In fact, they're openly accepting that there is a Ukrainian anti-missile system that landed in Poland, it's not yet clear whether or not it made contact with an incoming Russian missile or whether it was fired at a Russian missile and missed. These systems are largely automated. But Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary Austin, all of Ukraine's allies and the Ukrainian Government is making the emphatic point that the original blame for this incident rests not with Ukraine, but with Russia, because of the illegal war, but also because of the very substantial use of these missiles. And inevitably, when you're defending a country that Ukrainians are saying, that is right adjacent to another country, these sorts of accidents can happen and the subtext of this of course, being boosted really coming out of NATO and statements by Secretary Austin, suggesting that there is an imperative now to get more sophisticated anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems into Ukraine that have been increased recently. But the more sophisticated weaponry that gets in, the less there is a chance, perhaps of these sorts of accidents.",

We didn't know where did come from, or what certain - what circumstances that had been fired. And, of course, the huge worry, and the reason there was such tension here is that it would or it could, and Poland was certainly suggesting that it would seek to invoke Article IV, which is the beginning of the consultations that can then allow for Article V to be invoked or not. So it would have been a substantial step. And that was where we were this morning. It was at the end of that meeting that Jen Stoltenberg made those remarks explaining what we now believe to have been that case - the case that preliminary analysis and of course, that changes everything, it changed the tone, and immediately calmed things down. In fact, the speech that followed from Jen Stoltenberg was all about the fact that what was needed right now was calm and coordinated action, there was no escalation of the rhetoric, there was no announcement of a beefing up of, of military means or equipment or personnel on the Eastern Flank of NATO. It was very much about route, taking the pressure back down and explaining that this was no longer something they were concerned about, even though they continue to investigate it. However, there was after that a meeting held virtually and chaired by Lord Austin, the American Defense Secretary of the Ukraine contact group. And what the American Defense Secretary said at the outset, referring to the incident of the night before in Poland, was that it was important that the minds of everyone be focused as a result of this. It is a Sam was just saying, essential that Ukraine should get more updated, more sophisticated defense systems that it's been asking for. He praised the fact that more and more NATO countries were pledging them to Ukraine; this had shown how necessary they were. But also, an official told me a senior official told me as meeting finished here, that it was also about showing the world that this was a commitment that NATO was not going away, and that they were going to continue to giving Ukraine, the weapons and the support that it needs to see this through.",

There are two people from here farmers who were working just a few 100 meters away from here, who were killed as a result of this incident. And that's really shaken the local residents who I've spoken to. In terms of the country as a whole well, the Poles the - the Polish government has put it to military on a more secure footing in terms of increasing the deployments and tightening security around this border region. There's also that ongoing investigation that is trying to piece together forensically exactly what happened. So that you know, the firm conclusion can be reached. Already Polish officials are saying that look, they've got enough material from the scene to know that this was essentially a Ukrainian surface to air missile that caused this damage, as it tried to successfully attack they say and attack a Russian missile.

Now, the company that owns the ship, the eastern Pacific shipping company, so that there were no injuries and no major spillage that there was some damage to their hole, but that they're still managing to continue moving on the water. Now, as you noted, this ship is a Liberian flagship. It's owned by a company that's based out of Singapore. But that company's ultimate ownership does have Israeli affiliations. There's a few questions about whether this was a targeted attack on it somehow an Israeli connected ship. An Israeli official is telling me that while they do believe that Iran is behind this attack, they don't actually believe that it's a specific attack against an Israeli ship. And that instead, they think it's something to do with more. They're blaming Tehran trying to disrupt activity in the Gulf disrupt shipping activity. And they were specifically tying it to the World Cup, which is supposed to come under way in the next few days. What's also interesting is that the Israeli official told me that they think this was a Shahed-136 drone. And these are actually the exact same type of Iranian made drones that are being used by the Russians in Ukraine. So there's a connection there. So no official response from the Iranians yet, but we are hearing from both the Americans and the Israelis that they do believe it was Iranians who launched this drone towards this oil tanker.

Of course, this announcement coming from Trump last night is historical for many reasons. First of all, no president except for global Cleveland in the 19 century has actually served two non-consecutive terms. So this is really unprecedented for him to enter the field hoping to secure that second term after leaving office two years ago.

That is the most common opinion in Poland that even, even, even if this was a result of Ukraine, defending their own territory, we all remember what happened yesterday. It was an astonishing attack; perhaps arguably the biggest since this criminal invasion began. So Ukraine was defending itself. And what we have seen was Ukraine defending its territory from Russia.

But as the Polish president Andrzej Duda said that would require an agreement from also the other participants being the United States and Poland, one that can get the sense that Poland is feeling the need to find out to get to the bottom of this why this happened. And how can this are prevented in the future? In fact, just some 30 minutes or so perhaps a little more, the Polish prime minister in the building of the Polish parliament has said that we do hope that such a tragedy will not happen again.

The United ArabEmirates are facing Argentina is Leanna Massey starts in a friendly in the UAE's capital. The Argentine squad is among the favorites to win the World Cup and the clash is underway. The UAE and full blue are up against one of the best players in the world and messy in the second half Argentina is leading for Mill. While the region has certainly caught football fever on Thursday, the globe soccer awards are happening in Dubai celebrating the best the game has to offer. And this year we've partnered with the awards to launch the CNN off the pitch prize acknowledging the work of players away from the field. And I'm pleased to announce this year's winner of the prize is Ivorian footballer Didier Drogba. My colleague Becky Anderson explains why he is so deserving of the CNN off the pitch award. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BECKY ANDERSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This is Didier Drogba in his element, welcomed by hordes of adoring fans wherever he goes in his native Ivory Coast. He's no stranger to glory nights, league title celebrations European Cups on the lights and playing for his country on the biggest stage of all. But in his retirement, the former Chelsea striker is giving back to his community and the African continent. Founded in 2007 his foundation has brought electricity to schools has built health centers and donated to orphanages. Recognizing those achievements, Drogba is the inaugural recipients of the CNN off the pitch prize in partnership with the Dubai globe soccer awards, and I managed to catch him in Abidjan to virtually give him his trophy. ANDERSON (on camera): Congratulations Didier, it is my pleasure to present you with this beautiful award. And believe me it is extremely heavy. So I am quite happy that I'm not having to pick it up. It is though, all yours.",

It's just I want a healthy continent. I want a place where Africans can go abroad play and come back to their countries and enjoy another good life. That's all I want. ANDERSON (voice over): So no political ambition just yet. But that hasn't stopped the Ivorian doing all he can to affect change. And the name continues to echo through the streets of Abidjan.

Just one of those engines, there arefour clusters underneath that just one of them generates enough energy for 1.3 million kilometers of street lights. That's an idea of how much power is involved with these things. And they're lifting a tremendously huge rocket. This is the most powerful rocket ever more powerful than the Saturn V rockets back from the old Apollo missions many years ago, which were the benchmark for powerful rockets. Here's the thing, why are they so powerful if you think about it, you could actually launch a rocket to the moon with a lot less power. The reason they are so powerful is because this spacecraft has the capability of carrying 50 tons of payload to the moon, 50 tons. That's like two dozen cars that it can carry. So you have an idea of how much energy they have to put behind it to get it up there, get it into space, it's accelerating to roughly 18,000 miles an hour in a matter of minutes. And then when it comes back, it'll come back in at about 24,000 miles an hour, not the whole craft, just the main pot up there. And of course, we'll have to heat shields to ease it back down to earth. But this is a very big moment they build toward it a long time. And the power of this spacecraft is something we have never seen before on this earth. And I will point out one more things, when you launch a spacecraft of this power, it is burning fuel so quickly, accelerating so quickly, changing atmosphere changing temperature so quickly. It is effectively becoming a different vehicle every few seconds to adapt to all of those things, a remarkable, remarkable technology here, Lynda.",
