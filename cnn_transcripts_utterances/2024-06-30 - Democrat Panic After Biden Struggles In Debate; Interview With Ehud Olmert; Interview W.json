So I'm worried that this is going to get more and more intense and it's going to take weeks for Biden to realize what is staring him in the face.

      "sentences": "Well, first, I have a little PTSD here because if you will remember this, in 2004, George W. Bush got clobbered in the first of two debates with John Kerry. He was hazy. His performance was so bad that a Democratic cut made a video where they took images from his 1994 debate when he ran for governor in Texas contrasted it with 2004, and suggested that George W. Bush was in the grip of early onset dementia. He was 58-years-old at the time.The presidential brain is over promote cognitive demands, and presidents get a little -- certain presidents got a little arrogant about their abilities, and that is why for serving presidents, Reagan, Obama, Bush, tend to do very badly in their first debates. Now let's not to make any excuse for what happened. Biden, there clearly is an issue there, but it also needs a context. I am extremely skeptical that the Democratic Party, ribbon as it is along racial, sexual, ideological class, regional lines can come together at a convention and have a rational discussion and produce the best possible (INAUDIBLE). What you are much likely path is bloodbath. You know, we're a century -- this will be exactly 100 years from the famous Democratic convention of 1924, where they took more than 100 ballots to pick a candidate because they could not sort their differences between the pro-prohibition, pro-Ku Klux Klan, (INAUDIBLE), and the anti-prohibition, anti-Ku Klux Klan northern delegates, and tore themselves apart and Coolidge won in a landslide in 1924. That may seem like ancient history now. That kind of -- it's a self- destructive party. It is a party. There's a coalition of many different elements. It's not Republican coalition, it's smaller, but cohesive, and it falls a lot. Democratic coalition is big, but it's very diffuse. And it's full of animosity. And the idea that airing all those grievances on national television for four days, that doesn't seem to me a wise way forward.",

Look, if Biden last night had debated or this week had debated Nikki Haley, you would say just what you said, and you'll say, you know, it's a warning of a bad four years. So even if I don't love Nikki Haley's policies maybe he could do the job a little bit better and that offsets.But what we have here is a battle between the fire brigade and the arsonists. We are in this jam because the Republican Party is rallying around someone who tried to overthrow an election, thus the Constitution, who's a proven fraudster, who's got half a billion dollars' worth of claims against him for civil frauds and is a convicted criminal in New York state court with many more criminal trials to come. And one party has rallied to this person and there is a sense that the Democrats have to now be responsible people, they have to be grown-up and tidy this up. But we are having this discussion not only secondarily because of Biden's frailties, we're having -- t primarily because of Trump's criminality. That's why Biden's frailties are a problem for the country and not just for his part. ZAKARIA: Ed, I want to ask you about the debate with regard to the kind of things David was talking about. Because it even struck me that bite Donald Trump standards, it was really extraordinary how much he lied. You know, CNN has tabulated I think 30 lies, but those are sort of the major allies. And what was striking to me was he was completely unconstrained in even pretending to, you know, (INAUDIBLE) to the truth. There was -- you know, in the old days, I think they used to be kind of a kernel somewhere in there that was true and was wildly exaggerated. Here he said that he, you know, actually negotiated insulin prices down for seniors when in fact it entirely a product of, you know, decisions and legislation passed by President Biden. There were so many cases in which it was just an out and out lie is -- it does feel like it makes you wonder whether this format is one that one should accede too in the first place. I realized Biden acceded to it, but it does raise that question it does raise that question.?",

This would turn into because the people want a pass by Joe Biden also want to pass by Kamala Harris. They want to have a completely open debate. Put aside the first black woman vice president and that is going to be a nightmare. Ed is right about the process. You know, they didn't have to agree to this debate in the first place. I argued back in April that the debate was a mistake, not because of any lack of confidence in Joe Biden, but because of the nature of putting the president on the stage for a joint media appearance with a convicted criminal. That's not something that makes sense, and there are a lot of ways that the Democrats could fight, that could have brought this contest. There are still a lot of ways.

There's no committee of elders who can tap him on the shoulder and it looks like Jill Biden is not going to be that person, if she were that person I think what Joe to say is look, Joe, you could go within the space of 15 minutes from being a national embarrassment to be very frank right now, to being George Washington of the 21st century, to being somebody who, for the greater good of the nation and to protect their own legacy, walked away and said, seven weeks is a long enough time.To showcase what we're standing for. We say democracy is on the ballot, while here is democracy in action. We are going to choose amongst, it'll be noisy, it'll be vicious, it'll be personal, but at the end it will produce a nominee and a running mate. And by Labor Day, the party will be united behind younger, more energetic, articulate people who can read back and crushed Trump as he deserves to be crushed.

And a place for Jewish values to be made manifest in the public square for Hebrew literature to thrive, for a community that for 2,000 years had lived in exile to actually have a home where we could be safe and sovereign again.

These two visions are not incompatible.And it's precisely because of my love and connection for my Jewish family, including some in the state of Israel that I really can identify with the yearning for home, with the anguish that many Palestinians express, with the sense that no one in the world cares about our fate and it's up to us to take our destiny into our own hands.
