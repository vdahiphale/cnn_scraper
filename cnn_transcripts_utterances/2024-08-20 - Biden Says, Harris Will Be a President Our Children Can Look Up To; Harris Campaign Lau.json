Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey will join me in just a few moments, as will United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, and Domingo Garcia from the nation's oldest and largest Latino civil rights organization. The group is endorsing a candidate for the first time in its 95-year history. And coming up a little later than that, Political influencer Olivia Julianna will join me here. She's one of the young up and coming Democratic speakers this week. And former Illinois Congressman Adam Kinzinger will join us as well. He'll explain why as a Republican, he's speaking at a Democratic convention. And if you were tuning in last night, you saw on the convention floor, there was almost none of the party drama that spurred President Biden to drop out of the race less than a month ago. Yes, it's only been a month. Instead, it was cheers of thank you, Joe, in a four-minute standing ovation, and the president returned that love to the crowd. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
