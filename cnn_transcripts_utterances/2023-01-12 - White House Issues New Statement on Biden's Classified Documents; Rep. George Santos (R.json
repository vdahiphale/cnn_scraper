And so this is the White House trying to put some kind of a bow on this. We will see if this time, if this is the final kind of comprehensive look at this search and the kind of potential documents that might be found. But as of now, they are indicating that they have completed a review of any potential locations where documents -- classified documents from vice presidency could be found.",

I asked him about his apparent web of deceit, about his past, about everything, from having a family that fled the holocaust to his past background, to his educational background. He wouldn't answer any of those questions despite putting that question to him for about more than a minute.But you have hearing some members of his own delegation, Republican members, even some incoming members, saying he simply cannot serve effectively. And if you just start listening to the calls from back home to step aside. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARC MOLINARO (R-NY):  He's lost the confidence of people in his own community. So, you know, I think he needs to seriously consider whether or not he can actually do his job effectively. And right now, it is pretty clear he can't. REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY):  I don't think there is any way he could possibly perform his duty, but the man has got to be honest with himself and his constituents. And it is just clear he can't do his job.",

They discovered a small number of documents of classified markings in storage areas in file cabinets in my home and in my personal library. This was done in the case of the Biden Penn -- this was done in the case of the Biden Penn Center. The Department of Justice was immediately -- as was done, the Department of Justice was immediately notified and the lawyers arranged for the Department of Justice to take possession of the document.

So, Jeremy, I'm going to start with you. This was a pre-planned moment for the president to talk about the economy, to talk about the CPI numbers that were out today, the decrease we've seen in inflation, perhaps not surprisingly the first question, though, that he was asked was about these documents. And this comes on the heels of a statement that you just brought us a short time ago from the White House about what additionally was found. I'm curious, what did you make of his answer there, Jeremy?",

There are also Fed rate tikes coming that are appear to be working.",

But he's trying to pull it all together, talking about the cap of insulin prices and E.V. tax breaks that are now live and sort of new things that have been part of his agenda that the American people will start to feel this year.But the headline, of course, is that those inflation numbers that have been too, too high for too, too long are starting to curve. And he pointed that six months now of slowing headline inflation and he zeroed in on this super core rate of inflation when you strip out shelter and used car and food and energy. And he pointed out that over the past three months, that's been running at more like a 1.8 percent annualized rate. So, really, the inflation, bad inflation story is from the first half of last year and he's sort of turning the page into 2023 here. HILL:  And now we'll wait and watch, right, because the Fed -- we have about 15 seconds left but the Fed is meeting again next month. But we could see another rate hike but it's expected to be lower.",
