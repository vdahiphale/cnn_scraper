      "sentences": "Hi, welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Christina Macfarlane and if you're just joining us, here are some of the top stories we're following today.The U.S. is sending roughly 100 troops to Israel to operate an advanced anti-missile system amid heightened tensions in the Middle East. While it's rare for U.S. troops to be deployed in Israel, that's a normal amount needed to operate the THAAD system. It could prove helpful in Israel's defense against a future Iranian attack. President Joe Biden got another firsthand look at damage in Florida following Hurricane Milton and Helene. He thanked first responders and local officials for partnering on the federal response. The president also announced more than $600 million in energy resilience projects to shore up the power grid in places like Florida. Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will rally supporters in the swing state of Pennsylvania in the coming hours. The state could prove key in deciding the outcome of next month's presidential election, and polling there shows an incredibly tight contest. Prominent Democrats are about to flood the zone for Kamala Harris. Former President Bill Clinton is set to target several key battleground states. Sources say he's trying to appeal to rural voters, who polls show are falling away from the Democratic Party in growing numbers. Clinton is scheduled to appear at local fairs and porch meetings, talking to a few hundred people at a time. And former President Barack Obama is facing one of the most active campaign weeks since he ran for office himself. He'll continue his outreach to young Black men with a message that it's not OK to sit out this election. One of the top Black leaders in the Democratic Party is downplaying polls that show Kamala Harris lagging in support from Black men when compared to Joe Biden's numbers when he ran for president. Congressman James Clyburn says he has had frank and direct conversations with Black men out on the campaign trail, and he does not feel the polls are accurate reflection of what he's seeing and hearing during those discussions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): Yes, I am concerned about black men staying home or voting for Trump. But my concerns don't tend to keep me from being energetic about this campaign. Yes, Black men, like everybody else, want to know exactly what I can expect from a Harris administration. And I've been very direct with them. And I've also contrasted that with what they can expect from a Trump administration. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That means heading north where rich soil and plenty of rain can help olive trees grow and thrive.CNN's Eleni Giokos has our story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Farther and farther north in Europe, olive trees are taking root. Around 40 percent of the world's olive oil typically comes from Spain. But for two years, heat waves and prolonged droughts in the country have hurt harvests and doubled olive oil prices. One glaring effect of climate change on the world's fastest warming continent. JOAN SALA, ACCIO ECOLOGISTA-AGRO (through translator): Last year in liters, we had less than half the average rainfall of a normal year. This year, we barely have 10 percent precipitation. If with climate change, it's going to get worse, hotter, less rain, then we are already entering a climate emergency. GIOKOS (voice-over): Farther north, this farmer is planting the seed for alternative olive growing. The 55-year-old finding a home for his trees in the southern slopes of Hungary. There, the winters are mild, the soil is rich and the rain is plenty for his 200 or so Spanish olive trees. CSABA TOROK, WINEMAKER AND OLIVE GROWER (through translator): We increasingly tend to belong to a climate where the trees can find a home on better slopes. For me, it's not about wanting a decorative tree. I see the trees as an integral part of the landscape here in the future. GIOKOS (voice-over): As the climate warms up and olive groves seem to shift northward, some farmers have planted their feet in Austria and Croatia. In Slovakia, homeowners are buying their own Spanish olive trees, looking to get that Mediterranean feeling all the way in Central Europe. ISTVAN VASS, GARDEN CENTER OWNER (through translator): We are seeing it in practice that there are lots of olive trees planted outside in the gardens and they cope really well, so no need to worry about them. GIOKOS (voice-over): Things are looking up for Spain's olive industry for now. The Spanish Farm Ministry says it estimates a recovery in olive oil production in the country this year. But as climate change elicits more heat waves and droughts farther south, olive farmers must continue to adapt to Europe's changing climate. Eleni Giokos, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
