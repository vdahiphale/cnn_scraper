Also happening today, the UAE is expected to introduce a resolution that the United Nations Security Council calling for a humanitarian pause. How will the U.S. react? And a new horrific reminder of the impact of Hamas terror attack in Israel. Shani Louk, the German-Israeli woman who was paraded through Gaza has been found dead. Well, Israel's military says its grand operation in Gaza is expanding and advancing. The U.N. chief says the humanitarian situation there is growing more desperate by the hour. The IDF says overnight its troops backed by airpower killed dozens of commerce terrorist operatives who had barricaded themselves inside buildings and tunnels. This ground operation happening in what Israel and Israeli leaders called the second phase of the war against Hamas. A military spokesperson says activity in Gaza will only intensify. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON (through translator): We move from the ground and then we attack from the air. It is also a direct contact between ground and -- ground forces and terrorist inside the Gaza Strip. We are constantly estimating moving gradually, according to our operational plans. The ground force will be bigger. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He doesn't know who was inside that car. A U.N. Relief director says the fabric of society and Gaza is starting to break down. Relentless Israeli attacks have left Gaza infrastructure in shambles with little to no food, electricity and medicine. It is unclear when desperately needed help will get in. An official in Egypt says 75 aid trucks are waiting to cross the border. If they make it, it's still only a fraction of the more than 450 trucks that entered Gaza daily before the war. The humanitarian organizations Save the Children says more children have been killed in Gaza in this month alone than in armed conflicts globally in any of the past three years. Palestinian health authorities say 3000 of the nearly 8000 killed in Gaza are children. Numbers that CNN cannot confirm. Now this video shows seriously injured children at a Gaza hospital. A Save the Children official says as the violence expands more children face grave risks. Salma Abdelaziz now joins us from London to give us a bit more insights. Salma, look, these are startling numbers that we've seen out of Save the Children. We also know the big numbers, right? You've got two million people population in Gaza. We know mostly half of those are children. We're seeing this incessant warping playing out as well. I want you to give us a little bit of perspective in terms of what we've seen coming out from the global figures relative to what we've seen coming out in the past three weeks.",

Now very little proof or evidence was provided by the IDF to its claims that there's tunnels underground. The hospital, one piece of audio recording, apparently that CNN cannot independently verify. On the other hand, you have those on the ground, aid agencies, doctors, eyewitnesses, journalist all telling you no, that is simply not true. And you have to remember these hospitals are no longer just hospitals, Eleni. As you mentioned, Al Shifa Hospital is now home to many, many displaced people who simply could not find another place to go. Who could not find refuge and in their desperation are praying that a hospital is a safe place as it should be under international law. I do want to point out another hospital, the second largest hospital in Gaza city where people believed that they could be saved. It's Al-Quds Hospital over the weekend. Airstrikes landed nearby, sending gas into the hospital, damaging its infrastructure. Terrifying the 14,000 displaced or 12,000 displaced people rather who were sheltering there. One man, one eye witness inside that hospital saying, just tell us where to go. We can't find a safe place. If we go south, there's bombardment. In the hospitals, there's bombardment. There is no refuge and the borders are sealed.",

But none of this, as you mentioned, comes anywhere near what Gaza needs. On a normal day before this conflict, before this war, 450 trucks would cross into Gaza daily. So, this is nothing. And what we did see over the weekend is people, thousands of them, I believe, who broke into a U.N. warehouse just to grab -- I mean absolute basics. We're talking flour and soap and water. Just things that they were so desperate for -- the U.N. saying families are not only facing death by the skies, they're also potentially facing starvation.

I do want to just direct your attention real quick to something that is happening right now as we are on the border with Gaza. Right behind me, you can see this pretty heavy plume of smoke. That is actually appears to be emerging from southern Israel just north of the Gaza border near the town of Erez. And we just saw vehicles rushing towards that direction. It's not clear exactly what happened. But that could be the result of some kind of fire or activity from Gaza into southern Israel just across the border. Of course, for most of this day, what we have been watching and listening to here, just about a mile from the border with Gaza is we've been seeing a lot of outgoing artillery from near our position in Sderot towards the Gaza Strip. We've been watching those explosions happening inside of Gaza as both artillery fire, aerial bombardment and also tank fire inside the Gaza Strip continues. The IDF has said that it is continuing to expand this ground operation which began -- which is now entering its fourth day, and that they are going to continue to add troops. Over 600 targets have been struck by Israeli forces interest these last several days including Hamas. Command positions both above ground as well as underground, that tunnel system miles and miles of which Israeli military officials say are a top target, especially as they now have forces entering the Gaza Strip. And we are also learning that Israeli forces are operating not only in the northernmost part of Gaza, but also apparently south of Gaza City, which still remains in the northern half of Gaza. But that just shows you that this operation is not just limited to that initial entry that we saw of forces going from southern Israel into northern Gaza, but also apparently around the side from southern Israel into a North -- Northeastern Gaza as well.

It is not the kind of overwhelming invasion ofGaza with hundreds of thousands of Israeli troops that we were perhaps expecting, but it is certainly a stepped-up operation from what we've been seeing before. And what that also allows beyond having forces on the ground who can target some of these underground tunnels, who can continue to gather intelligence on those hostages and on Hamas infrastructure inside Gaza. It also allows them to carry out more precision strikes on some of these targets. In fact, just yesterday, we know that Israeli forces on the ground directed close air support to carry out a strike on a Hamas post. Killing according to Israeli forces more than 20 Hamas fighters in -- on that position. We've also been watching as Israeli troops on the ground appear to be shooting up flares, that can sometimes be used for marking targets, it can also be used for other purposes as well. But that certainly is kind of the development of activity that we are seeing. Certainly, the first two nights of this expanded ground operation we heard among the most intense and continuous bombardment and shelling of Gaza that we have heard in these entire three weeks of war. Now what we are seeing is more activity on the ground in terms of machine gun fire, tank fire and that steady thud of artillery that you may be hearing behind me still continuing.",

Thank you.While the war rages on, diplomatic sources tell CNN the U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting later today to discuss the conflict. Sources say the United Arab Emirates is expected to seek a binding resolution from other security council members for an immediate humanitarian pause. In the fighting, the UAE is the only Arab country that's currently a member of the Security Council. Now the emergency meeting comes after a U.N. resolution calling for its sustained humanitarian truce in Gaza passed. And the general assembly on Friday with overwhelming support. Although 14 countries including the U.S. voted against it. I want to bring in CNN's Sam Kiley joining us from London to give us a breakdown of what we can expect. Sam, look, language and wording here matters. It is a resolution led by the UAE. It's calling for humanitarian pause, not a right and sustained ceasefire in comparison to what we saw late last week. But international pressure is mounting. You know, if the -- if the U.S. vetoes this, we're sitting back - - we're going back to square one essentially.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think a great deal will depend on the language. The United States has privately beenputting pressure. We know that from our own CNN reporting out of Washington, D.C. and elsewhere on Israel to very carefully calibrate its military response to those massacres of October the 7th. So that, first of all, it doesn't endanger hostages, but above all, in a sense now that the numbers of civilians being killed. And according to the Hamas-run health ministry there you're talking about 8000 or so civilian casualties or rather other casualties including non- civilians, I should say. But this is a very astronomical figure that is really potentially could ignite the Arab world. So, what the Americans will be looking for is language that condemns Hamas, potentially. That might mean that they feel a bit more comfortable in publicly endorsing through a U.N. Security Council Resolution, that which they've been saying in private, which is that they really do need to get the Israelis to allow a great deal more humanitarian aid in there. But the United States has in the past -- over the past 10 days vetoed resolutions, calling for this. The United Arab Emirates, those very key player here. Remember, Eleni, I don't need to tell you of all people that the UAE really has led the charge in terms of normalization of relationships with Israel through the Abraham Accords. Very significant step forward in terms of the perception of Israel in the Arab world. So, they do have leverage to use there. Both with Israel and with the United States. So, condemnation and noise coming from the UAE matters. And is less predictable and more diplomatically influential than perhaps others who might be dismissed as the sort of usual suspects when it comes to being anti-Israeli. So, a great deal of pressure there coming, of course, as the United Nations is warning -- the world saying that there is an ongoing humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza. There have been a breakdown in law and order with the looting of U.N. food stocks. People have running short of food, fuel, medical equipment. Hospitals being ordered to evacuate by Israel as part of this ongoing military advance into the Gaza Strip. And I think militarily there, we can see a degree of calibration possibly because of the American influence, but also because the Israelis know that, you know, on a tactical level that Hamas will have prepared for a mass movement of troops. And they may well be trying to probe more gingerly forward in order to avoid mass casualties on the Israeli side as part of some kind of trap being laid by Hamas, Eleni.",

And we do also have a bit of an update and that the authorities are nowsaying that 20 people were injured and that at least 60 of the people who took part in those riots were in fact detained. But you're absolutely right that that crowd apparently breached through the security of that airport. Managed to overwhelm the security there. A huge crowd that had gathered, because they said that a flight from Tel Aviv was coming in and the rumor had spread that apparently there were refugees from Australia -- from Israel, sorry. They believed who wants to come to that region of Russia. The Dagestan region, which is of course, majority Muslim. And this large crowd had gathered. They stormed the tarmac. They actually managed to get to that plane that had come in from Tel Aviv but the passengers of that plane had already disembarked. They also managed to get into the terminal as well. You see some of the screens -- some of the shots there on your screen. Certainly, some horrifying moments for some of the people who had been on that plane. Some of them were cornered by those protesters, forced to show their I.D.'s. Obviously, they were looking for Jews among the passengers of that aircraft. But that also continued even outside of the terminal, outside of the airport as well where cars were stopped and searched and people forced to identify themselves as well. There was also some reports in Russian media and social media that apparently the protesters also went to a hotel nearby and searched every single room there to see whether or not they could find Jews possibly staying there. So, definitely some troubling scenes. The Russian authorities, Eleni, have already reacted to all of this. So, the religious leader of the Dagestan region has come out and condemned all of this. What we're hearing from the Kremlin is actually quite interesting and that Vladimir Putin is going to have a meeting with his top security officials in about 2-1/2 hours from now. And there they are obviously going to talk about what happened there at that airport. But right now, the Kremlin is saying that they are blaming this on external incitement. Obviously them saying that people were inciting this from outside of Russia, as the Kremlin put it trying to divide Russian society.

No injuries were reported. Adding to growing concerns of a wider regional conflict, worrying new words from Iran's presidents in a tweet, Ebrahim Raisi said \"Zionist regime's crimes have crossed the Red Line which may force everyone to take action.\" Washington asks not to do anything, but they keep giving widespread support to Israel.

What we're seeing here isthat basically coinciding with the entry of Israeli ground forces into northern Gaza, that the amount of cross border fire from both sides has been increasing in terms of intensity, but also in terms of the depths. The depth inside one another's territories that missiles artillery and other weapons are being fired. It's still an incremental increase in the level of hostilities between Hezbollah and other militant groups here in southern Lebanon. And Israel on the other, still not quite reaching the point where it looks like a full -- a full scale war is inevitable. Both sides seem to be -- going just so far, but not too far at this point. But this is obviously causing concern. Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati is on a tour of Middle Eastern capitals. Today, he's in Doha, the capital of Qatar, where he's meeting with officials there. Of course, Doha, Qatar is a key player intermediary when it comes to Hamas, Iran. And to a certain extent Hezbollah because the Lebanese government is largely powerless when it comes to trying to rein in Hezbollah, which is very much answerable only to itself and perhaps, to Iran. The Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister has made it clear on this trip that he's trying to shield Lebanon from the repercussions of the war in Gaza. Now, we're also waiting to hear from the Secretary General of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, who is expected -- who -- it's announced by Hezbollah that he will be making a speech on Friday. Until now since the October 7th, he has not uttered a word. And the anticipation is that if perhaps Israel intensifies its ground operations in Gaza, if there is no progress towards for instance a humanitarian pause in the Israeli operations to allow for the entry of more aid and other supplies to Gaza, that perhaps he will take a more bellicose tone. But we have to wait and see. But certainly, that speech will be key -- a key indicator as to where Hezbollah and perhaps behind it Iran is going as this war continues. Eleni?",

But it's also a key political player in Lebanon. It is a political party with representation in Parliament, in the government. It has a lot to lose if for some reason, it draws Lebanon into a full-scale war with Israel. And it depends on political alliances to maintain its position and those alliances could be jeopardized if Lebanon goes back into war. And let's also keep in mind the Israelis have made it clear. Yoav Gallant, the defense minister of Israel. Before this war began, warned that if Hezbollah were to engage in another war with Israel, Lebanon, would be bombed back into the Stone Age.

And that's where we've seen Secretary ofState Anthony Blinken and other members of the administration engaging as much as they can with other countries. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser in that interview also said that the Saudi defense minister would be in Washington starting today for meetings. So, you see that effort on the diplomatic front. But it's also on the military side. The U.S. very clearly trying to send a message of deterrence to Iran and its proxies with the forces, both naval and ground forces that had sent into the region. Still, even after those U.S. strikes in Syria last week, we have seen a continuation of the attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. Now, since October 17th, there have been 23 separate attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, including a number of those attacks, even after the U.S. carried out strikes against Iranian-backed militias in eastern Syria. So, you see there the deterrence effect that the U.S. is trying to go for, not fully there yet. Those Iranian-backed militias still see an opening and a reason to attack U.S. forces. It seems based on what we're seeing in the region. So, you see what the U.S. is going for. But very much, Eleni, you see what the U.S. is concerned about. Even if the U.S. tries to separate the conflict in Gaza from the rest of the region, other actors there simply don't see that as separate.",

After fierce criticism, Rubiales resigned last month from his role as president. World Cup winning manager Jorge Vilda was also fired from his role. FIFA says that Rubiales' banned covers all football-related activities at national and international levels. But -- that it is subject to a possible appeal before the FIFA Appeal Committee. FIFA is outgoing Secretary General Fatma Samoura said that she was encouraged by the global support Hermoso received.
