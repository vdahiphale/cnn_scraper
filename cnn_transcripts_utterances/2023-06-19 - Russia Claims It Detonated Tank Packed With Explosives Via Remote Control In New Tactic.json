Alexei Navalny appears in court to face a new extremism case. Antony Blinken meets Chinese President Xi in an effort to smooth relations. And later this out a new golf major winner at the U.S. Open. We start with the deadly Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank and scenes not witnessed in some two decades. Israeli forces in Jenin backed by an army helicopter engaging in fierce battles with Palestinian militants. Palestinian health officials report at least five Palestinians killed and 90 injured. Israel's military reports seven of its troops were injured. Hadas Gold watching all of this for us from Jerusalem. Hadas?",

But it escalated into something much bigger that lasted something like 11 hours. And Israeli forces only were finally leaving Jenin in the last hour or so. Now, Jenin, as we've been talking about for so long for the last two years has really been a hotspot in the occupied West Bank for some time, Not only for military activity, but also for these Israeli military rates. But, Becky, what happened today showed a rather alarming increase in the types of weaponry and firearms being used by both the militants and the Israeli military. So we're seeing some really dramatic video of as we're seeing some of these Israeli military vehicles entering Jenin. Some sort of roadside explosive device goes off as one of them passes. Now these really military telling me that a panther command vehicle was hit by this IED, and essentially took out the entire underside of it. I think we're showing -- yes, we're showing the video here. You can see it just kind of explode as it drives by. We do know that some of the Israeli injuries are from that IED. And in addition to that there was heavy gunfire in general. The Israeli military says towards their vehicles, rendering at least five of them actually inoperable. And it took several hours actually to extract some soldiers who were still in Jenin. They are all out as far as we know against seven Israeli soldiers injured. On the other side, though we are -- we did also see for the first time in decades scenes not really seen since the Second Intifada since the early 2000s. And that is an Israeli Apache helicopter firing over Jenin as they were trying to extract the soldiers. Now the Israeli military saying that they fired towards what they called open areas. But it is incredible to see an Apache helicopter like this over a very dense urban area over Jenin and firing towards the city. Now, we don't know if any injuries that happen as a result of that Israeli -- of that Apache helicopter firing down and the militants there did say that they fired back towards the helicopter -- towards the helicopter. We do know that five Palestinians were killed, seven were injured. We know at least two of those killed were claimed by Islamic Jihad as militants, but among those killed were also a 15-year-old boy and amongst the injured war, a critically injured girl and we also know that at least one photo journalist. A freelance photo journalist who was injured while covering this rate. But, Becky, really alarmed to see both the IED being used by the militants and this Apache helicopter being used by the Israeli military. Again, scenes we have not seen here in decades. Becky?",

Now, according to that account, it appears that the -- a driver, somebody of that tank basically pointed in the direction of Ukrainian lines. It moved forward and about 300 meters from the Ukrainian lines, it looks like it hit a mine, and then it was hit by an RPG round fired from the Ukrainian lines. And then it explodes. Now, we don't know whether as a result of that explosion, the Russians were able to move forward or not. 300 meters is a fairly good distance, despite the size of that explosion. Perhaps some Ukrainian troops were killed or wounded. We just don't know at this point.

Many observers willtell you that it's -- they're still engaged in shaping or softening up operations before the major push happens. Now, what we've heard so far from the Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine, is that they have managed to liberate some territory, 113 square kilometers. So far, the latest town that was liberated, we believe between today and yesterday was the town of Piatykhatky which is about an hour's drive from here. That was a town with a pre-war population of about 10,000 people. But to put all of this in perspective, keep in mind that this offensive is perhaps a week and a half old. And about that same amount of time back in September, the Ukrainians were able to take about 4600 square miles or about 12,000 square kilometers in the Kharkiv region. So clearly, the Russians appear to have learned some lessons since then. They -- the Ukrainians aren't making the sort of progress that perhaps some were expecting, but we have to keep in mind, Becky, that it is still early days.",

He said that they agreed on the need to stabilize the relationship. That in and of itself is significant, of course, Becky, because we have seen, you know, this relationship spiral -- downward spiral, really, over the course of the Biden administration and even before that. But when you talk to U.S. officials, they weren't expecting, as you said, major deliverables to come out of this. But one of the goals that they really set out to accomplish was to try and stand up military to military channels of communication between the U.S. and China. The Secretary of State telling me at a press conference just this evening that China did not agree to set up those channels, saying that at this moment, those channels have not been set up. That is something that he will continue to press them on. He said he raised it multiple times in his meetings. The backdrop, of course, is that there have been some close calls between the U.S. and China in the areas surrounding the South China Sea militarily just over the course of the last few weeks here. Now, when it comes to Taiwan, the Chinese readouts of the meetings made it very clear that Taiwan's -- that China said that Taiwan was the number one issue that could raise problems for the U.S.-China relationship. They pressed that the United States should not support Taiwan's independence. And it was clear when the Secretary spoke that he reiterated U.S. positions on Taiwan. The two sides are very far apart when it comes to the issue of Taiwan right now. Here is what the Secretary said on that topic at the press conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You must deny yourself, you must reject yourself. You must reach a point of ending your life, he says, For the sake of Jesus. His anti-government stance got him arrested and detained but never prosecuted. In 2019, the church was closed down. Later, the pastor started his forest community. We found a former cult member in Malindi. We agreed to hide her identity for her own safety. She escaped the forest last year. Why did you move your whole home and all your children and move into the forest? The pastor used to call me, she says. He was calling me telling me, my daughter, you're being left behind. And when the ark is closed, it will be too late. So, I decided to go. When the COVID pandemic hit, she says many saw it as evidence that the prophecies were real. Mackenzie charged her family $80.00 for a piece of land in Galilee. There were seven other biblically named settlements in Shakahola. With more than 1000 followers she says.

Most of the families that have been affected whose family members are now missing in Greece are in the eastern province of Punjab and in the north -- northern part of Pakistan in Pakistan administered Kashmir. A lot of people still don't have answers about whether family members are, whether they have survived or whether they haven't.
