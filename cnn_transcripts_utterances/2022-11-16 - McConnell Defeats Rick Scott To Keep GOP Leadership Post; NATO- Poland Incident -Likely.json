And Donald Trump launching his third White House bid with a cloud of investigations over his prior time in office, including the ones over his attempt to steal the 2020 election, and incite the deadly Capitol insurrection.

That is the number of House seats needed to control Congress, and right now, Republicans are on the cusp of snatching the House of Representatives from Democratic control. Republicans need to win just one more uncalled House seat to gain a majority in the first time in four years, 11 House seats currently remain uncalled. Fresh off securing the vote to be the Republican nominee running for House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy is facing another key vote on a host of rule changes pushed by the MAGA wing of his party meant to curb the power of his own leadership, as McCarthy works to secure the speaker's gavel. While in the Senate, the Senate pointing continues over Republicans disappointing performance in the midterms. Democrats kept control, and may even pick up a seat. For the first time in his 15 years, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky had to successfully fend off a leadership challenge. He defeated Senator Rick Scott of Florida after nearly four hours of closed-door deliberations declaring after the vote, quote, I am not going anywhere, unquote. Rick Scott who lead the campaign this cycle was urged to mound to the opposition bid by former President Donald Trump who made his third campaign official last night and then announcement you will be shocked to learn was filled with exaggerations, and distortions, and flat out lies. Trump's announcement coming just one week after the dismal results by candidates he endorsed in key battleground races. And before the January 6th Select House Committee issues its recommendations on conclusions about the former presidents role in inciting an insurrection to undermine democracy in the United States. Let's go to CNN's John Berman at the magic wall right now. John, what are the races that you are looking at right now to see if Republicans can get to 218 House seats to take control over the House of Representatives?",

Of course, you only need 218 for the majority. There are 11 uncalled races now. The Republicans lead in for, the Democrats lead in seven. Any one of the four that the Republicans lead and could give them the majority.That includes California's third congressional district, which is a Republican-leaning district, R plus one. You can see Kevin Kiley. He is ahead by 10,000 votes with 56 percent in. There are races where the Republican incumbents. California 27 congressional district, Mike Garcia, the incumbent there, is leading by 13,000 votes, 72 percent reporting here. Lauren Boebert's seat still has not been called yet either in Colorado. This is a Republican-leaning district. It's R plus eight or so. She leads by 1,100 votes, not much, but 99 percent reporting. Again, any one of those races could give the Republicans the majority. If they win, every race they are leading in right now, they would end up with 221 seats, the Democrats 214. How does that compare historically to other close congresses? Well, you could see this past congresses, what it was, it was full, the Democrats with 222, sees Republicans with 213. That is right in line where we could be this next Congress. There were also close calls, 19 99 to 2001, and 2001 to 2003. So, the Democrats, by the, way if they end up with 214, that would be a net loss of eight seats. How does that compare to history? We can look at that also. You could see also in the presidents first term, which is what President Biden is in right now, the average loss of 31 seats. [16:05:03] Minus eight is actually a pretty good showing for a presidents incumbent party. But in this case, enough for them to lose the House, which, of course, is a significant, Jake.",

The first is when we realized on a Sunday night at 10:00 the significance of what was going on there, which was fairly early in the chain of events, we had a new team on the ground by 7:00 the next morning. And that new team really did say save dozens and dozens of lives by being there. So we acted as fast as we could. The second thing, I called all the family representatives of everybody who died, and, I mean, I felt horrible about the whole thing. And the only thing I could think of was just calm. So I spend hours, and hours on the phone over the course of the next couple of weeks talking to people. And then, the third thing we did, we said we would make sure that we put in place the strategy to eventually build a new facility, which is moving forward at this point in time, requires significant changes and the governance and the operation of the facility, which was a law that I signed this past fall and to try to write as many of the wrongs as we possibly could. But there's no -- there's no getting around that at the end of the day, that was probably the single worst thing that happened during the entire pandemic to people here in the commonwealth of Massachusetts.",

We did the shutdown on the emergency that I think pretty much everybody did, except essential workers in the spring of 2020. But by the middle of May, after hours, and hours, and hours of meetings with folks in the business community, and the public health community, we had a strategy we rolled out and we pretty much stuck to all the way through. And it got a lot of people back to work in a reasonable period of time, reasonably safely, and I think that that, in some respects, was the piece that I feel the best about. I -- you know, I wish we had been able to get kids back in school sooner. I thought the data on this one was pretty clear from other countries.
