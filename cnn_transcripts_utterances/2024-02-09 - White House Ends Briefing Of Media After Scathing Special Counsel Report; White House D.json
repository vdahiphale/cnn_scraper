      "sentences": "That's him discussing what -- according to this report, that then-former vice president was discussing classified documents or classified information with the ghostwriter who was not cleared to receive that information.That is a problem. And it is plain as day that is on him. That is nobody else's fault but him. But his fault. And so, that is part of the effort by the White House, and Ian Sams is very capable of trying to defend what the president is trying to say. But they are sort of misfiring on some of this. Because again, the report makes clear that the line was crossed in these interactions. Now, we haven't heard -- we haven't heard these recordings, we haven't heard some of the evidence here, for us to be able to judge whether Robert Hur is portraying this correctly. They are saying -- they are disputing some of this. So we will wait. By the way, one of the most important things that Ian Sams seem to be open to, at least in his remarks, where a reporter asked about releasing some of these materials, investigative materials. Now let me tell you this, the Justice Department now considers this investigation closed. Which means Republicans are going to be asking for the materials that are behind this investigation. Reporters are going to be putting in Freedom of Information Requests to, again, access some of that information. And there is no reason why it should not be released. Ian Sams, on the podium just now, said it will be reviewed based on whether the class of information. But it seems at least the White House is open to releasing some of that. The only way it would not be released is if the president declares or asserts that there is executive privilege that he wants to assert. One final thing I want to just quickly talk you guys about is one of the things that the president's lawyers are pushing is this idea that this was out of the norms of the Justice Department, that Robert Hur exceeded the regulations or violated the regulations by producing this report. The problem here is that this is a special counsel. And a special counsel is required to produce a report. So this is basically what is usually what the Justice Department calls a declination memo, right? And they are ugly. They are not pretty documents. Because they lay out everything that was found in the investigation. And then, for the -- to explain why they are not prosecuting. And we don't normally see these documents. But because this is a special counsel investigation, it was required for this to be produced. And let me tell you, if Merrick Garland, the attorney general, had looked at this report, and found fault with some of the language, the stuff about the elderly, man with a faulty memory, that stuff, and asked for it to be removed, it would trigger a number of consequences. It would have to require for that to be reported to Congress and that would become a whole new scandal. So, it is a problem. And I understand why they don't like the report. But these are the regulations. But these are the regulations. And this is not a violation of the Justice Department norms or regulations.",

Those are the words they are using here.I want to get now to David Axelrod to talk about this. You heard that, David, not ruling out the possibility of releasing a transcript, but that that would be something that is pretty extraordinarily. I don't believe we saw transcripts released in, for instance, the Mueller investigation. And, he may have not ruled it out, Ian Sams, but he also raised that possibility that there may be some classified information. So there is a way to back out of it. Would you want that released, if you were advising the president?",

      "sentences": "Well, Ian Sams is actually the right person to come out and answer these questions. He has been the one whose been handling communications with the White House Counsel's Office throughout this investigation.The president has not only the White House counsel, but he also as outside counsel, Bob Barr, who has been helping him, shepherding him through this process. But I am not sure if that press conference really resolved the issues that they now have, in combatting some of these damning findings in the report. And also, I'm going to reiterate what Evan said. Special Counsel Rob Hur, as part of his appointment, he is required to issue a report. There have been comparisons, for example, to former FBI director, James Comey, talking to the Hillary Clinton probe or other prosecutors. We had a special counsel required to issue a report. James Comey was not required to come out and talk about that case. Traditionally, prosecutors do not publicly talk about cases when someone is not charged. But it is different with the special counsel. And the most comparable example is, of course, the report from former special counsel, Robert Mueller. It was incredibly critical of former President Trump and many of his associates. It was equal in length to Rob Hur's report. There are no page requirements, right, or any real restrictions on the special counsel. They are expected to comport with the Justice Department norms. And I think intelligent minds, including our Norm, can disagree with what this means and if he did go outside of the lines. But in speaking with witnesses who were interviewed in this case over the past year -- as we have broken a lot of stories on this investigation -- they described Hur as someone who is meticulous. He would call multiple times about the same question that in their minds was pretty minor, where did people sit, what were they doing, who lifted the box? He was meticulous. So, if he included these details -- and this is someone who is being described to us as, again, taking this very seriously, and being meticulous, he understood there would not likely be charges. Instead, he wanted to offer the public a detailed report. And we will likely have an opportunity to hear from him one more time, at as it is highly likely that he will have to testify, as Robert Mueller did before Congress.",

Also, no criminal intent, because he cooperated. Unlike President Trump, his failure to cooperate both proves intent of breaking the law, and holding the documents, and obstruction. But this happens. I've been working with the special counsel investigations for over three decades. There are always a few points of disagreement. And that is what that White House press conference was like, was about. And I think the White House has a point in calling attention to practice protocol and policy.

Andy, to the point that Norm was making, if you are the special counsel, and you are trying to argue that a jury would look at President Biden and see an elderly man who has issues with memory, someone that would be perhaps sympathetic, as a reason to not go after him and press charges of mishandling of classified documents.

That is relevant to the special counsel's duty.But I agree with Norm. It is the way that he characterized that, that faulty memory, that goes beyond what is necessary to communicate a potential weakness in your case. And actually wades directly into a major issue and a current political race. And it is not the only example of that. There is all sorts of language in the very beginning of the report where the special counsel refers to reasons why the president retained some of these materials. That he wanted to keep these materials to document his legacy, and as evidence that he was a man of presidential timber. Now that is not cited to any interview. So presumably, that is the special counsel's conclusion about what the president's motivations might have been, which is presented in what is undoubtedly a kind of distasteful, negative way.
