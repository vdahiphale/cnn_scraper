Meta, the company that owns Instagram, is rolling out a new teen accounts experience after years of criticism over the platform`s safety risks for young people. They are, for example, going to make all teen accounts private by default. So, these settings were available before, but now you`re -- if you`re under the age of 18, you`re getting put in them -- KIRA WONG O`CONNOR, META YOUTH SAFETY POLICY MANAGER: Exactly.",

DUFFY (voice-over): Teens who are 16 or 17 have the option to manually change the settings back themselves, but 13 to 15-year-olds need to set up parental supervision through the app and get their parents` OK to make their Instagram settings less restrictive.

So, this is interesting. You go to settings, and you see immediately teen safety settings. O`CONNOR: Yes. And so, here you see, learn more. If you click on that, it takes you to a pop up that will tell you how a Teen Account works, so that when you`re a teen using Teen Accounts, you`re only able to contact people that you`re mutually following or that you`ve already been in contact with. So, with sleep mode, anyone in Teen Accounts is defaulted into sleep mode. This means from 10:00 p.m. until 07:00 a.m. a teen is not going to get notifications in that timeframe, and then they are able to still use Instagram, but they`re not going to get notifications, kind of pulling them back into the app.",

If you said 1,000 light-years away, you are correct. Scientists believe dormant black hole Gaia BH1 is the closest to Earth. A new discovery is causing astronomers to rethink the structure of the universe. They recently uncovered a pair of ginormous black hole jets releasing from a supermassive black hole. See, black holes have a reputation of being the garbage disposals of the universe, inhaling anything that comes near them. But some of those materials are ejected before they get drawn in, forming these powerful jets. Scientists say the ones they just found are so enormous, our entire Milky Way galaxy would look like a tiny dot in those two giant glowing eruptions. They`re actually the width of 140 Milky Way galaxies. The discovery has astronomers wondering if massive black hole jets hold the key to questions about the universe`s evolution and structure. All right, octopuses have long been known to do their own thing, but new research is showing that they might not be as solitary as we once thought. These super intelligent cephalopods have been found to seek the company of other fish, and can even pack a punch if their fish friends don`t cooperate. Our McKenna Ewen is here to explain. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EDUARDO SAMPAIO, POSTDOC RESEARCHER, MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOR (voice-over): A new study found that typically solitary octopuses can actually work together with other fish to hunt. Researchers in Germany found that different species of fish share different leadership responsibilities within hunting groups, and that octopuses typically decide whether and when the group should attack its prey. Octopuses were even observed using their tentacles to punch uncooperative fish as punishment to get them to leave the group. This footage helps researchers better understand why different groups of species stick together. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
