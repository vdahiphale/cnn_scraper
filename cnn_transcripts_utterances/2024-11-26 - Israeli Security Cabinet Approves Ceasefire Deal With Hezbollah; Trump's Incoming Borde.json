This war between the two countries or between Israel and Hezbollah has been going on for more than 13 months, since Hamas' brutal attack October the 7th.But it really spiked in September, where Israel upped the ante and decided to take the fight to Hezbollah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is claiming it a victory, pointing out just how much they've decimated Hezbollah, including killing its iconic, charismatic leader, Hassan Nasrallah. But he's also saying very clearly, if Hezbollah violates the terms of this ceasefire, then Israel will strike back. Quite how and what the mechanism is for Israel striking back is not entirely clear at this time. What is clear, 60-day ceasefire, Hezbollah pulls back about 30 miles north of the Israeli border, north of the Litani River, the IDF pull their troops back into Israel, the U.N. and the Lebanese army go in to fill that sort of military vacuum, and the Prime Minister saying that now he can focus on Iran as being the next big threat, that he can get - allow the troops time to recuperate and resupply. And he said one of the reasons he was able to do this right now was because Hezbollah had separated its war from its stated aim of supporting Hamas' war in Gaza. That incidentally is something that Hamas - that Hezbollah has actually said a decision they'd taken prior to the escalation by Israel back in September.",

They said at one point this afternoon, 20 strikes in just two minutes. They targeted financial institutions that the IDF said was funneling Iranian money to Hezbollah, even striking in areas right in the center of downtown Beirut. We've talked about this in recent days, but the strikes today were even more in the center of Beirut, in places that hadn't been targeted even during the 2006 war.

The cabinet is still sitting, and I'm telling you from a source there just like 30 seconds ago, that the vote hasn't taken place yet. So this is why President Biden still hasn't spoken. The meeting is still ongoing. I think it's a matter of minutes until they will approve it, but, you know, technically they haven't.For Netanyahu, this is a significant moment because his base, his political base is against this deal. And to be honest, there are two main reasons I think that he decided to go for this deal. One of them he talked about in his speech earlier tonight is that the IDF is exhausted, okay? That's the honest truth. And the IDF asked for the ceasefire, A, because they think they managed to achieve all of their goals in Lebanon. And second, because they need a break. That's the honest truth. And the second thing is because Netanyahu looks at President Trump, President-elect Trump and he knows that he wants this deal. And he knows that if he doesn't take the deal now, he might get to January 20th with a war in Lebanon, something Donald Trump does not want.",

They managed to bury the hatchet during the campaign because it suited both of them politically, but Netanyahu is very careful with Donald Trump and he doesn't want to start on a - you know, to start with a crisis. He wants to try and decrease as much as possible the friction points with Donald Trump ahead of January 20th.Part of this is, as you said, in order to try and get Trump to focus more on Iran. And I think in order to do that, he needs to take the Lebanon issue off the table and this is why he's pushing for this ceasefire deal.",

And since - and Israel then pulled out 10s of thousands of its civilians fearing a Hezbollah invasion like the Hamas invasion on October 7th.And when Israel started retaliating, then Lebanese civilians started leaving Southern Lebanon. And I think that in any case, even though there will be a ceasefire tomorrow morning, it will take a few weeks, maybe a few months until all those civilians will go back to their homes, mainly because on both sides of the border, I think people want to see that this thing holds and it will take a few weeks or again, maybe a few months until they all go back. And on the other hand, on both sides of the border, the houses are - have been destroyed. So even people who want to go back might not have a place to go back to.

      "sentences": "The stark pivot, but also an indicator of what the Trump-White House relationship is going to be with the state of Texas, as well as those states that cooperate the way that they want them to. And what I mean by that is by talking with sources, they tell me that Trump's team wants to see the type of cooperation along the U.S. southern border with Texas and the types of operations that the state has done. For example, using their state resources to assist along the border in the incoming administration.Now, just to provide some context here, it's not unusual for states to help federal agents along the U.S.-Mexico border. Of course, their authorities are limited. But what this has been is something much further. Of course, this has been Operation Lone Star. Texas governor launched that in 2021 as an affront to the Biden administration. It included, for example, bussing migrants to Democratic-led cities, blocking off a portion of the border to federal agents, and putting up those buoys along the Rio Grande. That led to lawsuits from the Justice Department, but it also fed into the tension and the feud between the Biden White House and Texas. But now that's all going to change under president - well, under President Donald Trump. That is going to be in a relationship that is leaned on to try to do that mass deportation pledge that Trump has repeatedly talked about. Tom Holman, clearly there alongside Abbott, he's going to be the incoming border czar. But I'm also told by sources that Texas Border Czar, Michael Banks, is also being considered to lead U.S. Customs and Border Protection. So just these personnel moves alone tell you just how close this relationship is expected to be, which is a pivot from where it has been over the last three years. Now, of course, this may run into some controversy. Of course, we have seen that in states before where resources have been ushered in to help with border security, because it may take away from other priorities in the state. But certainly the sources that I have talked to say that part of the plan for the incoming Trump administration is to do a lot more of that to free up federal personnel so that they can work on interior enforcement. So Tom Homan being along the Texas-Mexico border today is telling, of course, he's the incoming border czar. He will be at the White House in the coming year. So certainly this is giving us a roadmap into how they plan to work together with Texas in next year and in the years to come. And of course, sources tell me that they are looking at everything they're doing as that blueprint to then also request the same from other states along the border. Boris, Brianna?",

I mean, just today, the footwear industry pleaded with the president- elect to rethink these tariffs, warning that even though he says the prices won't go up, they will.The trade group that represents Nike, Crocs and others said that these tariffs would directly increase costs for retailers and consumers, leading to higher prices on everyday essentials like shoes. Because remember, these tariffs, they're basically taxes on imports. And so U.S. companies, they pay the tariff to Treasury, and then they have to decide, do they eat the cost of the tariff or do they pass along the cost to consumers? And more often than not, they pass along the cost. We've already heard for Target, Wal-Mart, a number of different retailers, AutoZone, Columbia Sportswear, they've all said that tariffs could raise prices.

It's an integrated economy.And there is no question that, first of all, he's going to violate his own treaty. He renegotiated NAFTA and called his renegotiation the greatest trade agreement in the history of the world. He is now going to abrogate that treaty on day one with 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico. The threat of retaliation is real. I can't imagine the newly installed Mexican president or the much-buffeted premier of Canada stepping aside and acting like, well, it's the American prerogative. And so we're in for serious tariff wars, and it will add, it absolutely will add to the cost of goods and services here in America.

The only way America grows is with immigration.And so when you threaten mass deportation, millions of people in concentration camps, apparently, who would then be deported somewhere, you are injecting a real chilling effect on people to come to America whose labor we need, whose energy we need, whose contributions to a social safety net we need.
