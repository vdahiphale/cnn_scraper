It's Monday, October 14th, 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, where in the coming hours both major presidential nominees are set to hold events vying for the state's 19 electoral votes, the biggest single prize of the seven battleground states.And with the election just three weeks away, polling data shows there is still no clear front-runner between Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in these three states from the Democratic so-called blue wall. Well, the national picture remains unclear as well, with CNN's latest Poll of Poll showing an average of 50 percent of likely voters supporting Harris, while 47 percent back Trump. Pennsylvania's governor says it's par for the course in his state. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSH SHAPIRO, (D) PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR: In Pennsylvania, the last two presidential races have come down to 44,000 votes and 80,000 votes, representing about a point or less. So it shouldn't shock anyone that the polls are within a point or so or even a dead heat. These are close races, but the stakes are incredibly high. The contrast is clear. And I'll tell you what, I would much rather be us than them. I think we've got momentum. And like I'm a sports guy, I would much rather have our team on the floor for the final two minutes of the game, standing with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "The voter registration numbers, if you want a stat that Republicans absolutely love, it's this one, all right? Pennsylvania voter registration, you register by party in that state. You go back to November of 2020, you see Democrats 47 percent, Republicans 39. That was an eight-point advantage.Look at where we are today. Yes, more voters in Pennsylvania are registered as Democrats than Republicans, but it's now just 44 percent to 40 percent. Now that you've got a four-point gap, Republicans have cut that Democratic advantage in half, in half in such a short period of time. They have gone out. They have registered voters. There are folks that have come over to their side who have previously registered Democrats. But there's one thing to keep in mind, right? You had that New York Times, Siena College poll that came out yesterday that showed Kamala Harris slightly ahead, but within the margin of error. Why is that? Because take a look here. This is the Pennsylvania margin by party registration in that poll. What you see here is that Kamala Harris -- I'm going to come over to your side -- is doing better among Democrats, a 77-point lead, than Donald Trump is among Republicans, a 74-point advantage. She's also doing better with those who are not registered with a party or with another party. But this nugget is key because even though Republicans have closed that registration gap, they haven't closed it completely. So the fact that Harris is doing slightly better among Democrats than Republicans, and there are more of them, that is what gives Democrats solace, is because at this particular point, that state, compared to, say, Arizona, is slightly more favorable to Kamala Harris, at least in the polling data so far. (END VIDEOTAPE) MACFARLANE: Well, as the election draws closer, Donald Trump is taking his anti-immigration rhetoric to dark and disturbing new levels. The former president is doubling down on his false narrative that the Biden-Harris administration has opened the floodgates to a wave of violent migrant criminals who threaten to destroy the United States.

And it was very clear during his remarks on Sunday that that is what he feels will help him be successful come November 5th. Now, a bit of news from Sunday. Donald Trump called a bunch of Border Patrol agents onto the stage in the middle of his rally where they touted their endorsement of the former president, their first official endorsement of him this cycle, although I will note that they have supported him in the past. Donald Trump, for his part, also announced a new plan that he would call to add 10,000 more Border Patrol agents if he were elected in November, and also that he would call on Congress to give those agents a 10 percent raise as well as a $10,000 signing and retention bonus, again, if he is elected. Really trying to lean into their support, court these Border Patrol agents, and really embrace what he argues is a necessary action and advancement for these officials on the southern border.

It's one of the bloodiest attacks on Israeli soil since the war broke out last year. The drones targeted an army base about 40 miles from the Lebanese border.The IDF says it will investigate why the attack didn't trigger an alarm. Hezbollah called the retaliation for Israeli strikes on Lebanon on Thursday, which continued into the weekend. Lebanese health officials say Israeli strikes on Saturday killed 51 people and wounded more than 170 others. And while concerns continue over a wider conflict, Israeli strikes on targets in Gaza go on. This was the scene inside the Al-Aqsa hospital courtyard early Monday, where four people were killed and dozens wounded. Tents were in flames, with people trying unsuccessfully to put out the fires. The Israeli military says it conducted a precise strike on a Hamas command center inside the compound. And we have to warn you that the video we're about to show you is disturbing. On Sunday, more than 40 people, at least 13 children, were killed in another Gaza strike, according to hospital officials. At least 22 were killed when the al-Mufti school in the Nuseirat refugee camp was hit. But remarkably, today, in the middle of all this destruction, the U.N. is set to begin the second phase of its emergency polio vaccination campaign. The World Health Organization hopes to provide more than half a million doses of the vaccine. After a successful first round in September, when 95 percent of eligible children were inoculated. Joining me now to discuss all of this is CNN's Nada Bashir. Nada, a lot of important points to get through here. But I just want to start first with the increased military presence that the U.S. announced they were sending on Sunday. Troops on the ground. Also, a deployment of this advanced anti-missile system to Israel. Talk to us a bit more about the significance of this decision at this time when Israel is weighing and preparing for a response militarily to Iran.",

The tone from the White House is one of de- escalation. They want the response by Israel to be proportional in order to prevent this from spiraling out of control into an even more broader regional war than what we have already seen escalating in parts of Lebanon and Syria, of course.But clearly, what we've been also hearing from the Biden administration is that continued steadfast support for the state of Israel. And this support in the form of air defense system support and, of course, U.S. troops as well to operate them comes amid those mounting tensions, amid concern that there could be yet a further response from the Iranian regime targeting Israeli territory if, indeed, we do see an attack by Israel targeting Iranian territory. Now, this specific defense system is focused on defending against ballistic missiles. The hope would be that this would support Israel in its defense against any future attacks from the Iranian regime. And, of course, we have been hearing from Iranian officials suggesting that that attack, that that response could well be likely if, indeed, we do see Israel taking action. Take a listen to this statement from the Iranian foreign minister. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABBAS ARAGHCHI, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): We are prepared for any kind of circumstances. We are ready for war, but we are also ready for peace. This is the definitive stance of the Islamic Republic. We are entirely ready for a military conflict. We are not afraid of war, but we do not wish for war. We want peace, and we will seek a just peace in Lebanon and Gaza. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Again, the Biden administration has been calling for the response to be proportional. They do not want to see Israel targeting Iran's nuclear facilities or oil fields. That is certainly a huge concern with the potential for that to trigger an even broader war in the region, particularly with regards to Iran's regional proxies.

As you mentioned, a number of civilians were believed to be sheltering on the ground, on the compound of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. In fact, hospital officials say at least 5,000 people are believed to be sheltering on the compound, on the grounds of the hospital.But again, this strike, particularly targeting that hospital compound area, of course, impacted the tents where civilians had been sheltering and sleeping overnight. We have seen video emerging showing these tents engulfed in flames, some videos showing civilians engulfed in flames in these tents as well. Again, at least 5,000 people believed to be sheltering there. This is one of the last remaining hospitals still functioning in Gaza. It is one of the main hospitals, it is somewhere where Doctors Without Borders, the international NGO, has its staff operating and supporting Palestinian medics on the ground there. We have heard from the Israeli military acknowledging responsibility for this strike. They say they were targeting Hamas militants there. They have accused Hamas once again of using civilians as human shields. But again, this is a hospital, an area that was known to be housing and sheltering civilians. It has been from the early weeks of the war. So, of course, the efforts to mitigate any sort of civilian harm are clearly not enough in such a densely populated area. And this comes as we continue to see strikes in other parts of Gaza and, of course, the deepening of Israel's incursion around the Jabalia region in the north, where it is proven near impossible to get enough food or aid in so far. So, clearly, a desperate situation across the Gaza Strip.",

In places like Hillsborough County, recovery efforts are being hindered by ongoing flooding issues.

The floodwaters and debris are blocking roads. That means fuel trucks can't get to gas stations that are running low, crews can't fix the downed power lines as quickly, and those fuel and power shortages, in turn, are hampering the recovery efforts. More than 400,000 customers statewide are still without power, and almost 30 percent of the state's gas stations were without fuel as of early Sunday.

Those high temperatures on Sundays in the low 80s, by the time we get to Tuesday, they may not even make it to a high temperature of 60 degrees, and they're not alone. Look at Dallas, going from a high in the mid-90s on Sunday, dropping all the way back to the upper 60s by the time we get to Wednesday. Keep in mind, the average is 80, so going from above average to below average in just simply two to three days. Atlanta, also going to see a similar drop, but you're really going to notice it in those morning low temperatures. Take a look at this. Wednesday night into Thursday morning, that low temperature in the city of Atlanta going to get all the way down into the upper 30s. So again, very chilly for some of these locations. The good news is, notice that little bit of a rebound that we get once we get back into next weekend.
