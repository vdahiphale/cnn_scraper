That question, in just hours, will be center stage before the U. S. Supreme Court. We're standing by for the arguments to begin at the high court over Trump's fight to try to get his federal election subversion case thrown out.

It was both rank and file Teamster union members as well as just some working class voters.This is something that Donald Trump has been trying to effort in terms of his election with Joe Biden, but it's also a good reminder that Donald Trump, amidst all of his legal issues, is still running for president and still campaigning, or at least trying to, against President Joe Biden, trying to hear in New York City, a city that went for Joe Biden by huge numbers, try to make campaign stops and talk to various groups that might be more favorable to the former president. Now, we did get a chance to ask him some questions. I'd raised David Pecker, asked what he thought of the testimony, asked the last time he talked to David Pecker. He just said that Pecker was a nice guy and that he's been pleased with the testimony, but he also talked about those critical immunity arguments. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have a big case today. This judge isn't allowing me to go. We have a big case today in the Supreme Court on presidential immunity. A president has to have immunity. If you don't have immunity, you just have a ceremonial president. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They believe that this is very important for him, and they've become resigned to the fact that this is what the next several weeks is going to look like.

Pro-Palestinian protesters clashing again and again with law enforcement overnight, that included at Emerson College in Boston. Protesters met in the streets by police in riot gear who were sent there to dismantle the encampment that they had set up. More than a hundred people were arrested.At USC in Los Angeles, there was also conflict between police and protesters leading to the arrest of nearly a hundred people as well. The protests there are over for now, but the USC campus remains closed. At the University of Texas at Austin, state troopers arrested 30-plus people after sometimes violent altercations. As you can see, it's in all parts of the country that this is playing out right now. CNN's Polo Sandoval is live outside Columbia University in New York, where this is really where it all really began and picked up steam, and CNN's Ed Lavendera is outside the University of Texas at Austin. Polo, let me start with you. In addition to what we've seen has been the continued struggle for the school and protesters to calm this all down, you now have the Republican House speaker who came to Columbia University yesterday, jumping into all of this, his reception, it was -- he did not receive a good reception.",

And in terms of what we heard from the speaker yesterday, during the visit calling on the president of Columbia University, while he was joined some of his Republican lawmakers, calling on the president to step down, as he put it, if she cannot bear an order to this campus.Now, it's important to point out that the Columbia board saying that it strongly stands behind President Minouche Shafik as they try to work out a potential resolution here. Meanwhile, we have also heard recently from the Columbia College dean saying, recognizing very clearly that there have been, without question, instances of intimidation and harassment. And that is something that the university says it's still trying to certainly address with disciplinary action when they can, but also recognizing that there are limits some of the community actually says, especially off campus, and that is the other for the other side of the story that a conversation that's happening about how to address that as well, and still continue concerns about non-students or people that are not affiliated with the university from potentially trespassing on campus. And that is another issue that the university is still trying to address. Really, that encampment that has led to still the standoff between members of those student organizations that are holding that encampment, at the same time, also speaking to the university to try to bring this to a resolution with commencement still weeks away, and the university making clear in a statement yesterday that he intends to not allow any disruptions of that graduation ceremony next month.
