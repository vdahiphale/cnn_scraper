You mentioned this earlier, there was a ruling last night that blocks the administration from releasing migrants without a court date. Now, that is a mechanism they sometimes use when they're trying to alleviate overcrowding. Without that, it gives them one less tool in their toolbox when they're trying to deal with all of these numbers. Now, I spoke to a source this morning, they told me, look, litigation was part of the planning. It was baked in to a degree. They knew that the administration has been hit with lawsuits when trying to rollout border policy.

Now, part of the tough thing since then as you know is that both Ted Cruz after that, and Donald Trump, in an even more forceful way, made immigration the biggest bogeyman issue for the Republican Party, and it really brought it to the forefront among Republican primary voters in a way that it had not been for sometime. So that is the extra hurdle that exists today that did not exist, I think, in 2013, 2014. But look, I respect Tony being outspoken within the Republican conference, that some of the bills that he has been proposed by fellow Republicans have been cruel, and been nonsensical.

I've been a sexual assault prosecutor in the past. Delayed reporters are often not only defamed, they are disregarded and the idea coming forward is hard.

It's a significant event, the first known successful use of the Patriot system by Ukraine and crucially the first known interception of this hypersonic system, demonstrating the capability.

I would point towards the mass incarceration of Black and Latino citizens of our country, who are imprisoned and treated wildly differently than the police by than White citizens. And I would point towards the treatment of Muslim people on our borders, who are still bearing the brunt of the scapegoats for 9/11. And so, the idea that we have stopped being racist, and our government has stopped enforcing state sanctioned racist policies is untrue. And the way I talk about this with children often is, I tell them to imagine a bully. I say one day, the bully punches you, but the next day they apologize and say it was not fair, I should not have punched you. But then you see them punch someone else, and then they kick someone. Would you still accept that apology? Would you really believe that they had changed, that they were taking what they had done to you to hurt? And that is largely how I feel about Japanese incarceration. Yes, we received an apology. We even received reparations, which is something that my own family personally benefited from.
