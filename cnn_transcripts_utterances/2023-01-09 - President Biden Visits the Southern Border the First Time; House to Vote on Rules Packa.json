Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" President Biden at the border, yet he somehow managed not to meet any migrants. We will look at how he's dealing with an issue that is angering both the right and the left.Insurrection in Brazil, protesters stormed top government offices and scenes eerily similar to those on January 6 in Washington. And tributes across the country to U.S. football's Damar Hamlin. We'll bring you highlights from a game that couldn't have been scripted any better for his Buffalo Bills as the fights to recover from cardiac arrest. Good to have you with us. Well, one of the most controversial issues he faces back home will be front and center when U.S. President Joe Biden attends a regional summit. Mr. Biden has arrived in Mexico City where he will meet with his counterparts from Mexico and Canada later today. They will cover a number of pressing topics including the recent surge in migration. The president addressed that issue on Sunday when he visited the U.S. border in El Paso, Texas. He spoke with workers at a migrant processing center, but notably he did not appear to meet with migrants themselves. A senior administration official told CNN that was completely coincidental that the center did not have any that day. Mr. Biden also inspected the iron fence between Mexico and the U.S. and pledged more government support. It comes as he faces criticism for failing to address the spike in border crossings.

They have vowed to make cuts to programs like social security and health care. And they've also vowed to engage in what we know would be these very baseless investigations. They call it investigating the weaponization of the FBI. They're going to not only try to investigate the FBI but also the Justice Department, and potentially those investigations that are going on in the Justice Department against Donald Trump will become the subject of the Republicans as they set out on this course to, you know, engage in these endless investigations.

He never attempted it in earnest, and he obviously never got it done.And now it falls to Joe Biden. And showing up at the border is acknowledging the problem, but without comprehensive immigration reform, it will not get better for him or the country more broadly. There's the issue of the migrants who are at the border right now. There is the issue of the undocumented people still within America from years past and there's the issue of the people who have yet to come to the border.

When they had control of the House, when they had Donald Trump in the White House, they took very little action to actually do anything with respect to the immigration crisis. So, I don't think we should blame the Democrats, without looking at the blame that should be placed on the Republicans as well. And given how fractured the Republican Party is at this point, we should not expect there to be any efforts on the part of the Republicans to address not only the immigration issues, but other issues such as the economy, voting suppression. There are so many issues that are important to the American people. If they cannot elect a leader without 15 attempts, and without almost coming to blows on the floor of the U.S. Congress, I don't think we should expect anything from the Republican-led Congress.",

A top Brazilian official says the riots in Brasilia are now over, hours after hundreds of supporters of former leader, Jair Bolsonaro, stormed key government buildings.The tension and unrest filled into the night with police using tear gas to disperse the crowd. Earlier, the protesters breached security barriers and broke into Congress, the Presidential Palace, and the Supreme Court. One official says at least 400 people have been arrested. World leaders are condemning the violence and expressing their support for Brazil's newly elected president, Lula da Silva. President Biden called the situation an assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil. Brazil's Supreme Court has now ordered the armed forces to dismantle all camps belonging to Bolsonaro supporters across the country within 24 hours and is calling on police to arrest any protesters still left inside. CNN's Rafael Romo is tracking developments and has more now on the arrest in the capital. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AFFAIRS EDITOR (voice-over):  Brazil boiling over, supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro stormed key buildings in the country's capital Sunday, breaching security barriers and temporarily occupying the country's Congress, Presidential Palace, and Supreme Court. Masses of protesters flooded the country's seat of power, many dressed in the colors of Brazil's flag, yellow and green, fueled by anger and distress over Bolsonaro's defeat in a runoff election last October where he lost by less than 2 percentage points to current president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Protesters threw objects and scaled the roofs of buildings while clashing with police who responded with tear gas. At least one protester was seen sitting at the desk of Brazil's congress president. CNN Brazil reports the floor of the congress building was flooded after the sprinkler system activated when protesters attempted to set fire to the carpet. By evening, police began dispersing the rioters from buildings and arrested hundreds of people who were detained in buses before being taken to the police station. President Lula da Silva who was inaugurated just a week ago, described the events as barbaric and vow to punish the people responsible. LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL (through translation): Those people that we call fascists, we call them everything that's abominable in politics. They invade the government headquarters and they invaded the Congress like vandals, destroying everything in their path. ROMO (voice-over):  President Lula da Silva also blamed his predecessor for the lack of security in the capital where Bolsonaro's supporters have been camped out for over a week. Bolsonaro who is currently in Florida, denounced what he called depredations and invasions of public buildings in a tweet, adding that peaceful and lawful demonstrations are part of democracy. But critics say Bolsonaro may have stirred up the crowds by repeatedly saying without evidence, that he questioned the integrity of the country's electronic voting system. (On camera):  The intensity of Sunday's protest shows that last year's presidential election is still unfinished business for some resilience and a sign of just how divided the country is.

So, this claim has now appeared to have been rubbished both by Ukraine that appears to have been confirmed by various supporters, including as you said there, CNN. The question is, why would Russia put forward these claims? [02:40:01] Well, it might well be for their domestic political audience because remember just a week or so ago on New Year's Day Russia eventually had to admit that 89 of its soldiers had been killed after a strike by Ukraine on barracks where they were staying or an encampment if you like. Many of them were conscripts, if not most of them. And there was this embarrassing incident where Russia appeared to initially blame these particular soldiers for having been detected, saying that they had been using their cell phones in a manner that they weren't supposed to be doing. And as such, their positions had been detected. That was swiftly rebuffed by Ukraine as well. So, there's a bit of a propaganda and disinformation game going on here. As of course, the west continues and Ukraine continues to be on high alert for a mobilization of Russian counter offensive now that this unilateral ceasefire has come and gone. Over the course of the Orthodox Christmas weekend. One that was floated by Russia, rebuffed again, by Ukraine as a ploy to regroup and rearm by Moscow. And also, people looking further afield as the anniversary of this invasion gets going.
