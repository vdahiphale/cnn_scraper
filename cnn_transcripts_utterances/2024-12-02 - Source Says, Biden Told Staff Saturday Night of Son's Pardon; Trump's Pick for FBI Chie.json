I'll speak to the farmer behind this year's official White House Christmas tree. Good morning, I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. We begin with a new CNN reporting into President Biden's decision to pardon his son, Hunter. In a statement the president blasted Hunter's conviction, saying his political opponents targeted his son. Hunter Biden faced sentencing this month after pleading guilty to federal tax charges and his earlier conviction of federal gun crimes. CNN's Arlette Saenz is traveling with the president, joins us now with her new reporting. Arlette, what are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. President Biden issued this full and unconditional pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, which really marked a stunning reversal after Biden and his senior team had said for months that the president would not make this move. It also comes as Biden has staked so much of his political career on trying to maintain the independence of the judicial system. Now, President Biden came to this decision as he huddled with his family in Nantucket, Massachusetts, over the Thanksgiving holiday. I'm told that the president began informing his senior staff that he had made this decision on Saturday evening. He called up a meeting with them, some attending in person, others by phone when he arrived back at the White House to lay out his decision. And in that meeting, he also told his team that he wanted to prepare a statement to release on Sunday.The next morning, the team huddled together to iron out those final details. And, ultimately, the president released a statement saying that he made this decision as a father. He has long believed that Republicans have maligned unfairly his son, Hunter Biden. And in his statement, he said that he believes that these charges that were brought against Hunter Biden simply were made because he is the president's son. The president, in his statement last night, said, quote, here's the truth. I believe in the justice system, that as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process, and it led to a miscarriage of justice. And once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope that Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision. Now, this statement makes no mention of his reversal. You'll remember back in June, both before and after Hunter Biden was found guilty of those felony gun charges, the president emphatically said that he would not pardon him. Of course, he has now completely reversed course and is moving forward with that full pardon for his only living son.",

Arlette Saenz live for us in Angola, thank you so much.In the meantime, we're learning more about President-elect Donald Trump's pick to replace FBI Director Christopher Wray with one of his most ardent supporters. Kash Patel is a MAGA loyalist known for his extreme rhetoric. He's worked as a public defender and a federal prosecutor in the Justice Department's National Security Division. But Patel almost certainly will face an explosive confirmation battle in the Senate. He's vowed to take on the deep state, as he calls it, and says a Trump Department of Justice would come after members of the media. According to the New York Times, Patel's controversial track record includes being accused of nearly botching a high-stakes hostage rescue, wanting to shut down FBI headquarters in Washington, exaggerating his role in the Benghazi investigation, pushing Trump's Russia hoax as it's called narrative and promoting lies about fraud in the 2020 election. Here is Kash Patel in his own words. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

First of all, your reaction -- yes, your reaction to Kash Patel as the possible head of the FBI. REP.

Probably a majority of FBI agents voted Republican.This is not some bastion of liberal, you know, haven protecting progressive and liberal voices in our government in a deep state fashion, quite the opposite.

We just saw Donald Trump not only pardon, in his previous administration, his son-in-law's father, but now appoint him to be ambassador to France.

And the president suddenly decided, well, maybe the rule of law applies for the most part, but not as it pertains to my son. And so there's a bit of a double standard. I think a lot of voters out there look at this as, well, wait a minute here. Constantly, we were told that Donald Trump didn't respect anything, didn't respect institutions, didn't respect any of these things.
