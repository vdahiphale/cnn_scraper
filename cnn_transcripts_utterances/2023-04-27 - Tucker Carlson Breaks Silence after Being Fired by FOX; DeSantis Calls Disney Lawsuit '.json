We don't yet know what that message was. But \"The Wall Street Journal\" did report yesterday that Carlson had called a senior FOX News executive the \"C\" word.

So -- JOHN AVLON, CNN ANCHOR/SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. And maybe this was a move to kind of get ahead of that.

But today, she will have a few more questions from her attorneys on direct examination. But then she will be cross-examined by Trump's attorneys. And even the most experienced defense attorneys will tell you that is a delicate task. And we know they are going to try to paint her as someone who made this up for political purposes. And her attorneys did ask her, they did try to get ahead of this, you know, talking about whether she had any political motivation. And while she admitted to not liking Donald Trump politically, she said, \"I am not settling a political score. I am settling a personal score, because he called me a liar repeatedly. And it has really decimated my reputation. I'm a journalist. The one thing I have is the trust of my readers.\"",

We'll have a chat. Now, of course, that took on new significance after this whistleblower came forward in recent days, alleging that this whole investigation has been mishandled. And yesterday we spotted one of Hunter Biden's lawyers going into the Justice Department. We learned that the legal team met with at least one official from the tax division and one or two officials from the U.S. attorney's office. Now, of course, there's a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware who stayed on after the former president left to oversee this investigation. Now, our last report on the status of the charges was last summer. Our colleague, Evan Perez, reported that they had whittled down potential charges to a few tax crimes, one charge off possible false statements connected to the purchase of a gun. But nothing has happened for nearly a year. This is the first public event in this case. But at this point, it's unclear exactly what happened in this meeting. I was told not to expect a final disposition of the case. Hunter's lawyers really want to know what exactly is going on here. Are you going to charge him or not?",
