We have not heard or seen images that are anywhere similar to what it looks like in southern Beirut or in parts of southern Lebanon after Israeli airstrikes there hitting densely populated residential neighborhoods. In this case, the Israelis are saying that they were targeting military installations and the Iranian government, in what few statements have come out in the Iranian state media, have also indicated that Israel did in fact target, as one state media outlet described it, as military centers in three different provinces. We can show you a map of those provinces. It's Tehran province, Khuzestan and Ilam. Those were the provinces that were targeted. We will likely not see an extent of the damage if it was in fact military bases that were targeted because that is a national security secret for Iran. It won't want to telegraph that just as Israel didn't want to telegraph the extent of the damage caused by scores of Iranian rockets and drones that were fired at Israel on October 1st at Israeli air bases. Both sides trying to keep this somewhat quiet. If anything, the messaging coming out of Tehran is that, look. [03:05:00] Traffic is moving around Tehran as usual. It is business as usual right now. Where traffic was dramatically diverted is in the airspace in this volatile part of the Middle East, as the Israeli warplanes were flying to and from Iran. If you look at the flight tracker maps, you'll see that the air traffic, commercial traffic, was completely diverted, not over -- not only over Iran but also over its western neighbors, Iraq and Syria and Jordan. And it'll be a big question, I think. We may not get the answer of it, of what was the itinerary of the Israeli warplanes? What countries did they fly over, what were refueling exercises? Did they have to take place for the warplanes to be able to carry out these bombing attacks? The Israeli military, Paula, they say that all of their warplanes landed successfully back in Israel. And if that is, in fact true, then it would indicate that the Israelis succeeded in bombing multiple targets in Iran without losing a single plane to Iranian air defenses, which you could argue is quite a victory for Tel Aviv.",

What we do know is that the retaliation that Israel promised would take place is now taking place. The question will now be, does that end this particular cycle or does it start a new cycle? And if you look at how the direct attacks between Israel and Iran have taken place over the past year, this is actually the beginning of a new cycle in terms of the tit-for-tat. But the question will still be, is Iran now going to respond with its own retaliation? The media representation of this in Iran has pretty much downplayed these attacks.

What we've seen over the past year, I think, should really end this discussion once and for all. Unfortunately, it does serve as the stated motivation for a lot of these attacks and, unfortunately, what these attacks tend to do is place the region into a heightened sense of alert. It doesn't quote-unquote \"deescalate through escalation,\" which is the most incredible thing I've heard. Rather, all it does is risks plunging the region into further chaos and turmoil.

You have to keep in mind that Israel will calculate its own responses,keeping in mind that the United States is its closest ally, its indispensable ally and, thus far, a pretty, pretty solid ally in terms of not placing any conditions or restrictions in how Israel prosecutes the war on Gaza. How it proceeds in terms of strikes and invasion of Lebanon and, of course, these strikes on Iran. Having said that, I think the United States made it very clear to Israel that it does not seek a widescale escalation in the Middle East, which is the biggest danger when it comes to Iran, that this could unfurl into a massive, wide-scale regional war because that would bring in other actors in the region that the United States also counts on. And does not -- they do not wish to have this widescale regional war, either. So I do think that the Israelis calculated very carefully in terms of how they proceed with today. I think that the engagement of the U.S. in this regard was significant. But frankly, it also shows, when the U.S. wants to push Israel to modify its behavior, it can do so.

Well, as Kamala Harris continues to create a contrast between what an America under a Harris administration would look like and an America under a Trump administration would look like, when it comes to abortion rights, Texas is center stage. Texas is the biggest stage because Texas is one of the states with the strictest abortion bans. There is -- there are no exceptions for rape or incest in this state. And there's a very narrow exception for life of the mother. Now it's not just the star power that Harris has brought to Texas.

And that is so important because Trump has put forward in array of very specific proposals to use the military or the National Guard domestically in a second term. He's talked about sending the National Guard into blue cities to just patrol for crime, to round up the homeless, to participate in his mass deportation plan. And of course, most recently, to target in some vague way the enemy from within. It's really important to understand this is not just offensive rhetoric or kind of rhetorical excesses, this is Trump talking about using the military in a way that we have not seen through American history. And of course, maybe the most famous example I left out was in the meeting when they were -- when they were meeting in the White House before January 6th. And one of the White House counsels said, won't there be massive protests in the cities if Mike Pence overturns the election result? And one of the Trump -- the other Trump advisers said, that's what the Insurrection Act is for, which, of course, allows the president to use the military domestically.

Israel's security cabinet voted unanimously to approve the strikes. That's according to the prime minister's office. The vote apparently happened during a phone call hours before the attack. The White House is urging Iran to stop attacking Israel and put an end to this cycle of fighting. Now a quick reminder of what got us to this point. Back in January, Iran blamed Israel for the assassination of several of its military advisers and a missile strike in Damascus, Syria. That led Iran to launch an unprecedented large-scale drone and missile attack at Israel in April. July saw Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh killed in an overnight strike in the heart of Tehran. That was followed by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah being killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut, Lebanon, last month. Now in October, Iran launched dozens of missiles toward Israel in what it said was a response to those and other assassinations. And, of course, overnight, Israel responded to that, saying it's targeted Iran's air defense systems and missile production facilities.

You have some ultra-hardliners already, right now, hauling in version on social media for a third over to direct and kinetic ballistic missile barrage like you saw it back in April, like you saw earlier this October.

They used to have the terrorist infrastructure that you saw to the south of Israel with Hamas and what the October 7 terrorist attack did there. But again, the loss of that capability, given Israel's military successes to the south and vice versa the north, Hezbollah was long believed to be a kind of a conventional deterrent against Israel and to allow the Islamic Republic of Iran to develop the ultimate deterrent, which is a nuclear weapon. With Lebanese Hezbollah's leaders, operatives, midranking officials and lots of their arsenal out of the way, Israel is having military success, beget (ph) military success. And so the Islamic Republic really is indeed between a rock and a hard place here, particularly since early to mid September. If they escalate -- and there was talk about this back in April, as well as talk about this the aftermath (INAUDIBLE), if they escalate overtly, well then they'll have to keep pace with an adversary like Israel, which has clear escalation dominance. But if they don't respond at all, they set the tone, tenor and much more likely the predicate for an increasing series of a death by thousand cuts' use of military force by Israel against the regime or its proxies or both.",

I think you've even seen continued hedging by pro-American forces like Saudi Arabia right now, putting out a quick, short press release, condemning the strike.So I don't see anything indigenous or organic from the region being able to stem what appears to be a widening Israel-Iran cycle of violence. That, I think, is a role for outside players like Washington. That's why all eyes will be on Washington in the coming days.",
