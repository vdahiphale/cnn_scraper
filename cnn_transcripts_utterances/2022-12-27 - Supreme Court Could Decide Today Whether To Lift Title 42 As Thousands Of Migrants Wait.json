      "sentences": "The Supreme Court could decide as early as today whether to lift the Trump-era immigration policy known as Title 42. The policy used a public health rule during the coronavirus pandemic to allow authorities to quickly turn away migrants at the border.Now, some of those hoping for asylum in the U.S. are lining up at the Mexican border in anticipation that Title 42 will be lifted. Others, who have already crossed the border, are seeking shelter in El Paso, Texas. CNN's correspondent, Rosa Flores, has that part of the story.",

Will there be any reform coming from Washington? Joining us now is former secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff. So, Michael, thank you for being here. You know, the legal wrangling over Title 42 could end today or any time if the Supreme Court decides whether to lift the policy. The Department of Homeland Security says they're prepared for Title 42 to be lifted. They're making preparations. But from what you know of how difficult that will be, what is the task that's in front of them if this policy is lifted?",

      "sentences": "Well, what Title 42 allowed the government to do was simply to say to anybody that crossed the border, you have to go back to the other side of the border because of public health.Once that gets repealed, then people who come across the border who have a claim for asylum have a right to have it adjudicated. And sometimes as we've seen that takes a long period of time during which they will be residing probably in the United States. So what the administration is trying to do is speed up that process. Delegate the authority to people in the field to make the initial determination about whether there seems to be a reasonable claim of asylum. If there isn't they can be removed right away. If there is, then hopefully process them quickly. But in the meantime, you've got a place for them to stay in the U.S. that is safe and that doesn't overburden local communities. And I think what the administration wants to do is spread out among various parts of the United States the destinations to which people who are awaiting a lawful determination of their claim can wait in a place that's safe. The other thing is they're messaging very clearly that this is not the time to try to come across the border given the weather and the cold. And they're also targeting the smugglers groups who are deliberately trying to encourage a mass migration because they make money by trafficking in people who come to the U.S.",

And meanwhile, where I am here in Washington, there's really no movement to deal with the underlying policy issues behind this.When you were serving the George W. Bush administration, there were efforts being made, it didn't get through Congress. Do you see any possibility that there will be some political will to get this done, particularly on the Republican side? And I wonder if you think it's even possible to secure the border without dealing with the immigration laws that underlie it?",

This is a very troublesome story, as you have just said, this is the third incident and the second time he has been in concussion protocol. You know, Abby, he's a 24-year-old player and he has his entire life ahead of him. What the coach said sounded great, but meanwhile that same coach, the head coach of the Dolphins, said he did not notice anything during the game. Everybody watching on Christmas Day -- and of course you could see the highlights or whatever we would call this, the lowlights of this particular moment when his head hits. How in the world can that coaching staff, an army of coaches, how did nobody know how hard his head hit knowing the history for Tua and the fact that he has gone through this time and time again. Great questions to be asked about why this man was allowed to stay on the field. And, of course, now in concussion protocol. Hopefully, he's done for the year",
