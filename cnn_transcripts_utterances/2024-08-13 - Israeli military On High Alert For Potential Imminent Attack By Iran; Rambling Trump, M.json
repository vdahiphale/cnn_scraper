Iran and its Lebanon proxy, based proxy, Hezbollah, have warned Israel of retaliation after two high profile assassinations last month, the deputy leader of Hezbollah was killed in an Israeli air strike, while Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed while visiting Tehran.The strikes could come at a critical moment in negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza, scheduled to resume this week. The USS Georgia, a nuclear powered submarine armed with cruise missiles, is now en route to the Middle East, and the Pentagon has ordered the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group to hasten its arrival in the region, to join another carrier strike group already there. Meantime, as Israel waits, the military continues preparations to both defend the country as well as offensive operations.

The exact timing and most importantly, the scope and scale of such an attack are still unclear, but there's no question that there is real concern in this region at the moment about the possibility of further escalation, escalation that could potentially spiral this region further into conflict.The Israeli military says that it is now at quote, peak readiness, making preparations for both offensive as well as defensive scenarios here, increasing flights over Lebanon, where the key Iranian proxy of Hezbollah is based. At this hour, though they still have not made any changes to those Home Front Command guidelines giving no new instructions to civilians to prepare for the possibility of war. But even as these preparations are being made, there are still intensive diplomatic efforts being directed at Iran to try and get it to change its calculus, both the British prime minister as well as the German Chancellor speaking with the Iranian president, trying to urge restraint, trying to urge deescalation. And one of the key reasons for that, of course, is what's expected to come later this week, and that is on Thursday, when the United States, Egypt and Qatar are trying to convene Israel and Hamas for the next round of negotiations to try and finalize a cease fire agreement. Already, though there have been questions about whether or not Hamas will actually attend those talks. And then, of course, there's the possibility of this regional escalation, should an Iranian attack happen before those talks on Thursday, that could certainly put that effort into doubt and put the possibility of a cease fire that could really lower the temperature in this region even further into question.

They will keep the nuclear part in reserve before they use it, and they will use other means to attack.

This is very much in and of itself a message of deterrence to Iran and its proxies but it's more than that. To this point, the U.S. has described its force movement in the region as quote, \"defensive in nature\". But guided missile submarines that are armed with land attack, cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles are not defensive. They are offensive weapons with powerful ways of attacking adversaries. That's the threat the U.S. is putting on the table by publicly talking about the movements of the USS Georgia. It is a warning to Iran and its proxies that the U.S. has significant forces in the region and should Iran decide to escalate the situation, the U.S. may well be prepared to use those forces. But it's not just the USS Georgia. Austin also ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, which was in the Pacific Ocean just a couple of days ago, to speed up on its way to the Middle East. And that will add even more to the U.S. forces already there. There's the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group. There's an amphibious ready group in the Mediterranean Sea, additional fighter squadrons, including advanced F-22 fighters.
