First, the Mideast on fire. You can't have a region as disturbed as it is without a lot of chaos. Chaos is where Islamic groups regroup. And when we're seeing a regrouping of them in Afghanistan, with ISIL-K in Syria, in Iraq, in the wars in the region. Secondly, every day, as Avril Haines, the director of National Intelligence, has said, every day that the war in Gaza goes on, you're seeing a sea change in the Islamic and Palestinian world as they think about, you know, their future, their lives. Third, here in the U.S., there's been this almost normalization of violence, with more and more people being deranged and diluted, and therefore possible possibly attracted as this Texas driver who killed the 14 people in New Orleans.

At the same time, when you have the chaos that you have in the Middle East today, I was talking to an Israeli counterintelligence person, and he said they had identified 1300 separate groups of Islamic -- they could be small groups or even groups of hundreds emerging as clones or next generation versions of ISIS or ISIL.

I mean, if you go back to the Taylor Swift event, she was having a concert in Vienna where they would have killed probably 10,000 people had the terrorist attack not been disrupted.So the piece of good news in this, Fareed, I mean, I think it's part of the threat environment we'll have to live with. And I think the good news is that the intelligence agencies and the law enforcement agencies, the military have been working very hard. So I find a lot more thwarted or prevented terrorist attacks than the ones that succeed. Now, unfortunately, it's horrible when you have a success like the deranged fellow in New Orleans. But we live in a very dangerous world. Actually, Americans kill more of each other, you know, every week than we do -- than we have from Americans killed by terrorist attacks.

But on foreign policy, I want to ask you, do you really think that Trump is going to do something serious about Ukraine? You've been arguing for a long time that there is a deal to be had. The borders are not going to change. The Ukrainians need to accept that, and the Russians need to accept that Ukraine will get some kind of security guarantees.So my real question is, for that to work, Trump will have to pressure Putin because Putin needs to accept the deal. The leverage on Zelenskyy is obvious. We say we will withhold aid. What makes you hopeful that that could happen, that Trump could pressure Putin or try to pressure Putin? [10:20:00] HAASS: Well, first, what makes me optimistic is the situation on the ground. It's deteriorated slightly over the last few months, but after three years of fighting, Ukraine has essentially fought the Russians to a standstill. Second of all, Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine, seems to have come around to the idea that he's not going to militarily liberate the 20 percent of his territory that he's lost, and he seems to be willing to make a trade. Essentially, I will compromise for some type of a cease fire in place. I won't give up my long term claims in exchange for the security assurances about arms, what have you. So I think essentially the United States and Ukraine are pretty much at that point. Now we'll turn on to Putin. If Donald Trump really wants this agreement as much as he said, it's Vladimir Putin who stands in his way. Vladimir Putin clearly has manpower problems, not just we see it from the North Koreans, but increasingly anybody and everybody in Russia is being incentivized to join up for the military. He's got real economic problems. So I'm not suggesting Mr. Trump is going to get his deal in his day. But, you know, Fareed, I once wrote a book about ripeness. And you've got to have situations where people are willing and able to make deals. Well, Putin hasn't been willing. He's obviously able to make a deal. I think he's getting in the space where he's moving closer. He's going to be forced to be willing. And I think Mr. Zelenskyy is obviously able to make a deal if he wants. And I think he's now come around to that. So I think there's a decent chance 2025 will be the year that we will have serious movement towards a ceasefire.",

And I think President Zelenskyy has actually played the incoming Trump administration exactly as you say, Fareed.He understands his reliance on the U.S. and he's got to find a way to deal with President Trump. And I think he's doing that very effectively. What I hope will happen is that President Trump will hold true to his campaign promise that if Russia won't make a deal, he will open up the spigots and give Ukraine what it needs to win the war because Foreign Minister Lavrov is not sounding like there's any trade space.

And we have this really unusual situation today where in economic terms, if you look at America's share in the global economy is just below 30 percent.But if you look at the global stock markets and the main indices there, America's share in that now is approaching 70 percent. And I don't disagree with that. That America is the home of capitalism in many ways and of financialization and capital markets. But if you look at the last century, in more than half of those decades, the American stock market, in fact underperformed the rest of the world. So, it's not a straight line that America just keeps outperforming. And we go through these phases with the 2000s, the 1970s or even before that, when the rest of the world has done much better than America. But today we are in a space where there's a massive rush of capital into only one country, and there are fault lines that have been built here. And principally in that, I think, is the debt situation that today America's debt situation is in a league of its own. No country in the world today, at least, major nation is running a budget deficit of more than six percent of GDP. And that too, when you have pretty much full employment at such an advanced stage of the economic cycle, no other country in the world would be able to get away with that. And we're seeing the consequences of that from Brazil to U.K. to France. But America thinks that it can get away with it because it has got the world's reserve currency. It's the world's premier economy. I think that that situation is going to be proven to be unsustainable in 2025.",

It has got a very controversial leader at the top and yet the best performing market in the world in dollar terms in over the past year was Argentina.And I think that you've got a smattering of other -- of these countries in the developing world, you know, which are doing well. India gets some attention, but apart from India, there have also been some really surprising countries that are doing OK. There are some of these frontier markets from Sri Lanka to Kenya. But more than that, even in the mainstream emerging markets, if you look at even China, a country again, I've been very bearish on and we've spoken about, I feel the bearishness on China now is really overdone. People think that China is uninvestable and yet there are some gems to be found in that market because things have gotten so ridiculously cheap.",
