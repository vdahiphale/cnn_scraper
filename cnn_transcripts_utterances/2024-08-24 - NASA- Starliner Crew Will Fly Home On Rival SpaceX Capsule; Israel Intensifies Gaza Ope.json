      "sentences": "Well, Paula, NASA's top leadership says this was a really difficult and disappointing decision, but they believe it is the right one.In the end, it all came down to the astronauts' safety. It was a unanimous decision within NASA that made the call that this Boeing Starliner spacecraft with all of these helium leaks and thruster there are problems was simply just not safe enough to guarantee that Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, the two astronauts that have been up at the International Space Station since June would be able to get back to Earth safely on that spacecraft, and this was a unanimous decision. But during this press conference today announcing this decision, NASA leaders said that Boeing felt differently and of course, Boeing has so much on the line here. This program, way over budget, way behind schedule. Boeing put out a statement shortly after this press conference started and it reads: \"Boeing continues to focus first and foremost on the safety of the crew and spacecraft. We are executing the mission as determined by NASA, and we are preparing the spacecraft for a safe and successful uncrewed return.\" And so that Starliner spacecraft is now going to undock from the International Space Station sometime in early September and when it does, were going to find out if that spacecraft and its thrusters are going to be able to orient it properly, get that heat shield in the right place so that it can withstand those really hot temperatures on re-entry. Of course, no astronauts will be inside this time, but the reason that this has caused so much concern for the astronauts' safety within NASA is because there are echoes of what happened during the Columbia tragedy back in 2003. So during this press conference today, I asked the NASA administrator, Bill Nelson, who was a member of the committee that investigated Challenger. He was a senator during in the Columbia accident. I asked him how much did those tragedies and his role in investigating them impact the decision that he made here today with Starliner. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, it got extended to 80 days because of the thruster failures and the helium leaks.[18:05:10] And after doing some hot fire test of these thrusters, engineers were convinced that they were overheating causing Teflon seals to over- expand, over bulge restricting the flow of propellant, which degrades the performance. And that is pretty important because you want to make sure you're aligned, as was mentioned earlier, the capsule such that you protect with the heat shield as it comes in and you can be off by a degree or two or else, it could be a catastrophic failure. And I just want to mention that when the Columbia accident occurred, I was working as an engineer at NASA and someone coined a phrase of normalization of deviation that we start getting used to deviations than making exceptions and then will suffer catastrophic accident. And this is why NASA Director Bill Nelson said, hey, we are going to take the safest route because there are two lives at stake here and Butch and Suni are very good friends of mine.

Boeing is the blue chip enterprise when it comes to space and aerospace or was in this country and as we've seen on the commercial airliner side of things, somehow along the way, that strong engineering culture, which made it this aerospace giant, seems to have been forgotten or needs to be relearned. There is new management at the top. Let's hope that happens, but it is really sad to see that happen and Boeing has been a partner with NASA since the very beginning.

And this is where mass media, I am not saying you specifically, but keep parroting whatever number that comes out of Gaza within hours.

A British tech entrepreneur, his teenage daughter and five others died when the ship sank during a violent storm earlier this week.At first, authorities blamed the weather, but now a prosecutor says this ship may have sank because of the behavior of the crew and the way the boat was handled. Joining me now to discuss is Bruce Knecht, a former \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter and author of \"The Proving Ground,\" the story of the 1998 Sydney to Hobart yacht race that turned deadly. Bruce, are you surprised about this new manslaughter investigation? G. BRUCE KNECHT, AUTHOR, \"THE PROVING GROUND\": No, not entirely but I don't think that explains everything. I think it is a combination of extraordinary weather and I think the yacht itself, its design had some features that sets it apart from most yachts.

      "sentences": "Well, the first and most obvious one is the mast.For a time, it was the tallest mast in the history of sailboats, 246 feet, just extraordinary height, which they lit up like a Christmas tree whenever it entered the harbor. And the mast is not something that adds to stability. When you start rocking turbulence or high winds, it acts something like a pendulum. So that's the first one. The second one is the key -- well, it is on the screen right now, just at the center of the mast, there is sort of a lounge, a cockpit, quite large and it is below the level of deck and that sunken deck, if it were to be filled with water as has clearly happened in this case, it joined basically the living room of the yacht and the entrance was a double glass door that retracted in and out. [18:30:35] So one of the questions I'm sure the investigators are looking at is, was that door open, because if there was water in this essentially cockpit that would have turned into a swimming pool, it could have entered through that door. But I'm not sure that's quite decisive either, because the door, if there was a lot of pressure or water probably would have broken and some of the accounts from people on the boat talked about broken glass. I don't know that that's the case, but certainly one possibility. So the third issue is the keel. Most large sailboats have a keel that's fixed. This one was unusual and that it had a so-called lifting keel that change - you could change the height of the keel, the depth of the keel, from 13 feet below the water to 32, profound difference. But the truth is boats like this sail, they don't sail that much. You would want to have the keel down when you're sailing upwind. When you're motoring, which is what they did the day before they arrived at this harbor in the north of Sicily, we know through navigational records they went in a straight line, which certainly indicates that they were under power. When you're under power, you would never leave the keel down, because all that does is increase the drag, slow the boat down, and you burn more fuel. So it's those three things that together with this weather, I think, that explain what happened here.",

And I'm sure the crew, and that probably means the captain, because the captain ultimately has the responsibility, is the keel down, is it not. There were some people were on the deck at the time when the boat was knocked down, knocked down where the mast went flat to the water. That's when the water certainly entered.Should the crew have gotten everybody out of their state rooms, their bedrooms, on deck? Maybe. Should the keel have been fully set down? If it wasn't, well, that's going to be certainly an issue for the inquest. But there's also the design of the boat. Was it - you know, was it a boat that could withstand these conditions? I think most yacht designers would say that a yacht that's knocked down to 90 degrees, essentially flat to the water, should recover. Sailboats do that. I wouldn't say they do it all the time, but they do it. And they recover even going past 90 degrees. This is a boat that couldn't withstand that. So I think the designer of the boat, the manufacturer of the boat, when it comes to litigation, I think there's going to be a whole lot of directions that's going to go in and it's going to take - and this will be played out for a long period of time.

Anti-armor missiles, it's critical because the Russians have a lot of armored vehicles, including tanks. Counter-drone systems, this war is all about drones. And these counter-drone systems are going to help the Ukrainians really achieve a degree of security that they otherwise wouldn't be able to achieve.

So far, the United States has not allowed the Ukrainians to use the ATACMS far into Russia. However, if they do get that permission, that would put all kinds of Russian facilities, like in Belgorod, at risk. And that really would be a critical thing. One other thing that I'd like to point out real quickly, Paula, is this town right here at Pokrovsk. This is where a lot of fighting is taking place in the east right now. If that fighting continues, it could weaken the Ukrainian defensive line, and that could make a really big difference for the war.

      "sentences": "Yes, so the 12-team field is going to be unlike anything we've seen in this sport. Now, essentially how to break it down how it will actually work, the first four teams - excuse me, the first four conference champions, they will get top four spots. So that's going to be the ACC, the SEC, the Big Ten and the Big 12. They will get bids in addition to first-round byes.The fifth-highest ranked conference champion, so that's going to be your group of five team, Boise State out of the Mountain West looks like the favorite there, but keep an eye on the likes of Liberty, maybe even an Appalachian State from the Fun Belt (ph), they will get a bid as well. If they're ranked inside the top 12, that will be their seed. If they're outside of the top 12, they'll be automatically bumped up to that number 12 spot. So it's going to be really fun to kind of see how it plays out. In addition, seeds five through eight will be able to host first-round games. This is unlike anything we've seen in college football, teams being able to host meaningful playoff games in the first round. These campuses are going to be absolutely electric as they host these games in mid to late December. From there, the bracket just kind of plays out how a normal bracket would. In addition, the traditional bowls, like the Fiesta Bowl, Orange Bowl, Peach Bowl, all of those will also be incorporated into the postseason in those later rounds. So while there are rules for kind of seeding and first-round byes, there are real no set parameters for how many teams certain conferences can get in. So although fans may not like to hear it, we can very well see multiple SEC teams earn bids, multiple teams out of the Big Ten and the Big 12. So I'm interested to see how the committee kind of values certain conferences depending on how everything plays out and if they place an emphasis on stronger conferences or weaker conferences with respect to the number of bids. So it's going to be a lot of fun and really exciting, a lot of change, but I can't wait to see how it plays out.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean for fans, like I mentioned, the home playoff games, the fact that these schools will get to host playoff games is going to be so much fun. I mean, you talk about a typical college campus is dead during Christmas time in the middle of December. Now they're going - just going to be electric. This is going to be primetime matchup, so it's going to be so much fun.But as far as fans and certain teams, although it is expanding to 12 teams, there are going to still be plenty of teams left out. Florida State obviously last year left out of the 14 playoff despite being undefeated, but there are plenty of contenders across the country. The SEC Georgia and Texas, the favorites there wouldn't be surprised if they play in the SEC title game here in Atlanta, but also keep in mind Alabama, Ole Miss, a team - Lane Kiffin, he has one of the most talented rosters in Oxford that he's had since he's gotten to Ole Miss. But also don't sleep on a team like Tennessee and LSU. In the ACC, I mentioned Florida State being the preseason ACC favorite. They're still very much alive in that hunt, but this is a critically important year for Clemson. Dabo Swinney and the Tigers have missed out on the playoff each of the last four seasons, and he's been a head coach who's really actively pushed against the modern changes that we've seen with recruiting with respect to the transfer portal. Just a couple years ago, he was joking about using God's name, image and likeness to build his recruiting class. This is a critical year for him. Also a team like Miami in the ACC, I like them as well. They're really, really talented. It feels like this is the kind of Miami team that will finally take that offseason hype and momentum and translate that into on-field wins. But we've seen a lot of that happen in Miami teams in the past. In the Big Ten, the favorites there, Oregon coming in from the Pac-12, Ohio State. They'll actually play each other in late October in the regular season. And then the Big 12, one of the more fun conferences in the country, Utah's the favorite there. But just keep an eye on - it's really fascinating to see how it will all play out because there's a lot of unknowns with this new 12-team playoff, and I'm just excited to be along for the ride.",
