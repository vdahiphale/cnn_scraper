If you want to help decide who those two candidates are, the primaries are your best chance. It used to be that presidential candidates were selected at party conventions. It was mostly party members who selected delegates, who went on a convention to vote. Conventions still happen, but they`re mostly ceremonial since primaries have determined every candidate for more than 50 years. Here`s where it gets confusing, every state conducts their own primaries and none of them do it exactly the same. They`re spread over the course of months in a presidential election here, which is why candidates set up camp in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. If a candidate banks on Iowa and doesn`t win there, they might have to drop out.",

Did you know that from the moment they`re born, great white pups are all on their own. This summer swimmers at beaches across America are on the lookout for sharks. With more sharks found along the warmer shores on long island, New York State Park Police, they`re deploying an army of drones to monitor them and to help prevent attacks. Police gave CNN`s Clare Duffy, a hands-on demonstration at Jones beach in Long Island to see how these drones can help keep swimmers safe. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CPT. RISHI BASDEO, NEW YORK STATE PARK POLICE:  I can`t predict to say whether or not there`s going to be more bites of shark attacks, but what I could tell you is that because of the use of drones, the more drones that are flying in the air, there`s the more of a chance of seeing these animals in their natural habitat. CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER (voice-over):  This summer shark attacks here on long island have prompted a heightened sense of urgency to keep sharks and swimmers distant from one another. Now to New York where this drone footage shows about 50 sharks swimming near the beach of a state park in Long Island That`s where drones like the one that spotted 50 sharks at one beach come in.",
