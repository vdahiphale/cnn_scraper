      "sentences": "Another revealing day of testimony with David Pecker on the stand being questioned first this morning by the defense team. But, he has already said a lot because he has sat for testimony for more than six hours or thereabouts for prosecutors' questions. And when they had him on the stand, they used him to lay out the full arc of the scheme of the 2016 campaign of Donald Trump to make sure that negative stories about Trump related to alleged affairs he may have had with women would be buried, would not see the light of day to protect him as a candidate.And also, Pecker has highlighted the motivations. The way he has done this is explained three catch and kill schemes or three catch and kill situations, two of which the National Enquirer paid for. So, a doorman that came to the National Enquirer with a story about Trump that they paid for, took that story and made sure it did not see the light of day during the 2016 election. And then, Karen McDougal, a model actress who alleged a year-long affair with Trump, the National Enquirer bought the rights to her story and then made it. So, it was never published during 2016. Then, the third, Stormy Daniels, the National Enquirer didn't end up publishing that story. But, they also didn't end up buying that story from Stormy Daniels or the rights to it. But, David Pecker testified he was in touch with Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, who was deeply involved in the campaign, so that Cohen was able to take on the Stormy Daniels story himself. That's the core of the charges here. And Pecker has given quite an ark, put Donald Trump in the room and in conversations with him, talking about how he wanted these things to be buried during the campaign that that was a key motivation for him, as well as Pecker testifying that Donald Trump told Michael Cohen that he was furious or that Cohen told Pecker that Trump was furious when the National Enquirer didn't purchase the Stormy Daniels story. So, a lot for the jury to think about and to sue (ph) over as they look at this. But, we get the cross-examination now, Fred, and that's where the defense team is trying to highlight how often the National Enquirer was purchasing rights to negative stories about people and burning them. And then, also that the National Enquirer had a long history of giving Donald Trump a heads up in advance of negative stories that could be coming about him.",

David Pecker, it makes so much sense that he was the first witness called, and that's because he is setting the tone for everything. He is explaining what the catch and kill was. He is speaking directly to Donald Trump's intent. On the stand, during direct examination, he said that Donald Trump never mentioned his family. He never mentioned his daughter. He never mentioned his wife. He never mentioned his business. He was directly worried about the election, and that was the purpose behind these payments.So, that's a critical piece for the prosecution to prove. And therefore, David Pecker's testimony, really, really important to lay that foundation that will serve as those building blocks for the rest of the case.",

Now, that has to be in furtherance of another crime. The question then becomes, what's the other crime? Well, the district attorney during the examination of David Pecker said it relates to this New York election law, which says you can't conspire to impact an election through unlawful means. So, what's the next step to that? What are the unlawful means? Well, that's likely going to be this violation of campaign finance rules, meaning that these payments should have been identified as campaign contributions.So, David Pecker's testimony directly relates to that because the argument against that from the defense perspective is that these payments were done for any other reason other than the election. Well, David Pecker testified that this was directly related to Donald Trump wanting to be in the White House and his election efforts. So, you can see, it's a little bit of chain of logic --",

They're going to talk about that he has a non- prosecution agreement. So, there is an element of self-interest. And they're going to try and say that meant much of what Pecker testified to in his direct examination related to conversations that he had with Michael Cohen. So, they're going to try and take Trump and have him a million miles away from these conversations. That's going to be the defense goal.Now, keep in mind, prosecution gets the opportunity to do a redirect where they will clarify some of those points specific to Stormy Daniels because that payment, the timing, was at a time when prosecutors, as per their opening statement, the Trump team was in damage control mode because the Access Hollywood tape had just come out. So, they would do anything and everything to suppress the story because of the election, and that's why Pecker's testimony is so critical to the prosecution's case.",

But, of course, in order to do that, they'll have to get past the Israeli naval blockade of the Gaza Strip, and doing that will either require permission or perhaps some kind of confrontation.

They're not interested in going to Egypt with the aid either because they say that the land route there takes far too long, which is why they're going by sea anyways. They also would not accept a circumstance where the aid ship is allowed into the blockaded zone to unload, but the ship carrying mostly activists is not, because as much as this is about aid, it is also they make very clear about the principle of challenging that naval blockade, which they disagree with, though it's been in place now for more than 15 years.

At Emory University in Atlanta, 28 people were arrested, including two professors. A CNN crew witnessed police using a stun gun on at least one protester, who authorities say was resisting arrest. At least 33 people were detained at Indiana University after they refused to take down a tent encampment and disperse. And at Columbia University in New York City, the school says talks with protesters are ongoing and showing progress.Joining me right now from Columbia University is CNN's Polo Sandoval. Polo, great to see you. So, what is the mood like there on campus today? What do we know about these protests that have been turning violent, and now these talks? POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So, Fred, what we have heard from our colleague, Abby Washer, in some of the reporting is that some of those students, the pro-Palestinian students that are participating in that encampment, were told overnight by some of their group leaders there that what the university has offered, Columbia University has offered as part of these days-long negotiations, has fallen short of their demands, which remind our viewers really focused on divestment and on amnesty for the students and faculty that have been disciplined for participating in these protests. According to Abby's reporting, the students were also told that as part of these negotiations or conversations that are happening about a statement that would presumably come from Columbia University President, Minouche Shafik, in which we're told by the students that she would potentially address the incident from last week, which is when she turned to the NYPD and asked for assistance on campus to help clearing out a previous encampment. Last Wednesday, officially what we have heard directly from Columbia University and from the heads of these groups is that they are in fact making progress. So, these negotiations are certainly not at a stalemate. However, they are still far from over, according to what we've heard. Now, in terms of what the university is seeking, for starters, they really are hoping to -- for this encampment to be to be taken down, dismantled, if you will. So, I think that that's part of the longer conversation that is still continuing to happen. Well, we also heard from the university, they saying, look, they're making very clear, Fred, they have their demands, referring to the students, and we have ours. This is -- several people familiar with these negotiations have told me these are friendly and focused negotiations are happening, that the campus, the university, really hopeful that this will be -- this will come to a successful conclusion. However, they are also prepared to explore other options too, as they describe it, restore calm on campus, Fred. I have to tell you that we have been on campus. I've been allowed two hours at a time every day to be able to see for ourselves, and during the time that we have spent there, it has been calm. You do have that encampment that continues to grow. And just yesterday, there was also some shows of solidarity with Israel that was set up by some Jewish students. So, certainly evidence of a campus very much divided at this hour.",

But, what David Pecker did was set the stage about this conspiracy, set the stage how we got to Stormy Daniels, set the stage about this catch and kill scheme, and also give us some insight as to the mindset of Donald Trump and engaging in this catch and kill scheme, which later they'll be able to tie up when Michael Cohen, how we eventually got to the falsifying of business records.",
