      "sentences": "All of this stems from now false accusations that Crystal Mangum made in 2006 when she told police that three members of Duke's lacrosse team raped her after she was hired to dance at a team party off-campus.Well, three men were arrested and charged, David Evans, Collin Finnerty, and Reade Seligmann. But following much controversy over the investigation and national attention, North Carolina's attorney general dropped all of the charges. Here with us now is Ranjan Jindal. He is the sports editor at Duke's student newspaper. Wow, I mean, this is really a stunning admission, Ranjan. Nearly two decades later, this case is still gaining both local and national attention. What has the reaction been like on campus to this? RANJAN JINDAL, SPORTS EDITOR, \"THE DUKE CHRONICLE\":  Yes. No, it definitely has been. This case is something that, like you mentioned, happened 20 years ago. And in 2006 is when it all came down. And for a lot of people here, especially our age on campus, we were only 1 or 2. We weren't really alive for a good portion of it. And so I think that it has been kind of a wake-up call and a chance to retell a lot of the story that happened and the fallout from the case. In our story, we talked about, what happened after the case. I think a lot of people -- some people on campus when they hear Duke lacrosse case might think that the boys were charged or might not necessarily understand Crystal Mangum's circumstances. But there were a lot of unintended consequences of the case. And Duke lacrosse case still looms over campus. It affects social life, Duke- Durham relations and a lot of things. And so our goal in the story was just to kind of tell that story for a lot of people who weren't there and contextualize this apology and this admittal in the greater sense.",

And for a good portion of the time afterwards, a lot of people did think that the players were guilty of this. And they were -- they eventually had a game canceled and their season -- the rest of the season was canceled. The head coach of the time, Mike Pressler, was actually asked to resign and he had to move on from the Duke lacrosse team. He was the head coach at the time. But what a lot of people don't know is that the district attorney at the time, Mike Nifong, who was in charge of the case, was actually disbarred a year later for withholding DNA evidence that actually was the thing that exonerated a lot of these players. And so at the time, the players a lot of people thought they were guilty. But when the then attorney general, Roy Cooper, who was interestingly the former governor of North Carolina, dropped charges and said they were innocent, the season was still canceled. And a couple of the players transferred, had to transfer out, the ones accused. And it really still affected the relationship between the lacrosse team and Duke administration and Durham. So there are a lot of fallout effects to the case.",

It says: \"While traveling with a bipartisan congressional delegation in Luxembourg to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi sustained an injury during an official engagement and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation.\" Pelosi is currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals. She continues to work and regrets that she's unable to attend the remainder of the CODEL engagements to honor the courage of our service members during one of the greatest acts of American heroism in our nation's history.\" It goes on to say: \"Pelosi conveys her thanks and praise to the veterans with gratitude and to the people of Luxembourg for their service in World War II and their roles in bringing peace to Europe. She was personally and officially honored to travel with the distinguished delegation. She says that she looks forward to returning home to the U.S. soon.\" Now, this statement came from her spokesperson. But it obviously -- there are a lot of questions. She is someone who is really important to the Democratic Party, also someone who often leads and is part of these bipartisan CODELs when it comes to sort of marking these important anniversaries. It's unclear how many lawmakers were traveling with her. It's also unclear exactly what happened. As I said, this statement is a little bit vague still. So we're still talking to sources about exactly what took place. Obviously, everyone wishing her a fast and speedy recovery. (CROSSTALK)",

One source says the backpack recovered in Central Park and a burner phone found near the killing are among the focus. ABC News is reporting that the Manhattan district attorney's office is also presenting evidence to a grand jury. And as investigators search for a possible motive, there is a new twist. A UnitedHealthcare spokesperson says Mangione was not a member. Joining us now is James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University. He also wrote \"Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder.\" Thank you so much for joining us. So, are you surprised that Mangione was not a -- not part of UnitedHealthcare in any way?

And given the size and the prominence of this particular insurance company, it was an attack against the industry. And this particular victim, the symbolic takedown, as it was described, is also an attack at the industry. So it's not a surprise that he was not insured by that particular company.

FOX:  Well, the fact he went sort of quiet, underground. His family didn't hear from him. Over this period of time, it was likely he was thinking about what his next move would be and planning out this attack. So, it was quite deliberate, clearly. He had plans about how to get there, when to be there, when the conference would be held and where, and then, of course, his getaway.

And it's just like I'm speechless. What do you see there? J. FOX:  It's not just concern about the insurance industry and feeling that they're unfair. It's also the income inequality in this country, that we have CEOs who make a tremendous amount of money and large bonuses. At the same time, they are not treating the general public perhaps fairly. So there's lots of people getting rich at the top and the ordinary American is being -- is suffering at their expense. So that's -- it's partly insurance...",
