It was flabby and windy and flat 92 minutes. Somewhere in hell Fidel Castro is jealous. OK. It -- and I say this, I hope I have some credibility. I have been very rough in my criticisms of Joe Biden's performances. OK.So, it was stylistically flat, but worse than that, it was strategically dumb, except for that near death experience. The only thing we've been talking about for three weeks is this, is Biden too old? Trump never mentioned that. He changed the subject. As a Democrat I want to thank him. Somewhere in Biden headquarters in Wilmington they were thrilled with that speech. Why? Because for 92 very long boring minutes, we stopped asking whether Biden was too old and we started to ask, do we really want to go back to this nuttiness and weirdness and narcissism and chaos and hate? Let's call it what it is. So, Trump's set back -- the convention itself was great, except for the speeches by the vice presidential candidate and the presidential candidate. But other than that, it was a terrific convention.",

In the sense that, you know, we want to nitpick and figure out like, did Donald Trump change his tone? And I would say that I think he did. I don't think you saw a lot of the red meat. You didn't hear Crooked Joe. You didn't hear a lot of those type of descriptions. And, you know, I take exception to what Paul said about, you know, bringing up Joe Biden's age. I mean, I think that is something that may -- Trump may have done pre last Saturday. I do see your point in terms of, you know, the beginning of the speech was pretty emotional and you could tell that certainly what happened last Saturday had an impact on him. But to say that he was going to change his tone completely and forget what has happened in the past, I think was a mistake, you know, on many people's parts and probably mine as well. But I think near the end of the speech too, I think you saw a different side of Donald Trump where he talked about bringing together both sides of the aisle and every walk of life here in the U.S. and that we have to accept the fact that in order to get things done, we're going to have to come to agreement.",

And, Paul, yours was the first in '92 with the Clinton campaign and then again with Obama in '08 and then Trump in '16. I think, you know, we're dealing with an organization here that's playing chess while the rest of the folks are playing checkers. And we're seeing it play out on the Democrat side. And I think Donald Trump, certainly his tone and his -- you know, it's volume certainly was a lot less than it had been. And the interactions that you saw with him in the crowd and actually, you know, I had an opportunity to go backstage last night after the speech, and how he resonated or communicated with people was much different than I think we've seen in the past.",

But new reporting reveals the struggle facing Democrats as calls for Biden to exit the presidential race continue to grow. One Democrat tells CNN that no matter what the party does, it will hurt their chances at beating Donald Trump this fall, describing the situation as being caught in what they call a \"doom loop.\"With us now, the reporter on that story, Isaac Dovere. And also, sharing her insights, CNN political analyst and PBS NewsHour White House correspondent, Laura Barron-Lopez. We love the news hour over there at PBS. Love our friends over there. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST AND WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR:  Thank you. ACOSTA:  Isaac, let me start with you. We were just having a conversation about all of this and we had to cut it short because we were coming back on the air. But during the commercial break, you know, you and I were talking about, I mean, people should not be surprised if Joe Biden stays in this race. Despite all of this pressure, everything that's building around him, he might just stay in. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes. Look, there are some people who are under the impression that he is just living on a different planet, not taking this in. He is taking the information in, he is considering it, but he is also seeing information that points in the direction that maybe even for all of it, he could end up being the better bet for Democrats. Obviously, people have very different opinions of that. What is going on around him, though, is that even people who work for him in the White House and on the campaign, people who after the debate, for weeks after the debate, were saying, we're good, we're going to keep going, have, in the last week, started to feel the weight of this on them. Feeling like, even if they could try to make a case, it just is too much. One person said to me, it feels like it's game over at this point. That person said that to me yesterday. That person was not someone who was in that place even a couple of days ago.",

But I was talking to Congressman Veronica Escobar, national campaign co-chair for the Biden campaign. She makes a pretty good point. She made a good point on this program. And that is, you know, there's a lot of Democrats who are saying the president should get out of the race, they're not doing it publicly.We have 23. There are some 200 Democrats in the House. There are only two Senators who are publicly calling on the president to get out of the race. Does she have a point? BARRON-LOPEZ:  She does. I mean, the majority of lawmakers have not weighed in here yet. They are privately. I mean, a lot of the Democratic lawmakers that I've talked to do think that he should get out of the race, but they're not willing to go public just yet. One thing that I'm hearing from them, though, is some are saying that if they don't see a change from President Biden that they will go public by Monday. A lot of them feel as though Monday is kind of a key date for them, because the closer we get to the potential roll call vote on -- which would happen around August 1st for the Democratic National Convention, that nominating vote, they think that the soon -- something needs to change sooner rather than later. A lot of the Democrats that I talked to say that they feel as though, you know, it's doom and gloom, which I know that someone told you it was a doom loop, and I was like, a Democrat called it doom and gloom to me. And they -- even the ones that are supportive of Biden privately say they don't know if he is going to ultimately be able to survive all of this swirling, especially from Democratic leaders.",

They said there was going to be unifying, they said there would be a new tone.

I have to think, the president and his team inside the campaign are saying, no, we want to stay in and beat that guy.BARRON-LOPEZ:  They are. A Democrat I was texting with this morning said that the campaign felt emboldened by that Trump speech last night. And I think you've seen it in their response this morning because they've been coming out in full force, whether it was the campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon on MSNBC this morning saying he is in it. They also sent talking points out to Democrats last night saying President Biden has not talked to congressional leadership. He is the nominee and he is going to beat Donald Trump. So, there's a rallying effect right now. Also, Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Dems, their political campaign arm formally endorsed Biden just this morning.

Gershkovich was on a reporting trip last year when he was arrested and later accused of spying for the CIA, but Russian authorities never presented any public evidence to support their claims. Gershkovich, The Wall Street Journal, and the U.S. government have all vehemently denied those charges. In a statement, The Journal slammed the \"sham conviction\" and vowed to keep fighting for their reporter's release. Nearly a week after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, we have new reporting this morning. The gunman's online trail is giving officials a sense of his mindset before the attack. Thomas Crooks looked up information on Michigan mass shooter Ethan Crumbley and his parents and checked out websites detailing how to build explosives. Plus, moments before firing his AR-15 style weapon, he took a screenshot on his phone of the Trump rally live stream, despite law enforcement flagging him as suspicious then losing track of him for 19 minutes. Trump staffers had no idea of the threat perched on the rooftop yards away from the stage. I'm joined now by former FBI senior profiler and special agent Mary Ellen O'Toole. Mary Ellen, great to see you. It's been a while. Good to catch up with you. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on this case because many mass shooters leave behind manifestos or writings to explain what they're going to do. Yet, Crooks left behind very few clues. What do you think? MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, FORMER SENIOR FBI PROFILER AND FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT:  He did apparently leave behind fewer clues, but that probably is really part of his personality. He seems like a loner. He seems like someone that is very, very careful about what he leaves in as far as his footprint on social media. So, that may be the best that we have once the investigation starts to wind up. Hopefully not. Hopefully, they'll uncover more. And what happens with a lot of crimes, not just these mass shootings, the law enforcement and especially FBI profilers, we're really used to making inferences about motivation. So, you have violent offenders that commit terrible crimes, but they never tell you exactly why. So, from the forensics and the crime scene behavior, you infer why they did it. And there's a lot there right now that allows investigators to make those inferences. And certainly, one of them is this is a young man who was extremely mission oriented and he picked a very -- he couldn't have picked a more high-profile target. Just not even possible. So, when you combine those two, that really does suggest that he wanted a lot of attention brought to his behavior, even though he was -- he had to risk his life to do that.",
