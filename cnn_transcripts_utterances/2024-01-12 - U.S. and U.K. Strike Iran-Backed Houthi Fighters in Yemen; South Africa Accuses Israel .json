Appreciate your company.We begin with breaking news and concerns about a possible widening of conflict in the Middle East. The U.S. and U.K. have been striking Houthi targets in Yemen following a surge of attacks by the Iran- backed rebels against commercial vessels in the Red Sea. Have a look at these images that came in a short time ago, showing American fighter jets taking off from the U.S.S Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier. A senior U.S. military official says it's unclear what percentage of Houthi assets were destroyed inside Yemen. But he said the amount was significant. The Houthis say they're retaliating. We're told U.S. and coalition forces hit more than 60 targets at 16 Houthi locations. And those targets included the militants' radar systems, along with storage and launch sites for ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and drones. And I can show you where they're located. You can see there on the map. The U.S. has carried out strikes against Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria in recent months, but this is the first known strike against the Houthis inside Yemen. A clear sign of the growing alarm over the threat to international shipping in one of the world's most critical waterways. The U.S. president issuing a statement: quote, \"These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world's most critical commercial routes. I will not hesitate to further direct measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.\" U.S. officials say the strikes targeted weapons used in Houthi attacks on commercial shipping, attacks that have been going on for weeks now.

All right. Turning now to Washington, I want to bring in CNN military analyst and retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Good to see you, sir. So do you expect this to be short, sharp, and focused, or if the message isn't received, could it broaden? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Michael, I think it could broaden. And I know the Pentagon is optimistic that they will have a short and sweet, so to speak, effect on the Houthis and make them really, in essence, stop the type of activities that they've been doing in the Red Sea. But I don't think that's going to be the way the Houthis are going to handle this. What they will probably do is they will try to redouble their efforts. There will have to be some restrikes of some of the targets that were hit. And there'll probably be some new targets that the U.S. and the U.K. and other countries will probably have to engage before this is over.",

So that process has probably grind to a halt -- ground to a halt at this particular point.And you also have a situation where this kind of activity on the part of the U.S., the U.K., and other countries, has the risk of igniting this conflict in a different way, perhaps, than it was originally. And that will, I think -- creates some other dynamics within the region, and some of those can't quite yet be foreseen. HOLMES: It's not a strike on Iran, not directly, but it's a strike on a longtime Iranian proxy. How might Iran respond at all? And would a direct response be, you be, be direct or through proxies? I suppose it could -- it also could happen anywhere in the region, right? It could happen in Syria, Iraq.",

But it's most likely to occur in the Middle East but probably through proxies, because the Iranians don't want to, at least not yet, they don't seem to want to directly confront the U.S. and its allies.The other aspect of this is that the proxies that Iran has aren't necessarily as directly controlled as we sometimes think they are by the Iranians. So the Houthis might have one idea, whereas the Iranians and Tehran might have a different idea of how to proceed with this. So I think the Iranians are going to be cautious, but I think there is a risk that this could further inflame tensions, and there might be some sympathetic strikes in places like Iraq or Syria that will be tied to this action in the Red Sea.",

And it's certainly better for the U.S. and its partners in this operation that the Israeli is not be involved in it. So I think this was something that happened because of what the Houthis were doing primarily.

It is a critical waterway that sees some 15 percent of the global shipping trade pass through it. So there were more than a dozen strikes, mostly in the Western part of Houthi-controlled Yemen, in and around the capital, Sana'a, over here on the coast. And then up here in Saada, we saw this video of the night sky glowing after these strikes. In just a moment, you'll see another strike right there. In terms of the targets that were hit -- this is both according to the Pentagon, as well as the Houthis -- air bases and airports, camps, radar systems, drone storage, and launch sites. Drones have been central to those Houthi attacks. You have ballistic and cruise missile storage and launch sites that were hit, as well as coastal radar and air surveillance capabilities. Now, in terms of what was used in these strikes, you have fighter jets from both the U.S. and the United Kingdom. This is one of the British fighter jets that was taking off in order to carry out an airstrike. You also have ships and submarine platforms that were used, according to the Pentagon. One of the submarines that was named was the U.S.S Florida. It's a guided missile submarine. The ships and submarines are able to fire Tomahawk missiles against those -- those targets on Yemeni soil. Now, to what extent the U.S.S Eisenhower carrier strike group was used, we don't know. But it has been in the region to try to deter any regional actors, including the Houthis and Iran, from expanding the conflict that we are seeing currently between Israel and Hamas. The Houthis warning that they would retaliate against any international strikes. And the U.S. saying that they and their partners are prepared for that in the wake of their strike, saying this may not be the last word in terms of military action against the Houthis.

Then secondly, that ties up transport capacity and equipment for longer, which leads to tight supply in freight markets. And that leads us on to the second point, which means increased costs, which is also twofold. So firstly, there's longer sailing distances. That means more fuel costs to operate the ships. And then, in addition, the tightening of the shipping market itself increases the freight rates when customers need to compete for the available slots. Now that's where the costs really start to skyrocket and benefit the companies facing near these types of markets, especially as the supply of number of ships is very inelastic in the short term.",

But again, the U.S. led the coalition operation prosperity audience proven it effectively can intercept widescale attacks and should provide some comfort for the merchant fleet. Up until now, we've seen thee effects -- these attacks being nouns. But it truly does show how fragile supply chains are. It's not the first time there have been closures before.

And that tends to be huge positive for an industry that that is generally characterized by very fierce competition and high efficiency necessary among the operators to survive.

The rebel group has vowed to, quote, \"tread on America with our feet\" and called on the world to prepare for America's defeat.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: So those targets in the town in the Southwest of Taiz and the Western port city of Hudaydah along the border or close to the border with Saudi Arabia, the town of Saada and also around Sana'a, the capital, those targets there at radar sites; at ballistic missile launch and storage sites; cruise missile launch and storage sites; drone -- drone launch and storage sites. Those are intended, as the coalition says, as the United States says, to send a message, but they're intended to degrade the Houthis' ability to target shipping in the Red Sea. But already, the Houthis are saying that they are going to respond against U.S. and U.K. interests. It was U.K. Typhoon fighter jets that -- that targeted two different sites. It was United States missiles and fighter aircraft that targeted other sites. So Houthis say that they're going to respond, that it's not quite clear how they'll respond to U.K./U.S. interests in the region. How will they respond? The potential here for escalation is very real. And it could be that the Houthis continue to try to target shipping in the Red Sea to send a message. Remembering, of course, that after October 7, they began by trying to target Israel, by selling cruise missiles to Israel, and that some of those were intercepted by the United States by the U.K., and also by Saudi Arabia. So there are a number of different ways and places that the Houthis can target back. They've had a long-running war against Saudi Arabia that only just ended not so long ago, where they were sending long- range cruise missiles to the capital, Riyadh. They've sent drones into the United Arab Emirates. So there's a number of ways that they can destabilize, in their own view, U.K. and U.S. interests in the region by doing it not just in the Red Sea, but more broadly across the region. So the concerns of the Saudis about the potential for escalation are very real. They've been worrying about the October 7th attacks, Israel's response to that; escalating tensions; the Northern border in Israel with Lebanon and Hezbollah. All these Iranian-backed proxies trying to stoke tensions in the region. And the Houthis are the one that seem to have precipitated this particular escalation. The Saudis, of course, are saying that the -- the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea is of vital importance to the region. So that a lot -- while they are not part of that military coalition in the Red Sea, they are clearly giving it a green light to go ahead. But this potential right now, depending on the Houthi response, this is a very, very volatile time right now. Nic Robertson, CNN, Tel Aviv, Israel. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And the major threats that we saw in 2023 was an alarming rise in two particular types of actions by states in -- that make up the international community.One is double standards, where we saw a kind of selective outrage being implemented by states. A prime example of this is states like the United States and member states of the European Union, who rightly and loudly condemned the attacks on October 7th in Israel but were much more muted when it came to Israel's response and the bombardments and the deaths of civilians in Gaza. And the other big trend that we saw was that there was a -- there was this alarming move into what we refer to as transactional diplomacy. And that's where governments were prepared to sort of turn a blind eye to domestic human rights abuses in countries, so that they could advance their short-term political gains, whether they be security or to secure energy deals or trade. And a prime example of this has been Australia and the U.S. rolling out the red carpet for Prime Minister Modi of India, completely ignoring the fact that there has been an increase in repression under the Modi government, particularly of ethnic minorities, free press and civil society. So what we are calling for and what needs to change is that we need to see more consistency and commitment to the rules of international law, of human rights law, and principled decision-making by states. Because if we don't see that, then there's a real risk that the system that we rely on for our own fundamental rights and freedoms will come -- will be questioned.

Usually, closing arguments are an opportunity for lawyers to summarize their theory of the case.REID (voice-over): And the day kicked off with Trump's lawyer, Chris Kise, laying out their theory of the case, arguing that this is a political persecution; and that his client, Trump, had no intention of defrauding banks; and that the banks were never harmed. But after Kise wrapped his remarks, he then asked if his client could have a few minutes to address the court. And look, the judge granted it, saying, I'll give you five minutes. And the judge had previously set a restriction on Trump, saying you can participate in closing arguments, but you get give a campaign speech. And that's exactly what Trump did: attacking the judge, attacking the attorney general's office, and insisting that he is a, quote, \"innocent man.\"",

So it appears that he got a real return on investment here in terms of amplifying his argument that he is being targeted because of a desire by his political opponents to try to, quote, \"interfere in this election.\"But I want to note something that the attorney general's office said in their closing arguments. They noticed that, even though Chris Kise talked for two hours, other attorneys got up and laid out their closing arguments, not one person addressed the false financial statements that Trump submitted that misrepresented his assets by billions. And those are really the key to this case. Paula Reid, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

His attorney argues that the charges are part of a political hit job. Republicans have accused President Biden of benefiting financially from his son's business dealings with Ukrainian and Chinese companies. These claims have not been proven. The judge has set Hunter Biden's trial date for June 20. The U.S. military has not properly tracked more than $1 billion worth of weapons for Ukraine. That's according to a new report by the Pentagon's inspector general. The weapons belong to a category that requires enhanced monitoring after their exports, things like Javelin missiles, and night vision equipment. The watchdog says it is outside the scope of its investigation to find out what happened to them. But the Pentagon suggests there's no reason to believe foul play was involved. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. GEN. PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: No credible evidence of illicit diversion of U.S.-provided advanced conventional weapons from Ukraine. We do see some instances of Russia continuing to spread disinformation to the contrary. But the fact is, is we observe the Ukrainians employing these capabilities on the battlefield. We're seeing them use them effectively. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
