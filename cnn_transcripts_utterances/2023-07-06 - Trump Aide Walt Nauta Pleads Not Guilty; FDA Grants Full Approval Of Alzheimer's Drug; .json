And yet, of course, no sign of the man himself even as we had that video released. The timing also of what we heard from Alexander Lukashenko today, the Putin ally, remember, who had offered refuge to Yevgeny Prigozhin, the idea was, Jake, that as part of this deal, it wasn't just Prigozhin who would stay in Belarus, it was his Wagner troops that would be moved there.

And what flight tracking websites suggest is that his planes have been going back and forth.Now, if he is indeed in Russia and going to and from Russia with impunity, that does suggest a certain weakness on the part of Russian authorities, on the part of the Kremlin. Insisting today, Lukashenko did, that Vladimir Putin and Prigozhin went back some 30 years, it may be, Jake, that the criminal investigation is going on for purposes of propaganda showing that they are acting against him. But what analysts suggest is that Putin himself may have been convinced by the idea that Yevgeny Prigozhin was actually, as part of that coup, targeting some of the leading generals that are involved in the war in Ukraine, and may in fact, be allowing him home. Some Russian news websites suggesting that he may even have been able to get back some of his money, some of those weapons that has -- have been seized. Of course, there are so many questions about the actual dependence of the Kremlin on this huge structure that was that is Wagner, not just in Ukraine and Russia, but in Africa and the Middle East. Are they simply too dependent that they had to let him back and negotiate? For the time being, we've seen no sign of the man himself since the coup happened and since we understood he'd gone back to Belarus, Jake.",

The U.S. is there as part of the coalition to defeat ISIS, while Russia's military is there basically to support the Assad regime. And because they're operating in the same airspace, there are supposed to be deconfliction protocols between the two militaries. The problem is, according to the U.S., Russia has increasingly, as of late, ignored those deconfliction protocols or simply approached U.S. military bases or in one case even tried to dogfight a U.S. Aircraft.And the video you see now is but the latest example of what we're seeing. This is from yesterday over Syria, video from U.S. Air Force Central command, where the air force says three MQ-9 Reaper drones that were taking part in a mission against ISIS were suddenly approached by three Russian fighter jets. But that's not all, the Russian fighter jets dropped parachute flares. What you saw as those essentially streaming parachute objects right in front of the drones and forcing them to take evasive maneuvers. And one Russian fighter jet even lit its afterburner in front of a U.S. drone forcing it, again, making it difficult to operate there, Jake, and the U.S. is seeing more and more of this.",

Essentially, he spoke to the FBI, they tried to get him to flip, and not only did he not cooperate, he lied to the FBI.

Let's remember, this is a jury that's going to be drawn from South Florida, where Donald Trump is quite popular. And I heard Governor Christie also say, well, jurors are selected carefully. They're asked about to their -- to put aside their personal beliefs, their political beliefs, and to decide the evidence just based on what they see in the courtroom, which most juries are good at doing.

I've reached out to Beyonce's team for comment and they haven't responded. So we don't exactly know why. But here is what the stadium tweeted. They wrote due to production logistics and scheduling issues, unfortunately, the August 3rd Pittsburgh stop of the Renaissance World Tour will not be taking place.They go on to say that refunds will automatically be issued at the point of purchase. And if you have any questions or issues regarding your ticket order, please contact your point of purchase. But I do want to point out that the mayor of Pittsburgh, Ed Gainey, he took to Twitter and he said that they are deeply disappointed and that they actually had a whole thing planned for Beyonce and that they were going to dedicate the day to her and to honor her for all of her success and achievements. And he goes on to say that they are in touch with the promoter of the event in order to gain an understanding about what exactly happened and if there's any possibility that they can reschedule this and get her to Pittsburgh. But like you said, Jake, this isn't the only wrench in the upcoming tour, which is going to kick off in a few days. They have postponed two shows, but they rescheduled those dates. One in Kansas City that was postponed about a month, and then the other in Seattle that was pushed back about 24 hours. Now, again, they have come out these venues and said, if you have a ticket to the Kansas City or the Seattle event or if you're watching this right now and you're concerned about your ticket at one of these shows, they say that they will honor that. But obviously, Jake, not everybody might be able to make those other dates. But, you know, again, we've reached out to Beyonce and her team for comment. And I think it just goes to show you, though, that even a big star like Beyonce, whose tour has been acclaimed so far internationally, that even she too, can have some issues. It's not always perfect. Jake?",
