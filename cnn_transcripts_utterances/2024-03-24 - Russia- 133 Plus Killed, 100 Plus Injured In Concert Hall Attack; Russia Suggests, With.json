Ukraine strongly denying any such thing. The U.S., which warned of a terror attack in Russia weeks ago, says there is no evidence whatsoever that Ukraine played a role. In fact, Vice President Kamala Harris says the U.S. knows that ISIS-K, based in Afghanistan, is responsible and ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack.

They would do their best to find the so-called Ukrainian trace. And so when Putin spoke and addressed the nation today, it was no surprise to me whatsoever.

And she described what happened after what she now describes as major surgery in January, a recovery process, then the news that they had found some signs of cancer, and then into chemotherapy in late February.And then there was this really key process for the princess, which was how to deal with the children, to reveal it to them, to help them understand it, and then at that point they could reveal it to the world. So that announcement was very much timed for the end of the school term, at which point they could reveal it to the world whilst protecting their children. So they're really calling for privacy at this point. We will be seeing Prince William at public engagements, but not nearly as much as we're used to. Kate will try to go out on public engagements if she can, but really she's not going to be out full time until she's been given the all clear from doctors. So they're calling for everyone to respect their privacy, the media, but also the public. And then you have a question about what happens at this place, Buckingham Palace. You know, there's a huge amount of pressure at the top of the royal family right now. There were four senior royals in full-time public duties, now we have two, they are Queen Camilla and Prince William, both of whom have partners who have spouses who have cancer, and they have families to worry about. But they also have to represent the monarchy. But as the late Queen, Queen Elizabeth, used to say, you have to be seen to be believed if you're in this role. So they understand, they have to represent monarchy out in public, but they've got to balance that with, you know, a really tough, traumatic time back at home. That's a big challenge going forward.

One is to be just honest about what's going on. But to, of course, do that in language that people can understand, words that children can understand. It's important to, of course, balance too much and too little information. So be transparent in a way that that you think is appropriate. But some -- some common things that often people forget. One, don't forget to tell the children about physical changes that may happen. Better to get ahead of that story so that they know ahead of time what to expect. We find that that is a really important concept. Let them ask questions. And then finally, understand that sometimes children blame themselves and will not necessarily communicate this to you.

But also every time you're at your primary care physician asking that question, what is the right cancer screening plan for me? Have the conversation, prompt the conversation yourself, because it is much more than just about your age. It's about your age, your family history, and your own medical history and exposures to develop the right -- this right screening plan for every individual.

And in a statement, President Biden emphasizes that this keeps the government open. He says it invests in the American people and strengthens the economy and national security.But he also acknowledges this was a compromise and not everyone got everything that they wanted. And you are seeing both sides emphasizing what they say they're getting out of this bill. For example, there are 2000 new Border Patrol agents funded as part of this package, 8000 more detention beds for migrants. And you hear Republicans emphasizing how this bill strengthens security on the southern border. What you hear Democrats emphasizing is the billion dollars for federal child care and education programs like Head Start and the 120 million dollars for cancer research also included new money for Alzheimer's research. What this bill also does is cut funding to the U.N. agency that's responsible for getting aid to the Palestinians. The Biden administration has accused some members of that agency of aiding Hamas. Now, in that statement, President Biden does point to the next big funding battle on Capitol Hill, which is this fight over more aid to Ukraine. And you'll remember President Biden has requested 60 billion dollars in additional assistance for Ukraine. That has stalled on Capitol Hill as many Republicans, particularly those closely aligned with the former President Donald Trump, say that they won't approve any more assistance to Kyiv. President Biden has said that this is necessary. And you are hearing ever more urgent calls from the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has said that if American aid dries up, that Ukraine could lose this war. Now, the House has gone on break for Easter for two weeks, so we won't see any movement on that Ukraine aid in that span. What we do understand is that the House Speaker Mike Johnson has tasked members of the House with coming up with some options for providing that Ukraine aid. But it remains very unclear at this moment how that will move forward. And in this statement, President Biden says that it's time to get this done. Kevin Liptak, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
