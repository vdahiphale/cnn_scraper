Welcome to the program everyone, I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The science is clear as it's always been. The climate crisis is existential and humanity is  still not doing enough to prevent catastrophe. A new report from the United Nations warns that at our current rate, the world is set for disastrous overheating, 2.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, which is way higher than the goal of 1.5. The director of the U.N. Environment Program warns that these findings bring with them a hard truth, saying, \"in waiting so long to act on climate change, humanity has denied itself a chance to make a slow and orderly transition to a safer and more sustainable future.\" The U.N. report comes amid a spate of new studies. The World Meteorological Organization finds that methane levels are rising dramatically. And the leading medical journal, \"The Lancet\" reports that climate change is damaging public health around the world. All the while, gas and energy giants recording massive profits as ordinary people struggle with skyrocketing bills. This weekend, world leaders will gather in Sharm El- Sheikh, Egypt for the COP27 Summit. Where once more, they'll try to come up with a way to reverse this. And I speak about what needs to be   done now with Simon Stiell; he's the United Nations Climate Change Chief. Simon Stiell, welcome to the program.",

The price points to make this commercially feasible are there. And we're seeing some incredible -- as if developments on that front. But what we need to see is more of that.

And so first, I guess, for our audience, just a clarification of what's the difference between subscribing to an idea, and a meme. EMILY DREYFUSS, CO-AUTHOR, \"MEME WARS\": So any idea has the potential to become a meme, but it only becomes a meme if it resonates and can go viral and travels through cultures and through people. So one of the memes that this attacker that this violent attacker we know was interested in and share it online is a meme called it's OK to be white, which is a slogan. People sometimes think of memes as only being images with some text over them on the internet. But a political meme, a meme predates the internet and can be anything from a hash tag to a phrase to an image and this, it's OK to be white campaign that this person who attacked Paul Pelosi subscribed to and cared about Joan and I and our co-author, Brian, have looked into deeply and it was a disinformation campaign left on the internet for folks like this person to find, and then be taken down the rabbit hole with. It seems like this person who then ended up attacking the husband of the Speaker of the House was inspired by a lot of these resonant ideas, these resonant memes that have come to him via the Internet and other ways.

And then more people hear about it sort of, you know, in January 6 you started to see that where I mean, stop the steal, as you all point out, that wasn't by accident that that phrase sort of trended but then with the words that the President was saying, and with what was happening in real time, you saw kind of an evolution of things.",

So stop the steal was thishashtag phrase that was actually coined by Roger Stone, who registered a website called Stop the Steal in 2015. Because he thought that Donald Trump would not get the nomination for the Republican presidency, because if we can go back in our minds, remember, the GOP did not want him to be the nominee. So Stone, who was working for him registered this website, in anticipation of being able to launch a campaign to say they stole the nomination from him. Well, it didn't work. He did get the nomination. So he held that idea, that resonant meme in reserve for when it was needed. And then the thing about any kind of a conspiracy theory, or an idea or any of these things, is they work, they go viral when they play on something that feels true, right? You don't -- you don't get conspiracy theories that don't resonate in some way with some kind of part of someone's experience. And so that idea resonated with some people for various reasons, like all sorts of reasons. And what happens is when it resonates online, then if the residents get strong enough, they'll go into the real world and do something. And then this is where it becomes a meme war. Because in order for it to go even more powerfully, and lead to something like January 6, you need in real life, there to be some kind of spectacle or violence or something that prompts a ton of media attention and attention from other people, which then grows the campaign. And that's what happened with stop the steal, it grew. It's snowballed. Like they are building momentum. One of the things that we and I consider myself a member of the mainstream press still, and not just mainstream press, but also like the institutional government, like the Democrats and the systems that are set up in the government, they kind of saw those things, but we're like, Well, those are weirdos like that we can ignore or not, or if we can't ignore them, we'll like tisk, tisk them, point out how crazy they are. But we don't need to worry that they represent maybe like the tip of an iceberg. But the truth is that when these movements move back and forth online like that, they continue building momentum and building momentum. And all of those road shows, the stop the steal road shows that people were laughing about and making jokes on Twitter, they contributed to the momentum of getting people to the Capitol on January 6.",

You know, Twitter is acauldron of elites, in a lot of ways what it happens on Twitter, what trends on Twitter, what the vibe is on Twitter ends up being, you know, smattered all over televisions on reproduced on, you know, in conversations that people are having in their house like I, you know, my husband, he's not on Twitter. He doesn't look at Twitter at all. But he'll come home at the end of the day, and the stuff that has been happening on Twitter that I've been in the bowels of the internet, looking at exactly who made it and where it came in, who retweeted unquote who did it, he comes home, and he knows about it, because it made its way to the conversations at his office or to the radio because it gets picked up. So there's one just basic fact like it has an out a louder voice in our culture than other places. Elon Musk represents a kind of technocrat who, of the Silicon Valley ilk who -- and there is a growing number of folks who have this idea that as technologists, they know more than other people. And as someone who lives in this area, like I can tell you, a lot of people in Silicon Valley have this sense that hey, like we are the ones who've made this world the way it is and we know how it works and the government is broken and the system is broken. And this is a techno monarchist mindset that is insurgent in certain, very powerful circles, OK? And Elon is a part of that. Elon also is just a powerful troll in the same way that Donald Trump was like he -- he's funny, he's transgressive. He's using the internet in a silly way riling people up and, you know, it talked to any reporter who has been on the Musk beat or the Tesla beat for years. You know, Elon has no qualms sticking his networked group of fans on anyone. And we've seen that. I mean, that's what got him sued when he called someone a pedophile on Twitter. He's willing to engage in kind of targeted harassment that is the thing that can become so problematic. Elon already had millions and millions and millions and now he owns the actual means of cultural production of this system that has an outsized influence on our politics. And so, you know, you've been seeing all of these accounts now that there's been more racism, more N word, more and -- like outright anti-semitic stuff on Twitter since Musk's takeover. And some people are like has he already changed the algorithm? Is he already tweaking things? And the fact is, you don't have to tweak the algorithm yet to have to influence what kind of content is on Twitter because you give you can give a message a so you can make it clear to people make it seem to people like this is OK now.
