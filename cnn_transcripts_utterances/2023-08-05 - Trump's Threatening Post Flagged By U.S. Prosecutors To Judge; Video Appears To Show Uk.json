Well, former president Donald Trump airing a list of grievances on Friday night when talking to the Alabama Republican Party. And this was a very receptive crowd. He said that if he were elected President, again, the first day in office, you would appoint a special prosecutor to continue the work Congress was doing looking into investigating the Biden family. He also claimed that's less because he was doing well was seeking rabid Democratic left wing lawyers on him and also claimed that these charges were only brought because he was leading in the polls. Now one thing to keep in mind is that this is the playbook for these indictments for these charges, these arrangements, we have seen time and time again. And it's not going to stop. They are claiming Trump and his team that this is election interference. And this is something they believe that they can sell to voters that particularly they believe this, as we ramp up campaign season. They point to the fact that he is the front runner, but on top of that, that there is a time in which these trials will interfere with the campaign. Now, I have spoken to a number of Republican voters and there are quite a few who agree with the fact that this could actually impact the election or bleeding this narrative that Trump is spinning, so clearly something that is working there for them among the voters that I'm talking to in the Republican Party, but they are going to continue saying that this is fully political, ignoring the legalities, and at least try to play this out in the court of public opinion.

And he sends out a lot of misinformation. I mean, let's remind our viewers that it wasn't some prosecutors who indicted him. It was a grand jury. That's how our system works. It was a group of lay citizens who reviewed the evidence found probable cause to believe there was a crime and that Donald Trump was related to that crime. And they're the ones who issued the indictment. And, you know, we've got to make sure that we stick to the way a trial the way a court proceeding is supposed to proceed. And so it's really welcome to do that now that will interfere with Trump's ability to sort of spin this this fabrication about how he's simply being persecuted. And there's no evidence here.

According to some snippet of video, just trying to create as much confusion and doubt as possible. Unfortunately, it seems to have sunk in with a lot of voters. And so they know that something serious happened, certainly the January 6 footage, as well as the results of the Investigative Committee by Congress. And now some of these indictments are making clear that yes, this was very serious stuff. But people really don't know what happened. You know, and by the way, that's one of the functions of a trial. I mean, one of the reasons it's going to be good to see this work its way through the courts is people will be under oath.

And of course, we have seen as repeated artillery attacks by the Russian Armed Forces are more or less counter offensive. It's certainly moving slower than many had hoped the gains being made by Ukraine aren't perhaps as substantial as the allies may have anticipated or hoped. Ukraine says they remain persistent. Of course, we're also seeing developments on the diplomatic front. Today we are seeing around 40 nations sending delegations to Saudi Arabia for peace talks. Now, this isn't the first time we've seen these sorts of talks in June we saw similar talks held in Copenhagen, no major headlines from there and Russia, of course won't be in attendance at today's discussions, but Saudi Arabia says it hopes this will be a first step a foundation if you like for future peace negotiations.

This report looks just about right. Employers added 187,000 jobs in July, it's a bit below expectations. It's also the second slowest pace of job growth since late 2020.But make no mistake, this is a very healthy number especially given the historic job gains during this recovery. The economy has now added 1.8 million jobs so far this year. The unemployment rate continues to also defy those recession forecast. Many economists, even ones at the Federal Reserve, predicted that the unemployment rate would gradually rise this year, and yet it remains historically low, dipping to 3.5 percent in July. That is just a touch above the half century low of 3.4 percent. Moody's Analytics chief economist, Mark Zandi described the jobs report as down the middle of the fairway, couldn't have been much better. But there's one catch here, there always is, wages. Wages remain a bit high. Of course, that's great news for workers and more evidence that workers have considerable leverage over bosses. In fact, paychecks are now growing faster than prices. And that is huge. But strong wage growth is not really what Jerome Powell and his colleagues at the Fed want to see. They want wages to cool even further, to help drive inflation down. Still, big picture, there's a lot to like about these jobs report. It's just one more indicator that supports a growing sense that the soft landing that many thought was basically impossible might just be happening. Victor and Amara?",

So, we know that just from a CNN poll released this week, taken in July, just 37 percent of respondents approved of the job that President Biden was doing on the economy. And that really falls in terms of partisan lines, now only 25 percent of those taken respondents from that poll in July said that the economy is doing good right now, those current economic conditions as you can see on your screen. So that is really fueling this strategy from the Biden administration trying to be more aggressive when it comes to having Americans associate the positive gains that they are seeing in the economy with President Biden's leadership and his legislative wins, what they call Bidenomics.

Now, they're trying to do something not just overtly as we heard right there, but also subtly.We know that they're going to be putting up these kind of branding projects around the country when it comes to projects funded by President Biden's infrastructure law like bridges, roads, dams, all those type of things you can see on the screen here. President Joe Biden's bipartisan infrastructure law across the country really trying to hope that really as voters are traveling to work or going to the gym or wherever they may go during the day, they'll suddenly be seeing President Biden's name on projects that are making their lives easier, hoping that it kind of leads into them, having a more optimistic view of President Biden's handling of the economy. But of course, the election is 15 months away, so, there will be some time to see if that actually has an effect, moves a needle any point beyond what we're seeing right now where we know that voters are seriously pessimistic about what's happening.
