He may very well be fingerprinted, have his mugshot taken. I know he has been successfully fundraising off of these things with his most loyal base. But at the end of the day, is that actually a good look for him? Does that actually strengthen him not just in the primaries but beyond? Or is this a difficult and damaging day for the former president?",

With Republicans -- I mean, Donald Trump treats being arrested like the Super Mario Brothers treat red mushrooms.I mean, it makes him bigger and stronger every time it happens because even -- because even the Republicans who don't want to vote for him believe that he is being politically persecuted. I know tons of Republicans who have no intention of ever voting for Trump again, who still think he's getting a raw deal. If you just look inside the Republican Party, the polling is clear, the fundraising is clear. Yes, it has strengthened him. But go back to what I said before. Among general election voters, this is a terrible look. And if he were to be convicted, it is a terrible day for him. And I'll just say, on the timeline, there's every chance he could become the de facto nominee, say, in March or April, then get convicted of a crime over the summer. And then everybody goes to the convention in August and they're asking the Republican delegates to nominate a convicted felon, when we know the American people don't want that? It is very so overall damaging. But in the short term for him, it's obviously popped for him.",

We have to have a new generational leader.\" As you know, polls show it's not just a Republican position but Americans do have concerns about his age and, frankly, they would like choices other than not just Trump and Biden.

Nobody wants to go on TV and say it because we all like to be able to go to barbecues and house parties. But people are concerned. And I do think that anybody but Trump going up against someone like Biden, given some of Trump's challenges recently, probably might have a good shot and could make that age an issue. The problem is, when you put Biden up against Trump, Trump has so many other issues, he's not that much younger, that it becomes a little bit of a wash and then people just kind of go back to their respective corners.",

And obviously Republicans have often believed that people on theprogressive left have created alarm about this when the evidence doesn't warrant it. I would just say, though, as it came up in the debate, Ramaswamy made the big yet point of calling it a hoax. If you go back in time five months and pull up his interview that he gave, he was all in on climate change saying it existed and it was caused by human behavior. And so I do think on this topic and a few others, but for him especially, there was a little bit of playing to the crowd. But that's the problem with just saying what you think people in the room want to hear. Eventually, it catches up with you.

A fiery crash. U.S. officials telling myself and my colleagues, Oren Liebermann and Katie Bo Lillis, that, at its early stage of assessing this, there's no indication that a missile downed the Russian airplane. U.S. officials said it has not seen information that the Embraer Legacy 600 aircraft was struck by either a surface-to-air missile or an air-to-air missile launched potentially from a Russian jet. We should note the U.S. intelligence community has enormous resources to monitor and track such things. They can see via satellite and other means the launch of a missile from the ground or the air. They can also detect -- this is the capability that's been used before in cases like this. They can detect explosions in the air as well. But again, the reporting we're learning now is at this point the U.S. has not seen indications that a missile downed Prigozhin's plane. We will continue to bring you details as we learn them.

He offered his condolences. He described Prigozhin as \"a man of difficult fate but talented.\" Investigators do remain on the scene right now. They're getting a closer look at this fallen plane debris that Russian state media says is scattered just over a mile across an open field. And this new satellite image shared exclusively with CNN shows the crash site is at the edge of a forest clearing where most of the wreckage was found largely intact but with a missing wing. Joining us now, we have Kurt Volker, former U.S. ambassador to NATO and former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations. He's also a senior adviser on the Atlantic Council and a distinguished fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. Ambassador, thanks for being with us. What do you think about this latest reporting that Jim has here where it appears that this is not a missile, at least that is what U.S. officials are believing, but it does look like it's intentional? KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO: I can't speak to the new information that it is not a missile. I haven't seen what that is based on. When you look at the original videos that came out, you see a smoke trail that appears to be short, small and curved as a missile might do. So it's not exactly clear what happened. That being said, the way to think about this is the most obvious explanation, the simplest explanation is usually the right one. And this is where Vladimir Putin wants to eliminate Prigozhin because Prigozhin challenged his authority. And this is something Vladimir Putin wants to do demonstrably and do so as a way to re-establish his power in Russia. And I think that is clearly what happened. The mechanism, surface-to-air, air-to-air, bomb on the plane, which is very doubtful, those are things that, OK, we can investigate them. But let's not lose the big picture. Putin did this on purpose in order to re-establish his authority.",

The Russians have realized it's failing. And Prigozhin is the one who said it publicly. He gained a lot of support domestically from military and civilian as he tried to move into Russia because he had said that. Because people knew that that was the truth. So, yes, he may now be dead. Others may now be under arrest or dead as well. But this is evidence actually of more turmoil inside the system in Russia, which is what is ultimately going to bring an end to this war.",
