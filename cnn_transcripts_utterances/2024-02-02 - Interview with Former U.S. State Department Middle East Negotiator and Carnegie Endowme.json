And Bezalel Smotrich responded to the news yesterday, and I want to read for our viewers what he wrote on X. The settler violence campaign is an antisemitic lie that enemies of Israel decimate to smear and pioneering settlers and settlement enterprise, and to harm them and thus smear the entire State of Israel. I will keep, God willing, to work fearlessly to strengthen and develop Jewish settlements. If the price is U.S. sanctions against me, so be it. I mean, here he is taking the role of a martyr in a sense. What pressure does this put on Prime Minister Netanyahu and how big of a hindrance is this really in terms of U.S.-Israeli relations going forward, especially during a war?",

You know, for Benjamin Netanyahu on trial for bribery, fraud, breach of trust, now threeyears running in the Jerusalem District Court, I think he's due to testify this month, it's critically important that he maintain himself in power. And critical to that is catering, enabling, acquiescing in the activities of both Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. They will bolt from this coalition. Ben-Gvir in particular, if you look at the polls, he actually stands to gain in the event that there were elections. Bezalel Smotrich not so much. But Ben-Gvir, yes. So, there is that threat hanging over Benjamin Netanyahu's head. I doubt frankly, whether or not this is going to fundamentally alter either Ben-Gvir or Smotrich's objectives, Smotrich's objectives when it comes to the West Bank, but it could have a chilling impact. I mean, the United Nations is reporting, since October 7th, 500 incidents of settler intimidation and violence. Eight Palestinians killed, including a child. So, I think this is a significant and serious problem. It will not stop the settlement enterprise. But it does send a signal that the administration is prepared, it seems, to impose some measure of cost and accountability, at least on the most extreme manifestations of settler activities in in the West Bank.",

Just now, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saidthat Canada is looking to impose sanctions on extremists and settlers in the West Bank as well. This comes as there are reports that the State Department is exploring possibly recognizing a Palestinian State following the end of the war in Gaza. There are those in Israel that are pushing back against this. And we should note that the State Department itself is downplaying the significance of any of this. I want to quote a statement from Matt Miller, a spokesperson, saying, \"There has been no policy shift in the administration. We have made quite clear publicly that we support the establishment of an independent Palestinian State.\" But what do you make of even the timing of these reports coming out? As it is clear, there is a lot of frustration that we do not see any attempt even by this government of Prime Minister Netanyahu's to put together a day after plan what a two-state solution may look like. Because of course, that's the only thing that will lead him to get what he is hoping to achieve, and that is normalization with Saudi Arabia.",

They are still effectively in power. They effectively -- you know, they have 136 hostages. And they appear to be calling the shots now in terms of what they will and won't agree to in this deal. Is enough pressure and attention being put on bringing this organization, this terror organization, as the U.S. deems them, to an end?

The senior leadership of Hamascontinues to be ensconced in tunnels, probably near Rafah or under Khan Younis. The three key architects and implementers of the October 7 terror surge are alive and presumably well. Hamas may have 15,000 fighters, perhaps more. And the real key question seems to me is, when all this over, even with a hostage for prisoner exchange, Hamas may well remain as a sort of rump organization capable of influencing directly the economy and the politics of Gaza. And with almost no legitimacy, the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, now 88, in the 19th year of four-year term, controls 40 percent of the West Bank, undermined by his own corruption and autocratic tendencies and by Israeli policies, who exactly is going to be the legitimizing agent to bring Palestinian governance to Gaza? And right now, the most credible Palestinian organization, probably in the eyes of Gazans and certainly in the eyes of many West bankers, is Hamas, a terror organization, the organizational embodiment of an idea, which is the destruction of the State of Israel. I'm not sure we've factored in to the analysis in the \"day after scenario\" what role of Hamas is still likely to play, either intimidating Palestinians or exercising significant influence. So, I think this just one of the many, many uncertainties that the administration is going to be dealing with in the months ahead.",

But in terms of what Hamas wants and what the U.S., whatmany Israelis, what many in the region want, and that is a path towards a two-state solution with a Palestinian State and an Israeli State living safely side by side, that's divergent from what Hamas wants. Hamas does not want a two-state solution. So, even in the interim, when you have 136 hostages being held, if you have others pressing for a two-state solution right now as a way to end this war, how does Hamas respond to that?",

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  Do you want me to come and take you? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  I'm so scared, please come. JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A desperate call for help from six-year-old Hind, terrified, trapped in a car. Everyone around her is dead. Hind was in the car with her uncle, his wife and their four children trying to flee fighting from this part of Northern Gaza. The horror in that car captured in this call for help from her cousin recorded by the Palestine Red Crescent. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  They are shooting us. The tank is next to me. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Are you hiding? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  Yes, in the car. The tank is next to us. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Are you in the car? Hello. Hello.

She said, uncle, my dad, my mom, my sister and brother were killed. I am bleeding. Help me. I am dying. I told her, tie yourself with anything. At 04:00 p.m. she died. The only one left was the little girl, Hind. She said, please, I'm little, I'm injured. I peed myself. KARADSHEH (voice-over):  Hind stayed on the phone with the Red Crescent for hours. RANA AL-FAQUEH, PRCS RESPONSE COORDINATOR (through translator):  What time is it? She said, it's getting dark. I'm afraid of the dark. KARADSHEH (voice-over):  The area was too dangerous, hard to reach. They had to keep Hind on the phone as they scrambled to try and get a team to her.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  I want to, my dear, but I can't right now. KARADSHEH (voice-over):  As the team was finally dispatched, a psychologist was now on the phone with Hind. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  We are all with you. We will wait on the phone with you. KARADSHEH (voice-over):  But days later, they're still waiting. The Red Crescent lost all contact with Hind and its two volunteers who were dispatched to find her. CNN gave the Israeli military details about the incident, including coordinates provided by the Palestine Red Crescent. The IDF says, \"We are unfamiliar with the incident described.\"",

Drones being front and center, obviously much more affordable relative to some of the larger armaments fought in a traditional war and much more nimble as well. He also focused on technology and he said, \"Attack operations can have psychological objectives. And here, technology boasts an undoubted superiority over tradition. The remote control of these assets means fewer soldiers in harm's way thus reducing the level of human losses.\" Is he right to focus on this given the huge toll this war has taken on Ukrainian soldiers?

And doing that from a distance that is safe enough often to preserve their own lives. And it's not just aerial drones. I mean, the ship that was sunk two days ago, the Russian worship and missile cruiser, was sunk by Ukrainian naval drones, also un unmanned naval basically ships. And there is one other crucial point. Western weapons given to Ukraine are not allowed to be used on Russian territory. And so, Ukraine, as it tries to strike Russian military facilities, logistical facilities inside Russia, very often quite far away, all the way to St. Petersburg, he's using its own drones to do that.

And these two seem to go hand in hand, but there are conflicting, I don't know, advocacies for both, especially when it comes to manpower, because it is General Zaluzhnyi who is calling for more, whereas President Zelenskyy, understandably, as the president of a country, knows how unpopular that may be. But you could also make the argument, could you not, that without more ammunition, more artillery ammunition, you're just throwing these men out to fodder and they could become cannon fodder, just like we've seen in Russia.

Of course, I'm also disappeared that I have to wait a year until Wimbledon rolls around or until the next Olympics comes around, you know, it takes four years. But it's just -- it goes with the territory. You can't win the all, but what you can do is give it all you have.

And I applied for it. I got it. And they're like, cool. Here's your money. But you also have to come to these seminars where we'll -- you get to hang out with all of these other students who are interested in the same things that you are.

I am going to get you jobs and help you write your resume and connect you with people. And as I left college, though, I started noticing that this mentor was connecting me with groups that were increasingly less focused on journalism and more focused on putting out news that had a really intense partisan tilt to the point where they just like decontextualized what it was they wanted me to write for the sake of making a political point.",

And then the moment that Donald Trump comes in and the base is like, actually, we would like populism very much. The movement was like, all right, do we stick to our guns and try to promote a belief that is increasingly unpopular, or do we pivot to meet these voters where they are? We pivot Trump to where he -- to Trump where he is because now, he's the leader of our party in the free world, in order to maintain not just our power or our money cynically, but like the reason that we've done what we've done for 25 to 30 years. One of the things I keep noticing in the book over and over again was that people who left in response to Trumpism were immediately just out. They -- like, their friends disavowed them.

And when I got there, this wasn't so much a crowd that really was, like, whipped up into a frenzy so much as it was a crowd that did truly believe that the Capitol belongs to them and that they should be let through the barriers in order to tell the lawmakers to their face what to do.
