Here's where we start. As CNN first reported, embattled New York Republican Congressman George Santos is now facing federal criminal charges and could appear in court as soon as today. The charges remain under seal. They are in the Eastern District of New York. But the Justice Department has reportedly been looking into whether he broke campaign finance laws. Santos has been resisting calls from Democrats and some New York Republicans to resign ever since reports revealed he lied about much of his personal history and his work experience. Our Brynn Gingras is covering this live outside the courthouse for more. When do we expect them to be unsealed, and what reporting do you have on what they are likely tied to?",

If he comes for this indictment that we're hearing has been filed, he would have to be, just like any other citizen, actually walk up those long stairway to the door. Of course, he is not necessarily like every other citizen. He will probably be swarmed by press when, if he shows up today.Again, as you mentioned, this indictment under seal. It's not clear what charges the congressman could face. But we do know from previous CNN reporting that he has faced a lot of scrutiny about how he's made his money and contributions that he made, a loan to his campaign in 2022 about more than $700,000. Where did that money come from? This is all something we have reported that federal prosecutors in New York were looking into. There has been scrutiny about campaign expenditures. So of course, that will all be determined when the indictment is unsealed, which we think possibly today we will wet more information about that. What we do know is that the Republican congressman, who again, just took office in January, he did not vote last night in Washington, D.C. Instead, he boarded a plane to come here to New York. So it's very possible we will see him here in Central Islip later today, Poppy.",

We were actually monitoring a lot of the border wall here. And what you are looking while we're on the Mexico side is the U.S. side, that is technically U.S. soil where you see a lot of the migrants behind me just waking up in the morning chill here in Ciudad Juarez. And while they are on U.S. soil, they still haven't been processed to the other side of the border wall.What we saw overnight was an increased presence of Texas National Guard, a mix, from what we could see, also U.S. Army soldiers. And it seemed at one point they were going to push those migrants back on to the Mexico side. Now, that didn't happen. And so then you saw migrants thinking, maybe they are going to process us. But that adds to this confusion. And it's confusion that has being playing out over several months, and it has led to at moments, some excitement, some hope, and then disappointment as they realize they are still here, still waiting, and really amidst really tough conditions.

It's very individualized. Many of them plan perhaps to try tomorrow, maybe today, maybe in a few weeks. It's determined by their own situation.

They want to fill the hotel, which can handle 340 people very quickly. And they said this is a pilot program, which means this is the beginning, not the end. So you're talking about hundreds, if not thousands more coming into the county. This is their initial decision that they are looking to do. In addition, as the county executive pointed out, the hotel does not have a C.O. to operate as a shelter. So to turn a hotel, which can only take transient residents for up to 30 days, into a four-month shelter that houses 340 people, provides health care, laundry services, food and living, is totally unacceptable. In addition, what happens during the day with these folks? They can't get a job. They can't get access to employment. And so who is actually taking care of them? This hotel is within a mile of two universities and a high school, and you're talking about sending single male adults up here. It is totally unacceptable the way the mayor has handled this and the way the city has without any coordination or cooperation and communication well in advance -- they knew they were doing this, and chose not to discuss it with town and county officials until the very moment that they were looking to send them here. There is a temporary restraining order in place barring the hotel from accepting them because it's in violation of the town code. So we'll see what happens.

I'm not going to get into the body part situation with you, but it's a people go to jail for sexual abuse. It's a very serious offence, and most importantly, E. Jean brought this case because she wanted her name back, as you said, at the very beginning, she got her name back and the jury found that he lied. And he lied about her maliciously.",
