That includes the interior minister, his deputy, his secretary of state, six others.We know that at least three children have been killed, but as you can probably see behind me there is now an enormous emergency services and rescue and recovery response. Basically what they are trying to do is to determine whether there are any other children who are still inside that kindergarten because right before the helicopter actually crashed, you can see that there was some kind of debris or flames or jet fuel that came down and hit that part of the building. That caused a floor of the kindergarten to collapse, so it is possible that there are other people, children or teacher, we just do not know, who could potentially be unrecovered inside their. They say they do not know how many children have been killed beyond the three that they definitely know were killed. They also said that the others who were killed, you have the nine on board and the three children, were basically parents dropping their kids off at school. So this really is just a heartbreaking tragedy. At this stage, we don't know exactly what caused the helicopter to crash.
