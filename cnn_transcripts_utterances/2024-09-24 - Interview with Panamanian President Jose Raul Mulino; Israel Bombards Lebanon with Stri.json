And our John King down in Georgia finds out what issues matter most to voters in the southern swing state. Live from New York, Tuesday, September the 24th. I am Richard Quest and yes, I mean business. Good evening. We begin tonight with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, who says Russia needs to be forced into peace. NATO Secretary General agrees. In an interview tonight with us, Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance must change the Kremlin's calculus in order to end the war. Ukraine's president has addressed the UN Security Council a short while ago. He will present a victory plan to US leaders this week and he echoed Stoltenberg by saying, there is no bargaining with Vladimir Putin. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Italy got a new government not so long ago, remains committed to NATO and committed to support Ukraine. And I expect the United States to be committed to NATO, regardless of the outcome of the US presidential elections, partly because it is the US security interest to have a strong NATO. Russia and China has nothing like the US and NATO with 32 friends and allies. Second, there is a strong bipartisan support to NATO in the United States, and thirdly, the main criticism, NATO in the United States has not been primarily against NATO.

At least six were killed, 15 injured. Hezbollah continues to fire unabated rockets over the border.
