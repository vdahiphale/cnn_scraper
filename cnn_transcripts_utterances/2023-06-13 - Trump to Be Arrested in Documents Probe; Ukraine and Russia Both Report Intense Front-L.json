That is really the policy that we have seen emerge or tactic of the Russians, to send in large numbers of cruise missiles, often blended in with cheap Shahed drones, overwhelm the air defenses and get these missiles through. Bear in mind, 11 people killed as a consequence, many more injured, as a residential building has been hit by a high precision missile carrying about 400 kilograms in all, close to half a ton or more of high explosives. It is certain, if they hit a civilian target, that the damage will be catastrophic. That is exactly what we have seen time and again in the latest iteration.

Because that is the approach for the Ukrainians toward the Crimean Peninsula. Again a region captured by Russia in 2014. But clearly I think what we're seeing there in the early stages of the counteroffensive that we have been talking about for so long, beginning in earnest. Concurrent with that, not necessarily part of the counteroffensive but likely, if the momentum goes with them, have been Ukrainian advances that could be developed from a tactical to a strategic asset for the Ukrainians if they can prosecute more of those advances.

The Fed is moving more aggressively than it has at any point since the early 1980s but at last check, markets were pricing a 94 percent chance the Fed keeps rates steady. Tomorrow that is up from an 80 percent chance yesterday. As you can see that would be good news from the market perspective. U.S. markets are up as we speak, up modestly. This would also be good news for consumers, who are already dealing with high borrowing costs for mortgages and car loans, student debt, credit card debt. They don't want to see interest rates go any higher. Unfortunately, though, the Fed may not be done, even though markets do think that the Fed is going to do nothing tomorrow. There is roughly a two in three chance, as we speak, that the Fed has to do more work in July, raising interest rates by another quarter of a point.

And therefore she certainly speaks perhaps for that tendency in Italian politics. And really, what you are seeing today is this spectrum of opinion, looking back on the legacy of Berlusconi, who served four times as prime minister, longer than any other prime minister since the end of the Second World War. But here you get an idea of the difference of opinion. This is \"Il Giornale,\" a newspaper affiliated with Berlusconi. The headline is, \"L'Ultimo Cavaliere,\" \"The Last Knight.\" And we have an editorial here that says, \"self made man who changed world politics.\" And so obviously they take a very positive view of him. But here, \"il Fatto Quotidiano\" is saying \"Banana Republic.\" That's what they say he left as a legacy of Italy. Keeping in mind that during the 20 years when Berlusconi dominated Italian politics, the economy, despite all his promises of bringing his business genius to running the country, the economy actually shrank. Italy's debt went through the roof and, basically, until now, the entire economy is suffering from the aftereffects of his rule. So it was a very mixed legacy. But in the aftermath of his death, I think the tendency is, with the exception of this newspaper, is to take a fairly respectful view of the departed, the lately departed. And perhaps as the days go by and the funeral is over, perhaps the critique of his legacy will be somewhat more pointed -- Becky.",
