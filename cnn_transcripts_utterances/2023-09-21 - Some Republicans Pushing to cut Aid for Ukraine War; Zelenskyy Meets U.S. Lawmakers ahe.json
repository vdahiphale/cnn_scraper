First up though, Media Titan Rupert Murdoch stepped down as Fox News Chairman. Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says talks on normalization with Israel are getting closer to an agreement. And India calls Canada a safe haven for terrorists amid diplomatic fallout between the two countries. Canada has accused India of being behind the murder of face seek activist on Canadian soil. Well, we start in Washington where Ukraine's leader is looking to woo American lawmakers. Unlike his last warmer, wartime visit, President Zelenskyy won't be given the floor to address congress. Instead he is trying to win over a growing number of skeptical Republicans and individual meetings at Capitol Hill. He wants to secure continued age of his country's fight against Russia. Meantime, the Ukrainian military says it has carried out a major attack on a Russian airbase in Crimea. Over its part, Russia sent dozens of missiles across Ukraine overnight taking aim at the country's energy facilities. Let's start in Washington for the very latest. Our White House Correspondent Jeremy Diamond is in DC. This is a crucial day Jeremy for Zelenskyy. It does seem as though there is a steeper and steeper hill to climb in persuading the American public to continue to support this war. Explain if you will.",

A crucial day at a crucial time, not only in terms of where Ukraine standsright now in its counter offensive and its push, but also in terms of a crucial time here in the United States with a public support for supporting Ukraine. And its defense against the Russian invasion, very clearly beginning to wane, particularly among Republicans. And that is reflected not only in public polling of Republican voters. But also when you see a number of Republican lawmakers, mostly members of the House, some Republican senators as well, voicing either their outright opposition to additional funding for Ukraine, or casting doubt and raising questions about continuing this spigot of aid going. President Zelenskyy as he is in Washington today, his mission will be to try and shore up some of that support and to ensure that his country as it faces this war against Russia as it tries to retake its territory to ensure that that spigot of aid continues. The Biden Administration has put down a $24 billion funding requests to lawmakers for additional aid for Ukraine. So far, though, it's not clear that that can pass particularly in the house where you have Republican members of congress questioning that aid. Republican members like Congressman Byron Donalds, listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): The first thing I'll tell you is there's no money in the house right now for Ukraine.

Let's get you to something totally different now.A story that's just broken in the last couple of hours, Rupert Murdoch is stepping down as Chairman of Fox Corporation and News Corp. Now the 92- year-old media magnate says the time is right for him to take on different roles. He says his son Lachlan will become sole chairman of both companies. Murdoch launched Fox News in 1996, as a competitor to CNN pushing conservative agendas. And often promoting falsehoods as it became the most watched news channel in the United States. Our Business Editor-in-Chief Richard Quest is joining me now. And it's interesting, off times on a story like this loosely term story like this, we'd say, what's the significance and what's Murdoch's legacy? But I think I've got to reverse that. I think we should start with Murdoch's legacy. And then Richard, talk about the significance of this movement and what it means for the organization going forward. RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: I think the legacy aspect of it is clear. Wherever you look, the Murdoch footprint is very firmly on society, in the UK, from his newspapers and from a sky, more recently in the United States, with Fox in Australia, through the networks that he's owned and the papers that he's published. But, of course, it is the controversial aspects of the Murdoch's life. Closing what Fleet Street and opening whopping, the phone hacking sang scandal in the UK, numerous questions over political interference in Australia. And then it all leads Becky to the Pyramid Peak, which of course is allegations and what happened with Fox News that memorably ended up with them paying $787 million in compensation.",

But instead, what we heard in that segment that you played with him saying anything that would ease the life of the Palestinians not say, you know, that it would establish a Palestinian state that is notable by itself, perhaps that is something that they recognize might not happen before this normalization agreement. The other thing that really stood out for me is about who he would be dealing with. Because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leads the most extremist far right wing government in Israeli history. There are ministers in his cabinet who have been literally indicted, charged with anti-Arab racism.

And this briefing lasted for about 45 minutes, of which more than 40 minutes was focused just on the standoff and the escalating tensions between India and Canada. The spokesperson spoke for more than 42 minutes on this issue, which goes on to show how this has been a top headline in India and across the world for over four days now. Now, yes, the ties, like I said the tensions are escalating between the two countries. And you also have the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi coming out with a statement stating that their diplomatic staffing here in India will be decreased. I just want to read from that statement. It says, with some diplomats having received threats in various social media platforms, Global Affairs, Canada is assessing its staff complement in India. As a result, and out of an abundance of caution, we have decided to temporarily adjust staff presence in India. Now what is to be seen is when and where Justin Trudeau provides proof of the allegations he's made against India. Those are very serious remarks that he made on Monday, Becky, and India says it has not received any further information from Canada ever since Trudeau went to the floor of Parliament and made that big claim. That will take a lot really for India and Canada to reset ties at this point. It's not going to happen anytime soon.

If people see that jobs leave, income leave, they will block this transition. So it's really a call for a mix of markets, and sound politics.",

You know, if you go down to the small scale industry in an African country that can translate fromdiesel to solar panel, that is a very small figure, it is feasible, it can be done. And we want to support that. If we then move large scale, as we now plan to do in Norway to use our gas resources, take out the CO2 and deposit that CO2 3000 meters under the seabed. We can use that gas to produce hydrogen, which again can be a key source for European industry resources we need to do this carbon capture and storage also to deal with the hard to abate industries, such as waste plants, cement production, to get their emissions down. So you know, each and one of these investments are manageable, and I believe around the corner they will also be profitable adding all this up to one figure. I think it's hard to do.",

Certainly, Norwayvery involved in the transition to renewable energy that is a fact. How can a country rich in hydrocarbons and investing more not less in the industry truly play a role in limiting global warming? When the IEA for example, it said that the two are simply incompatible, that is what critics of countries whose growth is based on hydrocarbons will say and once again, let me be clear, you're investing more not less in the industry at this point?",

Norwegian economy is basically based on hydro water energy. But we are now also you know, making major investment in offshore wind, in land, wind in solar, in hydrogen, these need new sources. So, you know, you will see a transitioning out, we are taxing our fossil fuel sources with the taxes that will encourage that transition. But again, you know the fact that Norway is a gas producer was there to save Europe through the winter after the Ukraine war started. Again, we cannot simply cut out these sources without some having something to replace it with. And that's why the renewable push which is coming now, from wind, from solar, from hydrogen, from some nuclear. That's what we really have to scale up. And then gradually, you know, this will become cheaper, it will become valuable investments. And that's how we can secure that transition.",

But listen, we are going to need new minerals to secure this transition to build the wind platform, the wind farms, the solar panels, and either we say let China take care of that, or let the kids in the meals in the center of Africa dig out those minerals, we have a responsibility to map what we have available of minerals. And before we give any green light or any granting to for to industry to explore that we need to be 100 percent certain that we do it with inside those boundaries. But we cannot simply drop this issue because these are minerals that are also, key to the transition towards these new energy sources.",
