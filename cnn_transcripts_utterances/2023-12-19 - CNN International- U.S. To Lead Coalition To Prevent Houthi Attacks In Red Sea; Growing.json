      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, there are serious concerns over the impact of the Israel-Hamas war on the global supply chain. We'll discuss how the recent Houthi attacks on the Red Sea could affect prices and inflation beyond the Middle East.Then we'll be live in China, where rescue workers are battling subzero temperatures to find survivors of what has been called the deadliest earthquake in a decade. Then some extraordinary pictures from Iceland. A volcano has erupted following weeks of underground activity. Growing anger and condemnation today over an alleged Israeli sniper attack on a church compound in Gaza. A catholic group in Jerusalem shared photos of damage done to the Holy Family parish church, where it says two women were killed over the weekend by an Israeli sniper. The Israel Defense Forces appeared to deny the claim. Hundreds of people are said to be sheltering inside that church. Meanwhile, the U.S. is taking steps to stop Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea. On a visit to Bahrain, the U.S. defense secretary announced an international coalition that will begin patrols of the Red Sea. Houthi attacks have forced some of the world's largest shipping companies to divert their vessels around Africa rather than take the much shorter route through the Suez Canal. In the past hour, Austin arrived in Qatar, where he'll hold bilateral meetings with the prime minister and the foreign minister. Let's go to CNN's Will Ripley who's tracking both these stories for us. First of all, just take us through this sniper attack as we're told it is and the Israeli response to that.",

      "sentences": "Well, this is just the latest example, Max, of people who are sheltering in the only small handful of places in Gaza that they are supposed to believe are safe, churches, and they're not safe is what the people in Gaza are saying. They're saying that the IDF has been firing indiscriminately at civilians.And it's not just Gazans that are dying, of course, they're the vast majority of the nearly 20,000 people have now been killed. This church shooting over the weekend, the latest example of that. But also there were three Israeli hostages who were apparently shirtless, according to the Israel Defense Forces, waving a white cloth. They had actually written an SOS message in Hebrew on a white sheet with leftover food, and they were waving that white cloth. And they, all three of them, were shot and killed by Israeli forces before they realized that, in fact, these were Israeli hostages, that they were shooting and killing. But it does really raise a lot of questions about the forces that are on the ground and these face to face interactions with civilians and the United States and now, you know, the defense secretary, the second official in recent days to publicly pressure Israel to do more to protect Palestinian civilians, even as Israel insists that their mission to take out Hamas is not complete and that they need to make sure that that is their primary objective. But with growing international criticism, Max, about these civilian deaths, the mounting civilian death toll in Gaza, Israel is being forced to take a very hard look at their strategy in Gaza and try to find a way to accomplish their objectives without taking so many civilian lives.",

We'll have a bit more of this later on with Anna.Now to China, though, where rescuers are racing to find survivors in subzero temperatures after a catastrophic earthquake hit the northwestern part of the country. According to the state media, at least 126 people have been killed. Nearly 600 have been injured. The U.S. Geological Survey says the 5.9 magnitude quakes struck Gansu province just late Monday night, reducing homes and buildings to rubble. The quake is China's deadliest in nearly a decade.

      "sentences": "Very difficult to see, Max. And unfortunately, these rescue teams are just dealing with so many different hurdles. First of all, as you mentioned, this quake hit late Monday night just before midnight. A lot of people were asleep and of course it was dark outside. So that naturally makes this a tough rescue.And then, as we know, it's already Tuesday evening here. So another night of darkness in some areas that have been without electricity, although efforts are certainly underway to try to restore that. In addition, we are dealing with some very cold temperatures across China and in many places, including where this earthquake hit, the temperatures are subfreezing. That is certainly a challenge to survivors, but also to the rescue workers themselves who have to be out in these very cold elements. And then another big challenge is altitude. This is a high altitude location. And so that within itself makes a difficult job, even that more stressful, even that more tedious. But all day long, we have seen some very intrepid efforts by rescue workers going building to building, using shovels to simply dig through debris, hoping to find survivors. And the people who have survived are certainly very lucky, despite the fact that the death toll has been rising. So there is that to contend with. A lot of people are doing what they can to survive. At one point overnight, we saw people creating fires, fire pits almost in park like areas to simply stay warm because of these very cold temperatures. A big issue as we look ahead in the days and even hours ahead are going to be the fact that there are so many damaged homes. According to CCTV, which is the China state broadcaster, more than 100,000 homes -- is one data point that we have seen. More than 100,000 homes have been damaged. So that is going to be a very lofty task. President Xi Jinping is, of course, urging for a quick and immediate response. We have seen a financial boost to this area, a $28 million financial boost to help with rescue efforts. But, Max, that in many ways is moot, because, as we have seen, the things that you just can't simply put a value of money on, such as weather, such as darkness, such as high altitude, those are still going to be very difficult and formidable challenges in the not so distant future.",

A crack almost 4 kilometers long has opened up along the earth's surface, releasing fountains of lava into the air. Residents of nearby Grindavik were told to leave the area last month. The government says the eruption doesn't pose a threat to life, but it is releasing a considerable amount of toxic gases.Melissa Bell is following the developments for us from Paris.

Crews rescued hundreds of people in the wake of what have been tropical cyclone Jasper. Now the government says it'll pay the equivalent of $672 to adults and $268 to children. This drone video gives you an idea of how widespread that flooding was. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says more troops are on their way to assist with rescue efforts there. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy set to give a news conference in less than two hours from now as concerns over crucial western aid continue to grow. On Monday, the White House warned that unless Congress approves more funding, U. S. financial assistance for Kyiv will run out at the end of the month. Republican lawmakers are linking any further aid to strict new border restrictions. The U.S. Defense Department calls the funding vital to Ukraine's continued fight for freedom against Russia. And later in the show, we'll have a report from CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, who's traveled to Ukraine's frontline for a first-hand account on how desperately Ukraine needs that military aid from the U.S. Still to come, one of the world's busiest maritime trade routes, plagued by militant attacks, forcing shipping companies to hit the pause button.

      "sentences": "Exactly. I think the transportation of petrochemicals is one of the things we'll see really soaring as a result of everything that's going on with the Suez Canal and the Red Sea transit. This is really a critical shortcut, if you will, connecting Europe to Asia.And if we bring that muff up again of Africa and the west coast of Africa around the Cape of Good Hope, this is essentially the alternative route for some ships. And Maersk have said this morning that this is the route they will have to take to transit. And that route, as you can see from the example of a ship going from Rotterdam to Singapore, will take more than a week longer to reach its destination. So a lot more fuel is burnt for the ship. But also what you're looking at there is a very late arrival of a ship which impacts the next transit of the next shipment and so on. So quite quickly you can see containers stacking up at ports. You can also see how that would impact global supply chain. So key here, Max, is how long will this go on for? Can this route be secured so ships can pass through it again?",

And it was estimated at the time that the cost of that would be $6 billion to $10 billion a week while it was stuck due to the lack of transit of goods.That is a result of all of those ships being stuck. Trade coming to a standstill and the issue of supply chains. Imagine a car factory in Germany. It needs a part, but it's stuck at a port somewhere in Asia and it can't get there. That can shut down a whole factory line. So really, the impact of this in terms of inflation and the cost of goods, the cost of fuel will very much depend on how long we are talking about this transit route being unsafe for commercial ships and for oil tankers in particular.",

It really depends where it fits within an overall supply chain. Semiconductors were a big issue over the pandemic.Again, it remains to be seen whether this will continue. I was speaking to a shipping expert, though, this morning, and there is a big concern here that at this stage, with the Houthi militants shooting anti-ship ballistic missiles, which was really beyond the capabilities many of the shipping experts thought Houthi militants would have, the concern here is that is going to be very hard to secure. It's not like piracy, which is something shipping -- the shipping community is very aware of. They have, you know, armed security on board a ship. They have citadels to protect the crew. This is a risk that they can't really mitigate very easily without, of course, huge defense capabilities from around the world. So the prices of goods is all going to depend on what happens in all these talks in the coming days.",
