The National Weather Service was using a wording like large, dangerous, considerable damage likely and we are seeing that in images this morning.So far, 24 reported tornadoes. We already have a few of those confirmed. They will need to be doing a lot of surveying of that damage to further confirm those tornadoes. Here is a look at the radar right now. Showers stretching from upstate New York down to the Gulf Coast. We are focusing on the south here this morning where we still have some tornado warnings here. There's one on the border of Alabama headed into Georgia for a brief tornado there. We have a tornado watch that continues this morning until 9:00 a.m., includes parts of Alabama and then southern Georgia. Cities like Macon included. It's just to the south there of Atlanta as the threat continues for a few tornadoes from this same front. That front continues to slide east today. There is the threat from D.C. down to the Florida Panhandle. This pocket right here in eastern Carolinas, that's where the highest tornado threat will be today. A few additional tornadoes possible there as the threat a little bit more isolated in the green but still watching out for some damaging wind gusts to 60 or 70 miles per hour. Here is a look, fast forwarding through the day, you can see the showers and storms really igniting headed into Charlotte as we go into the afternoon. Pushing east, later on today, and then look at the pop. Cold air rushes in behind this, pumps some snow along the Appalachian Mountains and then starts to work its way north. We are talking about heavy rain and snow from areas like New York and Boston. Rain along the coast and then some snow in interior New England could be looking at some total of six to eight inches, up to a foot possible. So, the heavy rain posing a flood risk from Maine down to D.C. where some two to four inches of rain is possible there. We will have to watch out for that as we go through the weekend. You can see some of these totals really piling up. Those yellows from New York to Boston showing the heavy rain and again, like I mentioned, multi hazard system looking at up to a foot of snow in some places, too.",

Per a university statement she will remain tenured faculty at the university's law school and agreed to stay on while they find an interim replacement.As we reported, students, faculty, really the community in general has said that they lost confidence in Magill after Tuesday's congressional hearing in which she and the presidents of MIT and Harvard failed to explicitly say that calls for genocide of Jews would immediately violate their universities' codes of conduct. Now, moments after Magill's announcement, Scott Bok said that he too would be stepping down as the chair of the university's board of trustees. In a statement, Bok wrote, \"Former President Liz Magill last week made a very unfortunate misstep.\" He then goes on to write, \"Following that, it became clear that her position was no longer tenable, and she and I concurrently decided that it was time for her to exit.\" Bok also defending Magill calling her a good person, a talented leader, and in his words not the slightest bit antisemitic. Also interesting in Bok's statement, he offered some potential insight into what may have been Magill's state of mind at the time of that disastrous hearing. As Bok wrote that she was not herself at the time that she was being questioned by lawmakers, that she was -- quote -- \"over prepared, over lawyered\" and that she provided a legalistic answer to a moral question and that, Bok says, was wrong.

And I think some of the -- some of the poll was also indicating that I think more than 50 percent of Americans say that -- you know that Joe Biden had not helped or help them personally. And many said that they thought Trump's policies actually helped them, despite some of the legal issues, his rhetoric, etcetera, these things that are unpopular among even some in his base.So, this is very troubling. And I think that we're going to see how this plays out the next year, but we'll definitely be watching for how the economy improves, what these job numbers look like. I think that's going to be a big indicator of how he can improve his polling.",

They have got a stakeholder in the Palestinian Authority, the governing body of the West Bank, and East Jerusalem, the governing body outside of Gaza. Let's remember that Hamas runs Gaza. And I spoke to the Palestinian Prime Minister here, Mohammad Shtayyeh, about this idea that Israel wants to destroy Hamas before any ceasefire and any possibility of a sort of day-after conversation. He specifically told me that destroying Hamas was absolutely off the agenda as far as the Palestinian Authority is concerned. And he went on to talk about though, how Hamas might be involved in the Palestinian Authority running Gaza going forward, albeit as a junior party, and albeit if they signed up to a sort of P.L.O. platform. This is what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
