It's definitely a storm weary area. Talking to residents here, they are scared for the threat of more tornadoes today. They need to be on guard and prepared keeping an eye to the sky. I want to get to the graphics, show you the latest watches and warnings that we have across the country. Again, I just mentioned the latest tornado watch that's been included from Western and Central Arkansas southward into the Texarkana region. We also have tornado watches to the north as well. But I want to show you what the storms have already been capable of doing. We know about the fatalities and injuries coming out of the Southeastern Missouri region from the tornado that struck there overnight. There is also ground stops. Earlier this morning, there were ground stuff that Chicago O'Hare, at Midway as a line of extremely powerful storms move through. You can see the shelf cloud that was associated with this just about an hour ago. Powerful winds and large hail associated with that. And across Michigan, the storms there are causing havoc as well. Yes we're really showing how powerful these storms are. And Glen Allen has seen some of the worst of these storms as the video there is showing just the damage and the extent of how bad this tornado was overnight, but threats still ongoing. Sara?",

And she continued once the investigation is complete, this matter, like all matters, will be handled by our offers office based on the facts and the law.

And as we've discussed before, I think that part of the D.A.'s job is discretion and bringing a case when he promised to go and indict President Trump and when basically a former D.A. has passed over and DOJ has passed over. I think it leaves a lot of questions for a lot of voters about how political this prosecution is.I think, politically, I think it does strengthen the president, former president in the short-term. There's no doubt there's rallying around him amongst many Republican voters who say, you know, he was unfairly attacked for four years as president, and this continues that. And I think it also allows him, as John was just alluding a minute ago, to cast a shadow on these other more serious allegations outstanding in Georgia and at the federal level. But I also think there's another political beneficiary in this and, frankly, that's Joe Biden. And what I mean by that is, you know, in 2022, I think Republicans had all the issues set in our in our favor to have a historic midterm election. And I think we fell short of those expectations, because in many cases, we were still re-litigating the election in 2020 in states like Arizona and Pennsylvania. And right now, where Republicans should be talking about the crisis of inflation or talking about a border crisis, talking about bank failures, impending recession, talking about the situation in Taiwan, we're not. And I think that creates opportunities, like you saw in Wisconsin last night, when that's a huge defeat for Republicans in Wisconsin, where you have now a new Supreme Court that's going to overturn so many positive reforms that Scott Walker championed when he was governor of Wisconsin.

The U.S. technically hasn't had formal relations with Taiwan since the 1970s, when President Nixon met with leader Mao Zedong and agreed to honor Beijing's One China policy that states there is only one Chinese government, the one based in Beijing rather than Taiwan. China seized Taiwan, as you just heard, as a breakaway province to be unified with the mainland one day. But in recent years, China has been testing that arrangement by conducting more provocative actions, like the patrols that we're seeing in the Taiwan Strait today. Beijing also has amped up its military spending. Just last month, it announced that its military budget will increase 7.2 percent to roughly $224 billion. China is also boosting its naval fleet. It has about 340 warships with plans to grow to 400 ships in the next couple of years. The U.S., by comparison, is hoping to get to 350 ships by 2045. It all adds to speculation that China may try to invade Taiwan. And just last year President Biden made the bold statement that he would commit U.S. troops to support Taiwan if that happens.
