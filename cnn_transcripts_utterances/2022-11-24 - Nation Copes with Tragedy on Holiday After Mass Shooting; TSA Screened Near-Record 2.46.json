And I've been described by people here as the glue that held the small LGBTQ community here together.You know, how many nightclubs do you know that host a Thanksgiving lunch? Not many. Club Q did. And that, I think speaks to the place that that club had in this community here. It was the hub, and it was attacked and violated. The safe space was invaded by this person with a gun. Now, the suspect is in the jailhouse behind me, appeared in court yesterday for the first time, and you know, prosecutors here and investigators are still really trying to gather enough evidence for a motive. Listen, it looks very much like hey, if you walk into the only gay club in town and open fire. But prosecutors need to prove that. So, they are gathering evidence. Now, the lawyers for the suspect said that the suspect identifies as non-binary. It was interesting in the court appearance that the judge did not use they-them pronouns. And we spoke with a neighbor and a close friend of the suspect. They lived across the hall, and played video games together. And that young man, Xavier Crist, (PH) we asked about the non-binary status and he said that the suspect had never once brought that up in all the time that they had spent together, but did have some outbursts, some anger coming from a place of rage as Crist told us. Some of them directed at the gay community, use slurs to describe gay people, but also, more often than not, he said that those outbursts of anger were directed at other races.

Things have been relatively smooth for travelers and for the airlines mostly aided by good weather. After these major meltdowns have the airlines had in terms of cancellations over the summertime, 50,000 cancellations in total.Look at the cancellations of just yesterday. We've only had 60 cancellations yesterday, 50 so far today. In fact, on Tuesday, United Airlines says network-wide. That means mainline and smaller regional United Express flights, they canceled zero flights. Let that sink in for a second. Zero flights. 99.9 percent of all flights operated by American Airlines, it says it operated the biggest schedule of any airline in the U.S. I want you to listen now to the industry's top lobbyist who says that airlines have been on this hiring blitz to try and stem off those meltdowns of the summer that were due, in part, the staffing shortages.

Particularly, and overwhelmingly on the electrical system because, of course, if you break the electrical system, you can prevent water from being pumped, you can cripple the health services and, of course, ultimately undermine the war effort more widely. So, that is very clearly been the Russian campaign.They've not been doing so well on the ground, having lost Kherson City and much of the rest of Kherson province, and they're being pushed back of course northeast of Kharkiv as well. So, in that context, this has been a successful campaign really by the Russians, although they are losing, the vast majority of their cruise missiles are being shot down, Alex. The Ukrainians meanwhile, of course, saying that they desperately, desperately need more modern equipment to bring these missiles down. Because when it's not the cruise missiles, it's those more primitive Iranian-supplied Shahed-136s which are essentially drones that fly very high and slow and zoom in on a target and destroy themselves.

This is where analysts estimate more than half of the world's iPhones are produced. We've obtained new footage showing how these protests turn violent. These workers, they're angry about wages, dirty living conditions, chaotic COVID rules. The video show squadrons of riot police arriving. In one video, you can see a group of police and white hazmat suits beating workers with batons and metal rods, other video show workers protesting and tearing down COVID barriers, masses of them throwing metal parts toward police. And Another video shows a group of workers pushing over a police car cheering and chanting. A worker at the scenes of the protest turned into a river of blood with police ruthlessly hitting workers. This chaos at Foxconn has been ongoing for weeks. Several weeks ago, there was a mass exodus of workers after a COVID outbreak. People literally walking miles across highways to escape what workers said are subpar living conditions and COVID restrictions. To get more workers, Foxconn went on a mass recruitment drive promising higher pay and bonuses. But this worker said when the new workers arrived at the plant, the pay packages they were given were worse than what was advertised and they felt cheated. WANG Foxconn for its part is blaming the payments issue on a \"technical error.\" Apple also told CNN that its employees were on the ground at the Zhengzhou facility. And in a statement said, \"we are reviewing the situation and working closely with Foxconn to ensure their employees' concerns are addressed.\" Selina Wang, CNN Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
