And the flakes are falling early in parts of North Carolina. We are live on one of the areas hit hard by Tropical Storm Helene as local business owners try to recover from their losses. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington. Jim has the morning of. You're in the CNN Newsroom. Matt Gaetz is out, now Pam Bondi is in. What a busy 24 hours. President-elect Trump moving on quickly and his push again the attorney general confirmed. The news sparking early praise from several Republican senators, one of whom notably saying that Bondi is not, in his words, quote, problematic. CNNs Lauren Fox and Alayna Treene are here with us now. Alayna, I want to bring you in first to start with this. Look, Trump allies are relieved by this choice, but I mean, yesterday, shortly after Gaetz announced that he was withdrawing, Trump didn't really have a plan of who to replace him. Then by last night, he announced Pam Bondi. How did this all come together?",

      "sentences": "Right. So, a few things. One is that I was told very early on after Gaetz had announced that he was withdrawing that Donald Trump is going to push all of his other cabinet picks to the side. He wanted to fight, figure out who his attorney new attorney general would be. Very quickly, Pam Bondi's name started to circulate. And then, of course, over just the course of a few hours is when he ultimately landed on her.I'm told he did that for a few reasons. One, of course, they have a good relationship. They've known each other for years. She was previously in his White House, helped on his first impeachment trial. She also knows Susie Wiles very well from her time in Florida, obviously. But that was an important part of this, I'm told, as well. And I'm also told that, I mean, it was very clear, people were telling Donald Trump this, but Trump's transition knew for days that Matt Gaetz was going to have a very difficult time getting those confirmation votes. They feel a lot more strongly that Pam Bondi will have an easier time going through this, and that was one of the key requirements, really. But I do want to walk through some of Pam Bondi's background, because I do think that's important to note here, as she now has to face her own kind of potential issues with senators who will be involved in her confirmation process. One, she's -- of course, she was a prosecutor for 18 years, the former first actual female attorney general in Florida. She fought to overturn Obamacare and preserve the Florida gay marriage ban while she was attorney general. She also most recently joined the amicus brief to federal appeals court in support of Donald Trump in the classified documents case. But I think the big thing with him and what we know about him, thinking that attorney general is going to be the most important role, the one that he is the most kind of obsessed with behind the scenes, is that he wants someone who will be a legal attack dog for him, but also someone who will be very loyal to him. And he believes that that is something that he will find in Pam Bondi. Now, I want you to take a listen to some of what we have. I believe we have a mash-up of some of the things that she has said, because she's also been someone, Pam, who has really kind of repeated the election -- the false claims of election fraud in 2020.",

It is about the integrity of this election. And every vote, as Mayor Giuliani said, in every state must be counted fairly. We need to fix this.

If he had become the attorney general, obviously, he would not be returning to Capitol Hill. But I think that's still an open question.One thing, if you're Matt Gaetz, that you might be weighing in this moment, is if you return to Capitol Hill, what does that mean for the ethics report that has been established against you? And I think one of the questions is, if you leave Congress and you're not running for attorney general, you're just looking to live in private life, then I think the Ethics Committee's report is likely not going to see the light of day. If you return to Capitol Hill, that does reignite it because the job of the House Ethics Committee is to police its own. And so that is something that Matt Gaetz is going to have to be weighing. But we don't have a clear answer right now on what his plans are, obviously, watching very closely.",

Thank you so much, Lauren Fox, Alayna Treene, we appreciate it.And joining us now is CNN Legal Analyst Carrie Cordero and CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst and former Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe. I want to start with you. Andy. You know, Bondi, as just laid out, has been a Trump loyalist for years. She also has had a lot of experience in Florida as an attorney, the A.G. there and, you know, she does have a lot of experience in that way, and she knows Trump very well. She's also faced scrutiny more than a decade ago over a $25,000 political donation she received from Trump just days after her office that it was reviewing allegations against Trump University. A former formal investigation was never opened and Bondi was cleared of wrongdoing, we should note, but Trump had to pay a fine. So, does this history between Trump and his new A.G., does it cause any concern or not?",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, I think it should rightly cause concern in drive interest on the part of the committee that will ultimately have to confirm or deny her appointment. I think, you know, no question, she has the minimum kind of standards in terms of what you would look for in terms of experience to be attorney general, prosecutorial experience and leadership experience as A.G. for the state of Florida. The questions about her decisions around them whether or not to join the lawsuit targeting Trump University and whether or not that payment had anything to do with that decision, I think that's really good, you know, subject matter for the Senate to focus on when they question her about her fitness for this job.My bigger and broader concern for her is the sort of prejudgment and preconceived notions about the department that she may bring to the job. She said a lot of really questionable things about the department, about its work and about its prosecutors, not to mention the thing she said about denying the results of the 2020 election. You know, if she gets confirmed and goes into that job with a legitimate interest in learning about the department, what they do, what the people are like who work there, despite the fact that you may have plans to make changes and do things differently, you know, she could have a productive experience as A.G. and do a good job for the people of this country. If she goes in with the preconceived notion that everyone there is a deep state operative out to get her, it's going to be a very rocky road for her, for the department and ultimately a disservice to the American people.",

I mean, we need to hear from her, she's going to obviously go before the Senate and so forth. And so I think it's really important to hear what she has to say when she talks about her intention for the Department of Justice.But also, you know, the bottom line is no matter who leads the Department of Justice, it's really Trump who's going to be doing a lot of, you know, the guiding, right? Because, I mean, he's made it very clear whoever runs that, he wants a loyalist and he wants someone who is going to do his bidding, right? I mean --",

      "sentences": "Yes. I think with the intent to nominate Pam Bondi, what this does is it takes us more into what is a normal situation in terms of the Senate evaluating her for advice and consent. It will enable the conversation on her conversation -- on her confirmation, excuse me, to shift moreover to what her priorities will be at the Justice Department, what types of focus she will have, whether that's going to be the focus of the Trump administration on immigration enforcement, drug trafficking, whether she will continue enforcement on national security matters and the complex cyber security prosecutions that have been brought on foreign influence. So, it will be an opportunity for the Senate to hear those things from her.It also, I think, an important question senators will be able to ask of her is whether or not she intends to keep in place the policy limiting contacts between the White House and the Department of Justice. [10:10:03] So, over different administrations, bipartisan, there have been policies in place that limit how different people in the White House beneath the president can communicate with leadership and people in the Justice Department. And what that does is it's supposed to insulate the department from political interference in an investigation, whether those are criminal prosecutions, whether that's civil rights enforcement, whether that's national security matters. And so she has a close relationship with the president. And so that would enable her, if she's confirmed, to keep -- to basically protect the department. This is what you would want an attorney general to do, is protect the department from political interference. And so questions in her confirmation hearing that focus on how she is going to manage the relationship with the president and the relationship with the White House will give the Senate an opportunity to hear from her on that.",

      "sentences": "And I think those are really important, valid questions to be asking. You know, we just heard Carrie layout sort of why there should be some independence from the Department of Justice and so it can remain insular from politics and that kind of thing, Andy. And on that note, I want to talk about the FBI, because we know that Trump has been interviewing people to replace direct array of the FBI, including Kash Patel and Mike Rogers and others. He's considering a serious shakeup to leadership there.And I just want to take a step back to recognize how unusual this is, that he is looking to fire the FBI director that he put in place after he fired the previous FBI director, and why this is so unusual. I'd love for you to hear your insight on why that's so unusual, and why the FBI director typically has a ten-year term.",

      "timeStamp": "10:05:02",
      "speaker": "MCCABE",
      "sentences": "Sure. So, the ten-year term is really important. It's the thing that one of the things that makes the FBI totally different than every other government agency. There's only one political appointee in the FBI. It's the director. They're appointed to a ten-year term. And there are two reasons for that. One is it's thought to insulate the director from pressure from the White House.Any director who serves ten years will quite naturally serve more than one presidential administration. So, it raises them up to a level of kind of neutrality that no other division head has. But it's also meant to protect the American people from the FBI director. In the aftermath of J. Edgar Hoover serving somewhat disgracefully for 40 years, you know, nobody wanted that to happen again. So, that's where it comes from. Presidents of every stripe, Republican and Democrat, have acknowledged the importance of a consistent, stable, independent leadership in the FBI, and that -- really, that idea was shattered when Donald Trump fired James Comey. So, the idea that he's now going to come in and likely fire the person he replaced Jim Comey with is not surprising for Donald Trump, but it's quite surprising for the FBI. It's a sort of thing that really changes the nature of the organization and really changes the way that the employees think of themselves and their place in the Washington kind of bureaucracy and their independence. So, now we think about who he's going to put in that job. And that question of independence is crucial. From my perspective, for instance, Mike Rogers is someone who would make a logical and reasonable FBI director, may not agree with him on everything, but he certainly has the background, the connection to the organization as a former FBI agent. He is someone deeply familiar with intelligence matters, has proven himself reliable and trustworthy in handling that material. So that's all good. Kash Patel is kind of the polar opposite. He is someone who has little to no experience in an organization or a leadership position of any size, doesn't understand the organization, frequently says things that are maybe cute sound bites on podcasts but indicate that he doesn't really understand the mission and the organization and the people who work there. And someone who is by his own statements, professed himself to be interested in one thing, and that is tearing up and disrupting the current FBI, not a good thing for the people of this country to have that sort of chaos introduced into an organization that they depend up on for their safety.",

I think that is a serious threat. You know, there is talk of creating a panel, a civilian panel, to assess at the three and four star level, whether or not those individuals should be terminated. It is, of course, the prerogative of the president of the United States as the commander-in-chief, Article 2 of the Constitution, to really exercise an amazing amount of power just hasn't been done before. But the biggest concerns I have with this incoming administration is not the abuse of the law, in the sense of distorting it to something it never was intended to be, but it's the use of the existing law to a point beyond the norms of policy and practices that we've ever seen, such as prosecuting journalists under the Espionage Act.
