On Wall Street, a global market meltdown, stocks are plunging as investors worried that U.S. could be heading toward a recession. In the Middle East, Israel is preparing for a retaliatory strike from Iran or Hezbollah or maybe both. There's a lot of fear that that could come within hours.And here, look at Washington. We are tracking who's coming and who's going at Vice President Harris's residence. Her choice for the number two spot on her ticket could come at any moment. We are going to start though with the markets. CNN Richard -- CNN's Richard Quest is here to break it all down and try to explain to our viewers and to me, why this is happening.

We saw that on Friday with the unemployment and the job creation numbers. They were poor, too bad, not dreadful, poor too bad.But now everybody is starting to say the Feds left it too late to reverse course and cut interest rates. And so, this is the effect. Stocks are starting to fall because there is a fear now. The economy will slow, still a minor chance of a recession. Less than 30 percent say most people, but it's a question of fear. And since you're talking Inside Politics, you have -- Dana, you have to factor this in to the equation. Donald Trump is already calling this the Kamala crash. There is a political angle to this, the Fed too late, the Donald (Ph), Kamala Harris, part of the whole Inflation Reduction Act, the whole stimulus package at the beginning of the Biden administration. This politics wreaking throughout. BASH: I just have one quick follow up question. If the Fed would have lowered interest rates as many expected them to do, last week I believe it was. Could this have been prevented?",

We move forward regardless of politics. And they've done it before, they just move forward. But either side would claim a move at this point.As indeed in September, if they do not move in September, Dana, choose your restaurant and buying your dinner.

The Fed says that they're not political. They try to do things outside of politics. But there are people who think that they didn't do the production in part because they worried that the thumb would be on this scale. But if they lower the interest rate, even at all in September that's closer to the election. MAGGIE HABERMAN, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Correct.

They basically said, there was no contentious primary for Harris. This is right. But we're seeing it now. We're seeing the factions fighting each other now over who the vice-presidential selection pick will be. And the idea that maybe Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who may have been the front runner Friday, peak too early. You know, we're talking about this campaign, that's all compressed into two weeks. You pick too early by a few hours, is that possible? It could cost him because it gave people a chance to complain. We'll just going to wait and see over the next few hours. BASH: Well, complain and also really go after him. And then the OPPO (Ph). This -- I remember this happening four years ago when Joe Biden was picking somebody, we knew it was going to be an African American woman, he said that. And the OPPO was going -- that was going around. These are -- this is Democrat on Democrat, which you do see in a big way and during primaries that happened then, and it's happening now as well. Josh Shapiro, they're going after him for a whole host of issues. Then you have somebody like Chris Christie, who was on Sunday on with George Stephanopoulos. Here's what he said about the potential for Josh Shapiro. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR: It's going to show whether she's really trying to reach out to her entire party, and by extension, the entire country. I think she needs to pick someone who's more moderate than her. It should be Josh Shapiro. I don't think this is a hard choice. He's a very talented politician.

But this was sort of more evocative of January 2021, than anything that we have seen in the last year. And this is what he does when he feels like he's under threatened or his corner or threatened. That's right. And so, you're seeing all of that, you know, nobody needs to wonder whether he is concerned about the state of this race. Just look at what he's saying on the trail. Part of what his advisers hope he will do is frame an attack against the vice president as fake. And you've seen him do some of that in his rallies. He did say that.
