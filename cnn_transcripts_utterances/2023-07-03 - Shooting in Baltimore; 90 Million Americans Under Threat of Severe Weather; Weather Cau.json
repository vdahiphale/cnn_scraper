We are in the middle of the holiday leading into July 4th and people had gathered here for a block party. This was supposed to be a celebration of community and the families that live here, but it became deadly shortly after midnight. That's when police say shots rang out. Two people are dead, including an 18-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man. Twenty-eight people were hurt by gunfire, many of them teenagers, some as young as just 13 years old.Now, as you said, police have not identified a suspect or suspects yet. However, they believe there are multiple people behind this shooting. Now, we heard from Mayor Scott earlier this morning. He was encouraging the community to come forward and share any information that they might have about this incident. Also critical about guns all around the country, not just here in Baltimore, saying that this is a problem across the entire country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR BRANDON SCOTT (D-BALTIMORE, MD): We will not rest until we find those who cowardly decided to shoot up this block party and carry out acts of violence, with which we know will be illegal guns, but we -- no further updates will be given. A press update later today with any new things. But as of right now, we are still investigating, going through every single lead, every minute, every second of footage, everything that we have to find out who decided to disrupt this peaceful event in this way.

Powerful storms are expected to spread from Mississippi to Massachusetts, bringing wind gusts, hail and possibly tornadoes in some areas now. A record number of travelers passed through U.S. airports on Friday, but the weather has created travel nightmares for those wanting to spend the holiday away from home. So far 86 flights have been canceled today, but that number is almost certain to rise as storms start to pop up all across the country.CNN's Pete Muntean is live at Reagan National Airport, where I'm pretty sure he has a private room where he stays. We also have CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. Allison, we're going to start with you. Looking at that mad and as things happen, what do we expect and where do we expect these storms to pop up?",

      "sentences": "All right, so there's going to be two separate areas of concern going forward today. The first is going to be across portions of the Midwest and the high plains. The secondary area is really just kind of up and down much of the East Coast. And if you remember, some of those are the same areas that were just hit yesterday. Again, in total, nearly 300 total storm reports. The vast majority of them being damaging winds. But you can see here how many of these areas we're having dealing with large hail, trees that came down, power lines that were down, and also the potential for a few tornadoes.Right now the heaviest rain is going to be across portions of the northeast. But as we transition into the afternoon, we get that heating of the day, you're going to really start to notice more of those strong to severe thunderstorms fire up this afternoon and into the evening for both of these areas. Now, the main threats are still going to be damaging winds, the potential for some large hail and, yes, even some tornadoes possible from Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., New York, stretching down into Atlanta. That secondary wave that is set to come in likely about 2:00 to 3:00. In a lot of these areas is when you're really going to start to notice those showers and thunderstorms firing back up. They will continue into the evening hours and then even more showers and thunderstorms, unfortunately, for the holiday itself tomorrow. So, if you have some outdoor plans, most of these areas aren't expecting a washout, but you will have to be cautious if you've got some plans say late afternoon and into the evening when the bulk of these severe thunderstorms are really set to impact. You've got this other area over here in the Midwest and across the high plains and then still dealing with some strong to severe thunderstorms say from the areas of Massachusetts stretching back into Mississippi. The main threats tomorrow are expected to be damaging winds and the potential for some hail, but also some isolated flooding cannot be ruled out as well. And then in addition to that we still are dealing with the heat across portions of the southeast and then some new warnings popping up out in some western states as well.",

The TSA screened 2.5 million people yesterday, another 2.5 million people the day before that. Those are big numbers on their own.But think about this number on Friday, 2.88 million people screened at airports across the country. It's not a pandemic era record, it is an all-time record. It bested the big number back on the Sunday after Thanksgiving 2019. So, we've not seen a number that big since December 1st of 2019. I just checked Flight Aware. The cancellations and delays relatively low right now when you compare it to last week, 87 nationwide, about 800 delays. Think about just yesterday we saw 600 cancellations nationwide, and that number really crept up when these thunderstorms hit the East Coast. And there's a bit of a warning now from the FAA saying that we could see ground stops as the day goes on, especially in the afternoon in big hubs like New York, in Philadelphia, in Baltimore, in D.C., all the way down to Miami. The good news, says Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on CNN, is that things are starting to get back on track after all of the cancellations we saw last week. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Its CEO, Scott Kirby, has released a new memo in which he says the airline is going to look at its crew scheduling system, it's going to partner better with the FAA. Again, Kirby put a lot of blame on the FAA for these problems and air traffic control scheduling issues last week. He says that's really what caused the snowball effect and all of these cascading cancellations for United. But then he also says the airline's going to look at its schedule at Newark. That's one of its major hubs. He says the airline just may be putting too many flights through Newark.Still, we are not out of the woods just yet. Another huge test for the airlines coming up. All these people coming home all at once and the TSA says, when it's all said and done, when you add up every day since before the holiday, and through July 5th, they'll screen 17.7 million people in total, Sara.

France has been gripped by violent demonstrations following that shooting. French President Emmanuel Macron has condemned the shooting of the teenager, calling it inexcusable, but, he says, protesters, he believes, are exploiting the teen's death.

And this is a sort of an outgrowth of that in this community where the mayor was targeted over the weekend in his office behind the razor wire that protesters couldn't get in. They targeted him in his house. His wife in there with young children tried to escape. She broke her leg badly.So, people here in this particular suburb of Paris have come out here in a show of solidarity for the mayor, for their communities, for the sense of what Nahel's grandmother is saying, that don't burn the buses, don't burn the city halls, we all rely on that. Your mothers rely on that. I think that's one of the things we've heard from the government as well that so many of these protesters are young protesters, 2,000 detained, average age 17, some as young as 13. The government's message is to parents to keep your children indoors. They've treated this as a security problem beginning to turn their attention to some of the underlying concerns about racism within the police force. But this, today, is really all about a community coming out in support of their mayor when he's in trouble and coming out with that message, like the grandmother, just saying it's time to stop. Stop burning the buses. We all need them. Let's get on with life. And that does seem to be the trend. The violence far less last night than the previous night and the previous night. That seems to be the direction at the moment. They're ebbing away these protests.",
