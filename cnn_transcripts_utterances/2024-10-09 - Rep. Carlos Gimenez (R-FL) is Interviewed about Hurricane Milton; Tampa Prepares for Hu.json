Congressman, thank you very much for being with us this morning. I do want to note that you also, before joining Congress, where a career firefighter and paramedics, so you have looked at these kinds of incidents from a variety of angles. What is your message to your constituents at this hour as this storm approaches, and what are you most worried about? REP. CARLOS GIMENEZ (R-FL): Well, for my constituents, we don't expect to feel the brunt of this storm. Key West will probably be - be the most effected. Something like what happened with Helene. I think we have like maybe up to three to five feet of storm surge. And I think that's something that Key West can - can handle. But, you know, need to prepare for localized flooding. On the other hand, the Tampa Bay down to Fort Myers areas, depending on where that - the eye actually makes landfall, it's going to make all the difference in the world in terms of - of the - the height of the storm surge. And so, my message to those folks are, if you were ordered to evacuate, evacuate. Most people that parish in a hurricane do so - do so from the storm surge. So, if you're in its path, you need to get out. You know, you need to get out and you need to get out now. It's better to be safe than sorry.

You mentioned Obama and Chris Christie. I mean, Joe Biden and Ron DeSantis during a building collapse. I remember that scene of him reaching over and touching the governor's hand at that point while they were trying to plan the way forward. You're just not seeing it this time. I mean, almost immediately after Hurricane Helene, you have former President Trump say the misleading claim that the Georgia governor was struggling to reach President Biden as well for hurricane recovery.
