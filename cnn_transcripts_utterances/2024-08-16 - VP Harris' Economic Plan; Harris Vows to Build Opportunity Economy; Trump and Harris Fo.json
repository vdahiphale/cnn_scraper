Together we will build what I call. opportunity economy. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCKEND (voice-over):  Speaking Friday in Battleground, North Carolina, Harris outlined a series of proposals, including expanding the child tax credit to as much as $3,600 up from $2,000, adding a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for families with newborns, expanding the earned income tax credit for lower income workers without children.

Andin a message likely meant for Iran, he says no one should in the region should undermine the process. The U.S. and its allies are pushing for an agreement to be reached next week. International mediators wrapped up two days of talks in Qatar hours ago, with more talks expected in Egypt in the days to come. A proposal aimed at bridging the remaining differences was put forward. Israel says it's returned from the talks feeling cautiously optimistic and that gaps have been narrowed. This as the U.S. condemns an attack by Israeli settlers on a Palestinian village in the West Bank. More than 70 armed settlers invaded the village of Jit, firing on residents and setting homes on fire, according to local authorities. They say at least one person was killed. For more on this, we'll speak to our Jeremy Diamond who's in Haifa, northern Israel. Jeremy, good to have you with us tonight. It does seem that there is a degree of cautious optimism about this scale, the degree, the approach of these talks compared to what I think we've ever seen in the past. But history also tells us you have to be very cautious about their ability to close that final gap. What are we thinking at this stage about the talks next week?",

But for now, there is no doubt that there is aconcerted, multilayered effort to try and get Iran to hold its fire, to give the space for these diplomatic efforts to take hold, for the ceasefire negotiations to continue. Clear messages being sent by multiple countries involved in the process to Iran, that should you choose to fire on Israel at this very delicate moment, you risk upending all of the progress being made towards a ceasefire, which Iran claims that it would like to see in Gaza. And one of the clearest indications of the fact that Iran appears to be holding off and is certainly in communication about the progress of these talks and keeping tabs on them is the fact that the Qatari prime minister, who has been intimately involved in these negotiations, over the past two days, he has spoken with the Iranian foreign minister as many times. And so, he is keeping him posted on the progress of these talks and making very clear to him that any kind of escalation at this point would undermine those negotiations. And so, it seems that at least for now, Iran is heeding those warnings. We will have to see how that unfolds as we get closer to the next round of talks next week.",

I thought that was very effective. It was interesting to me that she seems to have toned down some of the rhetoric that her campaign was putting out earlier this week on the price gouging stuff. If you look at the materials that the campaign had sent out a few days ago to reporters, perhaps you received them as well, Julia, it was about punishing companies for raising prices above their costs and things like that, and echoed some bill text that is currently sitting in the Senate, proposed by Senators Bob Casey and Elizabeth Warren. That is basically price controls. Casey seems to think she has endorsed his bill. He put out a press release today saying she had, but the speech text itself was much more restrained and basically talked about, you know, enforcing existing antitrust laws. So, you know, I think she -- there may be attuned to some of the criticism they've received. You're right. It was very light on details.

Large waves, five to 10 meters high crashing into the shore here because this was a very large typhoon, the equivalent of a Category 4 Atlantic hurricane. And now, it is finally moving away. But it did put down quite a bit of rain, over half a month's rain in Tokyo itself there at 89 millimeters and along the coast, 171, the highest gust that I could find was 96 KPH. Probably some higher than that gusts along any of these buoys out there or any of the ships that may have been moored out in the ocean. It does move away and it continues to move away and that's the good news. Doesn't do much after that. It may get up toward the Aleutian Island chain still as something, but not a typhoon.

Whether it gets the middle of the eye, the left side, or the right side, it's still wobbling back and forth just a little bit, but there's not much time to prepare now. Eventually, though, it could even make a little run at Nova Scotia. And there you go, for Saint John's. But not any longer in the middle of the cone. That doesn't mean you're not in the cone, because you certainly still are. But 100-mile per hour gusts without a doubt here in Bermuda and the islands.

Some of its other partners include Uber Eats and 7-Eleven stores. For now, the L.A. based company is sticking close to home. However, it does have plans to scale up across the United States to as many as 2,000 robots by the end of next year. Ali Kashani is the CEO of Serve Robotics and he joins us now.

Longer distance deliveries, you can have humans or other modes of, you know, transportation. But you really don't need a two-ton vehicle to move two-pound burritos a mile. It's just a very inefficient way of doing things.

You mentioned him, Joshua Zirkzee. It was a really wonderful moment for him coming onto the field of play. Just past the hour mark. And then, he picks the ball up in midfield. We don't see it there, but he actually picked the ball up in midfield to set up the move. Casually rolls it out to the young Argentine, Alejandro Garnacho. And then, just jogs nonchalantly into the puck. Flicks out a left footed in front of a Trafford end and guided into the back of the net. A wonderful finish from him. He's pure composure. He really is. It was a comedy of errors near the end as well. (INAUDIBLE) defending. And counters Garnacho miss from just a few yards out there. I think those players, Julia, clearly thinking they're still in preseason training. But anyway, one goal wins it for United, their manager, Erik ten Hag, very happy with three points.
