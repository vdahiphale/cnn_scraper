At least one death was reported in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where hundreds of homes and buildings have been damaged. Anger on the streets of Nairobi again, as police and protesters have been tensely facing off. CNN's team on the ground reports large amounts of tear gas with at least one bloodied man being rushed to hospital. Israel's military issuing more evacuation orders from southern Gaza, forcing residents, most of whom were already displaced, to seek shelter elsewhere. But as we've been reporting for months now, there is nowhere safe for these people to go. (MUSIC PLAYING)",

All of this as the campaign continues to grapple with the fallout after his halting debate performance last Thursday night. Now this speech marks the first time Biden was speaking at the White House since that debate and since returning from Camp David, where he spent a few days with his family, which is encouraging him to stay in this race. The speech lasted just under five minutes. The president read from a teleprompter and took no questions. But he did try to use this moment to warn of the stakes of this election, saying that the Supreme Court's ruling would simply embolden president -- former president Trump to do whatever he pleases, whenever he wants. And he was trying to encourage voters to use this as a rallying moment to dissent when they cast their votes in November. But even as the president was speaking out there publicly, behind the scenes, Biden's campaign is fielding calls from anxious Democrats and donors, who are concerned about what the path forward will be for Biden. Especially if he remains at the top of the Democratic ticket. They held a phone call, top campaign officials last night, with about 500 donors, where they talked about the president, defended his health and said that his candidacy remains on track. But you are starting to hear from some Democrats signaling some openness to replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. One of those was congressmen Mike Quigley of Illinois, who, earlier today, said that ultimately it's a decision that's up to Biden himself. But he also needs to take into account the impact it could have, not just - - not just on his own candidacy but on other Democrats as well.

Israeli airstrikes again targeting Khan Younis in southern Gaza, overnight killing eight people. Israelis ordering people in parts of the city and elsewhere to leave the region. But, and forgive me, I know this sounds repetitive but it is true that there is no safe place to go. The U.N. says this is sparking a massive movement of about 250,000 people, quarter of 1 million people. This as Israel's prime minister again suggested that the current phase of the war is winding down. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is with us from Jerusalem. And I want to talk with you about what it is that we believe the prime minister's plan is at this point for Gaza.

It is an incredible undertaking and it is one that always leaves some people behind, most often of the most vulnerable of that population. And indeed that is what has occurred time and again in Gaza and is occurring once again now in eastern Khan Yunis. Yesterday, the Israeli military ordering the evacuation of parts of eastern Khan Yunis as well as eastern Rafah. The United Nations estimating that 250,000 people would be impacted by this. But beyond people who are living either in homes or in tents in that area around those hospitals, there is also the displacement of about 600 patients at the European Hospital, which lies right between Khan Younis and Rafah. Most of those 600 patients we're told were transferred to other hospitals deeper inside of Khan Younis. That's because that hospital did fall within that evacuation zone outlined by the Israeli military yesterday. But today, the Israeli military is saying that this evacuation order did not apply to the patients of that hospital, that there was at least no intention to have it evacuated. But of course, the doctors there know all too well, the risks of remaining in an evacuation zone. And clearly that does not appear to have been communicated to them yesterday when they began to evacuate that hospital. Now as far as what is coming next, we know that overnight, following these evacuation orders, the Israeli military carried out airstrikes in eastern Khan Younis. Where the Israeli military says, earlier in the day, about 20 rockets were fired from that is -- from that area toward Israeli towns and cities. What's not clear is whether or not this evacuation order was simply in anticipation of those strikes or if it is perhaps signaling a new ground operation in that area. This is often the case when we see these evacuation orders. We do often tend to see a major ground operation take place shortly thereafter. We have not yet seen signs of that. But it all comes as we believe that this phase, this current phase of Israeli military operations, one that involves significant numbers of ground troops and operating within major Palestinian cities in Gaza, that phase is coming to an end. At least that's what the Israeli prime minister himself has been signaling. But if there is another significant operation in Khan Younis, of course, then Rafah, which we once thought would be the last kind of ground operation before that next phase indeed will not be the last to come here. So a lot of remaining means to be seen on the ground. But ultimately there's no question that the displacement of a quarter of 1 million people heading, many of them to the quote-unquote \"safer\" area of al-Mawasi, where there simply are not enough resources for the number of people who've been displaced there is going to simply add to the suffering of people in Gaza. And obviously an indication that the fighting is continuing for the time being.",

It will make it impossible, I think, for any of the cases that are now pending to be tried before the election. I think that is his primary short-term objective. The Supreme Court's new analysis of presidential immunity with regard to criminal prosecution rules out his being prosecuted for anything he did, you know, allegedly corruptly with regard to the Department of Justice and its officials. Because the court classifies those as not merely official acts but acts within what it calls its -- his exclusive, preclusive authority. But the other parts of the (INAUDIBLE) indictment are still potentially up for grabs. They are subject only to what the court called a presumptive or presumption of immunity, which could be overcome if prosecution would not threaten the separation of powers or indeed if the interests of the other branches of government were stronger than the interests of the executive. And I think that is certainly true for that prosecution involving trying to manipulate the vice president. That's true for the prosecution involving the phony elector slates. It's a little unclear how it would play out for January 6th and his speeches on that day. What is scarier about the opinion, it's not what it would mean in the short term. What is scarier is what happens if Trump should be reelected because then he would have been told that, pretty much anything he does, that is tolerably (ph) within, again, this area of Article II power the court describes as being exclusive and preclusive, would be immune to prosecution.
