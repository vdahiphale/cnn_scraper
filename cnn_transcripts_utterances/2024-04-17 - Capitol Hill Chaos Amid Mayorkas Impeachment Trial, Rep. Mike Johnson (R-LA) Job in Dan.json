New details on the cyber attack that left thousands of Americans without water. Sara is out today. I'm John Berman with Kate Bolduan. This is CNN News Central. BOLDUAN:  Revolts, turmoil on Capitol Hill, just a regular Wednesday you might be thinking, but this is a special brand of chaos today, one that now includes an impeachment trial in the making for the Homeland Security secretary. Alejandro Mayorkas is facing a Senate trial that could begin today after House Republicans got the ball rolling back in February, the same House Republicans who are currently upside down and inside out over their own leadership. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson fighting to hold onto his job, declaring that he is not resigning, calling it an absurd notion. But it's a real possibility as the reality he faces is a Republican rebellion sparked by his plan to finally move forward on billions of dollars in foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other American allies. The rock and hard place Johnson finds himself between is especially unique this time as he may have to rely on House Democrats to not only get the foreign aid bills over the finish line, he may have to rely on Democrats to save his speakership. CNN's Lauren Fox has more on this. Lauren, what is happening? Where do you want to begin?",

Now, Marjorie Taylor Greene has an outline if or when she's ultimately going to move forward with that, but she is indicating that moving forward with Ukraine aid for the speaker could potentially end his job as the speaker of the House. Now, on Friday, Mike Gallagher, a Republican, he's going to step aside from his seat. That means at that point that Mike Johnson has a one- vote margin. He can only lose one Republican unless he can get some Democratic votes. And that remains true when it comes to saving his job. Donald Trump, who has a lot of sway in the Republican conference, he was asked yesterday if he would step in to help Mike Johnson. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, at 1Now, after that, the question becomes, is there a trial? How big, how full is that trial? Some conservatives are pushing Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to hold a full multi-day trial. But the reality is many Democrats view what House Republicans did as really just a political protest against the Biden administration's policies on immigration. They argue that that is not an impeachable offense, and therefore, the expectation is they're going to try to get rid of this rather quickly. That likely would come in the form of some kind of motion to table or motion to dismiss. Now, all eyes are going to be on a handful of moderate Democrats who are running in red states, people like John Tester, people like Sherrod Brown, Bob Casey, who is running in Pennsylvania, a swing state. What are they going to do? The indication we've gotten from Casey is that he's happy to quickly dismiss this, where all eyes are going to be on John Tester and Sherrod Brown. But if this is just a vote from Republicans and Democrats and everyone stays on party lines, this could be over rather quickly, Kate.",

Of course, he did shrug when he suggested that that was his timeline. So, we'll have to see how long the rest of the process takes to play out. But I do want to note that, you know, watching this process play out has been really interesting so far. Trump's attorneys, prosecutors and the judge all seem to be laying the foundation for a fair trial here, the questioning of potential jurors and making sure that they are able to be impartial and render a fair verdict now. Now, of course, Donald Trump is the one who does seem to think that his ideal juror would be someone who renders a verdict in his favor. Take a listen to what he said when asked about whether or not he thought the jurors that are seated now can be fair. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They need a total of ten throughout this entire process, and these strikes, they can essentially eliminate any juror for any reason, so really winding down the amount of, like, say, that each side gets in this process. I want to go into a little bit about what we know about these seven jurors that have been seated already, though, because it's a really interesting cross-section of New York and of Manhattan. The foreperson is originally from Ireland, is married, reads the news, gets their news from The New York Times, the Daily Mail, watches some Fox News. That's a consistent theme, and one that jurors were asked a lot about their media consumption habits. So, you'll see a lot of them are very well read and do get their news from various sources, conservative, middle and left. One of the other jurors is, you know, a Puerto Rican man described as an older Puerto Rican man who's married with adult children. When he was asked about his hobbies, he said, quote, I guess my hobby is my family. He called Trump fascinating and mysterious when he was asked during jury questioning his thoughts on Donald Trump. So, it would be interesting to see how that juror sort of views the evidence, and they insisted that they could be impartial and fair. And the last one was really interesting because this juror was the only juror of the 18 questioned yesterday who had not heard before yesterday that Donald Trump was charged in other criminal cases. So, a really wide variety of jurors have already been seated. We need five more plus alternates, and we'll see how long that process takes.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, there's a lot of claims that made online from hackers that I spend my day trying to verify, and a lot of them don't pan out to be true. In this case, there was truth behind it. In January, a small town, Muleshoe, population about 5,000 in North Texas, had one of its water tanks at the water facility that treats drinking water overflow, an unusual event.And they investigated, and they found out they were indeed hacked. They took the system offline, replaced it, and were able to mitigate any damage. There wasn't any threat to the drinking water, but it was alarming for a small town like that to experience that. Fast forward to today, we're learning that a Russia-linked hacking group was behind that. Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm, tells us that a Russian group that is linked to the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU, known for sort of sabotage in Ukraine, sponsored the social media channel that claimed credit for this attack. Now, we don't know if it was actually the Russian military or one of their proxies that carried this out, but it's still a significant escalation, potentially, in targeting U.S. critical infrastructure. So, we've had the FBI investigating for several months. The White House has been on the phone with the state of Texas and others to try to get to the bottom of this. But the bottom line, Kate, is that water facilities across the U.S. are strapped for cash and personnel to deal with these kind of hacking threats. There's been an ongoing push at the EPA, the White House, others to try to support them. But it's very much a work in progress because the same people that are helping protect the water facility are also keeping the lights out in the town and doing other things. So, it's very much a question of resources, Kate.",

But what's interesting is that this stock failure came as they announced this new streaming service that they want to launch.That's a little bit light on the details. What they say is that the streaming contest will focus on live T.V. They're saying everything from news networks, religious channels, family friendly content, including films and documentaries, they're saying anything that is at risk of cancelation they want to have on this streaming service. But not a lot of details, including on the personalities or the shows, things that you might typically hear of when you're announcing a streaming service. They only say this is going to come out in three phases before it comes to your streaming T.V. My big question, though, is how will this streaming service work? It costs a lot of money. It takes a lot of work to make a streaming service successful. Think about Disney. Disney has a streaming service and it has a gold mine of content, and even they are not profitable yet. So, I don't understand exactly how this streaming service where we don't even know who will be on it, how it's going to make money. Now, obviously, there's a lot of competition already in this space. You know, the Trump audience, it's a smaller slice of a broader audience. There're places like OAN. There's Newsmax that already have a streaming service out there. So, how will they be able to capture the audience and make the money? Now, after this streaming announcement, it did not help the company stock. We can pull up that graph again just to see that freefall from that high in early March. Now, this freefall of the more than 60 percent, pretty much more than 70 percent valuation drop, that has erased more than $5 billion in market capitalization. Keep in mind that Trump, he's the majority stockholder in this. He has 60 percent stake in the company. So, this drop, that's actually affecting his own personal net worth.",
