      "sentences": "They could do. But, what Hamas is saying at the moment is that the loss of these three men is essentially nothing different to the loss of every other Palestinian person in Gaza. They are the same. So, they're saying this will make them more steadfast. But, they continue to stick to, as far as we know, stick to their demands that appear to be the holdup in the hostage-ceasefire negotiations at the moment, which is the return of displaced Palestinians from the south of Gaza to the north of Gaza. Now, if Hamas was to show more flexibility on that issue, then perhapsa deal could get closer. But, the killing of Ismail Haniyeh's three sons and three or four of his grandchildren, it now appears, certainly that's what Hamas is saying, something that is potentially quite explosive in the current environment. However, I think there are several ways of looking at this as well, because look, and some people in Gaza criticize Hamas for hiding in their tunnels, for not bearing the brunt of the strikes coming from Israel. More than 33,000 people dead. And some Palestinians in Gaza say, look, Hamas is hiding in its tunnels. Also, there are those critics of Ismail Haniyeh who say, look, you're the Hamas leader. You're the political bureau leader, but you're outside of Gaza. You don't feel the war the same way that we do. Early on in the war, people talked about tensions between that political operation of Hamas outside and those on the inside. So, when Ismail Haniyeh's three sons get killed in an Israeli airstrike, that almost lends him more credibility and more legitimacy inside of Gaza. But, I think that's moot because it does, as you say, come down to the negotiations, and in essence, he has paid a high personal price. But, his point and the Hamas' point is it shows (ph) everyone else in Gaza.",

Thanks so much.Iran's threat to retaliate against Israel for an attack on its embassy compound in Damascus, Syria, last week is stoking further tensions in the region. Iran's Foreign Minister has held calls with his counterparts from Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other nations to talk about consequences of that attack. On Wednesday, President Joe Biden said the U.S. remains ironclad in its vow to protect Israel from threats from Iran and its proxies. Security concerns are also prompting German airline Lufthansa to suspend flights to Tehran temporarily. Let's bring in now CNN's Scott McLean, who is joining us live from Istanbul, Turkey. Scott, concerns of a possible Iranian attack on Israel targets. I mean, those concerns are growing. What's the latest from your vantage point?",

The United States, from the outset of the conflict in Gaza, has said that one of its primary goals is to prevent this conflict from spreading throughout the region. And objectively, they haven't done a very good job of doing that. You have the Houthis in Yemen who continue to strike commercial shipping. You have the Hezbollah in Lebanon that continues to trade fire with the Israelis on Israel's northern border. And now, you have this strike on this diplomatic compound in Damascus that the Israelis have not taken direct responsibility for, but they have defended nonetheless, and sort of implied that they're responsible for it anyways.And now, the U.S., after we heard from the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, is expecting that any kind of attack is inevitable. This could come, they believe, by some of their proxy forces in the region that could strike American targets or Israeli targets. And as you mentioned, you had the Iranian Foreign Minister working the phones with the Saudis, the Iraqis, the Turks, the Emiratis, and the Qataris is to try to send a message to the United States, and the United States has been on the phone with many of those same people. And the message from either side has been pretty clear. Iran wants the United States to quit enabling the Israelis. They believe that they're causing problems in the region, and the United States wants Iran to turn down the temperature with its conflict with Israel. But, obviously, they're expecting that there will be some kind of retaliation, just when and where, they don't know.",

Thanks so much, Scott McLean.And we've just learned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned his nation that it is preparing for scenarios in locations other than Gaza. Speaking at an airbase south of Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said Israel had developed a strategy in face of potential attacks. All right. More than 200,000 people in Ukraine are now without power, after Russia pounded the country's energy infrastructure with more missile strikes. Officials say Kharkiv is the hardest hit with more than 10 missile strikes on that city alone. In Kyiv, people took shelter in the capital's metro system, as the missiles fell earlier there. Officials also say the Russian attack destroyed the largest power plant in the Kyiv region. This comes as parliament moved to overhaul Ukraine's rules governing how civilians are mobilized to fight. And looming over all of this are pleas from Ukraine's President, urging allies, especially the U.S., to continue their support. The top U.S. commander in Europe says Ukraine could lose the war against Russia without it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. CHRIS CAVOLI, COMMANDER, U.S. EUROPEAN COMMAND: The severity of this moment cannot be overstated. If we do not continue to support Ukraine, Ukraine could lose. They are now being out shot by the Russian side five to one. So, Russians fire five times as many artillery shells at the Ukrainians than the Ukrainians are able to fire back. That will immediately go to 10 to one in a matter of weeks. We're not talking about months. We're not talking hypothetically. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah. These overnight strikes on Ukraine's power grid, Fred, this was a very widespread big attack involving multiple types of missiles and drones, many of which, at least a third of which Ukraine was not able to shoot down. So, like, this is now a trend. We've seen several other attacks like this at the end of March, and they are very targeted, specifically targeting things like power generation facilities, gas storage facilities. And so, we saw today, and we can show you some video of this that we have geo located this attack, which apparently has completely destroyed, wiped out the generating capability of the largest power generating facility in the Kyiv region.Now, by some miracle, this has not led to any power outages in the regions served by this power plant, likely in part, because we're not now in the depths of winter. But, this is going to be difficult to repair. This means that the company that runs this plant now has no generating power left. One of their three facilities was occupied by Russia, the other destroyed at the end of March. So, this is part of a pattern. The Russian Ministry of Defense came out today and said that this is a response, it said, to Ukraine's attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure. We have, of course, seen an uptick this year in Ukrainian long-range drone attacks on Russian refineries and other energy facilities. But, this also fits a pattern, attrition, attempts to exhaust the Ukrainian population. And so, that is, in part, I think what we're seeing today. And of course, it has led to another round of appeals from Ukrainian officials, including President Zelenskyy, for more weapons, specifically air defense. Zelenskyy saying in a statement earlier, we need air defense support and not a blind eye and long discussions.",

Now, the President will be meeting one-on-one with Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos, and then they will bring in the Japanese Prime Minister Kishida for that first ever trilateral summit between the three leaders. Maritime security is expected to be at the top of the agenda, heading into this summit. Senior administration officials said that they were very concerned about China's actions in the South China Sea, particularly as they relate to the Philippines. There have been Chinese Coast Guard ships who have rammed Filipino ships, firing water cannons on cruise there.And one of the key announcements that they will discuss today will be that the Coast Guards of each country will hold a joint patrol in the Indo-Pacific region in the coming year. A senior administration official says that this will include the U.S. Coast Guard bringing members of the Japanese and Filipino Coast Guard onto their ships for training. And it comes at a time where it's heading into this summit. We also saw these joint military exercises between the U.S., Japan, Philippines and Australia, really highlighting this show of unity among these countries amid China's aggression in the region. Now, in addition to maritime security, there is also expected to be some new announcements when it comes to infrastructure projects in the region as well as new cellular technology investments. Now, this all comes as President Biden has really tried to showcase the strength of the Japanese and U.S. relationship. You saw that on hand yesterday with the official state visit of the Japanese Prime Minister, full pomp and circumstance, including a very lavish state dinner in the evening. Japan has really been a quite a willing partner. The Biden administration believes in the administration's Indo-Pacific policy at a time when Japan has increased their defense posture, and also has offered support to Ukraine amid Russia's invasion there. Now, President Biden has also gone to great lengths to draw in the Philippines as well, fostering this relationship with President Marcos after the previous leader, Rodrigo Duterte, had really tried to align the country more closely with China than with the U.S. So, we will see more of the President's push to really bolster the alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, which has been central to his strategy, keeping his eye on trying to reinvigorate those alliances, even as he has dealt with these conflicts between Israel and Hamas, and Ukraine and Russia, over the past few years.",

A crucial piece of legislation that allows U.S. intelligence agencies to carry out surveillance of foreign nationals failed to pass a procedural test in Congress on Wednesday because Donald Trump opposes the measure. Reauthorization of the FISA legislation was blocked when 19 far-right Republicans defied the party's leaders and tanked a rules vote. Trump had urged Republicans to vote against the reauthorization. It's yet another blow to the leadership of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who plans to meet, in fact, with Trump on Friday in Mar-a-Lago.

The trial is set to begin with jury selection on Monday. This is the hush money case in Manhattan against Donald Trump, many, many charges against him for falsifying business records related to those payments to Stormy Daniels in 2016, that he funneled through his Attorney Michael Cohen at the time.But, right now, his team is doing everything they can to try and kick up appeals or get any sort of delay, if possible. It has always seemed unlikely. And the appeals courts right now are affirming that there are not going to be any pauses to this trial. The District Attorney's Office in New York has argued quite clearly there is a powerful public interest for this trial to start on Monday, and the arguments that Donald Trump is bringing forth right now just are not enough to put a pause on the case. Monday, his team scrambled to the appeals court to try and get things paused because of the trial being set in Manhattan instead of moved elsewhere. That didn't work Tuesday, it was about the gag order on him in the case. They said it was unfair to him. That didn't work. The appeals court said, no, we're not pausing because of that. And then yesterday, this appeal, it was about a bunch of different things. They wanted to try and get the judge tossed off the case. They wanted to talk about presidential immunity about how they're going to be able to file things while the trial is going on. And the Appeals Court said that's not enough either. There isn't enough basis here to stop the train. We are going to trial on Monday. It's quite clear. At the same time, Fred, remember, there are other criminal cases out there against Donald Trump even when he is going to be sitting before a jury beginning on Monday as jury selection commences.

An update now on that controversial state Supreme Court ruling in Arizona that reset the state's rules on abortion, reinstating a ban originally passed in 1864. Donald Trump was asked about it on Wednesday and was confident the near total abortion ban in the state would be lifted. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

More than 65 million people from Florida to New York are under severe storm threats in the United States today. On Wednesday, the storm system ripped through the southern U.S., killing at least one person in Mississippi, where dozens of homes were damaged by high winds and flooding. Parts of Louisiana were also hit hard. New Orleans saw a month's worth of rain in just seven hours, causing widespread flooding there. And in the neighboring city of Slidell, a tornado carved a path of destruction there, injuring at least 10 people, according to police. The storm knocked down trees and damaged homes, as you see right there. CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam joining us now from Louisiana with more on the destruction, Derek. My goodness.

We've got a severe weather threat right now.And I want to pay attention into what's happening in Florida, in particular, Jacksonville all the way to Tampa and Savannah. That area has a slight risk of severe storms and across the Ohio River Valley. But, focusing in on the more immediate threat right now across the Florida Panhandle, some stronger thunderstorms, and they have just issued -- the Storm Prediction Center has just issued a new tornado watch that you could see highlighted in red, some stronger storms moving through Jacksonville into Tampa and Orlando here within the next one to three hours. And then, I want to focus in on Charleston, because they currently have a flash flood warning with a considerable tag attached to that as well. They have had around two to three inches of rain here overnight, with some of the heaviest precipitation moving in, as we speak. You can see the radar, very, very active across the coastal areas of the Carolinas. That's where we anticipate the flooding today as the storm system continues to move to the northeast, heads up across Ohio. That region had tornadoes a couple of weeks ago. So, they're still cleaning up from the damage from that. It is April, statistically one of the most active tornado months of the year here in the U.S. Fredricka",

And play ended up only having to be delayed about two and a half hours.Now, the weather, the rest of this weekend is going to be just awesome here in Augusta, and that's something that Tiger Woods is certainly looking forward to.
