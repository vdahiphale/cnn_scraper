Glossip's case has drawn many supporters -- very public ones -- state lawmakers, Kim Kardashian -- even Oklahoma's attorney general who in a very unprecedented move attended yesterday's board meeting to advocate for clemency. One Republican state lawmaker told CNN the case highlights a systemic problem in Oklahoma.

One person had to recuse themselves because they are the husband of the chief prosecutor who prosecuted this Glossip case in 2004. So that leaves you down to four people on this panel and it was a 2-2 vote. And since there's no majority, that means clemency was not granted. Now, that is something that the attorney for Glossip is going to challenge. He already has. And Kevin McDugle, who you just heard from there -- he's going to go right -- he went right to the governor's office after that hearing to arrange a meeting to figure out what next steps are. But as Don Knight said yesterday, Richard Glossip -- he's down but he's not out. Many people spoke in favor of this clemency yesterday. Again, the attorney general.

They are very effective for that indication. And they are very effective for people who have excess weight and who are obese to lose weight. And so what they do, at least Ozempic and Wegovy -- these drugs work by mimicking a hormone called GLP-1. And what that does is -- it's a hormone that's produced in our intestines after we eat and it does a few things. It goes to our pancreas. It encourages our pancreas to secrete insulin. It lowers our blood sugar -- really important for people with diabetes. It also affects our stomach. And so it has our stomach empty more slowly so we feel more full. And it has receptors in the brain to make us, again, feel more full and eat less. And for those reasons it's very effective. People end up losing 15, sometimes 20 percent of their body weight if they are in that higher BMI category.
