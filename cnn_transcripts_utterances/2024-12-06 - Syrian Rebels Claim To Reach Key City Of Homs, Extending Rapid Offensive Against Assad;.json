And tonight, a fast-changing picture in Syria asrebels continue to take regime territory, eyeing Damascus, we'll bring you CNN's exclusive interview with the man leading the group that's driving the offensive. Abu Mohammad Al-Jolani, this as hundreds of thousands of Syrians get uprooted in just the last few days, I'll be speaking to the U.N.'s regional coordinator to find out what people are up against. That's this hour. And brutal crackdowns in Georgia this week highlight the growing threat to peace and stability in eastern Europe. The Estonian Foreign Minister joins me live this hour for a conversation on that. A busy hour ahead. We begin, though, in Syria, where rebel fighters have opened a new front against the government of Bashar al Assad after taking key cities in the north. They are now launching an offensive, if you look at that map towards the south. The green areas on this map, you're looking at show the advances they have made so far, and it's all happening rather quickly in the southern province of Daraa. Rebels say they've taken over a military base and a border crossing into Jordan, and it comes a day after they claimed control over the city of Hama. That was in the north, anti-government protesters there celebrated the takeover, as you can see, by toppling a statue of Bashar al-Assad's father. Rebels now setting their sights on Homs as well as the capital, Damascus. Neighboring Turkey has been supporting rebel groups, even deploying forces. Here's what President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said about the advance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, PRESIDENT, TURKEY (through translator): Idlib, Hama and Homs, the target is, of course, Damascus. This march of the opponents continues as of now. We follow this from both Intelligence and all media. Of course, I will say that our wish is that this march in Syria continues without any accidents or hardship. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This institutionalization included the restructuring within military factions. They entered unified training camps and developed a sense of discipline. This discipline allowed them with God's guidance, to engage in a battle in an organized manner. The progress and execution of plans have been swift with clear communication and adherence to commands.

Iran can disengage from the regime, but the regime can't.

Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is merely one detail of this dialogue, and it may dissolve at any time. It's not an end in itself, but a means to perform a task confronting this regime. Once that task is complete, it will transition to a state of governance institutions and so on.

The circumstances of that war led people to various places, and my path led me to one of those locations, given my level of awareness and my young age at the time, my actions evolved to where I am today.

Today, in the liberated areas, about one-third of the population lives in camps, approximately 1.5 million people. I believe we can soon reach a point where there are no camps. With the rehabilitation of the liberated areas, people will return to their homes. Many refugees in Turkey will likely return as well as significant number of refugees in Lebanon and Jordan.

Syrians have gone through so much and they're resilient. Just in the last few days, people have painted over this with the colors of the free Syria flag. And this is something you see around the city where people are trying to remove any signs of the Assad regime. This is the Bassel roundabout named after the deceased brother of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. And one of the first things that people did when rebel forces took over the city of Aleppo was topple the statue of Bassel, a symbol of the Assad regime. This is an area where there were fierce battles with regime forces. And since then, in the past few days, there's been an air strike that killed many people. You can still see the aftermath of that, the blood on the floor here. And speaking to people in the city, this is what they fear. They fear that there will be more Russian and Syrian regime airstrikes, that they will be back for the city of Aleppo. Hamad, this is your first time back to Aleppo in 10 years?",

And ultimately, as you say -- and I heard your earlier speaker saying -- I mean, people do want to go home. You know, there have been people who have been living in Idlib for many years, and they're desperate to go home, but they also need to be careful. I also spoke to someone in hospital in Idlib. And the reason why he was in hospital is he tried to go home to where he lived, in Hama, and he stepped on a landmine. So, this is something that they need to be very wary of as well.",

I mean, when I was there earlier this week, for example, we saw people in a reception center and aid agencies had managed to distribute tents, mattresses, blankets to help people survive the winter cold, but there was a lack of retreats and other items. So, I think, you know, the bottom line is, you know, there are systems there to support these people. But one of the problems is a lack of funding. And the humanitarian response plan for Syria for this year, we saw just over $4 billion was only 30 percent funded.

Well, still in the United States, senior White House aides are considering the possibility of U.S. President Joe Biden issuing preemptive pardons for people who may be targeted by Donald Trump. The President-elect and his supporters have openly talked about prosecuting people such as Congressman Adam Schiff, former Congresswoman Liz Cheney, and Special Counsel Jack Smith. He's the one, of course, who brought federal charges against Trump. But this type of potential pardon is controversial and could set a precedent for future presidents. Joining me now for the very latest from Washington and our Paula Reid. So, Paula, is it just potentially those three? Is he looking at others to pardon?

And these would be for people who might be targeted for prosecution by President-elect Trump once he takes office. Now, Biden's senior aides have been deliberating this for weeks as possibility of using preemptive pardons. This is something that would cover people who haven't actually been accused of crimes to protect them for prosecution. But this is controversial because this would be an extraordinary step. I mean, the fact that they're even having this debate highlights the concern many Democrats have that Trump will go after those he perceives to be his political enemies. We've also learned that several white-collar lawyers across Washington have also been fielding calls in recent weeks from government officials, including investigators from Special Counsel Jack Smith's office, who are concerned that they could be targeted by the incoming administration. But this is also controversial because of the precedent. And Trump advisors have been watching this. They believe that Biden could be setting a new precedent in terms of the scope of pardons that Trump could also take advantage of down the line to help his own allies. So, definitely uncharted territory. And at this point, it's unclear if the Biden White House will actually fall through on these preemptive pardons.",
