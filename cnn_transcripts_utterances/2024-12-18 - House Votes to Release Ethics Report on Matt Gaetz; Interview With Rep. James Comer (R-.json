Instead, House Ethics will reportedly post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.\"And he goes on to say this. \"In my single days,\" Matt Gaetz says, \"I often sent funds to women I dated, even some I never dated, but who I asked. I dated several of these women for years. I never had sexual contact,\" he says, \"with someone under the age of 18. Any claim that I have would be destroyed in court,\" he goes on to say, \"which is why no such claim was ever made in court.\" \"My 30s,\" he says, \"were an era working very hard and playing hard too. It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized,\" he goes on to say, \"drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I have a different life now,\" Matt Gaetz says, \"but at least I didn't vote for C.R.s that effed over the country.\" That's all for this hour of CNN NEWSROOM, that very frank and candid response from Matt Gaetz there.",

I'm Pamela Brown in Washington. We are following breaking news on Capitol Hill this morning. CNN, as we were just talking about, exclusively learned that the House Ethics Committee has secretly voted to release its report on former Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, and it's expected to be made public. The bombshell reversal follows the committee's decision last month not to release the report. CNN chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju joins us live. And, Manu, you and your colleagues broke this story. So, a reversal here, now that Matt Gaetz is out of Congress and now Gaetz is responding to this decision.",

He serves as the chairman of the House Oversight Committee. Mr. Chairman, thanks for coming on. So, you just heard Manu's report. It appears this Matt Gaetz report will be made public, Gaetz admitting in a social media post moments ago that he was a womanizer and partier, which he said is embarrassing, though not criminal. Do you support the release of this report? If not, do you know of any efforts to stop it? REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY):  I don't have any -- I don't -- thankfully, I'm not on the Ethics Committee. I don't know what's in the report. It's not entirely unprecedented for them to release a report on a former member. The last time that happened was Bill Boner, who represented Nashville. I knew Bill Boner because, when he left Congress, he ended up in my hometown of Tompkinsville, Kentucky, managing a business there. But Gaetz is going to have an opportunity to defend this. And I'm sure he will be given plenty of TV time on CNN and other networks to defend himself against any allegations in the report that may or may not be true. I have no idea, but I know that the Ethics Committee voted to release it, so it's going to be released and America will be able to see what's in there.

So I'm not surprised. I think it's unfortunate. But, at the end of the day, I think that the American people probably want to see this Ethics report. I think the Ethics Committee knew that.

It's been suspended for the last 15 years. So it's one of those things that I think a lot of members of Congress were advocating for a pay increase. I was not one of them. But it's -- if the pay had been increased with the cost of living adjustment, if they hadn't been suspending that, congressional salary, I believe, would have been $243,000. This year, it's $174,000.That's a lot of money in Kentucky, so I'm not complaining about the about the pay. But I was surprised to see it in there. When the bill was being explained, that was never mentioned. So it was it was kind of a surprise.

Just last month, the Ethics Committee voted along party lines not to release its investigation into allegations of illegal drug use and sexual misconduct, allegations, I will note, that Gaetz has denied. Joining us now is CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor. So, Elie, you saw Gaetz's response to this, right? Does he have any legal recourse to block this report?",

This is fully within the purview and the discretion of Congress. However they vote is however this report's going to go. There's really nothing Gaetz can do to stop it.",

      "sentences": "Right.So I just saw this news really quickly. I haven't had a chance to fully scrutinize the Supreme Court's order. But what this is, is a law that was passed by Congress earlier in this year that said, if TikTok is not sold to an American buyer by January 19 of 2025, so a month from now, then it will be banned. Now, TikTok had challenged that ban. They had not succeeded. They lost in the district court. They lost in the Court of Appeals, which said that the ban is lawful and can go into effect. And so TikTok, the other day, went to the Supreme Court and said, we would like you to intervene. And so it sounds like now, the Supreme Court has agreed, we're going to hear this case. We're going to hear it on an expedited, on a rushed basis, a hurried basis, because that date is looming, that January 19, 2025, date. So this is a win for TikTok, to be sure. It at least gives them a fighting chance to challenge this law and either to have it put on hold or to have it blocked. The alternative, if the Supreme Court said, we're not hearing this or we're not going to hold it, then that ban would have gone into effect a month from now, and TikTok could well have been pulled off of American phones.",
