Officials are working to determine whether two bodies found yesterday are those of Veronica Butler and Jilian Kelley. The women -- they were on their way to pick up their children when they disappeared late last month.Now, four people were arrested Saturday and charged with murder. The relationship between the suspects and the victims is currently unknown. The Hollywood armorer convicted after the deadly shooting on the \"Rust\" movie set will face sentencing today. Prosecutors are asking for Hanna Gutierrez-Reed to get the maximum penalty of 18 months behind bars. They say she has shown no sign of remorse after the death of the film's cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. And Gutierrez-Reed's lawyers say she should be released on probation. There are also new court documents, though, revealing Gutierrez-Reed complained about the jurors who found her guilty of involuntary manslaughter in recorded phone calls from jail. She called those jurors \"idiots\" and \"a-holes.\" American golfer Scottie Scheffler is a Masters champion again, playing an amazing back nine to win his second green jacket. And it wasn't the only thing on his mind, though. His wife is super-pregnant -- that's a technical term coming from someone who has been super-pregnant -- with their first child. And he said he would have left the tournament at a moment's notice had she gone into labor. She didn't, and he clearly capitalized on the extra innings, to mix sports metaphors. This makes Scheffler the 18th player to win the Masters more than once and the first since Bubba Watson in 2014. Tiger Woods finished in last place -- John.",

They need all 12 jurors to find him guilty in order to convict. And so, they have to be able to exclude every single person who is unfairly pro-Trump, right?

Of course, they can go into anything that was the subject of direct examination. But normally, you're also able to prosecute using -- or to cross-examine using impeachment evidence, and that includes questions about reputation for dishonesty. No one has a stronger reputation for dishonesty than the former president. I mean, 30,000 false statements during his presidency, according to the media. All sorts of court cases in which he's been found liable for lying and fraud.

It's -- the majority of your Monday is not going to be under the threat of severe weather. It's really this afternoon and evening, once we start to take advantage of all the dynamics -- the heating from the sun.You can see the timeframe here right at the top portion of your screen. Probably after the sun sets this evening at roughly 7:30-8:00 across portions of Kansas and into Nebraska, South Dakota, and even as far south as the Oklahoma and Texas border. This is the area that we've highlighted for the chance of severe weather. Very large hail, a few tornadoes, and strong, gusty winds. And the Storm Prediction Center has highlighted this area, in particular, as the greatest threat. That is a level three of five. That is an enhanced risk. And you see that hash that we've put over top of that? We've overlayed these two locations, including southern Oklahoma and into central Texas. This is the area where we have the greatest probability of large hail, two inches or greater. That's baseball-size hail falling from the sky. That's a real threat. And again, it's the hail that is the larger threat today even though there is still a tornadic threat possible across the Plains. You can see that here -- about a five percent probability. Not as great as what we anticipated over the weekend, so some good news in this. But the severe weather threat will advance eastward for tomorrow. And then we've got to keep a close eye to the sky across central Iowa. This is an area that has an enhanced risk already set up for tomorrow afternoon. To make matters worse, behind all of this activity is very windy weather that will take advantage of dry conditions on the ground. And that is why we have a critical fire threat across the Texas Panhandle, portions of eastern Texas, and into New Mexico. Remember, the state's largest wildfire ever occurring just within the past couple of months across this area. So we do not like to see this type of setup for critical fire weather, but there it is for the day today as it taps into dry conditions and windy, windy weather.

Look, this was also the first indictment to be handed down to him and I think that kind of set the tone then for further indictments.This one -- while I believe that there is evidence to justify it, it did seem like the prosecutor in this case is maybe stretching the charges a bit. These are misdemeanors that he's elevating to be felonies and the legal theory there is a little shaky for it. And I think that serves to help Trump. And I think the other cases that he's facing and the charges are much more serious, and so I would have liked to see those come first. Who knows if we'll even get trials for those ones before Election Day? And so, this being the first case to go to court, I think does kind of make it -- it helps Trump to his advantage because I think it furthers his narrative of this being politically motivated. And I'm not saying that justice shouldn't be served here. Obviously, if the facts warrant it and they make a strong case, then he should be convicted.

Bush come out and just explain to people what is al Qaeda. Who are these people? What are they about and what are they trying to do? I didn't like where George W.

I don't -- I think we spend so much time talking, as we should, about what's happening in Gaza, what's happening in Israel, the hostages, et cetera.

It's not just about Gaza, it's about Jihadist terror against Western civilization. He's got to explain that -- and when he does it, I think he's going to be able to get more support.

General, just so people know, this was -- and I don't use the word massive very often -- this was an enormous strike -- an attempted strike by Iran. More than 300 projectiles shot at Israel -- 170 drones, 120 ballistic missiles, 30 cruise missiles. This is a huge attack, largely unsuccessful, right? Almost no success at all for Iran. But as you look at the situation now and as the Israeli war cabinet is meeting, what do you think the possible responses could be? GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST, FORMER COMMANDING GENERAL, U.S. ARMY EUROPE AND SEVENTH ARMY (via Webex by Cisco):  You know, to reinforce, John, your comments about this being huge, let me give a comparison real quickly. The first day of the so-called shock and awe campaign in the first day of Operation Iraqi Freedom by the United States, 500 precision weapons were used. In this case, you've got over 300 in a five-hour period. So this was a significant attack. To answer your question of what's going to happen next, that debate going on -- I think we should mention that Benny Gantz is a former chief of the Iraqi Defense Forces, so he has a significant amount of intelligence and information about how to strike. But I think Israel realizes they have improved their strategic messaging position by defending so well against this massive attack that could have been catastrophic. I'm going to throw that in there, too. It could have killed a lot of civilians and damaged a lot of infrastructure within that small area that is Israel. But you're going to see the potential for kinetic strikes in return, but I also think you're going to see more covert measures. Israel has just a brilliant capability in cyber offensive operations and defensive operations. They are going to be able to say to Iran we stopped your strike. We're going to do things to you. You won't know when those things are going to occur, and it's going to affect your country significantly. And by doing that, they're still going to stay in the catbird seat in terms of their messaging and their strategic position.",

All of that is a part of it.And when you have as many countries involved with highly technical capabilities in this area on a defensive positioning, that's why you saw the success that we saw the other night.
