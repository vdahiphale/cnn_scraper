But, this time, it was a U.S. aircraft that came crashing down. And, today, the White House says the wreckage of that unmanned drone may never be recovered. But Russia vows to try and find it for itself. A Russian jet forced down the roughly $15 million Reaper drone on Tuesday over the Black Sea. And, this morning, top Biden administration officials lashed out, calling Russia's actions reckless and unsafe. Moscow disputes the U.S. account, saying the drone shouldn't have been flying near its so-called special military operation. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon for us. Natasha, what are we learning about this incident and also the wreckage?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna, well, the race is on really to find this wreckage.And what we're told is that, apparently, the U.S. does not have any Navy assets in the area that could readily kind of go and pick up that wreckage. And so it will be very difficult for the U.S. to launch some kind of rescue mission for the drone. And it is appearing more and more likely that that drone may not ever be recovered by the U.S. Meantime, Russia is now saying that they intend to try to find the drone as well, with the secretary of Russia's Security Council telling reporters this morning that they do intend to launch a mission to try to find that drone, which, of course, landed in the Black Sea after being harassed by two Russian fighter jets over international waters and international airspace on Tuesday. However, we are told that the U.S. did take steps to erase the software on that drone before -- as it crashed into the Black Sea, kind of before Russia -- so that before Russia could actually get to it, they would not be able to glean any kind of sensitive information out of it, because it is not necessarily the hardware that would be valuable to the Russians. It would be the software on that system that is responsible, of course, for collecting intelligence and other kinds of data that the Russians would likely want to get a hold of. But this is becoming kind of a real tit for tat between the U.S. and Russia just in terms of the statements they are releasing, the U.S., of course, calling the incident very reckless, irresponsible, saying that the pilots were essentially acting in an incompetent manner when they harassed that drone. Meanwhile, the Russian saying that the U.S. was flying in an airspace that Russia created for its so-called special military operation in Ukraine, which, of course, is an explanation that the U.S. has flatly rejected, Brianna.",

And this kind of Reaper was actually shot down by Houthi rebels in Yemen before, so it's not like the technology is out there. And our reporting at \"The Military Times\" and Defense News is that there was nothing in particular in terms of added technology on this particular drone that the Russians would find sensitive. So you default back to the Russians want to send a message to their people and the various populations around the globe that are on Russia's side, so to speak, in this conflict that, look, this is the U.S. harassing us in what we have been calling a U.S.-led NATO proxy war.",

In this case, by making this war about a U.S. conflict and bringing the U.S. into some sort of direct confrontation with Russia, Russia is playing the long game with U.S. public opinion. They're already aware that there's this sort of thin end of the wedge of some Republican opinion on the far circles of the GOP that perhaps the war in Ukraine is something that has nothing to do with U.S. interests. And you can see that in Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' message that you were just referring to, where he said this war is not strategic for the United States and is essentially a waste of money. And that's why stalwarts like Lindsey Graham have attacked back and said, no, this is something that needs to be -- this is about a war of good and evil and a war of democracy vs. authoritarianism, and that's why support for Ukraine needs to continue.",

But the -- you can also see it in some of the Russian messaging. One of Vladimir Putin's former advisers was talking about this drone giving information to Ukraine to kill Russian soldiers.

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, this new drama actually started overseas, in Europe, specifically.All the attention right now is on Credit Suisse. This is Switzerland's number two lender. Now, trouble at Credit Suisse is nothing new. This bank has been in turmoil for years. Last year, they reported massive losses. But, just yesterday, they acknowledged material weaknesses in their financial reporting. And, today, their biggest backer, a Saudi bank, said that they don't have any interest in plowing more money into this bank. And that's on top of ongoing withdrawals of money from customers at Credit Suisse. Let's look at what this stock is doing right now, down 25 percent today. That's a very big drop for one of Europe's biggest banks. And look at where they have gone. Look at where the stock has gone the last 10 years. It is now at record lows. Look at the regional banking sector in the United States. It's kind of mixed today after the big gains yesterday. But the one you want to pay attention to here is First Republic Bank down 22 percent. This comes after both Fitch and S&amp;P just today said that they're cutting the credit ratings of this San Francisco-based lender, worried about customer withdraws. And what's interesting is that the selling has even spread to some of the biggest banks, despite the fact that those banks are actually getting customer money from the smaller banks, J.P. Morgan Chase down 5 percent, 6 percent for Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo down. Clearly, nervousness about the banking system continues.",

Wade last year. Anti-abortion groups are asking the judge to step in and force the FDA to revoke its more-than-two-decade-old approval of mifepristone. CNN's Rosa Flores is in Amarillo following this high-stakes hearing. Rosa, what are you hearing from inside the courtroom?",

      "sentences": "Brianna, the plaintiffs made their arguments based on merit and standing. But the most important part so far from the plaintiffs' arguments is actually a question that the judge asked the plaintiffs.The judge asked them to point to another case in which a judge did exactly what the plaintiffs are asking this particular judge to do. So what are they asking him to do? They're asking him to yank off a shelf a medication. Now, think about that and process that with me for just a second. They're asking a judge, who is not a subject matter expert, who's not a scientist, to overrule the FDA, who are the scientists, who have done all of the research for the approval of this -- of these drugs. Now, this drug has been approved for more than 20 years. So there's been a long history of this drug being used by millions of women in the United States. Now, back to the question that the judge made to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs could not point to another case in which this has happened. That's why this is so unprecedented. Now, about the implications and the impact here, if this judge indeed rules in favor of the plaintiffs, we're talking about millions of women across this country who will be impacted. Now, since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, so many women in this country don't have access to abortions in their own particular states. For those women that are in states where there is a ban on abortion, this is their only option. This is the option that they have. For women who are in states where abortions are not banned, this is an option that they have without having to go into a clinic. So, again, the implications are very vast here. Now, the plaintiffs are also asking the judge for a swift and complete decision. Now, does that mean that the judge could be compelled to rule from the bench? He has the power to do that. Will he do that, we don't know. What's happening on -- what's happening right now in the building that you see behind me, the courtroom where this is happening, is, the U.S. DOJ is now making the arguments on behalf of the FDA. And, Brianna, we're not inside the courtroom. I'm not inside the courtroom. We have a reporter inside the courtroom. But we know that the FDA is expected to make the argument that this drug is safe, that it's been approved for years. It's been used by millions of women. And so we're going to have to see what happens. There are no cell phones allowed inside. And, also, there's no in-and- out access into this courthouse. It's the reason why I'm outside and not inside, so I could be reporting the news to you. But we're going to have to see how this pans out -- Brianna.",

So it's a medication that's been around for a very long time, also very, very safe. But, by itself, it is not as effective. And I think it would really limit a woman's ability to have a termination of pregnancy or an abortion at this point, because, as Rosa said, right now, in states where there is the heartbeat law, this is one of the few ways women have access to termination of pregnancy, with the medications.",

But I think that brings up another point, that the medical termination of pregnancy has a lot less risk for women than the actual procedure that can be done. It's a really good alternative, which is why more women opt for it, because it is -- does have lower risk.",
