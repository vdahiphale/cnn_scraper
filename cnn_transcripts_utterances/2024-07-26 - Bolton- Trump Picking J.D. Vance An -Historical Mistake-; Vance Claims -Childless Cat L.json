As brand-new swing state polling confirms that Trump's lead is shrinking, and the race really couldn't be any closer tonight. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, Donald Trump is seeking to take back the news cycle, following the week, where his new 2024 challenger has really been dominating the headlines. Trump is in a rare position, at least for him, of fighting to reclaim the spotlight, but also to recalibrate his attacks on Vice President Harris. Just one week after he was basking in the attention of the Republican convention, under the impression that the presidential race was really his to win. Trump is speaking at a conservative summit, in Florida, tonight. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She was a bum, three weeks ago. She was a bum. A failed vice president, and a failed administration. So, now we have a new candidate to defeat, the most incompetent, unpopular and far-left vice president in American history. And by the way, there are numerous ways of saying her name. They were explaining to me, you can say Kamala, you can say Kamala. I said, don't worry about it. Doesn't matter what I say. I couldn't care less. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We'll continue to monitor that.Kristen Holmes, if he says any -- makes any news, please keep us updated, on that. While we continue to monitor that event, where Trump is still speaking, in West Palm Beach, Florida. Our inside source that we're starting off with tonight has seen firsthand, how much Donald Trump wants, and needs, to be in the center of every news cycle. Trump's former National Security Adviser, Ambassador John Bolton is here. And Ambassador Bolton, just first off, what you're hearing from Donald Trump, tonight, as he is really trying to land a line of attack on Harris. Obviously, she's only been his challenger for a matter of days now. What do you make of how he's handled that so far? AMB. JOHN BOLTON, FORMER TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Well, I think the rhetoric he's using is classic Trump. It's bitter and very personal, very insulting. I don't think it's so much the policy aspect, although I think that has to be part of it. Look, she's a California liberal. What else do you need to know? But for Trump, it's all about the person. And the vitriol that you see, I think, is for the next 100 days, going to rise to the surface. That, to me, plays in Harris' favor, because I do think that a lot of people, who haven't made up their minds yet, or at least considering who to vote for, are tired of Trump. He hasn't really won an election since 2016. If you look at how his approach has done for the Republican Party, lost control of the House in 2018, lost the election in 2020. No Republican wave in 2022. His approach may work for him. It doesn't work for others. And it may not work for him this time. I think people are really tired of it.",

Even though on stage, I was just listening to him, a few moments ago, he's still claiming he did win the 2020 election, which obviously he didn't.But Ambassador Bolton, just given you worked with him, you saw how he talked about people. One thing that I've heard from Trump-world people is concern that the attacks will go from what Kristen was just talking about, policies, to more of the personal, in the sense of her gender, or her race. And I wonder if you think that is somewhere, that in the next 100 days or so, we could see him go to?",

But inevitably, he moves away from it into the personal attack. That's what it's about for him. And it's about who the dominant personality in the campaign is going to be.I really think Biden prevailed in 2020, because people just wanted quiet. They wanted what they thought was a safe pair of hands. And a large part of Biden's vulnerability, until he withdrew, was that he had moved to the left, and didn't provide a safe pair of hands, and didn't turn the rhetoric down. I don't think Trump's capable of anything else. And they can talk about strategy, in the Trump campaign, all they want. The real Trump will come through. That's Harris' opportunity. Just say things like, unite the country, and tone down the rhetoric. Most people aren't in the Washington beltway. They don't care about politics. They just wish people would solve problems and leave them alone. Donald Trump never leaves you alone.",

He said, \"Stop attacking\" her \"for locking up too many people\" as a prosecutor. He says that benefits her as the law-and-order candidate. And he said that they need to point out the -- or he said -- was pointing out the legit -- logical problem, and saying that she's part of this cover-up of Biden's age, but also that she staged a coup. And I just wonder, given we are hearing some of those simultaneous arguments, from some, in your party, if you also see it that way, that they're kind of trying to have it both ways, in how they're figuring out how to go after her.",

Biden is a side issue now. We should worry about what he may do, in his lame-duck period. But he's not the opponent anymore. And it may make people feel good to attack him. It doesn't advance the Trump campaign's objective. And this is one of the things I think that most disturbs Trump, is that really talking about Joe Biden stealing the 2020 election is very much yesterday.

Vance to be the heir apparent, something I didn't think Trump would do for a long time. But now that he's got his heir apparent, how does that benefit him with the people, who are going to vote for him already? Not at all. How does it benefit him for the people who might consider him? Not very much. He does have the youth factor. But ironically, that underlines Trump's age.

Our Democratic Party stands for childcare tax credit, for raising minimum wage, so women and families can do better. We stand for early childhood education. We stand for so many things that are pro-family. And again, there's a truism. Republicans talk about family values. And Democrats actually value family. So, I think J.D.
