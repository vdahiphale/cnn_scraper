But there are big questions from Trump. These numbers matter a lot to Trump right now after Nikki Haley dropped out of the race. She still picked up notable votes in five state primaries. And this morning her message to him is clear, don't assume these voters are with you. Will he thank her and appeal to her voters later today when he heads to the incredibly blue area of the Bronx. He got trounced there in 2020.CNN's Kristen Holmes is joining me now. So, Kristen, of course the big question is, will Trump utter those words, Nikki Haley, when he's on that stage tonight.",

But I will remind you that they also hoped that he would be gracious when she suspended her campaign, and we saw that he was, well, not really at all.But when I talked to Republicans across the country, they say they really hope that Donald Trump starts to court these Nikki Haley voters. You put up some of those numbers of Republicans voting in primaries after Haley had dropped out in critical battleground states. The most jarring really being in Pennsylvania where she got 16 percent of the vote. Again, in a state the Donald Trump's team believes they need to win. So, whether or not Donald Trump is going to start courting those voters remains to be seen, but he is going to be up in New York today, in the Bronx, trying to court minority voters. Now, this was planned before court wrapped on Tuesday. They had tried to plan a series of different events around this state of New York because he could only travel on Wednesdays and Saturdays and Sundays outside of the state when he didn't have court. However, they are doubling down on this rally. They say that there are thousands of people that they expect to be there. We will, obviously, be there to see whether or not that is true. But Donald Trump has continued to insist that he could win New York, or at least make a play for New York. He even said that last night in a Truth Social post. I will remind you that no Republican has won in the states since 1984.",

But I mean I remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg basically coming out and trashing Donald Trump. She didn't recuse herself on any of the cases that came before her that involved the former president. So, look, I mean, our justices all have their own personal, political beliefs. They are able to do that. That is their right. The question is, how did they rule on the law?

Once you've done something like that, I don't know that you need any more information about the intention of where he's going or where he'll go in a second term. I mean we have a guy who has tried to end American democracy for all time once. He decided that he needed to run again so he could finish the job in January 2025.

I think that's one of the big takeaways back from 2016 and now moving forward that we don't want just our politicians in Washington, D.C., to talk. We want them to actually solve the problems.

They sent us, in the last hour, a fresh, new report about the conditions in Monterey, saying that the stage was impacted by a gust front. They said which is when gusty winds push out in all direction from thunderstorm that this can cause winds to suddenly pick up. And if you see those terrifying images that we're receiving from social media across Mexico, you can see that the wind is very sudden, that the candidates were on the stage singing and chanting campaign slogans when all of a sudden the winds suddenly pick up and cause the sage to collapse. Now, the main question hanging over Mexico this morning, Katie, is, how could these events take place? Because we know that the Mexican meteorological service had issued a stark warning about these possibility with winds forecast to up to 40 miles per hour.
