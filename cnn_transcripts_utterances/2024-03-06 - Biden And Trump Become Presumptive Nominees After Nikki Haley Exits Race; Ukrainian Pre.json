It's the 2020 sequel that, according to many polls, Americans don't want. The first official day of this rematch feels like history repeating. Trump is slamming his latest vanquished opponent, Nikki Haley, then calling President Biden an enemy of the United States.While Biden is making an appeal to disenchanted Republicans and arguing that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy. Let's get the view from Florida and CNN's Kristen Holmes tracking this new phase of the campaign with the Trump campaign. So, Kristen, what is Donald Trump saying about this now becoming official?",

      "sentences": "Well, so let's go back to Nikki Haley's dropout speech because it was during that speech in which she said that she was not going to endorse Donald Trump, but really called on him to unite the party, to bring people in, saying that he needed to earn the votes of these Republicans who were choosing not to support him, but instead endorsing her. Now, he responded halfway through that speech, not even when she had finished, and said this. Nikki Haley got trounced last night in record-setting fashion, despite the fact that Democrats, for reasons unknown, are allowed to vote in Vermont and various other Republican primaries. Much of her money came from radical left Democrats, as did many of her voters, almost 50%, according to the polls. At this point, I hope she stays in the race and fights it out until the end. I'd like to thank my family, friends, and the great Republican Party for helping me to produce, by far, the most successful Super Tuesday in history, and would further like to invite all of the Haley supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our nation. Then he goes on to say Biden is the enemy, he's destroying our country, make America great again.Okay, so, just to break this down, he attacks Nikki Haley, or goes after Nikki Haley, then says all of her supporters are Democrats or funded by radical left Democrats, then invites them to join the fold. I do want to make one thing very clear. Donald Trump, his team has been working for months on a general election strategy, on a strategy to siphon off voters from traditionally Democratic voting blocs. That includes working class voters, black voters. It also includes people who voted for Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley supporters. Obviously, that's a different message than this was sending. Now, we also heard from President Biden, who reached out to those Haley supporters, because, again, in a rematch, both sides expect this to be incredibly close. Both sides have said every vote, and that counts. This is what President Biden had to say. He said, Donald Trump made it clear he doesn't want Nikki Haley supporters. I want to be clear. There's a place for them in my campaign. I know there is a lot we won't agree on, but on the fundamental issues of preserving American democracy, on standing up for the rule of law, on treating each other with decency and dignity and respect, on preserving NATO, and standing up to America's adversaries, I hope and believe we can find common ground. Obviously, those are all things that Donald Trump has said he wants to get rid of, in terms of NATO, but clearly here, two very different messages when it came to Haley supporters.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, there are about two things that are going to happen here with Haley dropping out that are going to alleviate the squeeze. One of them is the fact that there were donors who essentially said that they wanted an alternative to Donald Trump. Likely they're going to back Trump now and give that money. The other part is, as you mentioned, the RNC. And this is really a total Trump takeover of the Republican Party, because what he now gets access to as the presumptive nominee, and they put out a statement declaring him the presumptive nominee, congratulating him today, he gets access to all of their resources, their fundraising tools, their donor lists.[14:05:09] He also gets access to their infrastructure within various states. That's important because it means that he doesn't have to have a huge team in every state. He can rely on the RNC, rely on their funding to go through that process. The other part of this, I do want to note, it's not just about money. It's also about this takeover. Donna McDaniel, the current chair of the RNC, has said she would step down after clashing with Donald Trump when he became the nominee. He has now promoted Michael Watley to be the chairman, someone who had supported his claims about the 2020 election. He also supported his daughter-in-law, Laura Trump, to be the co-chair of the RNC. Also, campaign manager Chris LaCivita, co-campaign manager, is going to serve in a chief operating role in the RNC. So, you're seeing a full merge here of control and alignment between the Republican Party and Donald Trump.",

And with independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema announcing yesterday that she is not going to run, it now becomes a two-way contest with a whole pool of moderate and independent voters up for grab. Carrie Lake really recognizes that. She says she wants to court all voters, not just the MAGA wing.And she also said she wants to appeal to Nikki Haley voters that might be in her home state of Arizona. But at the same time, she also mocked Nikki Haley's birth name on Twitter this morning. And she also, in her interview with me, attacked Nikki Haley for not lining up behind Donald Trump. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARI LAKE, REPUBLICAN U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE: She has continued along, continued along, hundreds of millions of dollars being poured into a vanity project. It's time for people to get behind President Trump. He's opening his arms, saying, come on in, and it's time for the people who haven't been with him to take some steps toward him. We have way too much on the line. And I'm saddened that she didn't come out today and endorse him. I think that's unfortunate. (END VIDEO CLIP) ZANONA: Now, she ran for governor in the last election cycle and lost. But there are some signs that she's trying to do things a little bit differently. She's been here in Washington trying to line up endorsements from Senate Republicans, including from the establishment wing. I'm told that she's meeting with GOP leader Mitch McConnell later this afternoon. And she's also tried to moderate her position on things like abortion. But at the same time, she is still peddling false lies about the 2020 election as well as the 2022 election. So even as she tries to shed her image as a MAGA firebrand, she is still holding on to some of those same positions that voters rejected in 2022.

And the reason why this is important and make no mistake, I think it's actually narrowly more likely that Republicans take the Senate in 2024. And so a race like Arizona is going to be absolutely critical.Similarly, for everyone who's all upset over that projection, I think it's likely that the Democrats win the House based on the chaos that's been happening there. So, every race matters. Every issue matters. And the three top issues right now, inflation, immigration and abortion. The Republicans have a double-digit lead on inflation, immigration. Democrats have a double digit lead on abortion. And it's frankly too close. They're close to a call.",

Even here, however, you still have about 20 percent of the Republicans who are not happy with Donald Trump and may consider an alternative, whether that be Joe Biden or an independent candidate.And you have 30 percent of Democrats who are not happy with Joe Biden and will also be looking for an alternative. I don't know a time in modern American history where the two presidential candidates have tremendous base support but glaring weaknesses. Trump and his indictments. Biden and his age (ph) that you can't escape. That you can't message, that you can't get around. And so, this is going to be a hard fought, vicious, mean campaign for the next eight months.",

Donald Trump is pulled even with them.And if that stays, it means that Arizona will switch sides. Nevada will switch sides. And it tells you that the Latino vote, 20 percent, can be 20 percent of the electorate. To me, that's a deciding vote.
