And you see this all across the country.

Republicans ultimately decided, for the most part, to sidestep issues about this; instead believing that they put all their eggs in the basket over attacking Joe Biden, trying to tie the Democrats to Joe Biden, tying him to crime, inflation, gas prices. Polls showed that abortion did not rank as high as economic issues. They gambled those issues would carry them across the finish line.

So that move caught a lot of Republicans by surprise, when Oz agreed to appear at that rally. But Trump also appearing in Arizona. What Republicans are concerned about, when they look back at that, is they see Donald Trump coming in and essentially changing the narrative, undercutting the case that the Republicans wanted to make about Joe Biden, about the Democratic policies in Washington, not about Donald Trump. Donald Trump inserts himself late in this election cycle and, all of a sudden, it's a contrast election, a contrast between Trump and Biden, between Trump and Democrats.

Now that is something that McCarthy simply does not want to do because that rule -- they changed the rules after John Boehner, the Speaker of the House, resigned his speakership because the speaker didn't want to make it easy to push out a speaker. Those easier rules that made it easy to push out a speaker, those existed when John Boehner was speaker. And because of those rules that is why he stepped down because he was concerned, he was going to be ousted by the Right flank of his conference. So the Right flank of Kevin McCarthy's conference wants similar power over the Speakership and McCarthy is not willing to go there. So those are issues they have to negotiate behind the scenes. We'll get a first taste of how this starts to play out next week, when the House members return to Washington. They'll have internal conference meetings, nominate their candidate for speaker. McCarthy will win that nomination but that doesn't mean he'll get to 218 votes on the House floor in January. That's 218 votes out of the full House. Those are questions he'll have to sort out over the next few months, winning over that Right flank but not doing something that could make him even more vulnerable in the Speakership.",

Here's CNN's Gary Tuchman with our report.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GARY TUCHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The U.S. Senate race here in the state of Nevada is so very close. Let us tell you where the mail-in ballots are that still need to be counted in this state. First of all, in Washoe County, that's northern Nevada, where Reno is located, there's about 11,000 ballots still to be counted. And Douglas County, a small county in Western Nevada, the county seat is Minden; the population is 50,000. It's very Republican. That county hasn't elected a president -- a Democratic president -- since before World War II. They have about 2,000 ballots outstanding. But this is the big prize, this building behind me. This is the Clark County election department. Clark County is where Las Vegas is. About three-quarters of Nevadans live in this county. There's still 23,000 mail-in ballots to count inside this building. And an additional 15,000 ballots are provisional ballots or ballots that need to be cured. What that means is some people don't put their signature on the ballot. As long as they put their signature on the ballot, it then gets counted. So that's a total of 38,000 more ballots. So there's still a lot of counting to do in this race that's really tight -- this is Gary Tuchman, CNN, in Las Vegas. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

She didn't get to do that. She was shot, almost killed -- others were killed -- when she was just doing her job. She was meeting with constituents in her district in Tucson.

She's driven, a devoted wife and mother and that plays well with Florida voters certainly those in the DeSantis camp.She's also started this initiative called Mothers for DeSantis, where she's successfully signed up more than a million parents to \"keep the state of Florida free,\" in her words. And, of course, she's had this very public battle with breast cancer. She's been now a champion for cancer research in the state of Florida. She's helped secure about $100 million in funding for cancer research in the state and she goes around the state talking to patients and certainly is getting the message out about early detection. And that, of course, playing very well with women across the state of Florida. That is a benefit for Casey DeSantis and for the governor -- Randi Kaye, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
