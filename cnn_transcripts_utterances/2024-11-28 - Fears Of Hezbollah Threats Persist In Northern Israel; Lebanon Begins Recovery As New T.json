Officials say the truce appears to be largely holding. Well, since then thousands of people have started returning to their homes in Lebanon's south and U.N. aid trucks are also on the move. Israel is still warning residents it's not safe to return yet, as its military is still deployed in the area and some places remained under evacuation orders.

We've also seen schools, some schools that have been damaged and in addition, healthcare facilities, more than 100 healthcare facilities and 40 hospitals have either been destroyed or have been significantly damaged and put out of operation.

We've seen the destruction of and airstrikes have hit at least 35 main water pumping stations, cutting off water to half a million people, for example. So of course, families cannot return having had their homes and livelihoods, their farms totally destroyed. So for peace and stability to return to Lebanon and for the protection of children in the country, it's absolutely vital that we support Lebanon on this journey to healing and recovery.

The FBI and local law enforcement officials are investigating.Now several top officials were targeted, including Pete Hegseth, Trumps choice for Defense secretary. He said Wednesday night his Tennessee home was the target of a pipe bomb threat. Others include John Ratcliffe, who was tapped to lead the CIA, Elise Stefanik selected for U.N. ambassador, and Lee Zeldin chosen to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Now the FBI has said it takes all potential threats seriously. But one law enforcement official who's familiar with these incidents and investigations told CNN these types of swatting calls are quite common and often target those people who are in the news at any given time. Now President Biden was briefed on these threats. A White House spokesman said the president and the administration condemns all threats of political violence.

There are things, some of them were bomb threats.Some of them were what we call swatting calls which are carefully constructed to make the police come with a SWAT team, thinking that there are armed people present which can be very dangerous, especially since police don't know when they're going that it's a fake call. But it's a pattern of threats that came together, either from one person, one group of people, or maybe some who saw the threat and decided to copy it. But I think the key is to keep the threats in perspective. They have a specific purpose.

A lot of the times these things emanate outside the United States but sometimes they emanate from an IP address that is spoofed to appear to be coming from outside the country.

Senior administration officials have hoped that that Lebanon ceasefire deal would push Hamas back to the negotiating table. Here is how Sullivan characterized it on CNN. JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: Since the beginning of this conflict, Hezbollah linked its fight against Israel to the fight that Hamas was having with Israel from Gaza. And it said, we won't stop until the -- the war in Gaza ends. That link has now been broken, which means Hamas is isolated. Hamas is now under pressure. And all eyes, not just from the U.S. and Israel, but the rest of the world, are going to turn to Hamas. And so, there is now newfound opportunity and possibility to drive forward a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza.",

Now, President Biden has spent the last 14 months trying to secure this hostage release deal, as four Americans are still believed to be held alive by Hamas in Gaza. And in his remarks in the Rose Garden, the president said that he does believe that peace is possible not just in Gaza, but also efforts to potentially normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.",
