Last Thursday, flames were spotted, on another American flight that never took off, from Charlotte, North Carolina. The FAA is investigating both incidents. That's it for us. The news continues.

      "sentences": "Anderson, thank you.Tuckered out. I'm Michael Smerconish, from New York City, tonight. It's been a chaotic day, for the media. Sources say former NBC Universal chief, Jeff Shell, accused of sexual harassment, by a CNBC anchor. Don Lemon and CNN parting ways. Disney laying off more workers. But though, a stunning headline, today, Tucker Carlson is out at Fox News. These stories, these networks, are all very different situations. But in terms of Fox, reports show the ouster could be, for a variety of reasons. Carlson disparaged network leadership, in text messages. He's accused of a hostile and sexist work environment. He continued to downplay January 6, and play up conspiracy theories, about the attack. But while the Network's official statement today explain very little, it's unlikely coincidental that the departure comes so close, to the record-setting $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems. If so, that litigation did something that no boycott ever achieved. It removed from the most popular cable outlet, its most watched talent. That means the civil justice system worked, in a remediated way, just as it has, for other products that posed harm to society. Here though, it wasn't flammable pajamas, or lawn darts or ATVs, but a false portrayal of the 2020 election. The texts, emails, sworn deposition testimony, everything that came into the public domain would be none the wiser, without the litigation. While it's true that only one of the 20 allegedly defamatory comments, in the Dominion suit, came from Carlson's program, he knew the truth, and he remained silent. And that's why he was scheduled to be one of the first witnesses, called by Dominion, at trial. Privately, he said the election theories broadcast on Fox were \"Insane.\" Said the whole thing was \"Infuriating.\" A few days after the election, November 8, 2020, he sent a text, and referenced Sidney Powell's Dominion claims, by saying, quote, \"The software shit is absurd.\" But the next night, on air, he said this.

Donald Trump is the first ex-president, who wants to beat the man, who beat him, since Grover Cleveland took the title back from Benjamin Harrison, in 1892. There is no one alive, in this country who has ever seen an ex-President, trying to get his job back. And, for Republicans, it's not just that he was President. A majority of Republicans believe he was legitimately elected that the election was stolen. One of the things that struck me, Michael, is ex-presidents rarely run for office, because when they lose, they lose. William Howard Taft finished third. Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter, even George H.W. Bush lost substantially. Only Gerald Ford lost close. In Trump's case, Republicans think well, he was -- it was stolen from him.

Because I do think that one thing that Bud Light has seen is that with younger millennials and Gen Z, they don't really buy Bud Light like that.How exactly is it that you attract this audience, as your base begins to age a little bit, and you've got new-of-age drinkers? How do you get them to drink Bud Light? This seems to have been an approach to that. And I wonder if the question becomes part of it being do people that are a bit older at these companies know how to reach the youth, and how exactly to use social media, and just the idea that you see somebody that has a big audience, and you say, \"Hey, I want to go in that direction.\" But my other question on this, which is just really important is what exactly were they going for here? Because typically, when a company makes a move, like this, it's because they're trying to not make the point that we're moving away, from our fratty culture, but specifically they are aligning themselves as being allied with a particular community. That doesn't seem to be what they were willing to do on this one. Because if Kid Rock goes and shoots his stuff up, with an assault rifle? That's what you expect from something like that. And you're happy about it.",

They were suspended by Commissioner Pete Rozelle, for a year. And then, they were allowed back. And ultimately, not right away, but ultimately, both made it to the Hall of Fame. In the minds of baseball fans, this is a simple distinction. No one is nominating Pete Rose for Citizen of the Year. And it was clear, in every clubhouse, because baseball was even more vigilant, about this, than other sports, because of the scarred history, of the Black Sox, in 1919, throwing the World Series, to the Cincinnati Reds. The penalty in baseball, whether you agree with it or not, was lifetime banishment, for betting, on baseball. You didn't have to bet against your own team. Betting on baseball, lifetime banishment. So, Pete Rose did that. And he lied about it. I think most baseball fans say he should have remained banned, from baseball, can't manage any more, can't draw a paycheck, from a team.

Like you, I've not seen it.What do we have? \"Amazing what losing a quarter of a billion dollars because of Carlson's lies will cause.\" Well, but what's interesting is, Richard L., the Fox stock tanked, today, on the news that he had been fired. And remember, Carlson, according to the Dominion suit, and that which came to light, he was complaining about the drop in the stock price, because of those who were abandoning Fox, and going to, what would it have been, Newsmax and OAN at the time. What else came in? Amazing how money drives so much of this. \"Someone will replace Tucker just like he replaced Bill O'Reilly.\" I made that point to Frank Sesno that when Ailes was ousted, when O'Reilly was ousted, lot of folks said, \"Oh my god, the network is really in trouble.\" But hey, we're all kind of replaceable, aren't we? And I'm sure they'll find someone. I mean, The Five gets huge numbers! It's not always Tucker, who's driving the bus. What else came in? I like this part. \"This was a separate action from the settlement, but could be an indication of what is to come. Fox may be moving to a defensive posture rather than a war footing,\" says Brian K. \"This was a separate action from the settlement.\" I don't know about that. I have to believe it's all related. I think I made very clear, in my opening commentary that there are a lot of -- perfect storm came together, against Carlson. But you have to believe that coming so quickly, after a $787.5 million, largest ever, as far as I know, defamation -- defamation settlement, it had to be a factor, in all of this. What else came in? What? What do you mean that's it? Oh, OK. Gang, thank you for joining us. I'm going to be back here, at the same time, and, on SiriusXM, tomorrow morning. \"CNN TONIGHT\" with Alisyn Camerota starts, right now. Hey, Alisyn.",
