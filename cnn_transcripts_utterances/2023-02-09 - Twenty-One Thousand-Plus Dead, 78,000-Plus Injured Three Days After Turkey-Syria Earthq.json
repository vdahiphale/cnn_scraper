      "sentences": "Good evening.We begin with the most immediate humanitarian crisis in the world right now. It has been three days since a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck the region bordering Turkey and Syria. The number of dead continues to rise from hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands. Right now, at least 21,000 people are known to have been killed, another 78,000 injured. Because there's far less access to Northern Syria, the concern is that the casualties there could be far, far worse. We are watching this play out right now from a distance and from a distance it looks one way, but up close is where the horror and their heroism is. These disasters happening one person at a time. In this case, one little girl. We don't know her name. She is about five years old. She was rescued after being trapped for 89 hours, two other girls alive waiting to be freed. Small victories one at a time from a distance, small lifeboats on a sea of despair. From up close, the entire world. From up close, too, the losses come by ones, one child, one family, person by person, block by block, home by home, hour after hour, every moment of every day now since Monday morning. One woman's loss, one friend gone, one classmate missing, a patient to treat, a mouth to feed, a family to shelter again and again. Tonight from up close, some of those stories and we want to warn you, some of what you see is graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) COOPER (voice over): In the darkness they search and sometimes they find them, a family crushed in what was once their home. (UNIDENTIFIED MEN speaking in foreign language.) COOPER (voice over): Headlamps reveal a woman partially visible laying on her side. She has no pulse. A hand frantically waves in the rubble, a man alive. (UNIDENTIFIED MEN speaking in foreign language.) COOPER (voice over): A baby buried next to him, a two-month-old girl is not. A feet away, they move the woman's arm and find a toddler named Hamuda (ph), she was protecting. His eyes closed, no sign of life. They pick away the concrete, but then -- the cry of life. (UNIDENTIFIED MEN speaking in foreign language.) COOPER (voice over): \"God is great,\" one rescuer cries. In another building, another child is pinned beneath collapsed concrete and steel. (UNIDENTIFIED MEN speaking in foreign language.) COOPER (voice over): Rescuers gave him water from the cap of a bottle. Sip by sip, second after second. They keep him alive. Elsewhere, a boy is found. They hold his hand, work until he is finally free. (UNIDENTIFIED MEN speaking in foreign language.) COOPER (voice over): After so much death, so much disappointment, the rescuers rejoice for the boy. (UNIDENTIFIED BOY crying, speaking in foreign language.) COOPER (voice over): In the ambulance, he cries for his family. \"My parents, my parents,\" he says. \"Your family, God-willing will be okay,\" a rescuer tells him. \"You are a hero, my darling.\" (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But this morning, even medical workers rushing to the scene, a bizarre street frankly, which every single apartment block was still upright, but its bottom three floors had collapsed down on themselves, and from one of those collapsed areas, an eight-year-old girl was pulled out. They had hoped she was alive, but by the time she got to the ambulance, the medical worker said it was quite clear, she had lost her life. Her mother, obviously distraught said that she hoped her little one would not be lost, would not be taken away. And so on every street here, there is that rush to try and find some moments of relief or hope, but the despair just mounting along with the numbers of dead and this odd sense of a city having to live out in the open to escape the possibility. Some more of these buildings may collapse upon them, burning the remnants of their own homes. That's what some of this acrid smoke is from, the poor choice of choosing a kitchen cabinet we think behind us over here and that is causing the air to be very difficult for some of the kids we've seen living out in the open. There are hastily erected tent cities in green spaces around here, tents just going up behind me over here, but none of that keeps out the cold that people are suffering from here. And this is just mounting challenges in the days and weeks ahead for a government that has got to deal with the aftermath of the quake, but also the future of the people whose lives had been taken by it -- Anderson.",

Now, after months of negotiating over it, Special Counsel Jack Smith has made it official with a subpoena for Pence's testimony. CNN's Kaitlan Collins broke the story for us, joins us now.

This subpoena I'm told is related to January 6. They want Mike Pence's testimony and any documents about that because he was one of the key people who was speaking one-on-one with Trump a lot of those times leading up to the election, leading up to January 6, and obviously that was when their relationship completely frayed at that time, but they think that he has a lot to offer.

So yes, I expect him to be asked a few questions.But for him politically, to be drug in under subpoena as opposed to going voluntarily, maybe he thinks that works for him politically, I do think he is genuinely concerned about his constitutional role here, which is why he did what he did on the 6th, but the executive privilege stuff does matter to him. And it wouldn't shock me to see them try to fight this out. And he would say, I just think we have to maintain this privilege and the separation of powers issues as much as possible. So even if he loses on it, it wouldn't shock me if they if they tested that out a little bit. COOPER: And Elliot, what would a fight like that look like? I mean, where would that would that go?

Now it gets a little more complicated, where if they were talking about purely political matters or purely personal matters.

Buster, apparently, according to the court clerk on the record, telling me that he was making obscene gestures at a witness while that witness was testifying.
