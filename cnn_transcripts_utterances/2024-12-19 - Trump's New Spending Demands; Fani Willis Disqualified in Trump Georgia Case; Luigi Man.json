And, of course, the consequences our grave. When you look at what could take place, and I've been through government shutdowns before, we have services that will be halted. We have people who would be furloughed.This is the holiday season. We'll have TSA agents who won't be paid. We'll have total chaos again. The economic impacts of a shutdown are devastating, and it hurts people, everyday people. And so, to be able to blow up a bipartisan deal that would keep the government open, that would allow the negotiations to move toward another deadline in March to me is just irresponsible. But it says a lot about Donald Trump, and it says a lot about allowing a non-elected billionaire to run our government.",

Because before one of the reasons why there was this time before the Friday deadline to review this is that House Republicans were demanding time to read the bill. Lawmakers are demanding time to read the bill. But if you don't have another deal cut until perhaps later today or tomorrow, it sounds as though you may blow through the deadline. Is that the case?",

And so, we're doing everything we can do to make sure that the government does not shut down because we know what the impact is on jobs, on the public, on life, on livelihoods, on our economy. And we're doing everything we can do to avoid a shutdown.But let me tell you, we had an agreement. That agreement was there's an agreement between Republicans and Democrats. The speaker agreed to it. Our leader, Hakeem Jeffries, agreed to it. It was an agreement that Democrats and Republicans said would keep the government open. And so, for a billionaire, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump, some have called him the unelected president, and Donald Trump the vice president. You know, I've seen messages such as that on social media. I mean, this is wrong, first of all, but the consequences and the impact on people is really unfortunate, and it's morally corrupt, if you ask me, in terms of what they're doing. And so, we have to go back and make sure that this bipartisan deal holds.",

It went away and now it's back.The suspect in the killing of Brian Thompson appears to be in the process of being loaded onto this small plane that is presumably going to fly to New York State where he will then be transported to a Manhattan courthouse for the process -- the legal process to get going there. And, Elie, you're with me now. Elie. I mean, this is all part of standard operating procedure.

As we see, he's boarding that plane and he should be arriving here, I'm not an aeronautical expert, but very shortly in the State of New York.

And then at some point, probably very soon, could be -- theoretically could be later today, I don't think that's particularly likely, but it's possible, maybe tomorrow, maybe Monday, he will make his first in court appearance in New York State Court. He'll be advised of the charges against him, including the first-degree murder charge, the second-degree murder charge, other weapons charges.He will enter a plea. Certainly, at this point, he will plead not guilty. And then the parties will set scheduling for discovery, which is the production of evidence by the prosecution to the defense. They may set a trial date. Sometimes you do set a trial date right away, sometimes you don't. But that's what's going to happen in the next several days.",

But the workers that are on strike and the Teamsters, which represent these workers, are hoping that it makes an impact. You have thousands of workers on strike this morning in four states across seven locations. And the Teamsters are saying, this morning's strike is because Amazon has said failed to negotiate with them over better benefits, better wages. And this strike is really symbolic for two reasons. One, it's the first time that there's been a strike at Amazon, but also, these workers are not recognized by Amazon as union workers, nor are they recognized by the National Labor Relations Board as unionized members. But it's very personal for these workers. I want you to listen to one of them this morning in Illinois.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ASH'SHURA BROOKS, AMAZON DRIVER:  One thing that I would like to say is that there is a narrative being pushed out by Amazon that we are the monsters and we are the problem and we are not. How are we the problem when we have Amazon drivers in Fort Lauderdale that are delivering packages in a flood? How are we the problem when we have Amazon workers in California who were forced to work during a heat wave? We are not the problem because we're asking for what is owed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

More than 13 hours later, the president-elect joined him, warning any Republican who supported the deal would be primaried.Let's discuss with CNN Chief Media Analyst Brian Stelter.

He really is the best buddy and chief, and that's why this deserves a lot of scrutiny.So, much of what Musk was posting on X yesterday about this spending bill was either misleading or outright false. He was referring to this bill being criminal. It's literally a legal piece of paper that he's calling criminal.

Lord knows when you have newly elected lawmakers come to Washington, they come with new and fresh and innovative ideas. That is a part of what makes government better. But Musk, this unelected figure who has this enormous amount of power, it sometimes seems as if he's just starting to learn how the government functions. And as a result, some of his X posts are completely false.And by the way, it's not just me saying it. Representative Dan Crenshaw, a Republican lawmaker, Tweeted to Musk last night and said, I love you, Elon, but you need to take five seconds to check your sources before highlighting bottom feeders looking for clicks. You know, Musk likes to post anonymous accounts that are spreading misinformation. And let's recognize, a lot of people have benefited from Musk. You know, the Tesla stock has been on a tear lately. Lots of CEOs going to Mar-a-Lago. They're probably jealous of Musk right now, both because of his relationship to Trump and because of the performance of Tesla and Musk's other companies. So, there's a lot Musk about the Trumps can bring to government, but his behavior on X and his influence over the spending bill, it also shows how misinformation is at work here, Jim.",
