New this morning, the U.S. is warning that it will veto any resolution calling for humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza if it comes up for a vote at the U.N.

And U.N. ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement that the U.S. is already working on a deal between Israel and Hamas that would bring a release of hostages and a pause in fighting for at least six weeks. She went on to say that the proposed resolution would not achieve the same outcomes so the U.S. will not support it. Joining us now is CNN's political and national security analyst, David Sanger. David, hello to you. Do you think voters in the U.S., the president's party, the wing of the party that wants a ceasefire is paying close enough attention to the U.N. that that will have any political cost for him?",

They're not calling it a ceasefire. They're calling it a pause because if it was a ceasefire, it would mean essentially that Israel was giving up on its objective of routing out all of Hamas.Fact remains that Israel set itself a pretty maximalist objective there. And by the assessment of most of the people I have spoken to intelligence officials, military officials here in Munich they really aren't very close at this point to achieving that objective. And of course, they don't have the top leadership of Hamas that plan the October 7 terror attack.",

And in fact, the talk here in Munich has been had to close the many loopholes that the Russians have quite successfully exploited in their effort to build up their own arm supply again.You know, I remember I was at that press conference when the president said that. It was right after he had met -- if I remember it correctly, it was right after he had -- had met Putin for the first and probably only time of his presidency. And I don't think the president at that time imagined the scale and scope of the kind of confrontation he would find himself in with Russia at this stage. And, you know, you've mentioned two things so far as the loss of territory in Ukraine, the Navalny death. But perhaps the biggest one that was sort of dominating everybody's attention here is this American intelligence report that they believe the Russians may be prepared to put a nuclear weapon into space, in orbit. And that wouldn't necessarily be that detonated. I don't think the Russians would do that, but it's to remind everybody that if you press those sanctions too hard, if you press the Navalny or Ukraine issues too hard, they have the capability to disrupt the entire global communication system by putting a nuclear weapon essentially in low- earth orbit with other satellites.",

And he said, look, if Vladimir Putin ever set off a nuclear weapon in space it wouldn't just take out American satellites. It would take out Chinese satellites. It would take out Indian satellites. It would also take out, of course, probably Russian satellites, but the Russians have less to lose than China and India do here.So, the theory is that they would go to Putin who listens to them in a way presumably that he wouldn't listen to the United States and say, you know, this is just wildly too reckless. This worked, or at least the administration thinks it worked, in October 2022 when you'll remember, we were concerned that Russia may be getting ready to deploy and detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine.

Not just a rainfall which will make the roads very slick, but also some gusty winds. And in the mountains, I know a lot of people are planning on going skiing into the Sierra Nevada, we're going to see between two and five feet of snowfall in some of those regions. While this weather system moves on shore, this atmospheric river carries deep amounts of moisture. That moisture makes its way on shore. And as a result, that's why we're seeing such a several rounds of wet weather. This goes from all the way from later on this afternoon into Tuesday, possibly lingering into Wednesday. Yesterday's computer model suggested it had slowed down a little bit and that's why we're seeing such tremendous expectation for between two and five inches of rainfall in San Francisco, Los Angeles, but in particular for Santa Barbara. Computer models have been saying you could see a couple of inches of rainfall here as well. Already, Sycamore and Mission areas, they're saying that evacuations already expected for that area.
