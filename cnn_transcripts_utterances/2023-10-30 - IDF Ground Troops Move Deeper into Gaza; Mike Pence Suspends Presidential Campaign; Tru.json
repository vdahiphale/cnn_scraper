Withless than three months to go as Nikki Haley comes from behind in the race for second place. Will it matter? All as Donald Trump's Former Vice President, gives up his bid to keep Trump from winning back the White House with Mike Pence is fall says about election lies and power in the Republican Party. Plus the alarming rise in anti-Semitism on college campuses what the Biden Administration is doing to combat hate. Good day, I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 am here in Washington, Monday, October 30. There are 77 days until the Iowa caucuses, 371 days until Election Day. This is today's STATE OF THE RACE. What's going on in U.S. politics but first we're going to start in Israel and Gaza where Israel's ground assault intensifies as the humanitarian situation in Gaza turns more desperate. Israeli troops say they advanced deeper into Gaza overnight. Israel's military says they killed 4 senior Hamas operatives and dozens of Hamas fighters. A new video shows an Israeli tank apparently opening fire on a passenger vehicle. The footage was taken by a freelance Palestinian journalist. The IDF tells CNN Hamas uses civilian equipment inside Gaza. It's not clear who was driving the car or their condition. Meanwhile, tensions are rising with Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in the north on 60 minutes. Vice President Kamala Harris was asked whether the U.S. could be drawn into the fighting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMAL HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: We have absolutely no intention or do we have any plans to send combat troops into Israel or Gaza period? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thank you all very much for being here. And, Steven, let me start with you. Because, you know, there are obviously a couple pieces to what's going on. You have, you know, the kinetic ground action, but also over the weekend, it seems like we heard from the administration from Jake Sullivan, about very real fears of this escalating beyond where it is. What is it's obviously something we've been talking about since the conflict began? But the tenor seems to be a little more intense in recent days. What do you attribute that to?",

But they are also now trying to shift their rhetoric a bit from what we saw at the very beginning, when the attack first occurred on Israel by Hamas. And the President, whether it's in phone calls and readouts of those phone calls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, or Jake Sullivan on CNN saying that we are trying to make clear to Israel, that humanitarian aid needs to get to Gaza as quickly as possible that can't be stopped. Also, there really big push to make sure that communications were brought back online after we saw them go offline in the White House, you know, pushing Israel aggressively saying that can't happen again. So this is we've seen the President with his phone calls, and you know, in his private conversations with Israel and other officials to try to make sure that the civilian casualties are minimized.

We recently saw a video from a Palestinian freelance journalist inside of Gaza, showing Israeli tanks in Southern Gaza City, which is further south than where they initially entered in this ground incursion in the northern and Northeastern part of Gaza, which was right behind me here, that City of Beit Hanoun was one of the first targets that appears of this expanded Israeli grounds operation. But we're now seeing Israeli forces really stretching further into the Northern half of the Gaza Strip. Now, as all of this has been happening, the Israeli forces saying that they have targeted over 6 carried out strikes on over 600 targets inside of Gaza that includes anti-tank missile posts, command centers that Hamas uses. But also that underground infrastructure, dozens of miles of tunnels, that stretch underneath the Gaza Strip, which Hamas fighters use, to evade Israeli forces could also use them to ambush Israeli forces as they enter these towns and cities inside the Gaza Strip. And what's also clear is that even though we haven't seen that kind of overwhelming force of hundreds of thousands of Israeli troops invading the Gaza Strip. We are going to see a steady buildup of forces inside of Gaza. As we enter, as I said, this fourth day of expanded operations, Israel's defense forces spokesman saying that Israel is going to continue to add troops inside of Gaza. And we're also seeing evidence that fighting is continuing to expand not only the aerial bombardment. But also we've heard outgoing artillery fire, tank fire, and we're also hearing a lot of machine gunfire indicating ground forces is engaging Hamas militants on the ground.",

There are some things, some technologies that the U.S. has, that the Israelis may not have, where they may have a variant of it. So it's not exactly the same. They also haven't really worked together in real world hostage rescue operations on a consistent basis. So it would be one of those things where they wouldn't have that interoperability that you would need in an operation like that at least that would be a hindrance.

You can see the numbers Trump now favored by 43 percent of likely caucus goers. That's more than double the support of his nearest rivals, rock Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. They are both up at 16 percent. Haley is really the headline here she is up 10 points since the last poll in August.

Kristen, what do you make of this?KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think you mentioned the Haley thing that is a huge part of this. The other part of this is just how sticky the support for Donald Trump really is. And that's when you look at the part of the poll that shows the caucus goers that support Trump, how many of them have already made up their mind? And that is 63 percent that is a huge amount of people within that 43 that has made up their mind. Now if you go to DeSantis, it's down to 30 percent. Haley 26 percent. So what you're looking at right now is that even at the low number of 16 percent, only 30 percent say their mind has made up for DeSantis. Or on the other number the 26 say their mind is made up for Haley, which leaves a lot of flexibility, 63 percent not a lot of flexibility there. Now I do think one interesting thing to note is over the weekend, I was at RJC when Pence dropped out and I asked almost every event goer that I talked to who they were supporting. And almost every single person said Nikki Haley, or Donald Trump. Now the reason this is interesting to me is because there was no mention of Ron DeSantis. Now this is a very specific crowd. It is a crowd that Trump can appeal to because of his record in the Middle East while he was in office, as well as Haley can appeal to because of her foreign policy chops. But again, it was very interesting that just months ago, DeSantis was right up there. Number two with someone they were considering over Donald Trump, and that was just not the case over the weekend.",

The new Speaker of the House Mike Johnson may not havebeen particularly well known before last week, but he played a leading role in the effort to block certification of the 2020 election results. You can see Johnson in this video is from January 6, 2021. He's speaking on the House floor urging congress to vote against certifying the electors from some states. And in fact, Johnson was behind a number of legal efforts that had tried to cast out on President Joe Biden's win. And a new piece out today on cnn.com, our Stephen Collinson writes, \"Democrats are already trying to make Johnson's record on election credibility into a liability as the 2024 campaign heats up, with Republicans seeking to cling to their House majority\". And Stephen Collinson joins us now, along with Doug Heye and Karen Finney, who are still with us. Stephen, as you know, I'm an avid reader and a big fan of your sort of big picture columns here. And you also look at this in the context of the presidential election, as well as the race for the House. And you can see it in Mike Pence dropping out. I mean, I think we all remember what it looked like when Vice President Pence was standing next to President Trump through all those events through all the Trump Administration kind of looking up at him like this, right?

And looking back, I think we have to question why that Pence thought given his involvement in refusing to certify, in refusing to block the certification of Joe Biden's presidential election, when he thought he had a viable path to the Republican nomination. My experience of talking to Republican voters is that even those who want someone other than Trump, or looking at other candidates, there's no appetite to re-litigate what happened on January the sixth to question Trump's necessarily election fraud allegations. And I think you've seen that in the way that Haley for example and Ron DeSantis have, have dodged around this question. They've criticized Trump saying it's time to move on to get rid of the drama. But they've not gone after him on the election issue. Maybe that's political cowardice, but there's no, there's no path and Republican Party for someone that does that.",

But it's equally terrifying for a student from Cornell University to find on the general message board these posts to \"Slit the throat of Jews\". And you know it's terrifying at the Cooper Union in New York City last week. The security pushed Jewish students into a room and barricaded it because there was such a mob of anti-Israel protesters. And when the mob identify these Jewish kids were in this room, they bang down the windows and chanted globalize the Intifada for anyone who doesn't remember what that was. The Intifada was a series of terror attacks, bus bombings, disco bombings, where civilians were slaughtered in Israel in the early 2000s. So globalizing Intifada from the river to the sea, this is anti-Semitism. This is threatening Jews worldwide. And keep in mind those two weeks ago, the Head of Hamas announced the, \"Global day of jihad\"; where Jewish parents get their children home from school synagogues close, some Jewish nonprofits close their offices. So the threats are real. And all of this is happening against the backdrop of the highest number of anti-Semitic incidents. ADL has ever tracked in America. So the intensification and the expansion is terrifying to Jewish people. And it's not just a Jewish problem, let me just say that very clearly, Jews may be targeted. But this is an attack on our democracy, threatening people because of how they worship or where they pray is on American.

When you say things like the great replacement theory, or you demonize George Soros, when you say things like anti-Zionism is OK, from the river to the sea.
