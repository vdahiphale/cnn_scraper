CHRISSY HOULAHAN (D), PENNSYLVANIA: So what I would say is about 20 percent of our military force, importantly, are all volunteer military force right now are women, and largely in reproductive age, you know, range. We also should account for the fact that most people in the military also have a family. So they have wives and children as well. And so reproductive care and choices about abortion are not theirs to make in states and places that they don't choose to be stationed in. And so this is something where, you know, I grew up, as I mentioned, in a military family, you serve at the will of the president, you serve and you take the orders to wherever you're going at the -- for the needs of the military. You don't get to pick where you are. And, unfortunately, in many of the places where our men and women are right now, they don't have access to reproductive freedom and abortion services. And that, I think is something where if you're trusting a person to wear a uniform and to serve and protect and defend you, then you should trust them to make their own reproductive choices.",

If you in a lab, put atrazine in a tank full of frogs, it will chemically castrate forcibly, feminize every frog in there. We're seeing these anomalies, which are no longer anomalies, but in sexual development in boys and girls, but particularly girls getting, you know, nowadays commonplace for nine and 10 year olds to get their periods.

If you look at what his campaign raised, this is just the second quarter, which ended June 30th, $6.1 million. Super PAC $19.3 million. And Leigh Ann, that is on top of a pig -- chunk of change that he had cash on hand. Well, he has cash on hand, total $21 million. And the reason is because he had a lot of money that he transferred over from his Senate campaign. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes, he's really spent a lot of time building up this donor network. He had a Senate campaign in conservative South Carolina where he had no real challenger and he continued to raise more than $20 million for that campaign that he didn't necessarily need to win a Senate race. That was in preparation for a presidential campaign. He is serious about this. Every single, you know -- in the hallways on Capitol Hill, he used to be very chatty for the past year. He has no longer talked to reporters in the hall. He has become very disciplined and he offers something unique in the Republican Party that people are perhaps gravitating toward.",

His delivery is terrific\". And as we talk about that, I also want to put on the screen so far the people who have met the donor threshold for the debate. Tim Scott is one of them.

How are we're going to do this? Trump is maybe coming back. We need -- so much is on the line here. And, it's even fed this conspiracy thinking and some people that maybe his heart's not really in it. That's what's going on. He's going to drop out.
