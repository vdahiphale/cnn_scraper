What is the most important thing that you learned, that you want to amplify for Americans who are in the path of this dangerous storm right now? KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED &amp; DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE (via telephone): The briefing was very helpful on a number of fronts. But most importantly, in getting the word out to folks in Florida and to take -- to please heed the advice and direction of your local officials because this storm is unlike anything we have seen before. And that's the point of emphasis. This is unlike anything we have seen before. We got a lot of tough, strong people in Florida who have been through a lot of hurricanes, tornadoes, but this is not like anything they've dealt with before. So, if they have been told to evacuate, they must evacuate. We expect that this is going to be catastrophic and deadly. And I would emphasize that, I would also emphasize the information that we received that even if the designation of the categories shifts from a five to four, that's not actually a downgrade in terms of the danger and the dangerous potential of it. And so, let's not have people rely to their detriment on, oh, this sounds like it's going to be less serious than we thought. They made very clear, Category 5, Category 4 are almost equivalent in terms of the danger and the damage that they will create. So, I would -- I would urge people to really take that information as well as to note, there are dedicated folks on the ground from FEMA, from the federal state and local agencies that are there to help you, to help you in terms of advice now, to help you get out, and to help with recovery and rebuilding after this storm and this hurricane passes.",

With the full authority to spend against the President's fiscal year '25 budget, I've been able to start paying the recovery projects that we put on hold.

Some people still stay at home, and that's really where the danger is, and that's what officials are warning about. But I will say this that local Florida officials have said in the last 24 hours, they are pleased with the numbers of people who have evacuated. They say a lot of people have heeded these evacuations because Hurricane Helene that came through a couple of weeks ago was kind of a wake-up call for a lot of people. Again, that's going to be a factor, although here too, here in Tampa and elsewhere, those remnants from Hurricane Helene, that --those huge piles of debris here and in other places still haven't been picked up yet.

So, as for the resources, that first part of the question, we know that the Biden administration has been stationing 300 ambulances, members of urban search and rescue teams, coast guard rescue teams, the Army Corps of Engineers to try to conduct some other rescue operations as well as to deal with impacted infrastructure in the immediate term. But they're all positioned in the northern part of the state with the expectation that once Hurricane Milton exits the eastern part of Florida, then those resources would travel down to the hardest hit areas to get to work then. That will only happen I'm told from officials once the storm exits the eastern part of the state. But then, of course, there is the ongoing response to Hurricane Helene and the disaster programs that have been deployed in the last two weeks since Helene began ravaging the eastern seaboard of the United States as well of some territory farther inland that rarely if ever sees storm action like this. And of course, they've come under fire from Republicans, saying that they didn't spring into action quick enough. And also suggesting -- which the administration has been quick to come out and say that it's irresponsible, it's dangerous, it's exploitative of victims of these storms, as some of these claims that have been unfounded, that for instance, the government could reclaim your home if you participate in a relief program that provides you money on behalf of the federal government to help rebuild. And earlier today, we heard the Homeland Security Secretary say that, that type of rhetoric is already impacting the number of individuals who have begun applying for some of these types of aid, even though it's still early days. So, they're seeing a material impact in terms of people not taking these programs for what they are because of what they believe to be true from what is being discussed in the political sphere. So, certainly, the administration has been going full court press to tamp down on that with -- we'll see with what effect.",

The Israeli military ordered these people to leave Northern Gaza and move south, but the hail of bullets they faced now a testament to why so many are choosing not to leave, or simply cannot. Nine-year-old Dana is among those wounded in the attack. Her pink shirt smeared red with her own blood after she was shot in the neck. At the hospital, her mother says an Israeli drone opened fire as they were fleeing south. The quadcopter started shooting intensively, she says. Everyone was running. There were so many bullets. Even my children's backpacks were full of bullets. The Israeli military declined to comment. But the attack came as it ordered nearly all of Northern Gaza to evacuate, even as it says its renewed ground offensive is focused on just one city, Jabalya. But many are trapped like 15-year-old Zamzam (ph). For anyone who hears my voice, help us, try to get us out, she pleads. She says her mother was killed by Israeli forces. I watched her take her last breaths, and I couldn't do anything, she cries. Calls for help are flooding into Gaza's ambulance service. But this medic explains his team will be shot at if he tries to mount a rescue. The tanks are there. They will fire at the cars. Just get to the street and I will reach you quickly, he promises. Inside Kamal Adwan Hospital, a dire situation risks getting worse. As 17 people wounded in an Israeli strike pour into the hospital's emergency room, the hospital's director says he's been given 24 hours to empty the hospital. The Israeli army is now demanding that we evacuate these patients and move them elsewhere. This will endanger their lives, and it is a catastrophe for these children. Human rights groups now warning that the military sweeping evacuation orders risk forcing more than 400,000 people out of Northern Gaza and into a humanitarian zone that is already overcrowded and under resourced. Where do we go, this woman asks. In Southern Gaza there are assassinations, and in Western Gaza they are firing shells at people. Where do we go? Gaza City, others say they will not leave. I will die and not go to the south. I have 20 family members. I have children. Where do they want me to go? He says he would rather die than be displaced for a sixth time. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So, we move the containers inland. We move our cranes away from the water. We secure the warehouses to make them as watertight as possible. We evacuate personnel that's not essential.

And so, we know. I'm literally, you know, in the middle of Manatee County, the port is about a few miles from where I am now. And so, we know what's coming and we're preparing for it. And so, we're hoping for the best and we've planned for the worst. But I think that everybody's safe, all my staff is safe. Florida ports are very accustomed to this. This is not our first hurricane.

Just give us, first of all, your thoughts and your fears as we watch the speed with which this hurricane is intensifying. PORTER FOX, AUTHOR, \"CATEGORY FIVE: SUPERSTORMS AND THE WARMING OCEANS THAT FEED THEM\": Thanks This is a monster hurricane. Absolutely horrific. And I really feel for everyone on the ground there. What it is not is a surprise. We have been kind of assembling the ingredients for these massive storms for decades now, and the science has been proven that these storms will continue to increase. The more heat we kind of trap on the planet and in the ocean. So, they're going to keep growing. We kind of act surprised when we see them every time and yet, the writing has been on the wall for some time now.",

Fossil fuel pollution has made them a fixture of life in the United States, and they're going to get worse. I mean, from a science and a data led point of view here, Porter, how -- just speak to the ingredients that make a hurricane.

I found, lo and behold, that there is more energy in the system. We have put that energy in the system by adding heat to the planet. 90 percent of that heat that we've created is absorbed into the ocean, and heat in the ocean is just gasoline to these storms. It's what they survive on. And the more that we infuse into the oceans, the more storms like this we're going to see.",

The spike in extreme weather and in these very powerful hurricanes could not be more obvious. It has become the most expensive and deadly natural disaster in the United States. In the last 50 years alone, the U.S. has spent over a trillion dollars on these storms and lost over 7,000 people, 7,000 dead. And we've forgotten this. We've already forgotten Katrina.

And the people in North Carolina, the people in Florida, the people who have really been right in the crosshairs of these storms are the ones who are paying the price. And six months from now, I would say six days from now, you're going to have a hard time tracking exactly what is happening in this hurricane country. We just kind of move on and forget about it.
