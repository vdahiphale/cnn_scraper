Hundreds of workersin the country have long collected waste to sell on the informal market. But now informal workers like Martine San say the process is being formalized through industrialized recycling circuits, where she`s guaranteed around 16 cents per kilogram. MARTINE SAN, PLASTIC WASTE COLLECTOR (through translator): We used to collect waste without knowing who we could sell it to. There were no real outlets, but since we`ve started with this structure, things are better. We are always paid within the week for what we bring back. Since we have this structure, I have enough money to pay for my children`s school and to feed my family. Sometime I even manage to save a little.",

In the Ivory Coast, the production import and marketing of plastic bags has been banned since 2013, though, the application of the law has been hard to enforce. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The state attorney`s general say that Meta is contributing to an adolescent mental health crisis, arguing that the company designed Facebook and Instagram to be addictive. They say these platforms give the, \"false promise that meaningful social connection lies in the next story, image, or video and that ignoring the next piece of social content could lead to social isolation.\" Now, Meta issued a statement saying it has over 30 tools to support teens and their families, and that they`re willing to work with agencies to improve the user experience. But Meta, along with other social media companies like Snapchat and TikTok are infer more legal battles as they face dozens of similar lawsuits from states like Florida and hundreds more from private individuals. That`s the what, we`ll let you decide what to think. Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10 is emblematic of teamwork makes the dream work. Exhibit A, these are starlings swarming, each individual bird sinking its movements with the others, creating a mesmerizing display of poetry in motion ornithologist, scientists who study birds believe the patterns they create help the birds confuse and allude predators. Well, these patterns inspired the drone operating artists in our next story to light up the nighttime sky above central park this past weekend. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RALPH NAUTA, DRIFT CO-FOUNDER: We started our studio in 2007. We were studying bird behavior at the time. Immediately, we thought, how cool would it be if we would take that movement of birds, but have it tangible in the sky. And that merged into what you see behind us. So behind us, you see a thousand drones in their docking stations. Every box has like six drones. It looks kind of like your basic drone, but it`s specifically developed for this application. LONNEKE GORDIJN, DRIFT CO-FOUNDER: Today, we`re flying a thousand drones. It`s the biggest performance that we have done so far. And we were so happy to secure the first permit ever in Central Park to fly drones. This is one system, it`s thousand drones that`s that all are connected. And -- and with one press on the bottom, they come in the air. Really our goal to bring people with lots of different backgrounds and different moments in their life together in this moment. And that everyone relaxes and gets tuned into the same frequency. The art piece is called Franchise Freedom. It`s for us to understand that in society, we have to make sacrifices to function together as a social structure. If you look at birds swarms, you know, in our mind, it`s this most free flying beautiful organic shape, but in reality, it`s really like based on very specific rules. For me, that is what this swarm represents. It`s this collective body of individuals functioning as a group to be the most sufficient, beautiful outcome of multiple cultures and different people coming together to be the best version of itself.
