Mission one is stop the killing. Find the shooter. Eliminate the threat. But mission two, and this is the complicated part, is to stop the dying.So, we are very used to these situations where they may have the suspect barricaded or they're searching the building for the gunman and they have it all cordoned off, but medical people can't get in because it is still the hot zone. They responded, determined that the gunman had fled on foot. They sent the units out to hunt for the gunman and then they immediately shifted into what they call RTF, rescue task force, and that's taking armed police and medical personnel into the building, finding wounded, finding injured, finding people in need of critical care, and getting them out immediately. There was a unified command set up at the president's house where all of the commanders were. There were staging areas for the ambulances that had more ambulances than they would need, and it was very organized and very quick. And it was clear that the Michigan State University Police, the state police, the East Lansing Police and the Lansing P.D. had all practiced this before.",

And those seemed to be going in different directions. First, a defense officials tells us that a significant portion of the object off the coast of South Carolina has been recovered from about 50 feet of water, including much of the electronics and the structure. So, that recovery effort is going well, although it is hampered by some of the difficult seas there and some of the sea conditions. In the other case, a senior administration official tells CNN this morning it may not be possible to recover the objects down on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and that's challenging because that was what the administration pointed to as the moment we'll learn more about these objects that may not be possible to get a definitive answer without recovery.",
