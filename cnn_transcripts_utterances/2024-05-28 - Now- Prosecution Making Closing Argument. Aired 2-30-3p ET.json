And they -- the prosecutor talks about this situation where they are very criticized for not having fronted it more fulsomely in front of their direct. And he says that, look, that we -- he should have had, in that dealing, we agree. It's true he was never charged with that. He's also the one, talking about Cohen, who brought it to everyone's attention. But he goes on to talk about how it's -- none of this matters because it's not a defense to false business charges, too, if you say one of the conspirators is also guilty of dealings from another. So again, this is the benefit of when you're the person to be able to make the final and have the final say. This was not fronted for, what, those two hours or more in the actual defense's case? They didn't bring up at all the fact that Michael Cohen had been stealing in some capacity. And the fact that he was the one to now bring it up in the actual memory, perhaps, of the jurors is now going to be important. This redirects the jury's attention to why we're here, falsified business records. Not why the people who we're involved are problematic.",

He said, well, look at all the other evidence, look at all the other documents. Two, he's biased. And what the D.A. has said is, of course he's biased. He served time, in part, for this. Anyone in that position would feel the same. And then, finally, the theft, which is a big deal. I'm actually not buying the theft argument here. He's saying, I suspect you will continue to do that regardless of the outcome of this trial. I mean, the argument about, well, he came forward with it. That doesn't really answer the question of, first of all, why wasn't he charged, with the D.A., the guy standing in front of the jury? His office was the one that made the decision not to charge Michael Cohen with this. They knew about it within the statute of limitations, gave Michael Cohen a pass. I'm not so moved by the, well, he came forward with it. Also, the relevance of the theft isn't just Michael Cohen's a bad guy. The relevance of a theft is it shows Trump didn't know what was going on with this transaction, if he's getting stolen from in the course of this very transaction. But he's dealing with the three primary weaknesses of Michael Cohen, putting up right up front and giving the jury a path to say, OK, he has these weaknesses, but we can still use --",

That's what you've heard the defense use. So now what they're doing is trying to say, no. And then one of the things that we didn't -- didn't come up there, but I do want to re- read, is when the prosecution was up and they said Cohen did Trump's bidding for years and when it went bad, the defendant cut him loose, dropped him like a hot potato, and tweeted to the world that Mr. Cohen was a scumbag. So clearly trying to show a moment where, all of a sudden, Cohen was out there alone, and that's why he turned on Donald Trump because he essentially had two. Now, you started to see this back-and-forth here as Steinglass continued going through, really, again, as you said, trying to clean up some of this Cohen testimony.

He's also a partner at Mercury Public Affairs.Bryan, actually as we're coming on here, I'm seeing from our reporters, Steinglass, the prosecutor, is saying that the defense has tried to claim that that call was the big lie. That's a very pointed use of language from Steinglass on the prosecution there, basically saying the call happened and the defense is trying to pretend like it didn't. What do you make of what you heard from the defense earlier this morning and the rebuttal that we're just getting now from the prosecution? BRYAN LANZA, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN: First of all, Abby, thank you for having me. Listen, I think the challenge that the prosecution has and the reason the defense can say that that call, you know, maybe wasn't a Trump phone call, it was probably a Keith Schiller phone call, is because it just goes to the heart of the case. It's not a documents case that puts the felony in Trump's -- in Trump's orbit. It's -- it's the conversation of he, Cohen, talking about falsifying the records before the election. And that requires the jury to believe Michael Cohen. It requires them to feel that this guy's not a scumbag, a slimeball, a thief, a crook and all these things. And all this we've seen in the last two things is it just gets reinforced that he is, in fact, a thief. We now know he's a crook. Now I have a question. Did he keep the money? Like we're talking about whether he got prosecuted or not. But did Michael Cohen actually have to return the money? Like if he didn't have to return the money, that to me feels like the bigger scandal. But, yes, I mean, you know, if you -- if you're looking at what the prosecution has to do, they have to convince the jury that Michael's a credible person.

It doesn't go to whether the paperwork was filed with respect to a transfer of funds. It goes to whether Michael Cohen has the credibility, that the jury feels that he has the credibility to make the statement that the president was involved in this conspiracy to commit this crime. And they can say all these other things, but that's how you narrow it down. And it's just hard to see how anybody, at this point, can give that. In fact, the past two weeks have shown that you can trust Michael less. And the more they try to clean it up, the more they try to shine this up, it's just the more and more he looks less and less credible. I mean, I was talking to one of your colleagues on the TV the other day, is this almost actually now feels like election interference. Because you did - you're putting so much on Michael Cohen, who none of us would trust. Why else would you bring this forward, unless you'd want to try to slimy up the president before an election with some fake prosecution, which this is what it's starting to feel like, if you're dependent on believing Michael Cohen.",

And one of the things that they said -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- was that this man had done Donald Trump's bidding for years and years. And then one day was dropped like a hot potato. And Donald Trump tweeted out that he was a scumbag for the entire world to see. And that left Michael Cohen on an island. And that's the way they're trying to separate Michael Cohen from the past, somebody who admittedly lied multiple times in defense of Donald Trump, but also in defense of himself to protect himself, to protect his family or protect him with his family. And then also didn't lie at various points. Now they're trying to say, well, this is different because he was left out on an island and this was survival, and he's telling the truth now.",

You need first-hand accounts. And Michael Cohen is the only one we had. Allen Weisselberg, former CFO of the Trump Organization, is currently in Rikers.
