Tonight, Donald Trump becomes a voyeur in his own story. Today, the country heard the beginnings of a story about Donald Trump, but this time, he no longer controls that narrative. Instead it's New York prosecutors who are painting a picture of an alleged hush money cover up scheme where the victims were the American public. Now, in Trump's own version of events, he says he's innocent, a victim of Michael Cohen's vendetta and Stormy Daniels' opportunism. But he's not in control of that narrative either. Trump, who believes he is his own best spokesman and defender, will now have to leave it to his lawyers. Now, as you can imagine, this is why we've seen Trump letting loose outside of the court. He's trying to take back control, to take his own story in his own hands, even if it means risking his freedom and running roughshod over the rule of law. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When are they going to look at all the lies that Cohen the last trial? He got caught lying in the last trial. So, he got caught lying, pure lying. And when are they going to look at that? I just want to say before we begin, these are all Biden trials. This is done as election interference. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's also various people who were working for Pecker, people who were working for Trump. Hard evidence is not just the documents. It's also a tape recording in which Donald Trump is heard discussing the payment to Karen McDougal on tape, in his own voice, talking about even paying her in cash.So, I think this really just distorts what the evidence is and what the government's claiming. They're not saying the hard evidence is Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels. It's all of this evidence together that all supports each other. That's why they have David Pecker is the first witness. He lays the groundwork, sets out the entire scheme. And from there, it's almost impossible not to believe Michael Cohen, especially after they bring in this tape, which they've already alluded to in their opening, which was kind of a weird thing to begin with, because you have to ask, why did Michael Cohen ever tape Donald Trump? I never knew the answer to that until it came up in the opening. It was because he had to convince people Pecker that Trump would still pay the money that was owed, the $115, 000, for Karen McDougal, or $150, 000. So, he taped him in order to get Pecker back on track. So, Pecker is going to say he heard the tape, and you're going to hear the tape through Michael Cohen.

He represented him, Trump trusted him. Sure, that's one.On the other hand, though, these are just the facts. Cohen is a convicted liar, convicted felon, lied to Congress, tax evasion. And what the defense is going to do, Abby, like what you just said, when it's their turn to cross-examine him, they're going to say, don't you have -- and I think you used this word in your intro, isn't it true you have a vendetta? So, I think even as early as last night or this morning, Cohen was tweeting at Trump. He's been on T.V. every day, which is his right to do.

But if they can link it to cooking the books or federal election violations, then you have a case. The only other thing that I would point out, and, again, I worked for Congressman Elijah Cummings, Democrat on House Oversight, and Ed Towns, all Democrats. So, I'm just saying what if I was going to be on the defense team, which I'm not, the other issue is going to be if, if in addition to, to Cohen's issues with credibility, the problem is going to be if Trump can say, well, I really did it. It wasn't to commit a crime, violate New York state law. It was, and they, he's not going to testify, I don't think, but saying it was to, so I didn't hurt my wife. I didn't hurt my family.",

From my standpoint, this is an overwhelming case.And you have the documents as well. And so, Cohen, of course, he's got to get up. And any good opposing counsel is going to impeach him. Any witness that is on the stand is open to impeachment, to cast light on their character for untruthfulness. So, we know that's going to happen, and it's no surprise there.

So why are they not walking out for us?And additionally, I would say that the university's, like, insistent or inconsistency with enforcing its own policies when it came to these universities, organizations which were suspended over the last six months, has fomented this environment of hatred towards the Jewish students on campus because it's gone on for six months with impunity. And so, it's time, that's why President Shafik was in Congress, that there has to be action and the university has to enforce its own policies. And if it doesn't, then we have anarchy on our campus as we've seen over the last four days.",

That's not what happened.They were integrated, and it took five days for them to make a statement saying, oh, that's not us. The only reason they made that statement is because they're losing the narrative, because unfortunately, they're being exposed. And so, look, what should happen to the university president? Here's what I recommend to the president of Columbia. I don't know what the right thing to do is. But if she wants to know what the wrong thing to do is, she can call the former presidents of Harvard and UPenn, who let this nonsense go on on their campuses, and Columbia is way past those two universities. And so, while I want students to be able to protest, while I want them to be able to point out injustices, while I want them to be able to talk about people in Gaza, because that is something we should talk about. We should talk about October 7th, and we should talk about humanitarian aid. We should talk about a two-state solution. We should talk about a ceasefire in exchange for release of hostages.",

It's not anti- Semitic to disagree with Israel.But if you're only pointing out Jewish kids, if they see a Jewish kid on campus, and then they go after that Jewish kid, right, and surround him and blame him for Netanyahu, they targeted that Jewish kid.

And Jelani Cobb, for example, Dean of the School of Journalism at Columbia, is doing a great job listening to students and trying to find a balance. I think a college campus is an exchange of ideas.
