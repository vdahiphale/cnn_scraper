Rebels in Syria have toppled dictator Bashar al-Assad. A stunning development in a 13-year civil war that has cost the lives of more than 500,000 Syrians and impacted millions who have fled their homes in the region. State TV declared victory of the great Syrian revolution as Assad fled Syria, effectively ending his family's half century rule of the country, the development with sweeping implications. Now as new videos show rebels and civilians touring and ransacking residents of Assad in Damascus, President-elect Trump said that the United States should have nothing to do with it, adding overnight that, quote, Assad is gone. He has fled his country, his protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer. Now, a source says Assad left Damascus under Russian protection. Meanwhile, President Biden has not made a public statement yet on the historic developments. But a White House official said he was closely monitoring the situation. First, let's start things off with CNN's Paula Hancocks, who is live in Abu Dhabi. Paula, give us a sense of what's happening on the ground in Syria?",

This is what we've heard from the Russian ministry of foreign affairs, saying that Assad has left Syria, saying that he also decided to leave his presidential post giving instructions to transfer power peacefully. Now we have no way of independently verifying if that is in fact what he said. Another source, though, telling CNN that he did leave Damascus under Russian protection. He left to go to the northwest of the country, close to where there is a Russian military base. So, obviously, Russia certainly has its hands with this one as well. But Russia, as you say, was not there when Assad needed them to, to actually try and shore up power. This was a remarkably fast takeover of power by a group of anti-Assad coalitions of rebel groups, and it has taken really everybody by surprise. We are seeing images of people going through presidential palaces, families indeed. We've seen children going through having a look around at where President Assad once lived. They see some looting as well. In fact, at this hour, we know that a curfew is being put in place by one of those main rebel groups, HTS. Remember that, that is one of the main groups and they have said that there will be a curfew until 5:00 tomorrow morning to try and calm things down -- Manu.",

And even on Syria, his statement of we should stay out, which is an agreement fundamentally with what the White House has done, doesn't answer the question, what do you do if Syria becomes this vacuum that someone's going to fill?

That is going to be a key priority for the president. Just real quickly on the president-elect's general view of the Middle East, he, you know the Abraham Accords were a significant diplomatic victory. And I think one part of his sort of overall vision is establishing that. And extending that with other countries now, how Syria plays into that, I don't know, and I don't think anyone knows.

In the case of the Iranians, it was a Syria was a great conduit for them to deliver arms to Hezbollah.And quite frankly, Syria was also in essence, if you will, a client state of Iran. And it served as a frontline proxy for the Iranians vis-a-vis Israel. Now as far as Russia is concerned, they've got those two bases, one, a naval base at Tartus, the other in air force, air force base, the Russian air force base near Latakia and those two bases gave Russia -- continue to give Russia a powerful position on the eastern Mediterranean, on the shores of the eastern Mediterranean. But if the -- if a government formed by HTS or under the auspices of HTS, I -- it moves forward with their desire to rid Syria of all foreign influence, that logically would indicate it would also get rid of the Russian presence there, and whether or not that happens, of course, is another question. But they certainly based on their public statements, wanting to get rid of the Iranians, they see them as the HTS and Jolani himself see the Iranians as a force for bad in Syria. And it's been one of the driving forces for them. And if they move forward with that, then the Iranians will have one less foothold and become far less powerful in the Middle East, especially with the northern Middle East.

You've been covering a lot of these internal battles -- this is House versus Senate. Just to set the stage, the new Republican Majority Leader John Thune, wants to move very quickly on a new Trump agenda, dealing with border security, dealing with energy production. And also -- but he's facing pushback from Republicans in the House who say we need to move forward on taxes first. They say that is if we don't do this all now, then everything could -- that could fall by the wayside and they may not be able to pass these tax cuts that they've been campaigning so heavily on. This is not just an issue of prioritizing. It's a concern about potentially this all could fall apart if they don't get on the same page. JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": Right. I mean, there's so much pent-up demand for the policy that they've been waiting to be in a position to move through Congress. And now that they have this trifecta, they really want to strike while the iron is hot. But it is the case if you look at history that when one party has control of the White House, the Senate and Congress -- and the House, there's a lot of celebration and a feeling of elation, and we're going to be able to get everything done. But you find out very quickly that it's difficult to do because you do have internal party divisions on what to do first, what to put the most priority on in the House. As you pointed out, there is a nothing margin of control and we have seen how hard that's been for Mike Johnson and Kevin McCarthy before him to manage. They won't have the option of teaming with Democrats like they did in the last Congress so it's a lot, as you said, easier said than done. And they do need to kind of get on the same page pretty quickly about on how they're going to do this, because procedurally, you really need to make some decisions in January to be able to sequence this in a way that will work.",

They have been trying to draft these executive orders to push through the things that he wants first, and come up with legal, or at least trying to come up with legal ways to do so because they understand how small the majority is and because Donald Trump this time around actually has a better understanding of what this means.
