We're closing in on a presidential election year, and America alreadyfeels irreparably divided. Late last night, we saw former President Donald Trump leaning into his new argument that, despite his and his allies' efforts to overturn this the 2020 election, it is he who will save democracy, days after he told Hannity that, if reelected, he would be a dictator on day one, though just on day one, a line many of his fellow Republican officials laughed off. Democrats, of course, face their own divisions. The president of the University of Pennsylvania resigned yesterday after ham-handed comments at a hearing on antisemitism in which she said, any calls to commit genocide against Jews on campus would only violate campus harassment policy, depending on the context. And with Congress stalled over foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel, the pressure on the Biden administration over its Israel policy is only growing this weekend after the U.S. vetoed a U.N. Security Council cease-fire resolution that was backed by allies, and the State Department said it would bypass Congress to send Israel more ammunition for tanks, as Israel pursues its offensive against Hamas and Gaza, an offensive which has killed thousands of innocent Palestinians. Hamas hides among the civilian population, of course, but the U.S. continues to say it wants Israel to do more to stop the bloodshed of innocents. Aid officials are now warning that the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is only growing. And the president's support for Israel is continuing to divide the Democratic Party. Joining me now is Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Mr. Secretary, thanks for joining us. So, the U.S. stood alone at the U.N. Security Council on Friday to block the cease-fire. And the administration is sidestepping Congress to rush more weapons to Israel. You said this week there is -- quote -- \"a gap\" between the intent to protect Palestinian civilians and the actual results that we're seeing on the ground in Gaza. Can you describe that gap? What is Israel doing right now that you think does not demonstrate enough care or protection of Palestinian civilians?",

But you make another point that's very important. When the major military operation is over, this is not over, because we have to have a durable, sustainable peace, and we have to make sure that we're on a path to a durable and sustainable peace. From our perspective, I think from the perspective of many around the world, that has to lead to a Palestinian state. This is -- we're not going to have durable peace, we're not going to have durable security for Israel unless and until Palestinian political aspirations are met. And, of course, what happens the day after in Gaza itself once military operations, major military operations, are over, that's also hugely important and urgent to make sure that governance, security, reconstruction, all of that is in place, so that there's no vacuum.",

Last night, Trump called concerns about what he might do in office -- quote -- \"the threat to democracy hoax.\" For more on that and the debate that is dividing the Senate, key Trump ally and Republican senator J.D. Vance of Ohio joins me now live in studio. Thanks so much for being here. Really appreciate it. So, you just heard Secretary Blinken trying to make the case for aid to both Israel and Ukraine. You and Senate Republicans recently blocked the package to support Ukraine and Israel, among the reasons, more support for a border package to protect the Southern border. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, however, talking about the aid for Israel and Ukraine, said that threats from Russia, China, Iran, Hamas are all interconnected. I want you to take a listen to what he had to say. SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH):  Sure. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY):  The challenges facing America and our allies today are not a la carte menu of projects we can address at our leisure.

And here's the reason that's a direct conflict of interests, Jake. He's charged with the -- by the U.N. with the responsibility of guiding the world toward a sharp phasedown of these greenhouse gas emissions, which mainly come from burning fossil fuels. But he's charged by his sovereign, the -- and the company that he heads with a massive expansion of fossil fuels. They have got a plan to expand production of both oil and gas by an enormous amount, starting the minute the gavel bangs to end this conference. And that's a direct conflict of interests.

Nikki Haley at least is saying some exceptions, and that's probably why she's not going to win. It's Donald Trump who's upholding the extreme abortion policies,by the way, that even Ronald Reagan and George Bush didn't have, and I think that's another reason the Democrats will win.",

Right now, DeSantis is running, or one of the PACs supporting him, a kind of Nikki Haley conflicting statement ad, like a flip-flop ad. \"Tricky Nikki,\" they call her.
