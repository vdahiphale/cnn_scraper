Because when I look at it, it seems like his memory was bad in 2017 and then it was bad today. But there's never any distinction made. But isn't it true that if you were going to be looking at his -- at prosecuting as you were, you would look carefully at his condition in 2017. Isn't that the proper time because I think you say in your report that the most -- your best case, I think you call it out, the best case for charges would rely on Mr. Biden's possession of Afghanistan documents in his Virginia home in February 2017 when he was a private citizen and when he told his ghostwriter, he just found classified material.
