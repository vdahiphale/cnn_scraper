Zain is off today. You are watching \"ONE WORLD\". And we begin with escalating attacks along Israel's northern border with Lebanon, which are raising fears of a wider regional war. Israel says that it will not join a trilateral framework proposed by France. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant accuses France of having what he calls hostile policies towards Israel. This as Hezbollah fired a barrage of rockets into Israel for a third straight day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOLODRYGA (voice-over):  Israel says there was a fire and property damage, but no casualties. These latest cross-border attacks erupted after Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in a strike earlier this week.

Well, for more on the war in Gaza and the stalled ceasefire, let'sbring in Yaakov Katz, a senior columnist for \"The Jerusalem Post\". Previously, he was the paper's editor-in-chief and its military reporter and defense analyst. He's also the author of several books. Yaakov, good to see you. So, first of all, just your response to that interview Ben conducted with a Hamas official, specifically as it relates to the number of Israeli hostages that remain and their whereabouts. How do you respond to his statement that they have no idea how many are still alive? YAAKOV KATZ, SENIOR COLUMNIST, \"THE JERUSALEM POST\":  Well, I think the Hamas has been playing this game, Bianna, since the beginning. The people got lost in Gaza. They didn't know how many of the hostages were even taken. They didn't know where they were. They've been playing a very cynical game when it comes to the lives of now 116 Israelis who remain inside the Gaza Strip since October 7th. And they do this because they know that this is the way to continue to pierce the hearts of the Israeli people and probably lots of people around the world by keeping them in tunnels, in homes, abusing them. And we've heard, as opposed to what Osama Hamdan said, that these doctors just say what the Israeli government tells them to say, the atrocities and the sexual abuse and just general abuse that these people have been through should keep us all up at night.",

But you need two sides or two parties, two people to tango. And Hamas is not there. And I think that what we're seeing, we saw this in some of the reporting of \"The Wall Street Journal\" earlier this week, where they reported on some of the communication between Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, and other terrorist colleagues of his who are based in Qatar. And he says, we have Israel right where we want them. And the people who have been killed, they're just a sacrifice of what we need for our national liberation. I think what Sinwar feels is that the pressure is actually on Israel, right? They see the condemnations. They see that Israel goes in, Bianna, rescues four of its people, Noah, Shlomi, Al-Mogh, and Andrei, just last Saturday. And what happens? The whole world accuses Israel of committing a massacre. So, why would Sinwar feel the pressure that he needs to come into a deal right now? Look, what could happen? What could change that? Is if America says, for example, you know what? We're totally on Israel's side. There's no clock. There's no pressure on Israel. We're actually accelerating weapons deliveries now to Israel. That would get Sinwar to think that something's not working, and he actually has an interest in getting this war done.",

Let me ask you about the situation that's continuing to evolve there and concern about a second front really opening up between Israel and Hezbollah, a much stronger party, obviously, than Hamas is and capable of much more damage to Israel. There are two thoughts -- two schools of thought here, that one, that Hassan Nasrallah at the end of the day would rather keep this at a lower temperature, doesn't want to expand to a full- on war. But the other is that, listen, any miscalculation could happen any time, and given what they're capable of, they could very well decide that now is the moment. And the frustration appears to be that just like with the war in Gaza, at least from Israel's government's perspective, there isn't a day-after plan, there isn't a longer-term plan. This seems to be a day-to- day sort of response. Is that fair?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I mean, you're breaking it down, I think, pretty accurately, Bianna. There's a feeling in Israel, on the one hand, why do we need asecond front? It's a much stronger enemy. If Hamas had, I don't know, 30,000 rockets going into this war, 40,000 fighters, Hezbollah is looking at 150,000 rockets and missiles, some with precision, some with half-ton warheads, some with the ability to strike anywhere inside the state of Israel. The army talks about 5000 rockets a day. That would be too many for our missile defense systems, Iron Dome, David's Sling, Arrow, to be able to intercept all of them. And we would see unfortunate devastation and casualties inside Israel, unlike anything we've probably seen before. So, people say, if Nasrallah wanted war, there's an easy way for him to do that, fire a barrage into Haifa or Tel Aviv. As long as he's not doing that, it's just him paying lip service and showing solidarity to Hamas, we can continue to contain this. The other side of it, though, is we've had to evacuate 100,000 people from their homes in the north. We have capabilities that Hezbollah has, that at some point, at somewhere down the road, they will use them against us, should we not preempt now. And I can tell you that at the Jewish People Policy Institute, a place where I'm a think tank, where I'm a fellow, we did a poll this past week, which showed that a third of Israelis, it's not a small number, want to see Israel attack Hezbollah right away, now. So it's something that really has the country, to some extent, torn. What is the right way forward? But I'll just say one last thing. People who say that Netanyahu is undecided on this, that I push back on. He has decided. His decision so far is not to engage, to try to contain the threat from Lebanon for as long as possible. [12:15:01] GOLODRYGA:  Yeah. He is somebody who is, at least historically, not been a risk taker. He's been very calculated, although we've seen many faces of Benjamin Netanyahu, especially when he is under pressure. So, this really is a tinder box as we continue to cover the growing escalation.

And so, yesterday, Zelenskyy was sort of the star, if you will, crystallized thinking and conversation. And today, the Pope really had that mantle, had that role. And of course, he comes in with all the grace and the elegance that you would expect the Pope to have and all the gravitas that he brings to the conversation. So, those leaders, they sat there and they listened to him as the Pope talked about the idea that A.I. is a tool and it's a tool that can be used for good or bad. He gave an example of the bad, automated weapons that can literally select, aim and fire at a target, non-humans killing humans. He said we should never arrive at that point. And he talked about an ideal where no one country in the world should get advantage of A.I. No one group of people should get advantage. No, the haves should not have advantage and benefit over above the not haves. And that's part of that conversation we've heard from White House officials is that the U.S. wants to sort of do two things here. One -- one, try to reach that ideal that the Pope is talking about there by making sure in the developing world that they have access to the health care improvements, the agricultural improvements, the A.I. technology, the good things that it can bring, and as well at the same time, align A.I. governance. A.I. obviously is a global issue. And unless you can, as these sort of most powerful democracies, can align their governance of A.I., there's really no hope to align it globally. So, that's what those were the two aims that they were aiming for. But the Pope really energized that discussion. A.I. is not something normally you would expect to get a lot of excitement and buzz around. But he made that happen. And I think that really symbolizes what he brought to the conversation today.",

The surprise was that they agreed to go into this government of national unity with their rival, their arch-rivals, the DEA, the Democratic Alliance. Some black South Africans see the DEA as representative of the white minority. One of the political names best known in South Africa even refused to go into this coalition, Julius Malema of the Economic Freedom Fighters, saying that he will not go into a coalition with a party that represents white monopoly capital. And so, he's left out of this, as is former President Jacob Zuma and his M.K. party. They were number three and four in last month's election. But the DEA and the ANC have enough to form a coalition government. They've brought in two smaller parties, as well, just for a more national outlook. So, the Speaker has been elected a short while ago. The South African National Assembly right now is electing a deputy speaker. And then the next thing will be for them to re-elect Cyril Ramaphosa as the President of South Africa. So, he gets to keep his job. But then his next job is to assemble a cabinet. What these parties have done so far, according to the DEA leader, is to sign a statement of intent. The actual details, they will work out those over time. So, there's still some work to do. They're calling what is called in South Africa as a lekhotla, a meeting of these political parties to agree on a strategy to how they will govern in a government of national unity. It's not going to be easy for President Ramaphosa, because even though he's the largest party, but he's only got 40 percent, for him to remain President, he needs the DEA. He needs all these other parties. So, they brought him to the dance, and they will be bringing their own interests. And they will be making sure that they are, in a way, an opposition within government. Bianna.",

The G7 leaders provided Ukraine with a $50 billion loan while the U.S. and Ukraine agreed to a 10-year security pact. That loan being funded by the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets. Russia's President calls that theft. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The countries of the West have frozen now a part of Russian assets and foreign currency reserves. Now, they are thinking about any sort of legal grounds allowing them to finally appropriate the assets and reserves.

David, this is a G7 where it is fair to say that all but one of these leaders are politically weakened and are challenged in the coming weeks and months. President Biden here, obviously, against former President Donald Trump, who has a much different philosophy in terms of alliances and NATO and the view on the war and Ukraine. You wrote a piece this morning about what the United States in particular is doing to safeguard against another Trump administration, this 10-year security pact, the $50 billion in loan to rebuild the country. But you write -- your headline, \"Will Biden's help for Ukraine come fast enough and last long enough?\" And that really is the key question here.",

Of course, President Zelenskyy was here and signed that 10-year security pact. But behind the scenes, there's a lot of doubt about what that really means. So, when you dig into the security pact itself, it doesn't actually require the United States to do anything other than to consult with the Ukrainians if they were attacked anew or if there was some major threat to Kyiv, for example, from the Russians. It also has an out in it, which is that either side can exit the security pact with just six months' notice. Well, this is exactly the loophole that then-President Trump used to get out of the Iran nuclear deal, also an executive agreement like this one. Neither one of these are treaties. If a President can sign it, the next president can leave it.",

And there's a bigeffort by the U.S. to see if they could scrounge up some more Patriot air defense systems. The decision that the President made -- President Biden made, two weeks ago to allow the Ukrainians to fire U.S. arms into Russian territory near Kharkiv has apparently been successful in sort of stalling out the Russian attacks in Kharkiv. But we have very little doubt that the Russians, if they've got the manpower for it, will then spread that effort further up. And there are a lot of people here who are concerned with just what you mentioned, that based on what you just heard in that tape from President Putin, that the Russians are going to try to have their own marking of the NATO 75th by truly going after Ukraine in those weeks leading up to the summit and perhaps the week of the summit itself. The summit is supposed to be a celebration of a new, stronger, expanded NATO, as you heard from Secretary Austin. I think Putin's going to want to go try to push that to tell a different story.",

And it's interesting, we had President Zelenskyy now say that patriots is practically a Ukrainian word now. And it does speak to some of the frustration that many military experts and obviously the Ukrainians have been voicing since the early days of this war, and that is that the U.S. and the West at this point should be quicker to saying yes to some of their asks in terms of what they're allowed to do with the military aid provided by the West and giving them some of that aid because it eventually, for the most part, does get there, but just at a very high cost.",

And then, I think the third category is just understanding what it is that the pace at which the Ukrainians need this ammunition.
