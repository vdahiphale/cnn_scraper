They have not presented any evidence of these claims. And also there have been -- as you know, there have been claims about whistleblowers related to the Biden family, where nothing has come to fruition. So we're watching to see what comes with that. But it's certainly sparked a lot of questions about what exactly is going on with the criminal investigation into the president's son. As CNN was the first to report last summer, the investigation was heating up. They had narrowed it down to a few charges, tax crimes and one possible false statement related to the purchase of a gun, not disclosing his addiction. But as of now, there's no indication that anything has changed with the case. And obviously there have been no charges. But in the absence of the criminal investigation, manifesting anything Republicans are really seizing on this narrative, going back to sort of arguments in the court of public opinion and trying to bring Hunter Biden's name back into the public square.",

When I spoke with the mother of that 6-year-old girl -- remember, the mother herself was grazed by a bullet in her arm. She texted me and told me, \"I am just so glad. I can't believe he made it all the way to Florida.\" Now that little girl's father, actually, Hildebrand's husband, remains in the hospital. He was shot in the back. Police say the shooter was 24-year-old Robert Singletary, who did appear before a judge in Hillsborough County, Florida this morning. He waived his right to extradition. The Gaston County authorities have a couple of days to bring him back, to transport him to North Carolina before there's another hearing there in Florida just to determine sort of the status of the extradition. Once he arrived here, Boris (sic), Singletary faces a whole host of charges, although authorities say that there is still an open investigation, and there could be more, including four counts of attempted murder.",
