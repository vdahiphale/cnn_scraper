Then, Ukraine accuses Russia of setting a trap as both sides prepare for a battle for the city of Kherson. And a new right-wing government takes shape, as Israel's current prime minister concedes defeat. But first, tonight, Pakistan's former Prime Minister, Imran Khan is accusing senior government officials of orchestrating an assassination attempt against him, including current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as well as others. But they denied it. Khan was shot in the lower leg and thigh when the gunman opened fire at a rally on Thursday. He's listed -- in stable condition. But a party official says pellets are lodged in his leg and the bone is chipped. This video shows Khan, as you can see there, fleeing the scene. One other person was killed and several others were also injured. I want to go to Sophia Saifi, who is live for us from Islamabad, Pakistan. Sophia, good to see you. Just bring us up to date on how this all unfolded and how he's doing this hour.",

Theywere protests across the country in response to what's happened to Imran Khan. There's been months of political polarization and unease, leading up to what happened today. Here's our report on how the events of today unfolded. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAIFI (voice-over):  In the chaotic moments after the shooting, Imran Khan had to be carried out and whisked away from the crowd. A gunman had opened fire at a rally of tens of thousands of his supporters. His target, Khan party says was the former prime minister himself.   Shot in the lower leg, he was bundled into a bulletproof car and driven two hours to Lahore for surgery. A party senior leader released a statement from Khan saying, Pakistan's old cricketing hero blamed Prime Minister, Shehbaz Sharif, his Interior Minister, and a senior Intelligence official for an attempt on his life, calling for their removal from office. It was, the government said, a grievous accusation. Outside the hospital, people waited desperately for news. Protests broke out across the country as news of the shooting spread. Six others were injured in the attack and one was killed, according to a senator from Khan's political party. \"Please pray for Imran Khan, for our fellow workers who are injured.\" This senator says, \"and for our party member who has died.\" Khan had been on the campaign trail to demand snap elections in Pakistan after he was ousted in a vote of no confidence in parliament just six months ago. Accused of bad governance and mismanaging the country's flailing economy. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I want togo to Ukraine now because Ukraine believes Russia is setting a trap for its forces in the occupied city of Kherson. That's because Russian appointed officials say their troops will most likely withdraw to the east bank of the Kherson region, leaving the city empty as the Ukrainians approach. This social media video shows Russian flag is no longer, as you can see, they're flying at the main administration building, but Ukrainian officials don't see evidence that Russian troops are actually pulling back. And Ukrainian residents north of the city are reporting large accumulation of Russian forces as well as equipment, including tanks moving in large numbers at night. And that leaves Ukraine to believe Russia wants them to walk into an ambush. Nic Robertson joins me now from Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine. So Nic, a lot -- it seemed a lot of confusion as to what is unfolding in Kherson. Is it mixed messages or, as we've outlined there, perhaps part of Russia's power play here?",

When the Ukrainians launched that verysuccessful offensive in the north of the country, they spent a long time messaging the Russians indirectly and directly to create the impression that they were about to launch an offensive in the south. And what do you know? They went and took a lot of territory in the north. So, I think they're naturally suspicious that Russia is doing a similar thing right now. They say, while that flag is -- the Russian flag is not on that main government building in the center of Kherson, Ukrainian officials are pointing out, yes, that the Russian flag is flying on other buildings in Kherson. You know, the residents of that city on the bus on social media video, being very happy seeing there were no Russians at a checkpoint. Now, CNN did manage to reach somebody in Kherson, a resident there, talked to them - - we're keeping their identity secret for their safety. But that person told us, yes, in fact, all the Russian checkpoints inside the center of the city are gone. And we're not seeing very many heavy military vehicles by day. The sort of Ukrainian official vision of that, of what residents are seeing is slightly different. They're saying, well, look, we believe that there are Russian soldiers on the streets in Kherson, but actually dressed in civilian clothing. And this resident in other details he gave, backs up what Ukrainian officials think is happening. The resident there said, look, we believe that a lot of Russian heavy weapons on the edge of the city. So, this is the real question. Ukraine wants it. President Putin, and particularly his military, doesn't want Russia to be embarrassed because they are going to lose it overtime. How they lose it is perhaps the question, and can they score some kind of victory over Ukraine, even though, ultimately, they will pull out, as those officials are suggesting and actually have been suggesting for several weeks now.",

A new right-wing government is taking shape in Israel as finalelection results confirm Benjamin Netanyahu will be returning to power. Current Prime Minister, Yair Lapid, conceded defeat just a short time ago, calling to congratulate Netanyahu. The former prime minister will serve an unprecedented sixth term. A far- right alliance helped Netanyahu's coalition win a majority of seats in parliament. Now, those extremist allies want key government roles.

Yair Lapid instructing his office to start the transition of power, saying in a statement, the state of Israel comes before any political consideration, that he wishes Netanyahu success. Now, we did -- we are getting the final numbers in, it does seem as though Netanyahu will have 64 seats for him and his allies in this next parliament. It's the one less than what we have been talking about, 65. But still far greater than what anybody had expected. Opinion polls placed him and his allies at only getting 60 to 61 seats. And a lot of where that surge is coming from, as we've been discussing, is the rise of this far-right party. And that's really the question that everyone has right now, is what is the makeup of his cabinet going to look like? Well, and you just look at the pictures of the heads of the coalition sitting with him, they're all men, they're all white, and they -- some, I think three or four of them are -- or even more are religious. So, it's going to be a much different makeup than the last coalition government, which was the most diverse coalition in terms of political viewpoint in Israeli history. This is going to swing to essentially the other side, becoming the most far-right coalition potentially in Israeli history. A big question will be, what positions will these far-right --",

Officials also say, North Korea fired three short-range ballistic missiles a short while ago into the water of its east coast. This is just a day after Pyongyang fired as many as 23 missiles to the east and west of the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang, earlier this week, condemned American as well as South Korean joint military drills, which have now been extended. Let's get the view from Washington with CNN's Alex Marquardt. Alex, great to see you. So, we've heard in the last, what? Two hours or so from U.S. Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin. What did he say, Alex, about the repeating -- the repeat as well as the increasing nature of these missile tests? ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Isa, we heard from Secretary Austin alongside his South Korean counterpart, Lee Jong-Sup who is in Washington for pre-planned meetings. The two men held a press conference today, and it was really a strong display of bilateral cooperation. Secretary Austin calling the U.S. support for South Korea, ironclad. He called on North Korea to end this provocative actions and engage in what he called serious dialogue. Instead, of course, Isa, there's no sign of that happening any time soon. As you noted, we have seen a real flurry of missile launches from the North Koreans, 30-missile launch events so far this year. Of course, many more missiles than that launched, 23 as you noted just yesterday. Several more, including that intercontinental ballistic missile, as well, that if it were to work, could reach the United States. Now, it is believed to have failed. So, the North Koreans continue to carry out these missile tests, and there is an expectation, Isa, from officials and from observers, that any day now, at any moment really, North Korea could carry out another nuclear test. An underground nuclear test. The South Korean defense minister saying today that there's still a curiosity, in his words, as to when that might happen. He warned that if North Korea were to carry out a nuclear attack, that, that would mean the end of the Kim Jong-un regime. And nuclear tests would lead to the end of the Kim regime, he said, because of the overwhelming and decisive response of the alliance. Isa.",

North Korea has said that this is an irresponsible decision and has pushed the situation to an uncontrollable phase.

SIMON COVENEY, MINISTER OF DEFENSE &amp; FOREIGN AFFAIRS, IRELAND:  It's hard to know, to be honest, Isa. I mean, what we know is the -- Ukraine has had significant success in terms of liberating parts of its own territory that have been temporarily occupied by Russian forces. We also know of some of the horrors that have unfolded. Some of those areas have been liberated because of some of the abuses and potential war crimes that are being committed by Russian soldiers. But I think everybody is cautious now in terms of what's likely to happen or unfold over the next few days as that liberation continues in the Kherson region.

Doctor, thank you very much for coming in and discussing exactly what we have, what you have uncovered. Just talk us through, explain to our viewers what the study found and, critically, the impact on the brain here. JAMES RUCKER, CONSULTANT PSYCHIATRIST, KING'S COLLEGE LONDON:  So, the study found, it was in 233 participants with depression that doesn't get better with the usual treatments. And we gave everyone psychological support but divided people into three groups. They either received a very low those of psilocybin and intermediate dose of psilocybin or a high dose of psilocybin. And we found that people's depression symptoms in the 25-milligram group were much improved at three weeks compared to those in the 1-milligram group. So, to put a figure on that, two-thirds of people in that group had felt their depression significantly lift and a half of those no longer qualified for a diagnosis of depression at all.",
