The Trump campaign largely laying low over the past few days, but the former president did make one notable remark.

Stephanie, I want to start with you because it seems that the Trump campaign is making a deliberate choice to cede the spotlight -- something they don't do a lot. And I want to read from some of your latest reporting. You write that, \"Aside from a celebratory rally last Friday, Trump has largely gone silent -- even canceling a planned television interview with a Virginia network, according to local outlet 13News Now. After flirting with announcing his vice-presidential pick in the day before the debate, his campaign reverted to their original plans to unveil the pick close to the Republican convention.\" So a rare less is more strategy from the Trump campaign?",

They don't have the same problems and it seems like the polling has been helping them ever since the debate. And so we're seeing that the campaign has largely allowed the advisers to do the talking for President Trump. And instead of potentially unveiling a vice-presidential running mate, he's decided to hold off on that announcement, which is something that we were expecting but there was discussion among sources that had told me that there -- they might have unveiled it earlier should the debate not have gone the way that they were hoping it to go.",
