It's open to pedestrians, but it is still closed to vehicles. That said, there is still a major security presence here. As you see some of these police vehicles being let in. You also might notice some of those yellow barriers on the sidewalks as well. That is new. We saw those being installed over the course of today. And for those that have seen the surveillance video of this truck coming through, it did initially go over part of the sidewalk. And then, of course, it would have come down this direction onto the street over toward this area as well. Again, all of it now reopened to pedestrians for the first time. And on the investigatory side, you were talking about some of it before you were coming to me. The FBI today saying, as opposed to yesterday, that they believe this driver acted alone. Remember yesterday they believed he wasn't solely responsible for this. They said this new conclusion comes as a result of actually going through interviews, going through phone and laptop records, where they also uncovered that they believe this is 100 percent ISIS motivated. Another big aspect of this, too, there is a major football game going on. It was delayed today. That is also under -- that is also underway. We were over there earlier talking to some fans and they were nervous. Some of them were out that very night when this happened in the early morning hours. But they are all at the game with also an increased security presence as well. There was music coming through earlier. And a little bit closer to the entrance of this, there are flowers laid out, 14 of them for the 14 killed in this attack, Wolf. But as you can see, Bourbon Street is now back reopen.

We've seen cities locked down in response to terror or violence, as we saw in Lewiston, Maine, most recently after a mass shooting. And so there's a couple of criteria.One is, can people be kept safe? I think the FBI made it clear today that they felt that this was lone wolf. They weren't looking for anyone else. There was confusion yesterday, as we've noted a number of times. The second is they're just putting a lot of manpower and woman power on the street, on Bourbon Street as well as the Sugar Bowl, which is relatively easier to protect because it's a single site. Those are things that jurisdictions are looking about, and I think it is important to do. This is. This is the symbolic nature of terrorism. If an individual can close down a city, cancel a bowl, make people not enjoy the benefits of the city, this is what we love about cities, community engagement, fun being out on streets, then they win a lot more than just the attack itself.

Nic, thank you very, very much.I want to bring in retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Allied commander. He's a CNN military analyst. General Clark, thanks so much for joining us. Jabbar, as you well know and all of us know by now, as a U.S. -- was a U.S. citizen, a military veteran. How is ISIS ideology attracted to someone like him? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: You know, he's a man who got out of the military. He had a -- he had a really troubled personal life. He was failing in his marriage. He tried businesses, businesses failed. I think he was looking for anything to hold onto. And so unlike a young person who would be looking for some way to -- to latch onto something for his identity, this guy was sliding downhill quickly. He -- he would take anything at this point, I -- I suppose. And somehow he was on the ISIS websites. And -- and Wolf, what it says to me is we've got to do a better job of policing the websites, knowing who's on them, knowing who's back and forth in the correspondence and answering. And, you know, this is a slippery -- this is difficult to do, takes a lot of manpower. And ISIS is learning and has learned how to elude U.S. surveillance and efforts. And -- and so this is part of their resurgence. We're just going to have to do a better job on this.",

And by choosing those individuals alongside advocates for liberal causes like gay rights, veterans issues and gun safety, as well as some of his closest confidants over the course of the last several decades.Biden is essentially sending a signal to the President-elect that he has supported these individuals and their causes, even as Trump and his team have sought to malign those two individuals and the work of their committee. Biden is also still considering a preemptive pardon for Cheney and other individuals potentially targets of retribution by the incoming administration. And earlier today, at a separate event at the White House, I had an opportunity to ask the outgoing chair of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Dick Durbin, what he thought of the possibility of such preemptive partisans for Cheney and others, including California's new senator, Adam Schiff. And Durbin told me this. He said that essentially he's spoken to several of the people mentioned, including Senator Schiff, who don't think it's necessary. Durbin says, I'm standing by them. So certainly that is something that is going to be watched in the final days of the Biden administration. But you can see the President choosing to elevate the people and the causes that he holds most dear, and we expect him to do that as he closes out his time in office. Wolf?",

And right now, Thomas Massie, a Republican from the state of Kentucky, has already said that he will be voting against Johnson in tomorrow's count.Now, earlier today, Johnson met with some of those holdouts. And as those members were emerging from the meeting, they said that they've had a good conversation with Johnson, that they can continue to try to press for changes in how they try to move forward with spending bills. They want those bills to be individual. They also say that they are trying to get more promises from Johnson that individual members will have more say in the initial negotiations when it comes to big pieces of legislation. Think about the upcoming tax bill that Republicans might be eyeing in the next year. But it's not clear whether or not Johnson has the votes. Now, earlier today, he did appear on \"Fox Business\" and he was bullish, saying that he thought that they would be OK tomorrow, that he thought that they could potentially lock this up in the first round of voting. But we should note that earlier today, some of his closest allies still preparing for the potential that this could go multiple rounds.

This has never happened before for somebody who is in office.So what we're looking at right now, the drama of the moment. Police are corralling out protesters and we're waiting to see, Wolf, whether or not there is going to be a clash with supporters of South Korea's suspended President Yoon and police. So bringing you back to speed or rewinding the tape a little bit, this comes one month to the day after this guy suspended President Yoon declared martial law, throwing the country into chaos because he couldn't get what he want -- what he wanted done through the parliament here in South Korea. That effort failed. And what we're seeing right now, that is a direct result of him trying to throw this country back into a state of martial law. So he's facing charges of insurrection and abuse office, paraphrasing the charges ever so lightly. So what we're waiting to see is if he goes without incident, if there are mass protests, clashes, fights. And this warrant allows him to be questioned, Wolf, for 48 hours. Police and investigators here in Seoul would need another warrant to keep him in custody longer. But it is a standoff with, you know, questions of how this democracy will continue -- will continue to exist while we are still under the pall of 179 people killed in that cataclysmic plane crash about three and a half hours south of where we're standing, Wolf.",
