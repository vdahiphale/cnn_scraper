So the question is, how long is this plunge going to last? It is very serious. ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  There are going to be some cities that stay below freezing for multiple days. So this is not just going to be something that's a couple few hours here and there and we'll be back to normal. This is going to be a prolonged event, and you're talking a prolonged period at dangerous levels. Here's a look at where we have all those windchill advisories and windchill warnings. Again, it stretches from the Canadian border all the way down to the Mexican border. This is a very widespread cold snap. Look at some of these windchills already reported, minus 70, minus 58, minus 57. Most of them so far have been in Montana and South Dakota, but that cold air is going to be spreading, especially today we're going to start to see some of those dangerous windchills down as far as Oklahoma and Texas. But look at this, minus 35 in Casper, minus 47 in Pierre, minus 45 in Billings. But even as far south as Amarillo, Texas, minus 26 for that windchill. And ahead of all that cold air, you have all of this snow from this other system that's just out to the east. So that's what's going to be causing a lot of the travel concerns not just in the air but also on the road. So do make sure you give yourself extra time, pack a little bit more patience today and even tomorrow, because this system will be making its way off to the east. So today the concern for the easter cities is going to be that mix of rain and snow and a little bit of ice before finally transitioning all into snow as we go into tomorrow. So here's all the areas where you have those winter storm warnings, winter weather advisories, as well as blizzard warnings. Again, as we go through the day today, Chicago is going to be a big focus, same thing with St. Louis. Then by the time we get to tomorrow morning, you're still looking at some pretty heavy rain across Boston and Washington D.C., now looking at full slow for areas of Detroit and Cleveland. But the good news is by the time get to Friday night, the cold air will still be there, guys, but at least the snow will finally start to come to an end.",

We are literally voting on a full-year appropriation, hopefully today, with the money for Ukraine. And there's a lot of people who were on that floor yesterday on the Republican side of the aisle who have signed a letter saying, no, we do not support that full-year appropriation. We will go after Republican senators if they vote for it.So I thought it was interest. At least a person like Chip Roy is consistent and he says I don't think we should be doing this, and so I'm not going to attend.
