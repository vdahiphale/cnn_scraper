That is an 11 percent increase over what they saw in 2023.So, perfect weather with these big crowds is keeping things very smooth. There are very few delays, very few cancellations across the country when you consider how many people are traveling. So this seriously could not get any better. Let me give you the proof. Look at this. TSA pre, 10 minutes through security. First class, five minutes through security. Economy, 10 minutes through security. Do these numbers get any better? I don't think they do.

He serves on the House Veteran Affairs Committee and is also a retired Navy SEAL.And congressman, I wanted to start there. First, thank you so much for joining us. Your thoughts on the President-elect's recently announced pick for secretary of the Navy, John Phelan. He's not someone who has military experience or any significant public connection to the Navy or the Pentagon. He's someone who founded a private investment company. He was a large donor to Trump's reelection campaign, we should note. Do you think Phelan has the right qualifications to be secretary of the Navy? REP. DERRICK VAN ORDEN (R-WI): Well, first of all, Happy Thanksgiving to everybody. I'm also on the House Agriculture Committee, so when you're eating your Thanksgiving feast tomorrow, make sure you thank a farmer. You know what? I'm the longest serving enlisted member of the United States military to ever be elected to Congress in the history of our nation. I have multiple combat tours as a United States Navy SEAL, and I'm completely comfortable with our incoming SECNAV. The reason being is that we need somebody that's able to make sure that they can lay out a strategic vision and then follow through with it. That's what the Navy's about, projecting strategic power through keeping sea lanes open. And I have the utmost confidence that our incoming secretary is going to be able to do just that, because he understands that in order to get things done, you have to be able to put something above yourself. He's done that in the private sector, putting the company and the welfare of the stockholders above himself. And he's going to be able to do that as the incoming SECNAV by putting the United States of America, our well-being and the well-being of our allies above himself.",

It's President Donald Trump.We have to make sure that we have a level playing field. Canada, unfortunately, has decided to not follow the regulations, or excuse me, the USMCA agreement, and they're eating our lunch with our dairy farmers. Mexico is doing the same thing across the board with a lot of our different commodities. Brazil is gutting out our corn and ethanol industry.

How is the Trump administration planning to mass deport those workers without disrupting the nation's supply of food? VAN ORDENAnd we got to understand that this is not a political statement. It's not a Republican or a Democrat issue or independent or libertarian. We're sick and tired of our children and our neighbors dying from fentanyl poisoning.

It comes as President Biden yesterday said that they would be renewing a push to try to secure such a deal working with countries like Israel, Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to try to hammer out some type of agreement.Earlier today, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that they really view this as a fresh opportunity because in the United States' eyes, they believe that this ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon really further isolates Hamas, that perhaps this could push Hamas back to the negotiating table as talks to try to achieve a ceasefire deal in Gaza have really stalled out over the course of the past few months. Now for President Biden, he's expressing a lot of hope that they might be able to achieve that type of ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, but there are many questions whether that is just wishful thinking or if they can actually turn this into a reality. We know that the President's Middle East coordinator, Brett McGurk, was in Saudi Arabia yesterday to talk about this ceasefire deal in Lebanon, but also the potential for it to unlock negotiations relating to Gaza. But as you heard Nic talking about there, there so far haven't been any political moves from Israel relating to a ceasefire deal in Gaza. But for President Biden, having the ceasefire in Lebanon, for him, it really is an effort to restore calm in at least one front of this multifaceted war. President Biden argued yesterday that it shows that peace is possible. He said he'll be dedicating his remaining time in office to trying to secure peace on other fronts in the Middle East. And then there's the also the factor of President-elect Donald Trump. We know when President Biden met with Trump in the Oval Office just about two weeks ago, the two talked about this conflict in the Middle East, specifically trying to get those American hostages back home. The hostage families have been urging for the two sides to work together. So we will see whether there will be any type of coordination in the coming weeks as President Biden is very quite hopeful that he can try to finish off this deal, try to get those loved ones back home before he leaves office.",
