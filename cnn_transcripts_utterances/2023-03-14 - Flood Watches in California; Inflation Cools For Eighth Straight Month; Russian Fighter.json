I'm Brianna Keilar in Washington.We will have much more on our breaking news here in just a moment, a Russian jet striking a U.S. drone over international waters in the Black Sea. First, though, today, a collective sigh of relief after the latest inflation numbers and a market rally have the U.S. stepping back from the brink of economic disaster. Inflation has cooled for the eighth straight month, with the Consumer Price Index at a level that we haven't seen since September of 2021. That doesn't mean the prices are back to normal. Any trip to the grocery store makes that very clear. But, overall, they're trending in the right direction. And, right now, regional banks are rebounding. There, you see some of the surging stocks, and paired with that, deposit outflows are apparently slowing, meaning the collapse of two banks in recent days has not as of now sparked a domino effect. But Moody's has just downgraded its outlook for the entire U.S. banking sector. CNN's Matt Egan is here to interpret all of this data. So, Matt, what a difference a day makes here, right? First Republic was under serious pressure. Now it's leading this market rally. What's going on and is the worst over?",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, let's hope so.It does seem like cooler heads are prevailing. Let's look at these bank stocks. Regional banks, as you mentioned, they got clobbered yesterday. First Republic was down 62 percent yesterday alone, but look at this, up 48 percent. We're seeing across-the-board games, Western Alliance, Comerica, all of them moving higher. This is encouraging because, remember, banking and finance, this is really a confidence game. When people are not confident, they will take out their deposits. Unfortunately, that is what we saw late last week, leading to this collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. What U.S. officials have done is, they have announced this shock and awe rescue plan, trying to save the depositors, trying to get confidence back. And in an encouraging sign, a U.S. official from the Treasury Department says that deposit outflows at small and midsized banks, they are slowing. That is exactly what they want to see to make sure that the banking crisis is going to end and that there's no other banks that are going to collapse.",

That's actually three times hotter than what is considered healthy.But look at this chart. You can see inflation spiked in late 2020, 2021, stayed high last year. But now the trend is going in the right direction; 6 percent is not good, but it is way better than 9 percent last summer. Now, that is not to say, of course, that inflation is gone. It's not. Look at these price spikes that we're still seeing. Jewelry, groceries -- that's a big one -- natural gas, airfare, pet food, all of those prices continue to go up significantly. Now, the big question is, what is the Fed going to do? They face a very difficult balancing act. They did before these bank failures. They do more so, now because if they keep raising interest rates, the risk causing a recession. That's been the risk all along. But now they also have to worry about adding more stress to the banking system. They don't want to do that. At the same time, they can't just accept 6 percent inflation. They don't want that. And the jobs market -- outside of the tech sector, the jobs market remains pretty hot, uncomfortably hot if you're the Fed. So there's a lot of debate over whether or not the Fed is going to raise interest rates at next week's meeting or if they're just going to hold steady.",

And so it looks like the actions the government took, effectively saying, if your bank is in trouble, we will help out, you don't need to worry, well, folks, your viewers appear to have taken that message to heart. And that in itself is enough to create stability in the financial system. So it's working. And the best story of the day is the story of the stories not being written. We're not getting bad news.

You will definitely get your money. If you're running a business, and you have got more than that in the bank, the government has effectively said, not explicitly, but implicitly, we're going to guarantee your funds. So you're safe as well. Even more so, the big concern was contagion from one bank to others. If one person starts worrying, it causes others to worry. And what we're seeing today is folks just aren't worried because folks believe and trust that the government's response is going to be enough.

One job, one building is full of a whole lot of boffins whose job is to worry about financial stability. And they do things like making sure that the Fed can provide loans to banks that need them. There's a different set of boffins. Think about them as being in a different building. And their job is to worry about things like inflation and unemployment. And they use a different tool. They use the interest rate. So inflation remains a concern. The Fed definitely wants to keep fighting inflation. It has different tools to support the financial system. And, so far, those tools seem to be effective. So I don't expect to see a big feedback from financial instability to what the Fed does with interest rates. And so, if not at this meeting, although probably at this meeting, it's going to continue to raise rates until it can be a little more confident that it's got inflation under control.",

He is the White House and national security correspondent for \"The New York Times.\" All right, General, first off, I mean, just explain how significant this is. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  This is typical of shadowing and intercepts in Europe, Brianna, truthfully. What you see is, Russia does this all the time in international airspace, on top of international waters. Russia often considers the Black Sea their national lake, which is dead wrong. It doesn't apply that way. But you will see Russian aircraft continuously having these kinds of intercepts or shadows, but nothing like this. Airplanes get close. You certainly will see -- there have been years where there are over a couple of hundred of these kinds of things, incidents occurring every year. And it's normal procedures. But when you get this close, and you interfere with flight paths of other aircraft, either manned or unmanned, it's certainly not under international law. And it's certainly going to create quite a distraction in this campaign. But, as Oren just said, it's in western -- possibly in western Black Sea region to the west of the autonomous region of Crimea.

And that means that, fortunately, there are no casualties. But I'm sure that President Biden is going to be thinking that what he's trying to avoid here, of course, is an escalation with the Russians. Remember, his first goal in this war has been help the Ukrainians. His second goal in this war has been avoid escalation and anything that could lead to World War III. Now, we have had surveillance craft taken down before. The most famous case in modern times was a Chinese collision with a man American surveillance craft in international waters, as in this case. The Chinese pilot ended up being killed in that incident, and the Americans survived, but were taken captive for a while, eventually returned to the United States. This does not rise quite to that level, because it's unmanned. But it nonetheless tells you that the Russians are now willing to take more risks to push back on the American involvement in the war.

One of the big questions that Mark raises here and that you do as well is, what's the level of intention? In other words, did Putin himself order this? Did the Russian military order this? Was this a Russian pilot who saw an opportunity and was sort of acting on his own? We may not know that, or it may take us a while to go figure that out. My guess is that, right now, the administration will denounce it, but that you won't see them take a similar action. And the reason for that is pretty clear. Putin has until now been pretty cautious about keeping the war inside Ukrainian territory. There have been some cyberattacks on Poland. But other than that, there's really been no case we have seen where they have gone into NATO territory, where they have shelled that kind of territory.

And what I'd suggest is, contrary to what we were just talking about, yes, there's going to be a denouncement of this and a demarche issued by the United States. This was probably a big mistake by a Russian pilot, but I would bet, knowing USAFE, U.S. Air Force Europe, and also EUCOM, you're not going to see any drones flying alone. You may see a couple of aircraft intensifying -- U.S. aircraft, NATO aircraft intensifying their presence in the Black Sea area immediately.
