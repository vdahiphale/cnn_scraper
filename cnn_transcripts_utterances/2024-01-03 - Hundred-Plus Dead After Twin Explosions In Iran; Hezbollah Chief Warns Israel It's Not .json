Details on the two explosions there in just a moment. This coming on the same day that Hezbollah leader's response to a targeted killing in Beirut yesterday of a top Hamas commander, he's warning Israel that Hezbollah is not afraid of war. And a record immigration surge at the U.S. southern border. Right now, top Republican lawmakers are there to demand tough immigration policies. We'll bring you, of course, the very latest. But first, this evening, a day after an assassination in Beirut, a horrific attack in Iran is only fueling concerns about the stability of the entire region. Iranian state media say 103 people were killed in two explosions near the grave of top commander today. Nearly, 200 other people were wounded, huge crowds had gathered in Kerman to commemorate the death of Qasem Soleimani, who, if you remember, was killed in a U.S. drone strike four years ago. Meantime, the leader of Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon condemn that attack today. Hassan Nasrallah also called the assassination of a top Hamas deputy in Beirut, a major dangerous crime about which we cannot be silent. His words. Well, Tuesday's strike is widely blamed on Israel. U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Lebanon says it's deeply concerned about the potential for escalation, warning could have devastating consequences of people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border. Now, let's get more on all these trend, joined now by Nada Bashir, she's following the developments for us from Beirut this evening. And Nada, this twin bombing first of all in Iran is being described by authorities there as a terrorist attack, but as of yet, no group has claimed responsibility. What more are you learning this hour?",

We're also getting more details as they come at this stage. At least 103 people are said to have been killed, more than 180 injured, some said to be in a critical condition. We've seen that dramatic video emerging of crowds running away from those explosions of emergency services, responding -- taking those injured to nearby hospitals. And of course, this happened on a day marking four years since Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani was killed by U.S. strike, ordered by then-President, U.S. President Donald Trump -- Baghdad International Airport. And of course, we saw crowds gathering to pay their respects. Now, according to Iranian state media, that first blast was caused by a bomb in a suitcase in a car just about 700 meters away from the burial site of Qasem Soleimani, where people had been gathering to pay their respects. They believe this bomb was detonated remotely. A second blast going off just under a mile away from that location. According to Iran's Interior Minister speaking to a state broadcaster, it was that second blast that actually killed the majority of the fatalities as understood so far, many had been rushing to the scene to help those injured in that first explosion. Now, of course, no claim of responsibility just yet. We have heard from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who has taken to X, formerly known as Twitter to say that there will be a harsh response to those responsible for this attack, and of course, there is mounting speculation around the possible motives behind the attack, but who --",

The commander of the Quds Force of the IRGC who took over from Qasem Soleimani when he was killed in 2020, that he is already linking the incident today in Iran with the killing of an IRGC General around Christmas Day in Syria on through an airstrike near Damascus. Which he had inferred back then was an Israeli operation, an Israeli-U.S.- backed operation, and is making that link and distinction today to the events of today.

And he said we were moved by two imperatives: on the one, hand to support Gaza but also to take into consideration Lebanese realities. And this leads me to think that if there is a response -- and there will be a response -- that it will be relatively contained in the sense that it may be outside of the immediate border area. Because up to, now most of the fighting has taken place in the immediate border area. It may go beyond that. But at the same time I think he would - - that Hezbollah will try to end it there. I don't really feel that Nasrallah wants to provoke a wider conflict. I think he took a strategic decision since October not to carry Lebanon into a wider war that could spread to the region.

And I think, to a certain extent, Hezbollah wants to show that they are not going to remain idle while Israel goes -- pushes that far.

I think that the Americans have, over the weeks, madeincreasingly clear that they don't want to see a conflict in Lebanon because they very much fear that it could spread to the region. And Jake Sullivan was in Israel last week and he said that the way to resolve the issue of what comes after the end of fighting is through negotiations. So the Americans don't want a Lebanon war. And what is very interesting is that apparently the al-Arouri killing, at least if we are to believe what we read, was not -- there was no prior consultation between the Americans and Israelis. It seems like the Americans were virtually blindsided by the Israeli decision. So my belief is that given that Israel took the initiative here without telling the Americans, except at the last minute, they would also be less likely to push the envelope further with regard to the relationship with the United States, knowing very well that the Americans don't want a war. So this is maybe another ingredient that suggests that things may be contained.",
