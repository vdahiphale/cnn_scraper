Mayor Eric Adams has announced plans to build a new humanitarian relief center on Randall's Island to accommodate thousands of migrants. The center will provide on-site services like other relief sites across the country. The number of asylum seekers funneling into the city has reached nearly 100,000 since the start of the crisis with more than 57,000 currently seeking care.Meantime, the number of migrant families that the U.S. state of Texas has separated under its Republican governor has gone up. An immigration attorney says the number has now increased to 40 from 26 known cases last week. The separations come following a marked shift in the state's policy where it is arresting fathers for trespassing and then turning over mothers and children to U.S. immigration authorities for processing. The attorney also says that most of the separated families are from Venezuela and Colombia. And the controversy over how to deal with the influx of asylum seekers in the U.K. is growing more complicated. On Monday health experts warned of a possible risk of infection aboard a barge that's being used to house migrants. ITN's Carl Dinnen has more from Portland in southwest England.

And the Home Office said 20 people had refused to come here. That's more than have actually boarded the barge. CHERYL AVERY, U.K. HOME OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR ASYLUM ACCOMMODATION: So we successfully on-boarded the first cohort today, and there are 15 people on board. We have had a few challenges, but this is part of a long-going and structured process to bring a cohort of up to 500 people on board. DINNEN (voice-over): The first residents of the Bibbi Stockholm can expect to stay here for three to nine months.

Google, Salesforce, Amazon and the U.S. government are all saying we like the idea of people being there face- to-face. We like the synergy. We like the productivity that comes out of it. They're convinced that's better.Now a lot of workers are not so convinced, especially younger workers and those that who more highly educated. They are saying, look, we don't like commuting. 48 percent say that's one of the reasons they don't want to come into the office. It costs gas, it costs time, it costs money. They don't like paying extra child care. When you're home, they can take care of that -- 14 percent think that. 13 percent say that they are better able to focus. What is the difference here in what they want? Generally employers want 1.6 days at home per week. That's where the uptake .6 days. So basically, we are saying two days at home a week is enough. Workers want a little more than that. So basically three days at home per week. But workers have a really strong hand to play here right now because so many employers are still trying to find enough people. And interestingly, working from home one study found workers equate that to an 8 percent higher salary if they have the freedom to work from home a lot. So you can see for employers, yes, they want people back, but it's an uphill climb. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
