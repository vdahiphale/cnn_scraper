Tonight his own party is speaking out.And John King will be with us to break it all down. His top takeaways. Is Biden really in trouble? And news breaking this hour, there are new details on just how much legal trouble and debt Rudy Giuliani is facing as Trump tries to keep him close by throwing him a fundraiser tonight. Plus, China buying up more land in the United States. China setting up companies directly tied to communist party officials. So what is going on? It is a special report that you will see here first. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Biden wake-up call. A new CNN poll out today shows the president is at risk of losing the election if it were held today. The alarm tonight coming from his own party, the majority of which wants another candidate for president. Biden's fellow Democrats admitting tonight there is a problem. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JON TESTER (D-MT):  There's no doubt about it, the polls say what they say. SEN. MARK KELLY (D-AZ):  There's 14 months until an election, and there's a lot of work we have to do. SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV):  I think the people have spoken loud and clear. They're not happy with the two choices and only two choices. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They say he does not have the stamina and the sharpness. They say that he has not helped the economy, and a majority say he acted inappropriately regarding the investigation of his son Hunter.But what may be most worrisome for many Democrats is that in a head to head matchup, Biden and Trump right now are statistically tied despite what's going on with Trump legally. Biden isn't winning. It's not even -- you know, it's dead heat. In fact, Biden is statistically tied with all the Republican presidential candidates except for one, Nikki Haley, who is beating Biden. And we have a lot to get to tonight and the reaction from the political world has been swift as this came out. John King's OUTFRONT at the magic wall. And, John, you know, you've had time to kind of go through this, break it down, think about it. The numbers are striking. And as I pointed out, it's not just a headline number.

But he's been on the road for a couple of months talking up Bidenomics, so far, there's zero evidence he's breaking through.This is just Democrats and did Democratic leaning independents, right? The president's base. Two-thirds of them want a different candidate. 67 percent of Democrats and Democratic leading independents say we want a different candidate. We asked an open ended question, what's your biggest concern about Joe Biden as 2024 candidate? Look at that, it's stunning, Erin. These are Democrats and Democratic leaning voters, these are not Republicans. Half of them say he's too old. If you add up these other numbers, mental competence, health, effectiveness, risk of dying, not being able to serve a second term, that's 74 percent when you add all that up. Only 5 percent of Democrats and Democratic voters said they have no concerns at all.

You know, there are a lot of Democrats who say Donald Trump could never win again. If the election were tomorrow, Donald Trump would win again. This is a dead heat but Republicans have an enthusiasm gap right now. The Republicans have enthusiasm on their side right now. There's no question Donald Trump could win again today on paper, today, 424 days out. This is a dead heat. There's no clear leader. If you look at the weeds of the poll, if you go deep into the poll, there is no question Trump could win again. But to the -- look at it this way, Biden-Haley, she, as you know, the only Republican who beats him right now outside of the margin of error, right? So, how is she doing that? Look at these comparisons. Who have become a key part of the Democratic base in recent years? College graduates, especially white college graduates. They used to be Republicans. They live in the American suburbs, right? They have move over to the Democrats because they don't like Donald Trump. Joe Biden a 14-point edge among white college graduates. Remember that, plus 14. Look at him, the same group, white college graduates Nikki Haley, she beats him by seven points among white college graduates. She is digging deep clawing into the Democratic constituency, including in the American suburbs. Another quick one, Erin, for you among independents. This is how you win in a close election, right, you get independents, Joe Biden beats Donald Trump, what is that? That's nine points, right? By 47 to 38, but you bring Nikki Haley into the conversation, she is winning right now by five points among independents. The suburbs, college graduates, that's why Joe Biden is in the White House.

KATIE PORTER (D-CA):  President Biden has done a terrific job on the economy, and I think this is a matter of just people wanting to sort of dream up what they could imagine for different kinds of candidate at this point, but the truth is Joe Biden has a terrific story to tell on the economy. He's not getting a ton of help telling it, I think, and that's part of one of the things that I hear during my Senate campaign is people want to hear about what he's done. They also want to hear about what he's still going to do. And if you think back to his big signature legislation, the things that got knocked out of it, the cost of child care, bringing down the cost of housing, two free years of community college, I think what voters are signaling is they want those problems tackled, and they still see the work ahead.

That responsibility has fallen to his son, Andrew Giuliani, who is close to Trump and Giuliani's former lawyer, Rob Costello. He went down with Giuliani in the spring, we wrote about this in our story, to ask Trump for money. But learned Costello did almost all of the talking. Giuliani currently owes Costello about $1.4 million. Tonight might help a little with that. It's interesting, around the former president there's a split among his advisers. Some people say, look, you don't have to help him. You can even cut him loose. Others are insisting that, yes, you do need to help him. Look what he's done for you. All of his work in recent years has been for you. He has lost a great deal of his reputation based on that work. One of his associates estimates he has lost between $10 million and $20 million in consulting fees based to the damage of his reputation because of this relationship. But, look, they are hanging out.
