He's on the plane right now, we understand. This is despite \"Politico\" reporting this morning that Musk might be wearing out his welcome. Sure doesn't look like that. At least not this morning. So, Trump will visit the White House at the invitation of President Biden. An invitation that we noted was not extended four years ago. And that's a vast understatement. We're also standing by to see who Senate Republicans will pick as their new leader. That vote could happen any minute. Our Laruen Fox is on Capitol Hill.

He's going to be now shortly giving that mantle to another top Republican.It's really unclear right now who is going to win this race. You have John Thune, John Cornyn, as well as Rick Scott, who's gotten this late surge in MAGA support. But I was talking to members just a few minutes ago who say that they are still undecided. Some of them say that they just don't want to publicly say who they are voting for. That's because this is a secret ballot election. Just around the corner from where I'm standing right now, in just a few minutes, senators will go into the old Senate chamber, they will hear the nominating speeches for each of these nominees. There will be some discussion. Then they will vote. When they vote, it is all secret ballot. That means no one, not their staff, not their fellow colleagues, not even Donald Trump will know who they supported in this election. At that point, the votes will be tabulated. If none of the candidates has gotten a majority, which today that magic number is 27, if none of them have gotten a majority, then the lowest vote getter will drop out and they will vote again. Obviously, John, this could take some time because it's been nearly two decades since Republicans had a three-way contested GOP leadership race. Mitch McConnell has held this post for 18 years. So, a really significant transfer of power that we could see today on Capitol Hill. But again, we are just a few feet away from where Mitch McConnell gives his weekly press conference as the Republican leader each and every week. John.",

But also, it kind of can represent maybe something of a signal whoever comes out on top of kind of what's going to be the prevailing force for the Senate Republican kind of agenda, and also the Republican Party. BASH: Yes. Yes, which is why Rick Scott has a ton of support from people in and around Donald Trump. It is noteworthy that Donald Trump himself has not weighed in, put his sort of thumb on the scale. Perhaps that is because if Rick Scott doesn't win, he doesn't want to have egg on his face. But nonetheless, I've talked to a Republican senator this morning who said that the calls coming in from people who listen to and watch Tucker Carlson, its intense. And so there is really big lobbying going on for the Trump orbit pick, if it's not Trump himself, and that is Rick Scott. The thing to keep in mind is that this is a secret ballot. So, we're not going to know unless these senators want to tell us who they voted for. And that is really, really a key thing to remember.

And it was going to happen in the way that it did. So, it just - having just been an observer of Donald Trump, as so many of us have for so many years, he clearly enjoys having Elon Musk around, enjoys having the power of his platform.

And I can't find one because if you think about the - never mind the numbers of the Republicans in the Senate and the House eight years ago, it's the makeup of the Senate and the House. There's - there are no more Adam Kinzingers in the House. I mean there are a few, but not many. In the United States Senate, I mean, name your Senate seat, and we can give probably an example of somebody who didn't like Donald Trump, didn't support Donald Trump, tried to push back against Donald Trump within his own party, who has retired and been replaced with a complete and total Trump supporter.I mean, Rob Portman, for example, in Ohio. He retired. J.D. Vance is in his seat. He is, obviously, going to be vice president. But there's no question that whomever is picked is going to be of that ilk. And you can go on and on and on down the line when you look at the sort of makeup of the Republican conference in the Senate and the House.

Again, the other part of this will be the other detail that needs to be worked out is whether he needs to submit this report to the intelligence community. That's usually a part of this.

President Biden inviting his predecessor and the incoming president, Donald Trump, back to the White House four years after Donald Trump declined to extend that same courtesy to then- incoming President Joe Biden.It's clear that President Biden and the offenses that are working for him are very set on sending the message to the country that this election was fair, and that there now needs to be a focus on a peaceful transfer of power. It is also just going to be a rare opportunity, and perhaps the only opportunity for President Biden, to press some issues that are important to him, to the incoming president. For example, we've heard National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan saying that he is set on talking to the incoming president about the importance of the U.S. continuing to support Ukraine's war efforts. We, of course, don't know what effect, if any, those kinds of pleas will have on the incoming president. As for the mood here, Kate, at the White House, obviously this comes at a moment when emotions are running high. A lot of White House staff, aides who work for the president, were very much disappointed and stunned for some by the election results. They are still processing that. But according to the folks in the building here that I have talked to, they are trying to basically take their cues from President Biden, who, again, has made clear that he is focused on the business of the peaceful transfer of power. So, some of the folks that I've talked to, they are saying that they are set on treating this as any other busy day here at the White House. Now, as for the president himself, we actually haven't seen him very much out in public since Election Day. And I am told by one senior Democrat that he is quite sensitive to, and aware of, the finger pointing that is going on and the fact that he is actually getting a lot of the blame for what happened last week, and that he is not happy about that, and he doesn't think that that criticism has been fair.
