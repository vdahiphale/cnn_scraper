He wanted a concrete plan for how and when he would join NATO, that Ukraine would join NATO, and he's not getting that.So, what is he getting? Well, he's getting firmer language that Ukraine will one day join NATO. They were promised that, essentially, back in 2008 under what's called the Bucharest Agreement. Now, in this latest communique, which is an agreement among the 31 NATO allies, there is strong language that, quote, Ukraine's future is in NATO. But it is still rather vague, John. NATO has also streamlined the process. They made it easier for Ukraine to join. They've reduced the steps from two to one. They've removed what's called the membership action plan to make it easier for Ukraine to eventually join. And then we also heard from Ukraine's defense minister saying that -- sorry, I'm getting some feedback -- that there will be what he called an F-16 coalition, an agreement of 11 countries to train Ukrainian pilots on F-16s. But, John, this disappointment comes at a very critical time when Ukraine is trying to make advances, making slow progress in this counteroffensive. But there is evidence that there was a real punch at Russia today. There were missile strikes on the southern occupied city of period Berdyansk and there are reports from both Ukrainian and Russian sides that a top Russian general named Lieutenant General Oleg Tsokov, that he was killed at a military headquarters by a Ukrainian strike. He would be the most senior general to-date killed in the Ukrainian campaign, removing one of the most senior generals from the battlefield, one of the most experienced generals from the battlefield, and he would be the latest in a long list of Russian generals who have been killed in this campaign.

We're joined by the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Gregory Meeks from New York. Congressman, grateful for your time tonight. NATO says Ukraine can come in, quote, when allies agree and the conditions are met, but what's awfully vague. As you know, President Zelenskyy wants a commitment now. He wanted it yesterday, in fact, that NATO allies say, you can't bring them in now, because then NATO is at war with Russia. President Zelenskyy says the delay helps Russia. Who's right? What should happen here? REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY):  Well, I think you're going to hear President Zelenskyy thanking the United States and thanking the NATO allies for supporting him. What's most important right now is winning the war and utilizing and making sure that the weapons that we're giving to them for the counteroffensive are there when needed. And I think that that's what the United States and President Biden have done. And each time and each phase in the war, when there is something that is needed, we have been able to provide it. And we know that to win the counteroffensive and thereby get the land back, Ukrainian sovereignty back, protect the Ukrainian people who are now devastated by Putin's criminal and illegal war, the best thing to do is to make sure they have the munitions that are needed so that they can have their counteroffensive and moving forward. And notice counteroffensive now, they need more ammunition. We're going to make sure that happens. The F-16s and training of the pilots, which will come thereafter, we're going to make sure that happens. So, I think you'll hear president Zelenskyy -- yes, does he want to be in NATO? Absolutely. And, yes, are we setting a path for him to do that? Absolutely, just that there's got to be some reforms that are made and at the appropriate time. But there's no -- I don't think that you will see any separation, any disunity. I think that the NATO alliance is stronger than ever before because of President Biden and how he has conducted this multilateral effort to make sure that Putin's invasion of the sovereignty of Ukraine is stopped.",

Because if NATO -- if Ukraine was into NATO today or tomorrow, then Article 5 would be involved and we would all be at war with Russia. That's not how we started. We've always talked about what we'd do once this war is won, once Ukraine has gotten all of its sovereign territory back. Then the appropriate time is to work, finish up. As indicated in your previous interview, steps have been taken already to reduce those numbers from two to one and there're other things that are being done that's basically really unprecedented, John, as far as folks' entry into NATO. And so we've got to make sure that those reforms are done and then there would not be a problem, and hopefully when the 75th anniversary of the unity, the summit is going to take place in the United States in 2024 occurs, that might be the way and the time because we will push back Vladimir Putin out of Ukrainian territory and celebrating Ukraine's winning its freedom back and thereby taking and making sure the reforms necessary were taken so they can become members, strong members of NATO, strengthening the NATO unity.",

That is very and significantly important to me. And so -- but so far, so good.

This is the first hearing before her really discussing some of the classified documents issues that obviously are part of this case, John. And maybe we'll get a little bit of a hint as to where her mind is at as to how quickly we can get it to a trial.We know that the special counsel is asking for a December trial date. Of course, the Trump team has now said, don't set a trial date at all, Judge, because there's so many things to litigate, including, of course, are these documents even classified, whether the special counsel is actually legal, and whether he is capable of bringing these charges. A lot of things are going to be litigated over the next period of months, which may necessitate a long, long delay of this trial. But one of the things that really comes across from this is they're playing both a legal game and a political game. I'll read you just a part of the filing from the Trump team. It says, this extraordinary case presents a serious challenge to both the fact and perception of our American democracy. The court now presides over prosecution in advance by the administration of a sitting president against his chief political rival, himself a leading candidate for presidency of the United States. They also write essentially that they don't know whether the former president can get a fair trial, John, because the outcome of this trial could have an impact on the election. So, for all of those reasons, they say, Judge, don't set a trial date, let us litigate some of these things that we have to go on. And, look, to be fair to the Trump Team, they are right, that there's a lot of complicated things that are likely going to have to go perhaps all the way to the Supreme Court before we can even get to a trial date. So, even if Judge Cannon decides to pick a date out of thin air, she may have to push that date forward, past that --",

And, yes, it would still be politically fraught even if it was charged after the election. And, yes, there's ways you can make sure that you vet your jury.

It's really a question of scheduling for her.

He said he that didn't happen. But he did say that he do so because he was concerned that Republicans and conservatives were being painted with a broad brush as being racist. And, ultimately, he said all white nationalists are racist. Now, when I asked the Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, about Tommy Tuberville dancing around this issue earlier today, he made clear that he disagreed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But the United States Senate gives any individual senator the power to hold up nominations, slow down the process, forcing the leadership, the Senate majority leader, to try to take time-consuming steps to overcome those holes.Now, this comes as the Pentagon itself is trying to ratchet up pressure on Tuberville, trying to use backchannel communications with senators, trying to lean on Tuberville himself and raise concerns about the impact this hold could have on military families. But, John, in talking to a number of Republican senators, they agree, a lot of them do, with Tuberville's approach. He is demanding the Pentagon change its policy to provide reimbursements for any individuals getting abortion services, military personnel getting abortion services. They say that the Pentagon should drop that policy. So, he does have a fair amount of support among Senate Republicans. But one person who does not support this, though, John, is Mitch McConnell, who has publicly said he opposes Tuberville's hold on all these military nominees. But Tuberville told me, John, that Mitch McConnell has not pressured him internally, not leaned on him, urged him to drop the whole.

And that's what seems to be at play here with Senator Tuberville. He, I think, seems to have walked back -- I don't think he said it on camera yet -- that all white nationalists are racists. Last night, he seemed to suggest that white nationalists are people who get a bad rap from Democrats as sort of misunderstood white people.

And I think that's what the bigger concern is, is not only is he refusing to condemn white nationalism, which is itself kind of a new way of describing the effects of white supremacy on politics, but he's not even choosing to confront these realities. So, by avoiding even accepting the definition of white nationalism -- and we've seen that particularly from Republicans. They've refused to confront the true definition of Christian nationalism and its impact on American politics. We seen that with white supremacy. We see that with white nationalism. So, if you won't even accept the definition, then you definitely can't take the next step as to really being honest about its impact in society, its impact in politics, and the fact that people like Donald Trump have curried favor with white nationalists. And that's part of the coalition he built that helped him become president. If you don't want to confront those realities, then perhaps you refuse to even accept the definition.",

Now, protests have been going on here for months against the government's plan to completely overhaul the judiciary. But the reason that they've been particularly amped up now is because of legislation that was passed Monday night. It's the first of three readings on just one aspect of this massive judicial overhaul, this particular legislation has to do with stripping the Supreme Court's ability of declaring government actions unreasonable. But it almost doesn't matter what the legislative steps were. It's just the fact that the legislation is back on the table because they had actually been frozen for several months after those massive general strikes and protests, and the defense minister coming out against the overhaul back in March. There were some attempts at compromised negotiations with the opposition. But those have clearly gone nowhere. The coalition government led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are now pushing forward once again with this legislation. It'd going to be done in a slower, more piecemeal fashion. But for these protesters, they essentially don't believe anything that comes out of Benjamin Netanyahu or the coalition government's mouth when they say that even partial legislation has been softened, watered down. These protesters and the opposition want the judicial overhaul essentially completely off the table. They say they will continue coming out to the streets and continue protesting. Now, the government and Benjamin Netanyahu say the judiciary desperately needs some sort of reform. They say they've won the election. They have the votes in parliament to make this happen. But the protesters here, the opposition, and even some of Israel's biggest allies like the United States have expressed grave concern about what exactly this reform will do. And these protesters, they say they will continue coming out. Some even said they plan to pitch tents in downtown Tel Aviv to make their protests even more permanent.
