Nearly 48 hours after Israeli forces raided Al-Shifa hospital, these are the first images of what the Israeli military says is an operational tunnel shaft on the grounds of the hospital complex. CNN cannot independently verify those claims, but using this frame, CNN has geolocated this video to the Al-Shifa complex, about 30 meters away from one of the hospital's main buildings. REAR ADM.

He put it in place after Trump had made baseless claims about his law clerk on social media and then extended it to Trump's attorneys after they raised questions about communications the judge was having with that same law clerk who sits just a few feet from him on the bench. So, the judge in the case had also sanctioned Trump $15,000 for violating that gag order, but now after this appellate court judge stepped in, Trump is free to say whatever he wants about this case. Now, Trump's attorney, Chris Kise, said this after the hearing, fortunately, the Constitution and the First Amendment protect everyone, including President Trump.

He actually also ran for re-election and was not elected and he was not voted to be expelled. Lawmakers are very loath to kick people out if they are not convicted for a crime.What's interesting about this report, though, is it's so specific, not just about Botox and some of this other sort of funnier stuff, but about him manipulating and lying to donors, and that's a no-no. You're tapping into the pool of everyone else and messing with everybody's money and I think that that's something lawmakers really don't like in the party. And it was showing that he was double dealing with the loans, et cetera, but he was also using the fact that he was in Congress to continue to reach out and continue with some of those manipulations.",

And we hear the same. We heard that amputation of legs are done without anesthesia. A caesarean section for a pregnant woman was done without anesthesia because of lack of medication and the necessity and urgency to do these operations. As well, there is no protection for these operations by antibiotics, as it should be in such cases. And, therefore, the situation is really very difficult and very horrific.",

Out of these hospitals, there are 26 hospitals are not in service now because of the bombardment of the occupying power to the -- some of the hospitals, or because there is lack of fuel and medical supplies and medicines. Now, when we say 26 hospitals are not operating, this means the majority of the hospitals, nine hospitals, are left and they are the most of them, they are in the south, functioning.

The Pelosi family is very proud of their Pop, who demonstrated extraordinary composure and courage on the night of the attack a year ago, and in the courtroom this week. We do have video of the attack on Paul Pelosi. It is disturbing. During his testimony this week, he said that last year has been incredibly trying. He had to re-learn how to walk.
