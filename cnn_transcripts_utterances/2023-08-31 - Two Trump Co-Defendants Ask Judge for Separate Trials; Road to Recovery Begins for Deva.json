This morning, two of Donald Trump's co-defendants in the Georgia election subversion case want separate trials. Former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell and pro-Trump lawyer Kenneth Cheseboro are asking a Fulton County judge to sever their cases. Both have denied any wrongdoing and have already invoked their rights to a speedy trial. For Cheseboro, the judge has already set a trial start date of October 23rd. No date has been set yet for Powell. Now, Trump's team opposes this quick timeline. They want to delay. They say they want to sever his case as well, though no motion has yet been filed. Let's bring in CNN's Katelyn Polantz, who has the details? So, Katelyn, why the argument for separate trials?",

They want to be looked at by the jury separately from the other defendants. And that a lot of the accusations that are being levied against them are not things that pertain to them. So, in this racketeering conspiracy, there's 160 overt acts. Sidney Powell is saying she only knew about some of them, that she wants to be tried on and contest that those would be crimes. So, she doesn't want to be lumped in with the rest of the case. Ken Cheseboro is making a similar argument. And so they're seeking distance. Whether that's going to be successful is a big question.

And what they filed yesterday was some additional material in trying to get the judge to say, we don't even need to go to trial. We can rule on this case just on these documents.And so they're saying that over this ten-year decade, that every year in these financial statements, the former president inflated his net worth. They said that ranged anywhere from $812 million in one year to as much as $2.2 billion. And that was in 2014 alone. They also were saying that this big question has always been how much is Donald Trump really worth. And so they try to answer this, and they do the math based on their own appraisers, their own experts. They say that Mr. Trump's net worth in any year between 2011 and 2021 would be no more than $2.6 billion, rather than the stated net worth of up to $6.1 billion, and likely considerably less if his properties were actually valued in a full blown professional appraisal. So, they're saying that the former president saying in these statements, at least two of the years, he was worth $6.1 billion, some of these other years, $4 billion. They're saying it was really only $2.6 billion. Now, Trump's lawyers, they say these financial statements are not inaccurate. No one lost any money. In fact, the banks made millions of dollars in interest, and they want the judge to rule in their favor. We're not expecting the judge to rule until late September, and this is scheduled to go to trial October 2nd.",

And everyone gets to pick their own jury. Everyone gets to, you know, with their own reasons to allude (ph) jurors. Everyone gets to cross examine every witness. The trial could last a year.

It is just gone. Where is it, you may ask? It is over here, a couple of dozen yards away. We went inside this home yesterday evening and want to give you some looks. We do have permission to be here, a great guy named Lin (ph). This is his family home. He has retired here. He's a fishing guide in this town. He's a retired Army veteran, disabled, and he says this has been in the family. This means a lot to him. He just repaired it after past storms. Now, he can't live in it. He's right now trying to negotiate with the insurance adjusters, trying to get some help right now throughout this terrible situation. And this is just one of hundreds of stories that we could tell you about here in Horseshoe Beach. I want to show you this home. This is our friend, Ms. Hope, over here. We met her yesterday. I think she's the unofficial mayor of the town here. We love you. We love you. We're glad that you're doing well. She's holding a lot of people here together. And if you don't mind, we're going to show everyone what it's like inside here. So, she is also a fishing captain here, and she runs part of a short-term rental in this house. So, she lost her income from that. She lost her income from fishing. And she doesn't know if she's going to be able to get insurance because of the storm surge. I want to show you what used to be her home right here. This was the game room. She challenged us to a game of pool. I don't think that's going to be the best scenario right now, but certainly just an ugly situation. She slept here last night, obviously doesn't have electricity. Cell phone service is really spotty here, and there's just not a lot of resources. People in Horseshoe Beach say, we're looking for help, we're asking for help. Anybody that can come and pitch in, it will be greatly appreciated. And I just want to give you one more tidbit of information about Hope and her neighbors here in Horseshoe Beach. They're truly incredible.

This is the first time that Clarence Thomas himself, after many, many years of travel with Harlan Crow, is actually disclosing it on the report. And, as you say, there were two private jet trips to events in Dallas, Texas, and then another one to a place where he's vacationed with Harlan Crow many, many years up in the Adirondacks, a very expensive estate where Clarence Thomas has summered. These things were all first reported by ProPublica, but this is in a report in April that showed lots of really lavish travel that the justice had taken, but this is the first time he's actually putting it on the forms. And, again, it takes place against the backdrop of new scrutiny of the Supreme Court justices, their lack of transparency and lack of a formal ethics code for us, Boris. And let me just tell you one other thing we got today, in addition to these reports that I want to add at this first part, Boris, is what Clarence Thomas' lawyer said about this filing. He said, the attacks on Justice Thomas are nothing less than ridiculous and dangerous, and they set a terrible precedent for political blood sport through federal ethics filings. His lawyer said that Clarence Thomas has always tried to be upfront about what he had to file, and it's just that he now knows more about what he should file. And in actuality, Boris, there had been some confusion in the rules about personal hospitality of the kind that Harlan Crow had given Clarence Thomas, but many ethics experts say that private jet travel, yacht travel, which Clarence Thomas has also enjoyed with Harlan Crow, that that should have always been reported, Boris.",

What we got on the Sam Alito report was just a lot of extensive travel for speeches that he gave, including a very provocative speech that he had given in Rome right after the Dobbs decision that reversed Roe v. Wade. So, a lot of this arises in that context also. And one other thing I would mention is that what Clarence Thomas himself put on his form about one of the private jet trips he took on Harlan Crow's dime, it came in May of 2022, just about a week after the Dobbs leak, the leak of the decision reversing Roe v. Wade. He said that he had been advised to start taking private travel rather than commercial because of safety concerns. Now, again, that's the first time he has put that in writing, and we've -- you know, the first time we're seeing that assertion. We're not sure if all the justices are now suddenly taking more private travel than commercial because of those kinds of security concerns, Boris.",

Thomas does make a number of 2022 disclosures, and he discloses an older real estate transaction involving Harlan Crow.But there are many more trips, luxury travel, yacht trips, visits to Crow's properties, payment of a family member's tuition, those are not disclosed in here. There's a footnote saying he's still working on it. Most ethics experts believe that those disclosures were required. There is a debate about it. Some of them, particularly the luxury private travel, I think were pretty clearly required to be disclosed years and years ago. So, it points to -- and then Alito has a much skimpier ethics report where he doesn't, for example, get into a luxury fishing trip he took years ago that has come under scrutiny. So, it does speak to the issue that Boris was asking Joan about. How is it possible that we do not have a code of ethics that is binding upon the highest court in the land? I can tell you when I was doing ethics in the Obama White House for the former president and his administration, not only would I have required anything like this to be disclosed, I wouldn't have allowed it in the first place. Harlan Crow has had a case with interest before the court, and he has ideological interest as a prominent conservative. So, there is an ethics crisis at the court. SANCHEZ:  Norm, on the question of trying to enforce ethics within the Supreme Court, I spoke with Senator Mazie Hirono last month, who put forward a bill essentially saying that Congress could come up with ethics rules for the court. But in speaking to legal experts, there's a lot of disagreement. They essentially say that the Constitution doesn't allow for that kind of oversight to come from Congress over the judicial branch.

No less an authority than liberal members of the court have said that they believe there's ethics authority here for regulation. Now, the conservative wing disagrees, and that is particularly the case with Justice Alito, who's been one of the most outspoken about this, even taking to the pages, very unusual, taking to the pages of The Wall Street Journal to defend his ethics.
