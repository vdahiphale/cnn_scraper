So it's interesting, because it's a little bit late in the game, later than you would expect someone like Jack Smith's office to be talking to someone like Raffensperger, who had such a public role in some ways in Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, Brianna.",

It's a statement of the actual defendant, right? So that's an exception you can actually use, but how it comes in to be able to support the underlying case. Everything you have ever said in your entire life or every document you want to get in doesn't always come in. The judge has a lot of power in trying to decide through the motion practice what's going to come in and what's not going to come in. And so that's really the underlying issue here.

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, as the sort of narrative propaganda gears of the Kremlin finally, after two-and-a-half days of relative silence, kick into gear, we're hearing a bizarre series of explanations and narrative from Vladimir Putin, repeatedly in front of troops telling land forces that, frankly, on Saturday barely seemed to get in the way of advancing Wagner troops that they indeed, in fact, had saved the nation, has saved it from civil war.Going on to say that Yevgeny Prigozhin had, despite his Wagner operation, long for years being something Moscow said it had nothing to do with, that, in fact, Wagner had over the last year alone got over a billion dollars of state money, a bizarre self-own, frankly, from the Russian president. That's his narrative. Hard to see who in Russia will be buying it. But then we have a much more colorful, frankly, expletive-laden, it seems, at times, rant from the Russian -- sorry -- the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, a man that often is held in disregard by Vladimir Putin as a subordinate. But, today, he at great length explained, it seems, according to him, seminal role in stopping the events on Saturday. He says he had a 30- minute-plus phone call initially with the Yevgeny Prigozhin, during which he said the mercenary boss used 10 times more expletives than normal words. And then, over a series of phone calls, during which he said, look, if you keep going to Moscow, you will be crushed like a bug, he eventually persuaded Prigozhin to move to Belarus under his protection, for safety, and to bring some of his fighters there as well. Lukashenko casting himself very much as the hero here. Some of this is pretty believable, frankly. It's been echoed by the Kremlin, echoed by Prigozhin himself. Importantly too, yes, as you said, Lukashenko says that Prigozhin is now in Belarus. We haven't had that confirmed by Prigozhin himself. But, wow, what an extraordinary end to all of this, Vladimir Putin speaking of a parallel reality, in which the military stepped forward and saved the Russian people from a revolt, where, frankly, it appears to be the president of neighboring Belarus who, in fact, got in the way here and calmed things down. And Prigozhin, while a headache for Vladimir Putin, but one that's been transferred just across the border to Belarus, and it does appear he won't be prosecuted and his fighters may even get to join him and continue being part of Wagner there, a bizarre end to a very dangerous weekend for the Russian head of state -- Brianna.",

Joining me now, Seth Jones, director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and retired Army Colonel Liam Collins.Good to have you both on. Seth, I'm curious what you think happens from here. And I want to first play the thoughts of Bill Browder, who, of course, I'm sure you know, helped pass the sanctions law against Putin allies, also has become a target himself of Putin. Have a listen, and I want to get your reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL BROWDER, PUTIN CRITIC:  In my opinion, the only way that Putin can stay in power is for him to reassert his authority. And the only way he can do that is to become extremely aggressive, dangerous and violent towards all sorts of people who he doesn't believe are loyal to him. And so I think there's going to be a huge sort of purge, crackdown, whatever you want to call it, of the elite, of the government, of the military, and of the oligarchs for Putin to reestablish his authority.

So, if there's going to be a bloodbath and a reckoning, it is likely to be global in nature, in part because Wagner's tentacles are actually much bigger than just Russia itself. It also would be a huge gamble for Putin, because he may actually undermine power even more if that's the direction he goes.",
