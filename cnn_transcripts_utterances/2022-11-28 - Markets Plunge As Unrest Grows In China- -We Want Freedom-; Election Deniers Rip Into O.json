Is a brutal crackdown coming? We're live in Beijing tonight.Plus, election deniers lining up one by one to rip in to Republican officials, calling them traitors and criminals, saying they should be punished by death for certifying a state's election. And an OUTFRONT exclusive tonight, hear from a Russian woman standing up against Putin's war, and now leading the charge to demand Russia pull out of Ukraine. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, markets plunge worldwide. The reason, widespread protests in China against Xi Jinping's COVID lockdowns, sparking fear across the world, sending stocks lower in Europe, in Asia, and Wall Street, where the Dow sank 500 points this afternoon. The uprisings in cities across China are on a scale not seen since the at the Tiananmen Square protests. Right on your screen, you are seeing just six of the nearly dozen cities across China we know are facing mass protests. This is what we know on this map, right? There could be even more because obviously it is difficult to get a lot of information. But this is what we know of. These are mass protests coast to coast. Today, a reporter from \"Reuters\" asked a Chinese official about whether the protest would impact Xi Jinping's zero COVID policy. The answer coming off as a bizarre denial that a problem even exists. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Right now, the country is seeing its highest level of COVID infections since the pandemic began.And as for the Chinese people, they're showing leadership right now by hitting the streets. In Shanghai, one of China's biggest and richest cities, the financial capital of the country, thousands came out despite the risk of arrest. The crowds chanting, quote, no PCR tests, we want freedom. Just look at those people on your screen. The response brutal force, dramatic images of police dragging away men and women. These are images that protesters have been able to get -- upload so we can actually see them. And in the Chinese capital Beijing where Xi Jinping lives, the crowd is chanting, quote, we don't want lockdowns, we want freedom. And something you may have noticed in these pictures is the people holding up just blank sheets of paper. That in and of itself is now a new way of protesting. They're doing that to make a point. You can't accuse us of writing or displaying a message that is deemed illegal. We're just holding a blank piece of paper. In fact, the blank piece is now reportedly being censored by the Chinese government. The words blank sheet of paper and white paper are now being filtered from search results in China. Think about that. And on Twitter, when people in China are searching for protests, what they get is spam and porn. Officials are going into overdrive to censor what the Chinese are seeing. It is really incredible to think about this. Because, frankly, people in China are seeing a lot because they're actually living through what we have been showing you for months out front. A desperate mother under lockdown jumping to her death from her 12-floor balcony. They hear and see people starving. They hear the screams for food and medicine right from their windows. Armed Chinese workers locking down airports, leaving passengers stranded. Well, tonight, the White House is weighing in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, he has suddenly these demonstrations, some of which are even calling for his ouster.There's no chance he's going to allow that for persist for weeks on end. I think there'll be carrot and stick. There will be some local officials that will be removed for a poor implementation of zero COVID. They will probably be loosening in the way that zero COVID is actually laid out and policed, compared to what we have seen over the past weeks and months.

They follow people like Kari Lake, who encourages this garbage. Things were not helped by the fact that the Maricopa County election office did screw up with these printers on these ballots that just fed this untrue narrative. But that was a small mistake, it was rectified, no one was disenfranchised. And one of the things I take heart with -- take heart about is that this is only really happening now in Arizona. The 2022 midterms put a really bad odor on a lot of the election denial stuff.

In the state of Georgia, if you're a Democrat, because there are more self-identified Republicans than Democrats, you need to win independents. If you're a Republican and you're able to keep the loss among independents to a minimum, or win, in the case that Brian Kemp did, you're able to in fact win in the state of Georgia.
