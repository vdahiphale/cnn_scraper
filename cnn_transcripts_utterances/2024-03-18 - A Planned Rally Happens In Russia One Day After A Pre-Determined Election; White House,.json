So, as these residents, the lucky ones, Americans, have been able to flee and come back to the U.S., obviously I'm sure you'll be speaking with them and getting their stories, but I want you to respond to what I was really struck by one doctor saying. He said, we often say in Haiti that in Port-au-Prince it's like we are in a boat. There's no captain, no direction, and we the people are inside it, and we don't know where we are going and what can be done to save us. You couple this with the fact that 80 percent of the capital is controlled by gangs. There's a lot of concern that up to one million people can face famine. Hospitals are shutting down quickly. Describe to us the dire situation on the ground there now. JACQUELINE CHARLES, CARRIBEAN CORRESPONDENT, \"MIAMI HERALD\": Well, it really is dire because something as basic as potable water is now becoming a luxury. Imagine somebody who has to have dialysis treatment, and they can't do it. I mean, people's lives are feeling like it just doesn't matter. And, you know, the people that I talk to every day are saying, it's health coming. When is it going to come? Are we just going to be left to die standing? The police are doing what they can. But yesterday, I was talking to an official in the police, you know, and he said, listen, we're on our last line here. We have to remember, you know, these are human beings.

Obviously, it is very difficult to hold any kind of political process, any kind of political vote in this kind of environment. But walk us through the next steps on that front. Well, we have to first deal with the security issue. I mean, this morning we had reports that there were armed gunmen who had flooded, you know, the hills from house to house. And so, you're going to name a presidential council. But what sort of security is going to be provided to these individuals? And that's their top concern right now in terms of who is going to secure us. The next job, you know, if they decide to go ahead with this, will be, you know, how are they going to operate? Who's going to be the president? Is it a vote by majority? And you have to find a prime minister to replace Ariel Henry, because under Haitian constitution, you need to have continuity.

But let's just look at the numbers. You have a police force, less than 9000. You have a country of 12 million people. Not all of them are in Port-au-Prince. And you only have a couple of hundred specialized police officers involved in anti-gang operations. On Friday, the police melted an operation in the lower part of Port-au-Prince in Delmas. They went in. They destroyed a lot of the buildings. They got in a shootout with the gang members, with barbecue. But if the police -- are they able to hold that? That's been a challenge, that when they go in and they take control of an area that's under gang control, their numbers and all of the things that are unfolding, the violence, doesn't allow the police to stay there and that they need some more bodies to hold control, because what we've seen with these coordinated attacks is that the gangs united. And so, you've got violence escalating everywhere all around Port-au- Prince. It's not just in one location. That has been the saving grace until now, that these have been isolated incidents of volatility. Now what you have is a volatile situation throughout the capital.

He's saying it is, as you said, you know, impossible from a practical standpoint. They've approached 30 brokers to try to get them to support this finding, and they said that no one is able to, that of the brokers, some of the largest ones in the world, that a lot of them have internal limits that won't allow them to post more than $100 million. And then even those that could, they won't accept anything but cash or stock, something that can quickly be turned into cash. So, they're not willing to accept any of his real estate properties, and that is what Trump's attorney has said has been one of the major obstacles in being able to secure a bond. So, Trump's team has asked the judges and the appeals court to allow them to continue to appeal without allowing the New York Attorney General's Office to enforce the judgment because they're saying, we have the properties, they know we have the properties, they can collect that at the end if we lose this appeal. And the New York Attorney General's Office has opposed this. We expect the Appeals Court to make a decision on this by the end of this month.

Now, what will this mean for users? Users will now start to see a label on videos disclosing when that video contains A.I.-generated content. In most cases, that label will be in the description of the video, but for certain potentially sensitive topics, including politics, there'll be a more prominent label actually on the video player. Now, this is, of course, an effort by YouTube to address the concerns that the proliferation of A.I.-generated content in these generative A.I. tools that have made it so easy and widely accessible to create this kind of content.

Now, there is this sort of disagreement in the A.I. world about whether or not it's actually good to open source this technology and make it so that anybody can review it. On one hand, you have proponents like Elon Musk who say that that will make the technology more transparent.
