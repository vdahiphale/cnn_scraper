One of the questions was, how was it that Vladimir Putin, given his record of dealing ruthlessly with his critics, allowed Prigozhin to live? How come he allowed him to go into exile in Belarus and maintain control over the Wagner mercenary group that he runs? I mean, look, I don't want to get into cliches, but clearly the leader believes revenge is best served cold. I'm not suggesting for a second, at this point, that the Kremlin had anything to do with the downing of this aircraft. But it's highly suspicion that that aircraft carrying 10 people, not just Yevgeny Prigozhin but other senior officials as well, has now officially crashed.",

And to your point, enormous influence in the Russian military and in the Russian military's primary operation right now, which is, of course, the invasion of Ukraine.Much of those Wagner forces left in recent months. They played a major role in the fighting of Bakhmut. But going back, the reason he's called Putin's chef is not because he was his private chef, but because he had some of the biggest military contracts in that country, including feeding the troops. But also, as I mentioned, he ran the IRA, that research agency that was so highly involved in the Russian misinformation campaign, the 2016 campaign. We're also by Cedric Leighton, CNN military analyst. [13:34:59:] What is the effect on Russia's military without the Wagner Group specifically in Ukraine? Wagner forces were some of the most brutal but also some of the most effective there. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, that's exactly right, Jim. One of the key things about this is this is going to have real impact if it is, indeed, Prigozhin on this plane that crashed north of Moscow. That's going to have a profound impact on Russia's ability to fight the war in Ukraine. You'll remember the center of attention, almost the center of gravity of the Russian war effort was, for many months, for about 10 months, centered on Bakhmut. And the person and the forces that were actually running that show for the Russians, that was Prigozhin. And he was responsible, in his own brutal way, for that one Russian bright spot, from their point of view, in that war effort. Well, what's happening now, if he has, indeed, been killed in this plane crash and the Wagner Group is being decimated, by all accounts, in many respects, that could have a significant impact on the ability of the Russians to carry out their war effort. And I think it would potentially have some negative impact, especially on their ability to carry out the operations on the northeastern part of the Ukraine and on the eastern front especially.",

They're certainly raising that specter and that message is being sent is very clear. So I want to bring David Sanger back into this conversation. When you look at the war here, David, and Vladimir Putin's calculus and his long-term plan, that he wants to keep going, he wants to see what might happen, certainly in America moving towards this next election. And we've reported this out at CNN and I know you have at the \"Times,\" that maybe he is going to see, he hopes, American support and that alliance between America and Europe be cracked a little bit depending on the outcome of the election.

That day has been put off now by the U.S. giving cluster munitions and NATO coming up with some more. The second would be a crack among the Europeans, who, of course, have done better than we expected without Russian oil and gas at the levels that they had been before. And the third is that President Trump or someone with President Trump's views that the United States should not be a part of this war decides to pull out. All of that just requires that Putin hold the line. And there are many American officials I talked to who believe that Putin thinks that's entirely doable. He maintained a low-level war between 2014 and the full invasion of Ukraine -- this was after he invaded Crimea -- and sustained that at relatively little cost. If he could do the same here, he might well be able to just outlast the United States and the NATO allies. Now Prigozhin was getting at a separate issue, which was whether or not Putin's military leaders were prosecuting the war correctly. And he was willing to put up with that until it got to the point of an armed uprising. Now, even if this was an accident, and perhaps it was, it will be hard for people to believe this wasn't Putin securing his base.",

      "sentences": "Well, it certainly seems to indicate the Russian government know a lot more than we're learning at this point in time.And I think that Nick also pointed out that Russia has been very, very fast to come out with detail about what is likely going on. Including some recent things that I've just seen right here, that they've already, apparently, recovered four bodies from that crash. That there were three pilots on board and seven passengers. And everybody on board has been killed. We have to keep in mind, also that that crash site in the area of Kruzankanov (ph) is north of -- in the northern part of Tver Oblast, a little about two-thirds of the way from Moscow to St. Petersburg. That's all a pretty remote region. It's very difficult to conduct any forensic work very quickly and to sift through debris that quickly. So certainly, information definitely coming out very fast in all of this. Of course, it's far too early to see what exactly happened. But certainly, right now, I'm sort of speaking to folks inside Russia and some of them are saying that they believe that this plane was taken down. Of course, not that they'll say who was responsible for taking this plane down but that's, certainly, things that people are saying. They don't believe something like this could be an accident or would be an accident, especially if the plane was at cruising altitude. So certainly, a lot of things that are very intriguing about what's going on. But one of the things that seems to be transpiring, when you look at some of the messages coming out from Russian state media, but also quite frankly from social media channels affiliated with Yevgeny Prigozhin and his company, they're saying they can't get in touch with him, they're having difficulty, that they're not able to reach him. State media coming out very quickly with a lot of the details. That certainly does seem to indicate that they know or that they believe that Prigozhin might very well have been on that plane. And one of the other things, Jim, that I think we also need to talk about as well, there were seven passengers apparently on that plane. Were any of Yevgeny Prigozhin's very important deputies on that plane? Talking about (INAUDIBLE), who was a very important person in setting up Wagner, giving it the name, running the operations in Syria, and to a great extent running the operations in Ukraine, and now being tasked to run the operations in Africa as well. How many of them, if, indeed, if it's his deputies, how many of them were on that plane, how big of a blow is that to the organization? And will that mean the organization itself is going to change? But one of the things that one of the sort of Russians that I was speaking to says, look, right now Wagner is completely changing at this point in time. It's going from an organization that was running those operations in Ukraine, those really tough battles in Ukraine, to going back to essentially conducting what they called counterterrorism in Africa. They're right in the middle of a huge change. What is this going to mean for that? And what is this going to mean also, of course, for Russian influence now in Africa as well as the companies making that transition. Just a couple of days ago, we saw Yevgeny Prigozhin on the ground in Africa saying his forces were starting to take charge there doing what he called counterterrorism operations. What's going to happen now? So certainly, a lot of open questions and a lot of information also coming out very, very quickly, surprisingly quickly from Russian state media.",

Brianna, to Fred's point, we've witnessed, in the weeks since the attempted coup, two months ago to the day, Wagner effectively being put in its place to somewhere degree.
