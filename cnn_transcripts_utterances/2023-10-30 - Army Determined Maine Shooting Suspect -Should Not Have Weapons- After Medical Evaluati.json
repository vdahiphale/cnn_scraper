That's after the IDF initially said she had been released by Hamas. A rescue of a hostage, as they're now calling it, would be the first since the war began. Her name is Ori Megidish. That's a photo of her reunited with her family. According to the IDF, she's been medically checked and met with her family for some time. Also, today, Hamas released a short video showing these three women believed to be captives held by Hamas since the attack on October 7th. CNN is not showing the actual hostage video. Israel has sent more troops into Gaza, an Army spokesman saying operations are expected to, in their words, intensify.

The IDF is declining to provide many additional details about how exactly she was rescued inside the Gaza Strip.

Now, the Israeli prime minister says that this rescue is evidence that this ground operation inside of Gaza actually serves the goal of getting more hostages released, whether that is by additional ground operations that could potentially rescue additional hostages or for the simple fact that, as he said, it increases the pressure on Hamas at a time when these negotiations are still ongoing.",

Over the weekend, newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Fox that Israel is the, quote, \"pressing and urgent need\".Johnson also believes an Israel-only package will have bipartisan support, but he could be setting up a showdown in the Democrat controlled Senate. In his primetime speech from the Oval Office earlier this month, President Biden had called for one bill with roughly $105 billion in funding, the majority of it for both Israel and Ukraine, as well as other national security efforts. Joining me is CNN Senior Political Commentator Adam Kinzinger, former Republican congressman, is also the author of a new book, \"Renegade: Defending Democracy and Liberty in Our Divided Country\", which goes on sale tomorrow. Congratulations on the book. Obviously, you wrote this before October 7th as you view what's happening there now. I mean, what stands out to you?",

You know, we obviously are sad for the civilians in Gaza as well, but it just -- it's sad we're in this moment. Israel has an absolute right to defend itself, and it's not a pretty process.

It's one of the most like intense bonds you can build who texted me and said he was ashamed to have ever flown with me and served with me. Why? Because I disagreed with his view of Donald Trump.

So I talk about in the book, I hopefully mince no words and saying I bear some responsibility for this and I accept my role in the party to a point.
