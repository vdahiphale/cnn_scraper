Vance went even further -- further in this 2020 podcast.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) J.D. VANCE, VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (R): There's just these basic cadences of life that I think are really powerful and really, really valuable when you have kids in your life. And the fact that so many people, especially in America's leadership class, just don't have that in their lives, you know, I worry that it makes people more sociopathic and ultimately our whole country a little bit less -- less mentally stable. You go on Twitter and almost always, the people who are most deranged and most psychotic are people who don't have kids at home. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But if you look at what the parties actually stand for, what their records are, you could not come up with a worse way of contrasting the two parties. If you look at, for example, the fact that it's Democrats who've been pushing paid leave, affordable childcare, an expanded child tax credit that would predominantly help low-income and poor kids, access to IVF, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
