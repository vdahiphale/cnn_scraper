And today, jurors convicted the two paramedics, of criminally negligent homicide. An Aurora Police officer was convicted, earlier, on that same charge, and subsequently fired.

      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.Not so fast. Special Counsel, Jack Smith, denied as Donald Trump gets something he very much wanted, from the Supreme Court. Will his federal election subversion trial be delayed, and by how long? Also, tonight, breaking point, at the border, an unprecedented surge, a government overwhelmed, and the private militias, now taking it upon themselves, to patrol the border. And as America pushes, to bring hostages home, from Gaza, Russia, Iran and Venezuela, I'll talk to a wife, who is pleading for her husband's safe return, from Afghanistan. He's one of three Americans being held by the Taliban. Kaitlan Collins is off tonight. I am Brianna Keilar. And this is THE SOURCE. A win for former President Trump, at least for now, with the Supreme Court denying Special Counsel Jack Smith's urgent request, to put the issue, of Trump's claim of presidential immunity, on the fast track. A one-sentence order. Denied. No explanation, no notation, of whether any justices dissented. And here's what this means. The nine justices will not bypass the D.C. Appeals Court, to decide whether Trump can be prosecuted, for alleged crimes, committed while in office. Arguments are set to begin, in that court, in just over two weeks. The case is expected to ultimately end up, at the Supreme Court, just not yet. Still, this is a victory for Trump, who has been trying to delay, all his trials, until after the election. The immunity question must be settled, before his federal trial, for allegedly trying to overturn the election can begin. It's on the calendar, for March 4th, right before Super Tuesday. But that date now very much in doubt. And as this case heads back, to the Appeals Court, I'm joined by retired judge J. Michael Luttig, who spent 15 years, as one of the country's most prominent figures, on the Federal Appeals bench. You'll recall that he testified, before the January 6 committee, last year. He advised former Vice President Pence that he did not have the authority, to interfere with the certification of electoral votes. Sir, thank you so much, for being with us, tonight. A key night here. Why do you think the court chose not to hear the case, right now? J. MICHAEL LUTTIG, RETIRED U.S. APPEALS COURT JUDGE: Thank you for having me, with you, tonight, Brianna. Today's perfunctory per curiam denial of Jack Smith's motion to expedite is not a victory, for the former President, nor a defeat for Jack Smith. This was just a typical decision that the Supreme Court made, not to expedite consideration. The Supreme Court is fully capable of expediting consideration, of any matter, where it concludes that expeditiousness is necessary. In this instance, today, it's clear that that the Supreme Court decided that expeditious review, of the immunity question, simply was not necessary. It's of surpassing an obvious importance, to the American voters, to know before they vote, in November of 2024, whether the former President, the presumptive Republican nominee, today, will have been convicted, by a jury of peers, of the criminal offenses, for which he has been charged, by the United States. The Supreme Court understands the surpassing importance, of a verdict, in that trial, before the voters of America vote, in November.",

At that point, the losing party, whether it's the government, or the former President, could appeal again, to the Supreme Court of the United States.And now, for example, if the former President were to lose, in the D.C. Circuit, that is if the D.C. Circuit were to hold, as did the District court, that the President is not entitled to absolute immunity, from prosecution, for criminal offense -- these criminal offenses, then, it would be an option, for the Supreme Court of the United States, to deny review of that D.C. Circuit opinion, on a timeline that I've suggested that is reasonable and possible. It's entirely possible that the March trial would not have to be delayed at all. But in all events, not delayed long, certainly no longer than one to two months, so that the trial would in all events begin sometime near the summer of 2020, four, five, six months before the election of 2024.",

So, I'm the only one, without judicial experience. So, take it for what it's worth. But I think that when it's heard, by the D.C. Circuit, they will hear it very quickly. I think that they can quickly do the en banc process, if Trump seeks that, which I think he will. And then, I think the Supreme Court will take it up. So, I do anticipate certainly a delay, and I don't think we'll start trial, on March 4th.

But if it does, it certainly pushes it back closer to maybe when the Republican National Convention is going on, closer to Election Day. And then, I think, you get into questions of whether you can even have a trial, at that point, out of fairness to the election, if Trump is the nominee. The fascination with March the 4th, of course, is that the next day is Super Tuesday, March the 5th. And so, the specter of this happening, right before and during the most pivotal month, for delegate collection, in the Republican primary, had a lot of folks talking. So, just as a technical functional matter, if this thing gets delayed, and Trump doesn't have to deal with it, while he's out finishing up the primary in March, that's probably a good thing for him.",

He waited and waited and waited until the following May. And what happened, in the intervening period? Donald Trump started getting in legal trouble, and Republicans got mad, and they rallied to Trump's side. By the time DeSantis got into this thing, Trump had already re-coagulated himself, and collected himself, and his campaign was well on its way. So, I think as he -- if he does lose this race, and he looks back on it, he'll look at that period, and wonder what might have been? What if he had gotten into the race earlier?

I do still believe there's a cohort of voters, some Republicans, some Independents, out there, who won't want to vote, for a convicted felon. And they're watching to see what happens in these trials. And I also think, frankly, Donald Trump deserves a chance to clear his name. I mean, he's been accused of pretty serious stuff, not only in the Jack Smith case, around January 6, but also in the documents case. My view from the beginning of this is Donald Trump also deserves a chance, to clear his name, if he can, in a court of law, and not just fight this out, in the court of public opinion. So, I think he should clear his name. I think the prosecutor should have a chance to clear their case. But mostly, I just think the American people should know whether or not they're about to cast their ballot, for a convicted felon, or possibly for someone, who just got acquitted of all these things they've heard that he was accused of.",

And of course, it just stacks on top of what he's already facing, in Georgia, and the other cases. The only question I would have is, how long does it take? I mean, it's the thing with Trump. All the things that have happened, since the election, since January the 6th, it has taken an extraordinary amount of time, to get any of these things to the brink of trial. And even today, now, in the news, we see the probable delay, of a trial, regarding something that happened on January 6, 2021.
