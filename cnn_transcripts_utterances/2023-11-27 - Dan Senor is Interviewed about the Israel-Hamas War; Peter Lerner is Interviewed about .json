The U.S. and Qatar, two critical intermediaries in the deal, are seeking to use the momentum of the pause to create a foundation for a more permanent end to the fighting that could see more hostages freed and civilians protected in Gaza.Joining us now is IDF Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner. Lieutenant Colonel, we appreciate your time. To start with, there have been some pauses throughout the course of the hostage releases in the last couple of days. There appears to be some issues this morning as well. Do we believe at this point, based on information you have, that the release for today is on track? LT. COL. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESMAN: Good morning, Phil. Yes, indeed, we are taking the necessary steps to be prepared for a hostage release as it has happened over the last few days. But, at the same time, we're taking the necessary steps in order to be prepared for a new mobilization, a renewed attack against Hamas and its strongholds wherever they're holding out. That is the nature of our position currently in the course of the day. You know we've had heart- wrenching moments over the last three days in Israel here where people have been glued to the television just holding their breath to see who are the people that are coming out. And I saw your report about Maya Regev, who is a friend of a colleague of mine here in the IDF, and reports of the families and it touches everyone in Israeli society. And that is why it is so important to see this move forward but be prepared for the steps ahead.",

That is the resolve of the people of Israel. And us as the IDF, the Israel Defense Forces, our role is to make sure that never happens again.So, how long will we be prepared to mobilize? How long will we have the tools and the support? I think, looking forward, it's an extended period.

Avi, I was saying to our team just a moment ago, it's just so striking to see that. I mean after the things that he has re-tweeted and comments he's made, let's just remind people, he re-tweeted a comment just a couple of weeks ago that said, \"Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of delectable hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.\" And he wrote, quote, \"you have said the actual truth.\" Given that context, what does it mean to see him with Netanyahu here in this kibbutz? AVI MAYER, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"THE JERUSALEM POST\": Well, you know, we, in the Jewish faith, believe in repentance and atoning for one's sins. Perhaps that's what's going on right now. But the proof will be in the pudding. We'll have to see what happens on his platform, which indeed has been turned into a platform for all sorts of hate targeting a variety of groups. And perhaps most prominently anti-Semitism. And this anti-Semitism comes from a variety of sources. It comes from the far right, the far left and areas in between. And this is something that has run rampant for many years, but in many perceptions, it actually accelerated since Mr. Musk's acquisition of the platform. The question is whether this visit will change that trajectory in the future. MATTINGLY: Avi, can I ask, as we watch the prime minister from the video that we're showing from this morning with Elon Musk, inside Israel right now, on day four of these hostage releases, what is the public opinion about maintaining this truce, continuing this truce, extending it or restarting the combat operations that have been ongoing in the wake of the October 7th terror attacks.",

There are many, of course, who are extremely supportive - I would say the majority of Israelis are supportive of any efforts to release those hostages, bring them home to their families. This is something that Israelis have wanted for eight weeks now, to see them come home and to see them brought back to their loved ones.At the same time there's a very keen recognition, on the one hand, that those individuals who are being released by Israel are terrorists, people who have tried to murder Israelis. We know that many terrorists who have been released in the past, including in the Gilad Shalit deal in which 1,000 terrorists were released for one soldier did, in fact, returned to the cycle of violence and  Yahya Sinwar, who was the commander of Hamas in Gaza, was one of those individuals. There are some concerns about what that might mean and there are also concerns about what this might mean for Israel's capacity to continue its military campaign and decimate Hamas' capability to carry out a massacre like October the 7th. How many days can Israel maintain its military readiness before it's significant impaired? And Israel's ability to continue its mission is - is harmed in that way.",
