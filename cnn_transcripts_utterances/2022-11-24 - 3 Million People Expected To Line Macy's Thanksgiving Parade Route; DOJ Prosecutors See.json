CNN projecting that Democratic Congresswoman Mary Peltola will defeat Sarah Palin again for the state's at-large House seat. Peltola beat Palin in August in a special election that would have filled out the rest of the late GOP Congressman Don Young's term. Palin is the former governor of Alaska. Again, she was the 2008 vice presidential nominee. She was pushing really hard for a political comeback but just couldn't make it happen. CNN is also projecting that Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski will be reelected. She was facing challenges by another Republican as well as a Democrat. Prosecutors with the Justice Department are reaching out to former Vice President Mike Pence asking him to testify in the criminal probe of the January 6 Capitol riot. CNN learning that the former vice president is open to the idea. Let's bring in Daniel Lippman. He is a White House reporter at POLITICO. So, Daniel, the first question is just what is at stake if former Vice President Mike Pence testifies? You know, there -- it seems that there might be some political capital at stake considering he's considering running for a 2024 bid to be the GOP nominee. What do you think -- what do you think he'd gain and what do you think he'd lose by possibly testifying? DANIEL LIPPMAN, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, POLITICO (via Webex by Cisco): Well, his own safety was at risk, and so he is much more likely to want to participate in a probe that sees if there was any laws that were broken by President Trump. He has unique knowledge. There was a call at 11:20 a.m. on January 6 where Trump was very mad at him for his role in not overturning the election. And so, this is pretty extraordinary that you have a former vice president considering a testimony with another branch of government that is checking in to see if there were laws broken.",

People in that area are still understandably really on edge after more than a week -- excuse me, after more than a week of no answers after four students were stabbed to death in their home. So far, the investigation has yielded more than 1,000 tips but still no suspects.CNN's Natasha Chen has more detail. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  During an afternoon press conference, Moscow police did not share a whole lot of new details about this case. There is still no suspect named or arrested. They are still looking for the murder weapon. They did say, however, that a man who was called multiple times in those early-morning hours when these four students were killed -- he has been added to the list of people who are cleared from consideration of being a possible suspect. So now that list includes the two surviving roommates, the people who talked to 911 dispatch, a person who was seen standing near two of the victims at a food truck, a driver who took those two victims home. All those people are not considered connected to this crime as possible suspects at this time. The police also talked about the large number of pieces of evidence that they've collected, 4,000 photos that they've taken, 3D scans of the site. They've interviewed 150 people, and they are chasing down more than 1,000 leads. They've also received a number of videos from the public after they asked for surveillance footage for the public to upload to an online portal. Given that there is still no suspect in custody, however, they did talk about the remaining threat to the community as this college town is very concerned about public safety at this point. This small college town of 25,000-26,000 people had not seen a murder between 2016 and 2021. Here is what the captain of the police department said. CAPT. ROGER LANIER, MOSCOW, IDAHO POLICE DEPARTMENT:  And in some ways, this took our innocence. I would tell students that you need to stay with a friend. I know that the university staff is looking at different options to increase some of the safety on campus and providing certain options to students.

Spartans player Khary Crump was charged with felony assault after hitting Michigan's Gemon Green with his helmet. Jacoby Windmon -- he was also shown in the video and has been charged with one count of assault and battery. Five other players have been charged with aggravated assault. Michigan State's interim president saying in a statement last night that while they don't condone the players' actions they will support them throughout this process. All right, to the NHL. The New Jersey Devils seeking a club-record 14th straight win. But frustrations boiled over midway through the third period. Erik Haula thought he scored but the refs ruled that he kicked the puck into the net. It was actually the third disallowed goal of the night. And the fans, at that point, had had it. They started throwing bottles and cans onto the ice. It actually sent the Maple Leafs players back into the locker room for safety reasons. Haula tried to tell the fans to stop throwing stuff. And he said after the game he actually got hit with a chicken tender. The Devils ended up losing 2-1, snapping that record-tying win streak. All right, we've got no NBA games today and that's because Thanksgiving belongs to football. The Lions are going to open up the slate at home against the Bills, followed by an NFC East showdown between the Giants and the Cowboys.
