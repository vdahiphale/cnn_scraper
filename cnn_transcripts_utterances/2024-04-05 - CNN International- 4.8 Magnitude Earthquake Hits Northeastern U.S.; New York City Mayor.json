      "sentences": "We want to get straight to some breaking news. Right now, a 4.8 magnitude earthquake hitting New Jersey and could be felt in the city of New York City. That quake hit just about 20 minutes ago and is set to be shallow in nature, as we look at these live pictures of New York City now. Just getting some new details from the USGS, saying that about 23 million people felt some light shaking. That's what most people felt. Close to 300,000 people felt moderate shaking, moderate being strong enough to break windows or cause dishes to fall, and 9,000 people felt strong shaking.Let's check in now CNN's Jason Carroll, who is following the latest on all of this. Jason, I guess it goes without saying, New York not exactly a place that frequently experiences earthquakes. What else can you share with us? JASON CARROLL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you're absolutely right. So, you can probably guess as to why many of us second guessed ourselves when we felt it, myself being one of them, here in Hudson Yards. And for folks who aren't familiar with that, it's a huge sort of complex located on the west side of Manhattan. The newsroom is on the 18th floor. And when the ground started shaking, some of us felt it. I felt it. My computer started moving ever so slightly. And I thought to myself, are we having an earthquake? I'm from California. So, I'm accustomed to feeling earthquakes. But it's not something you're accustomed to feeling in a place like New York City. Again, magnitude, we're now hearing, 4.8. It happened at approximately 10:20. The shaking ever so slightly, from my vantage point, for several seconds. The mayor says that they are doing an assessment to see if there are any reports of any damage coming in from the city. So far, no reports of any damage. The impact apparently was felt throughout the tri-state area. So, it was felt not only in places like Manhattan, but also felt in New Jersey, felt in Connecticut, the State of Connecticut, as well. The Governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, released the following statement, saying in part, \"My team is assessing impacts and any damage that may have occurred, and we will update the public throughout the day.\" That's what she posted on X a short while ago. But again, you can imagine how many of us felt here in New York. And there were several years ago when we felt another earthquake here in New York City. But, this one definitely had more impact seemingly on more people here.",

It just says a 4.7 magnitude earthquake, which obviously you just updated, has occurred in the New York City area. Residents are advised to remain indoors and to call 911 if injured. So, of course, we continue to follow that.Jason, any sense of sort of how far this may have been felt? I think I heard you say that folks in Philadelphia, that's my hometown, my family is there, that's about 100 miles south of New York, any sense of how far this stretched?",

We've already heard from some of our colleagues, way out on the eastern shore of Long Island. They say that they felt some pretty heavy shaking there. Again, keeping that in perspective, when I say pretty heavy shaking, remember, these are folks who are not accustomed to feeling earthquakes because if you are at a place like California, a four point -- a magnitude 4.7, 4.8 would -- it's just sort of like an everyday occurrence. Not the case here.So, again, feeling it out in places like Long Island, feeling it here and Manhattan, some folks feeling it out in Connecticut as well, and definitely feeling it in New Jersey. So, felt over a wide area. That is for sure. But again, the good news is not getting any reports at this point of have any major or significant damage.",

But, as friends of mine know that I live in the heart of Manhattan, in a poorly constructed large apartment building, and I felt that it could have been a truck going by. Then I heard a newspaper or I didn't know what it was, something had fallen in the other room. And it turned out to be a newspaper, which I have many in my apartment. But, I thought, boy, I not have gone to the owners, the managers of this building with many complaints over the years. I said, well, maybe I'll mention it to them because this could get alarming in the future. And it wasn't until I checked my device to see that it was an earthquake.",

It's almost gets to be a cliche. You have to be alert. And I think a lot of people might have thought, was that my stomach? Was that just the way the steps just went? You could dismiss it.

So, authorities now reporting a 4.8 magnitude earthquake hitting the northeast part of the U.S., from as far north as Connecticut, as our meteorologist Elisa Raffa just pointed out there, to as far south as Washington, D.C. For international audience, Washington, D.C. is maybe 200 miles south of New York, Connecticut maybe 50, 100 miles as well. So, we're talking about a pretty decent sort of swath of land here in terms of how people felt this.Well, the USGS reporting that more than 23 million people felt light shaking. This is what can cause perhaps cars to rock noticeably, can cause a sensation like a truck striking a building. That's light shaking. So, about 23 million people felt that. 300,000 people felt what's considered more moderate shaking, and this is what's strong enough to break a window or perhaps cause dishes to fall. And then, 9,000 people felt strong shaking, and this is shaking that could move heavy furniture. This is shaking that could cause slight damage. This earthquake happening within the last hour or so, maybe last 30 minutes or 45 minutes. Those of us here who were based in New York at CNN's Hudson Yards location, we certainly felt it. I did not feel it. I was working and preparing for the show. I did not feel it. But, my colleagues, all sort of came out to the hallway. We all sort of talked about what just happened, because New York is not an area where we are prone to earthquakes. And so, I imagine, I certainly didn't think that an earthquake was the first thing that came to mind. And so, I imagine some people might not have been exactly sure what that shaking was. But, again, authorities confirming a 4.8 magnitude earthquake hitting the Northeastern U.S. Folks feeling shaking as far north as Connecticut, maybe even farther, but we know at least Connecticut, and as far south as Washington, D.C. are still waiting to assess sort of what the damage could be like if anyone, of course, was hurt. But, it's early days, because as I said, this just happened within the last 30 or 45 minutes or so. Let me bring back in CNN's Elisa Raffa, who was with us now. Elisa, can you just sort of give us a sense, if we step back, what exactly causes earthquakes? What what's behind this?",

I heard someone, they were interviewing on another CNN network, saying they thought it was like a truck ran by. So, definitely a lot of confusion, I think, is what most people are describing in New York.Like I said, I know I got that from my family. And they know, me, the meteorologist and the science expert. And my phone has been going crazy with all the family being like, what was that? But, yeah, you could see some of that shaking, and that's what I was talking about too about the magnitude, where it's significant enough to feel the shaking.

A mom saying that she was asking the kids to stop jumping up and down, when she came down, received that alert on her phone that in fact it was an earthquake that was likely causing that movement.

So, hopefully, New York City officials can at least update us on that, certainly mass transit that's used by millions of people every day.And then, finally, do they expect any aftershocks? That's a question that I keep getting right now. What the New York City officials have done is they've put out some advice for people in the region saying, should that happen, they're recommending that people simply drop to the floor, cover their heads and necks, and if possible, seek shelter under a heavy piece of furniture should that actually take place. But, again, we have not felt any aftershock, but certainly going to be an important question for officials to answer since that's likely something that's heavy on people's minds here in New York City, and not just where we are, but also surrounding states with people as far as certainly New Jersey where the epicenter was reported, Pennsylvania as well as other parts of the Northeast feeling that shake this morning.",

Philadelphia police urging people to not call 911. If you were OK and you just felt the trembling and you felt this, do not call 911 unless you are reporting an emergency.Polo, I would love to ask you just based on you being outside talking to New Yorkers as people walked by you, what have you heard from people?

This was significantly bigger than ones that are typically felt in the state of New York or occur and actually are not felt. That is because earthquakes happen on a logarithmic scale, which means that 3.0 is 10 times worse than a 2.0. So, a 4.0 is 10 times easier than a 5.0. So, every one of those makes a significant difference in what you will experience and what the damage could be.In addition, we are also tracking whether or not there is any increase in hospitalizations as well as whether or not there is any increase in vehicle accidents that has not been reported at this time.

A few updates here. She says -- the governor says that they have not identified any life-threatening situations. She says what they're doing now is she said they have structural teams. They have engineering teams. They're out surveying areas like bridges, areas like roads. They're looking for structural integrity concerns. So, that's what's happening now.So, essentially, they're still assessing to see sort of what the impact is on the ground in New York. She says that the White House has reached out. She says that she has spoken to neighboring Governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy. She said that the ground stops for New York airports such as JFK and Newark, they have ground stops. They don't have an update at this point on when that will be lifted. She said LaGuardia, which those of us who travel in New York know that LaGuardia had been under a renovation. It took years. That has since been completed. She says that it seems like that may be part of the reason why there isn't a ground stop at LaGuardia right now, which was really interesting. Let me bring back in our guest from the U.S. Geological Survey, Susan Hough. Susan, good to have you again. As the governor said there, this could be over or it could not be in terms of whether we see an aftershock. Give us a sense of sort of what the window is in terms of watching for an aftershock, and at what point people can feel like we're in the clear here.",
