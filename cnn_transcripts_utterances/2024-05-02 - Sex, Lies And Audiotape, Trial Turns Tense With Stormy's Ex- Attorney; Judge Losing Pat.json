One of the problems of a gag order is when you start getting involved in content.You know, it's one thing to shut everybody down and say nobody talks about this case, it's another thing where, you know, Trump has to deal as a presidential candidate with Michael Cohen who feels free to basically, as a potential witness in this case, who apparently will testify obviously, is free to comment all he wants and Donald Trump is being gagged from having comment with regard to a critical witness in the case while he's a presidential candidate. This is a difficult situation to be in, I understand, for everybody, for the prosecution, for the defense, for Donald Trump as a presidential candidate, and for the judge. I think it's pretty apparent from what Jennifer said, and I think you're right, that he is paying attention to the line which is the threat of imprisonment, and that message has gotten through.
