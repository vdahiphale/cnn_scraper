      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Right now in a New York courtroom, lawyers are arguing over a commonly asked question, has Donald Trump's rhetoric gone too far? Prosecutors say the former president has violated the gag order in his hush money trial at least ten times. The gag order forbids Trump from verbally attacking witnesses, the jury or others involved in the case. These are images of the former president seated at the defense table. Before entering the courtroom, he spoke railing against President Biden and other topics, but avoided any mention of this morning's hearing. And I just want to point out on the left side of your screen, you'll be seeing live updates from our reporters inside the courthouse, a play-by-play of the proceedings as they happen. And, of course, we'll be talking about all of it. CNN's Kaitlan Collins joins us live from outside the courthouse. Kaitlan, what stands out to you? What will the judge be listening for from both prosecutors and Trump's defense attorneys?",

      "sentences": "Well, right now, Jim, it's prosecutors who are making their argument that Trump did knowingly and willfully violate this gag order. They are citing at least ten posts within a one-week period that he made on Truth Social.But they're also talking about what he said just yesterday, leaving the courtroom, where he invoked Michael Cohen's name. He criticized him. He downplayed the legal work that Michael Cohen had done for the former president. And as you see there, the prosecutors are saying, these violations were made with knowledge and willful beyond a reasonable doubt, which basically means Trump knew this gag order was in place, he knew what the gag order limited him from saying, and he still willfully violated it. And so they are essentially, right now, making their argument to this judge before the defense has a chance to argue to him. But there was one moment, as this got underway, Jim, where Trump's attorneys came into the room, the prosecutors came into the room, the judge took the bench, and then those attorneys and the judge went into a side room. It's not clear to us yet what they were discussing, but Trump was sitting alone at the defense table while that was happening. They have now returned to the room, and they are going through this, essentially asking the judge to find a way to make Trump stop violating this gag order.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And just the last minute, we got another little tidbit, the prosecutor saying, quote, there is no doubt this defendant made these statements. Kaitlan, how much will the judge weigh the potential that witnesses or jurors could be endangered when Trump rails against them? That's been a familiar theme for Trump in all of these legal proceedings he's been through.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And I think the jury comments that he's been making deserve special scrutiny here because he not only had posted on Truth Social, essentially implying that they were trying to put liberal activists were the words that he used on this jury, but also last night in an interview, he commented on the jury, which is something he is not allowed to do from this gag. You can't comment on the jury at all. The other posts say you can't attack them, but it's essentially saying that he cannot comment on the jury.He was commenting on the jury alleging that it's made up of 95 percent Democrats, claiming that it was rushed, even though it took several days, actually longer than it typically would, to assemble a jury. And his attorneys, of course, had a say in striking people from that jury that they did not believe would be fair to their client. And so that is a new twist to this. And that is something that we are just told prosecutors have brought up inside that courtroom and on this hearing. And so the real question here is, of course, what the judge here, Judge Juan Merchan, is going to ultimately decide. We also have CNN's Paula Reid here covering all of this with me. And, Paula, you know, prosecutors are making their argument right now. A big question is how is Trump's legal team going to defend him?",

COLLINS:  On what you're saying right there, prosecutors are saying throwing a MAGA into a post does not make it political. It actually may make it more ominous, they're arguing, to your point.",

We have to remember this is extraordinary when we're thinking how this will resonate in a court of public opinion because both of these men have enormous platforms and they just attack each other relentlessly.I mean, some of Michael Cohen's attacks on Trump I can't even repeat on camera, right, because of a language that he used. But the fact is, right now, Trump is a criminal defendant. Michael Cohen has been in the past, but he is not right now. He is a witness in this case. That's why I think any argument about how this is unilateral towards Michael Cohen will lose in this courtroom, but might get some traction in the court of public opinion.",

Yes, Elliot, I'm mean let's just jump in on this. I mean, what do you make of what we're hearing in our side panel there, these little tidbits coming from inside the courtroom?

Number one, where is the line between what is protected speech from a candidate and someone who is interfering with the administration of justice in his own trial? And some of those are quite delicate.Now, the Michael Cohen question is going to be a much tougher one because, as they say, you have two people who are sort of going after each other and sniping in public. Going after the jurors is really a problem. And I think if there's anything that the judge is going to respond to directly, it's those statements about the jury pool.",

Under normal circumstances, the judge would have gone through every single juror and asked them methodically.After they said I can't be fair, you would have called them up and said, okay, if I give you the instructions on the law, can you be fairer? And most people say, of course, I can, and they'd be back in the pool. The judge here essentially used a hatchet and got rid of everybody, all the people who sort of even claimed, perhaps wrongly, that they couldn't fair the judge. So, yes, it was fast, but it fast in a way that ended up being far more fair to former President Trump than other ways they could have handled jury law.",

And Todd Blanche is saying that Trump does know the ramifications and the parameters of this gag order and that he did not violate it willfully, they are arguing.That is obviously a direct contradiction of what prosecutors just got up and argued. And I should note that as prosecutors were making their argument, they were saying that they don't believe the answer to Trump violating this gag order right now, they believe, is jail time, but they were saying, you know, that is an option that is, you know, the results of a gag order if any other regular person violated it. What Todd Blanche is arguing is that Trump is responding to people like Michael Avenatti and Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels and allegations being made by them. And they're saying that it's a political response, that it's not relevant to the case. And Todd Blanche is pushing back on what prosecutors had just said that, you know, putting MAGA in a post doesn't make it a political post. Instead, they were saying it makes it more ominous, potentially. Todd Blanche is saying, well, there's nothing that Donald Trump does that is not devoid of politics here and saying that everything really does have a political tinge to it when it comes to the presumptive Republican nominee. What we are told by our reporters, as you can see there on the screen, is that Trump is looking straight ahead, not really responding as these arguments are going back and forth. And, of course, once Todd Blanche finishes, Jim, that means it's going to be up to the judge to decide how does he handle this, how does he respond, and does he agree with prosecutors that Trump has violated this order on multiple occasions.",

He's basically asking Todd Blanche to specifically defend the exact post that Donald Trump has cited here. And I should note that what prosecutors are pointing to is about ten posts on Truth Social from a week-long period in April, though they're noting comments that he made just yesterday in court, comments that he's made about the jury, ones we saw even last night, of course, those comments as well.

The one that they haven't talked about in real- time in this hearing yet, where Blanche hasn't talked about with the judge, is this other post that the prosecutors say is a very troubling post, April 17th on Truth Social. Donald Trump quotes Jesse Waters from Fox News. They are catching undercover liberal activists lying to the judge in order to get on the Trump jury. The prosecutors are pointing to that and saying, this is really bad because the jurors are intimidated after this post went up that pointed to Fox News and coverage of juror profiles and commented on the Trump jury. Juror 2 was no longer comfortable to serve on that jury, and the prosecutor said what happened here is precisely the sort of thing that a gag order is in place. It's about preventing intimidation of witnesses and of jurors and other people working on the case, jurors, first and foremost. And the other thing to keep in mind here, what the prosecutors are doing with the judge, they are saying, make him care.
