The ministry of defense claims they destroyed three Ukrainian sea drones loaded with explosives, launched at the Crimean Bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge.It's just the latest attempt at an attack on the bridge, which is a critical lifeline for Russian forces. Meanwhile, Ukraine security service has identified a Russian commander that's been accused of participating in the atrocities in Bucha last year. The SBU says Vadym Ovchinnikov ordered his subordinates to open fire on two cars carrying civilians. A man, his wife and their 15-year-old daughter were killed instantly. Only the youngest daughter, who was 9 at the time, survived. Ukrainian forces say they have in fact penetrated Russian defenses in the Zaporizhzhya region in the southeast but they are being hampered by Russian trenches and barriers on those front lines. CNN's Melissa Bell has more.

That's what hit the Kerch Bridge overnight and in the early morning hours. There are two stages to this attack, according to the Russian ministry of defense. There was one around 11 pm last night and then two in the early hours this morning. They claimed they intercepted all but there was clearly damage as traffic moving across the bridge has been stopped temporarily. Sea drones, if they are coming from Ukraine and they are widely are expected to be so, would have had to travel hundreds of miles to get there. The nearest Ukrainian controlled territory, probably around Odessa, is quite a way away from the Kerch Bridge. And, of course, the bridge links the Russian mainland as well as occupied Crimea. This is part of the tactic that we have been seeing with these drone attacks, going far into Russian territory, really quite far away from the front line. They come within a week of other drone assaults, many different attacks deep into Russian territory, as far north as Moscow, even beyond Pskov and the airport there. These drones in particular, the sea drones, while Ukraine hasn't commented whether they're behind them. But they have spoken to CNN about their pride in this weaponry. We have spoken to Ukraine's head of the secret security service on this before. And he said this was a unique invention by the Ukraine. It's not private companies that have developed this; it is Ukrainians themselves. And that is part of what we are seeing here with Ukraine's domestic weapon capability. They are developing these weapons themselves, as part of an aim to show Russia and Western allies that they are able to continue this counteroffensive, to continue this war with their own domestic weapons capability. That could be a significant turning point and taking the world forward. Paula.",

This is in fact the third academic year disrupted by the war. It is tradition that students began on September 1st.

Ukraine has invested heavily in making schools safer, including on those building shelters. The government says about 85 percent of schools are equipped with bunkers, which is a requirement for any school that wants to bring students back to the classroom. UNICEF reports many students are falling behind in their schooling and struggle with mental health issues because of the war. Pope Francis is making one of the most unusual foreign trips in his papacy with a first ever trip to Mongolia. That country is predominantly Buddhist. It is landlocked between Russia and China and has a very small Catholic population. The pope began his first full day by meeting with the Mongolian president and delivering an address at the state palace. Pope Francis will be in Mongolia until Monday. Joining us from Singapore with more is Michel Chambon. He's a research fellow at the National University of Singapore and a scholar on Catholicism in Asia. It's good to have you weigh in on what is quite a peculiar trip. When I first heard of it, it did not make a lot of sense to me.

But Mr. Macron said displaying religious symbols in schools is contrary to France's secular education policies.Days after a coup in Gabon swept the president from power, the new military leader promised a return to democracy -- eventually. In a televised address, Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema said he does not want to rush into new elections that make, quote, \"the same mistakes as the previous regime.\" A recent vote that gave President Ali Bongo a third term was marked by irregularities and internet shutdown. In his remarks, Nguema said the break with democratic norms would not be permanent. For more on all this, CNN international correspondent Jim Bittermann joins us now. Good to see you and have you on the story, Jim. People have been watching carefully to see how long this would last and of course, to listen to what the military leaders are saying here. They are in no hurry, obviously, to try and hold elections and, basically give up power that they seized by force. JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTL. CORRESPONDENT: Well, exactly and I think people on the streets here in Gabon have mixed feelings about this because the opposition in Gabon has actually said they're in favor of the coup d'etat because they did not like the results of the election. A questionable election that was held that reelected the longtime dictator there, Omar Ali Bongo. He's part of the dynasty, the Bongo dynasty, that has been in power for 55 years. In any case, you've got the military taking power and they're making some very positive (INAUDIBLE) about exactly how they're going to return the country to democracy. The question is, exactly when? Here is the way that General Brice Oligui Nguema put it in a televised address. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. BRICE OLIGUI NGUEMA (through translator): The dissolution of the institutions of the republic is temporary. The aim is to reorganize them, to make them more democratic tools, more in line with international standards in terms of the respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law. But also in the fight against corruption, which has become commonplace in our country, money laundering and above all, the preservation of the environment, which is a battle dear to our country.

And now the deposed leader is under house arrest.The question is, what happens next? There are about 7,500 French citizens at the moment -- nobody is ordering an evacuation or anything like that. There are 80 subsidiaries of French companies there and putting some big ones like Total Energy and others. And as a consequence, the French have got a vested interest in making sure things turn out right here. On the other hand, if they seem to be meddling too much, there's going to be a reaction on the ground, no doubt about it. There's about 400 French soldiers there, a permanent base, who could assist in any kind of evacuation. But at the moment, that hasn't been ordered. Paula.",
