      "sentences": "Hello and a warm welcome to our viewers in the U.S. and around the world.It is Friday, the 5th of April, 9 a.m. here in London, 11 a.m. in Tel Aviv, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is acknowledging the deaths of seven aid workers killed on Monday in Gaza, and it was Israel's fault. He's also pledging to implement measures to make sure such a mistake never happens again. Israel is also announcing plans to get more aid into Gaza. It'll reopen the Erez border. That's the crossing between Israel and northern Gaza to allow for aid shipments. The Israeli security cabinet approved the decision and also agreed to the Israeli port of Ashdod being used to help transfer more aid. Now, the move comes after a phone call between U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The White House says Mr. Biden demanded specific, concrete and measurable steps to protect civilians and aid workers in Gaza or the U.S. would reconsider its own policies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Hopefully, you know, it won't come to that, that they'll be able to execute and implement on these things that we've asked for, these things that they've committed to doing, and we can make it safer for aid workers on the ground. And frankly, we can help start to make life better for, for innocent Gazans. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They say there was no animosity, but it was a very direct message from the U.S. president to the Israeli prime minister. And we saw a very different strategy being employed by the Biden administration.In the past, when they have criticized what Israel is doing in Gaza, they have also, almost within the same sentence, said, but we will not stop or impede the military support and the support we have for Israel with what it is doing in Gaza. This is a departure from that. Now, we've heard that the U.S. president said that they would look at the U.S. policy when it comes to Israel, what Israel is doing in Gaza, if what they wanted was not respected and was not notifiably shown to be changing. Notably, the change in humanitarian aid getting in, that the safety of civilians in Gaza, the safety of aid workers, the Biden administration saying they want to see concrete steps and measurable steps, that this is changing. So it's certainly a departure from what we have heard from the Biden administration in the past. We've heard from the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who's been in Brussels, saying that if those changes are not seen to be done, then there will be a change in U.S. policy. Again, begging the question, if this had been a change intact from the Biden administration earlier in this conflict, would it have changed the situation on the ground -- Max?",

The problem is that President Biden puts everything on the humanitarian aid.And by the end of the world -- by the end of the day, there is no humanitarian aid that can save, really save the people of Gaza, because it's only about food and some medicines. Those people are homeless half a year. 1.3 million people in Rafah who have nowhere to go. And they are still in great danger. And here I don't see Biden putting his weight on this. What we saw yesterday of the phone call just shows how big is the leverage of President Biden over Israel and how little it is used relative to what should have been used mainly to put an end to this war today.

The governor of Rostov says air defenses have shot down more than 40 targets over the region which borders Ukraine. His latest statement didn't spell out what the targets were. But earlier he called it a massive drone attack.The governor says an electrical substation was damaged and crews are working to fix it. Meanwhile, a Russian strike on Ukraine's second largest city has turned into a heartbreaking family tragedy. This is video of a firefighter in Kharkiv after he found out his father was killed in the attack on Thursday. Ukraine says they both worked in the fire service responding to the first wave of drone attacks. But a second wave then followed, hitting the area where the father was working. The son immediately rushed there, only to discover his dad was already gone. Officials say five people were killed in Kharkiv, including three rescuers. NATO countries will dig deeper into their stockpiles to try to find more air defenses that can be sent to Ukraine. The announcement was made after NATO and Ukrainian foreign ministers met in Brussels on Thursday. That's when Ukraine called for an urgent delivery of air defenses, including the U.S.-made Patriot missiles. Meanwhile, the Kremlin now says that NATO is directly involved in the war on Ukraine and that NATO's current relations with Russia have reached the level of direct confrontation. The alliance's chief reacted this way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

One should always go with a worst-case scenario when it comes to planning for things like noncombatant evacuations, which is the type of evacuation planning that should have been used in this particular case. And when you look at the different agencies involved, the U.S. State Department, the Defense Department, and some of the other agencies, it was very clear that they needed to work together not only at the tactical level but at the more strategic level to plan this type of an event regardless of what we might have thought was the viability of the Afghan government. \\ And it was pretty clear to anybody who was paying attention in Afghanistan that this government in Afghanistan, the one that existed at that particular moment in time, was not going to last a very long time. And that became really clear by July of 2021 and certainly was clear to me before that. But that's the kind of thing that should have really led to some very clear planning and realization that there was a need for a noncombatant evacuation. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
