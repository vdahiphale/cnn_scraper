And U.S. President Joe Biden will return to the campaign trail, hoping to give Kamala Harris a boost in a key swing state. We'll follow their stop in Pennsylvania. Well, this hour in Israel, a mixture of grief, anger and frustration following the murder of six Israeli hostages by Hamas over the weekend. One of the victims, Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin was mourned by thousands at his funeral in Jerusalem today. For nearly a year, his parents have waged a relentless campaign to try to bring him and other hostages home. His mother, Rachel says, she hopes Hersh's death proves to be a turning point in this war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RACHEL GOLDBERG-POLIN, MOTHER OF HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN:  I have had a lot of time during the past 332 days to think about my sweet boy, Hersh. And one thing I keep thinking about is how out of all of the mothers in the whole entire world, God chose to give Hersh to me. What must I have done in the past life to deserve such a beautiful gift? It must have been glorious. If ever, I was impatient or insensitive to you during your life or neglected you in some way, I deeply and sincerely request your forgiveness, Hersh. If there was something we could have done to save you, and we didn't think of it, I beg your forgiveness. We tried so very hard, so deeply and desperately. I'm sorry. Now, my Hersh, I ask for your help as we transform our hope into grief in this new unknown brand of pain. I beg of you, Hersh, please, do what you can to have your light shine down on me, dad, on Libby(ph) and Orlie(ph). Help shower us with healing and resilience, help us to rise again.

You know, he still carries support from within his governing coalition. He has a media echo chamber. The media in Israel is very split. But outside of it, if you look at the mainstream opposition inside Israel who have supported the war but they have not supported the way in which Netanyahu has deprioritized getting a deal to bring the hostages home. So, that's the accusation that's heard consistently in mainstream Israel. It's not just political -- it is political, but not just that, it is also ideological. Netanyahu and his coalition believe in maintaining the occupation, something deemed illegal by the International Court of Justice, maintaining the settlements, they have now conducting military operations on a more extensive scale in the occupied West Bank. They want to not only continue the war, but continue displacing, ethnically cleansing Palestinians. That's what de facto they are doing and that's what indeed their coalition guidelines say, which say that the entire land of Israel, in other words, all of it, Gaza, West Bank, the whole thing belong only to the Jewish people. So, yes, politics, yes, American malpractice, if not worse, but also ideology. But let's not underestimate the significance of what's happening in Israel right now because the response to discovering the bodies of those six Israelis held in Gaza and obviously, the suffering that them and their families have gone through alongside the suffering that tens of thousands of Palestinians killed, the entire 2 million plus population in Gaza living in appalling conditions because of the Israeli strikes, but the discovery of those bodies, much of Israel, perhaps not enough yet to displace Netanyahu, but tens and hundreds of thousands took to the streets to say, Mr. Prime minister, you have caused this because you've refused a deal. And in his press conference today, Netanyahu made absolutely sure that there could be no progress in negotiations, just as he has been doing for month after month because of the insistence on things that he knows are going to prevent a deal. And yet, the U S administration has refused to be honest, and I think that's all we need from them, to start off with, be honest with your public, tell them what is preventing this, and then if you accept that Israel is violating international law, committing war crimes, which is what the Court of Justice and the International Court have said, then don't provide arms for those crimes.",

We now know that Hersh and others could have gotten home alive had a deal been agreed to. But you have to understand there are two sides. If you consistently say that, first of all, you murder the political leader of Hamas in an extrajudicial killing and then you say, Hamas has no legitimate position. Look, Israel has committed war crimes. Hamas has committed war crimes. If we want to end this, then both of those parties are going to have to step back. Then we're going to have to deal with the permanent illegal occupation. But in the immediate term, something is going to have to change that equation. It is not going to be changed by more of the same what Israel's leading political commentator, Nahum Barnea, today in the Israeli paper, Yedioth, calls mendacious spin by the Biden administration to serve domestic political considerations.

The two will be in Pittsburgh in the swing State of Pennsylvania to mark the Labor Day holiday. They're hoping to win over undecided voters, as recent polls show the Vice President didn't receive much of a post- convention bounce in support. Well, joining us now from Detroit, Michigan, is Eva McKend. Good to have you with us, Eva. So, give us a sense of the message that that both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be delivering to voters today. EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Lynda, I'm going to get to that in just a minute, but we do have some breaking news. Governor Walz's motorcade was involved in a minor vehicle accident. He himself wasn't involved in that accident, but of course you know that several vehicles travel with him, some including members of his staff. They were taken to the hospital for minor injuries. It appears that everyone is going to be OK. But just something that can happen is so many people are traveling across the country, crisscrossing the nation that this minor vehicle accident occurred. But the vice president and the president joining forces now on the campaign trail today. The vice president wrapping up her event here in Detroit where she spoke about the power and the dignity of work. She thanked union workers for their support, and she pledged to be an advocate for them if elected president. Essentially, the argument was, listen, you might be courted by Republican candidates, but they ultimately do not support union policies. There's something called the PRO Act that would offer legal protections for employees trying to create unions. Well, that is something that she very vociferously supports, as does President Biden. And so, that is the argument that they are now making together on the campaign trail. They are going to be together in Pittsburgh. President Biden, very popular at union halls in that state. And so, we see her making several arguments here. She's trying to characterize herself as a new way forward, but she's also embracing President Biden in areas and in spaces, Lynda, where it makes sense to do so.",

It's now been flown to the U.S. and searched by law enforcement. The U.S. has been at odds with Maduro for years and has questioned the validity of his recent re-election. Well, in Bangladesh, many are still picking up the pieces after that mass uprising that outstood the country's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. It came after she ordered a brutal crackdown by police, leaving some protesters with deep scars. Well, now some victims are coming forward. CNN's Anna Coren has their story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The fresh faces of the future against that of the past. Shoes hanging in the face of Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the ultimate insult and show of defiance in a country where people on the streets achieved the unthinkable. What began as a student-led protest against government quotas in early July, morphed into a mass uprising. After Hasina, who'd been in power for more than 15 years, ordered police to open fire on the crowds. Over the following weeks, hundreds of people were killed while thousands were arrested.",
