      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Lynda Kinkade in Atlanta, in for Max Foster. Good to have you with us.Just ahead, a source tells CNN that Israel is back at the negotiating table and has brought forward proposals for a pause in fighting in exchange for Hamas releasing hostages held in Gaza. We'll go live to Tel Aviv with more in just a moment. Plus, Colorado's Supreme Court rules that Donald Trump is not eligible to be on the presidential ballot. What does this mean to his 2024 run? We'll speak to a legal expert. And then rescuers are working in the bitter cold in China, searching for those trapped after the deadliest earthquake in over a decade. We begin in Israel, which is now back at the table for hostage negotiations. That's according to a source who spoke with CNN. Israel has begun to make proposals that call for the release of hostages in phases in exchange for a pause in fighting. But that source also stressed that a deal at this moment is not imminent. Sources say the U.N. Security Council is expected to vote today on a resolution that initially called for a suspension of hostilities in Gaza to allow more aid to get in. This comes as humanitarian groups say half of the war torn enclave's population is starving. They warn of potential outbreaks of cholera and other illnesses. Our CNN Senior International Correspondent Will Ripley is covering the latest developments and joins us live from Tel Aviv. Good to have you with us, Will. So Israel and Hamas reportedly back negotiating. We know that Hamas's top leader is in Cairo. What are the expectations? WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So if we're judging by how things went last time around, Lynda, this hostage deal took a very long time to hammer out, more than a month, in fact. And so they're not necessarily expecting a deal imminently, which is what Israeli officials are telling us here in Tel Aviv. But they are back talking and they're starting to look at what the possible parameters of a hostage deal might look like. It would include women, the Israeli official tells CNN. It would also potentially include a release of hostages in phases. There are believed to be just over 100 hostages who are still alive in Gaza and another 21 of them who are believed to be dead, but their bodies in Gaza. Israel, of course, wants the return of all of them. In the past, Hamas has said that that would only happen if there was a permanent ceasefire, in other words, the end of the war. Israel has said that it would be a humanitarian pause. What they're putting on the table right now is an exchange of some 40 hostages, prioritizing women and children, people who need priority care, the elderly as well. And in exchange for that, there would be a week long pause in fighting. They would consider extending that pause in fighting if the remaining hostages would be released. So obviously still a lot of details that need to be hammered out, Lynda, and it could take quite some time. Of course, people would love to see something happen over the holiday week, but that might be unlikely unless the two sides can somehow work much faster than they did the last time hammering out the complex details of this negotiation, including, by the way, who's going to be released by the Israelis back to the Palestinian side. Hamas is asking this time around for more heavy duty prisoners as opposed to the teenagers and women that Israel released during the last exchange.",

The current refugee camp situation is untenable. We've talked about the humanitarian crisis, the lack not only of food and medicine, but also hundreds of people, if not thousands of people, sharing a single bathroom facility, lack of clean water. It is truly just an absolute disaster on the ground. And so shelter needs to be constructed and provided. But the details of what that would look like, how many people would be able to -- the timeline still unknown at this stage, Lynda.",

      "sentences": "Now, there might still be some small scale operations going on, according to state media, focused on remote small villages not only hit by the initial quake, but also the subsequent mudslides, because officially there are still more than a dozen people missing.But the fact the official casualty figures, including the death toll, have only been revised up slightly from Tuesday to Wednesday is perhaps a reflection of the remoteness of the quake zone. Sparsely populated, mostly rural, and often mountainous. Even though the epicenter was only some hundred kilometers away from the provincial capital city of Gansu. The authorities say their focus is now shifting to post the disaster relief, including treating the injured. Nearly a thousand people to get injured in this quake, but also resettling the tens of thousands of people forced to evacuate from their homes and farms after those structures were either destroyed or severely damaged. Now, that's no easy task during the best of time, the very harsh winter condition, with temperature reaching as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius overnight hampering this effort as well. And it may take some convincing for some of the people to get resettled since many of them are very poor farmers, telling state media they're not only concerned about their safety, but also their livelihood, including the fate of their crops and livestocks. Overall, though, the authorities say they have restored electricity, communication signals, as well as road access to most parts of this quake zone hit by that very powerful tremor late Monday night.

The Colorado State Supreme Court has ruled that Donald Trump is ineligible to run for president in that state next year. It disqualified Trump from the ballot because of his role in the January 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol.The 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bars government officials who have participated in an insurrection from holding future office. Trump's campaign has vowed to appeal that ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. CNN's Marshall Cohen is tracking the story for us. Marshall, good to have you with. So this -- there is no precedent for this. It's highly unusual, like many of the cases we've been tracking, covering Donald Trump. Just take us through this decision and the ramifications.",

Donald Trump's actions are at the heart of this case.What he did after the 2020 election, which he lost, and how he tried to remain in power by sending his supporters to the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, where they successfully, at least for a few hours, blocked the transfer of power. So the Colorado Supreme Court, as you said, issued a stunning ruling last night. It was a four to three decision, a divided ruling, but they said that the constitutional ban in the 14th Amendment on insurrectionists holding office, that it is still the law of the land and that it applies to the presidency, and therefore, Donald Trump is ineligible for office. Now, Lynda, he's definitely going to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. So this is not the final word, but this was a massive victory for the people that said, Donald Trump needs to be held accountable for his behavior on January 6. Lynda?",

And the big question is, are they going to issue a narrow decision that only applies to Colorado and reflects the case there, or are they going to take up this matter in a sweeping, broader fashion that settles the question for the entire country? There is a lot of uncertainty at this point.",

Yes, it's certainly something that the authorities are keeping an eye on, I would say right now in Reykjavik, especially, where some of that pollution may have happened, the authorities feared, which is, of course, the capital of Iceland and by far the largest town as well.So far, there don't seem to be any measures being taken on the ground. Seems pretty normal there right now. It's interesting because this volcanic eruption, which, as you noted, was absolutely massive. Some of the images that we saw there of those fountains of lava spewing, sometimes hundreds of feet into the air, that certainly is something that is taking place between, essentially the main airport and the capital of the country. And yet the authorities say they have this situation completely under control, because obviously, Iceland is a country that is used to volcanic activity, and certainly the residents of this country as well. It's interesting that you noted that the folks in Grindavik were told by the mayor -- that town, by the way, was evacuated more than a month ago -- that they would not be able to return home certainly before Christmas. That certainly seems something that you would expect, considering that you have something that looks like the gates of hell opening right in their backyard. And you're absolutely right, the seismic activity has decreased considerably. We saw that big wall of magma that was spewing from the earth after the initial eruption took place. Then the authorities said that it was now down to five vents that were still spewing lava out. And, of course, those lava flows taking place as well. This morning, the latest that we're getting that it's down to three of those vents that are still spewing the magma. However, the authorities are saying that the danger has not passed. They say that because this eruption is so big, that there could be new vents opening up along that fissure. And they also, of course, warn of that -- what you were mentioning, that possibility of toxic gas becoming an issue for places like Reykjavik and also this general area, because this is probably one of the most urban areas in all of Iceland, Lynda.",

      "sentences": "Great to be here. And you're right, it was stunning. And we're headed for an epic set of weeks at the Supreme Court. Now, you just gave people a part of what that amendment says, our 14th Amendment. It says that no person shall hold office who has taken an oath to support the Constitution and then engages in an insurrection or rebellion.So that's one of the main questions the Supreme Court would have to decide, did Donald Trump engage in an insurrection? And does this provision actually cover a president? A lower court judge had earlier said no, whereas the Colorado Supreme Court said this flatly would apply to him. But I have to say there are several hurdles, procedural hurdles, that the Supreme Court would first have to confront before it gets to exactly what does the text of our 14th Amendment say. And one of those is, did he have enough due process in the lower court's proceedings in Colorado? And does Colorado state law even allow the secretary of state to be able to keep him off the ballot, or does first Congress have to enforce this provision of the 14th Amendment? So we have myriad legal questions that will now be before the U.S. Supreme Court. At the same time that I should mention, the court is also considering whether to take up whether Donald Trump should be immune from criminal prosecution for election subversion brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith in that separate case. So just two major issues that will determine what happens in the 2024 elections now right on the doorstep of the U.S. Supreme Court.",

But then January 5th is a deadline, right, in Colorado for when the GOP primary names have to be submitted. And there are other deadlines coming up pretty quickly. If the Supreme Court gets this and gets this fast, which it probably will, it could decide it pretty quickly in the next couple of weeks.It's done it before. It's just a matter of what the arguments will be and how much the Supreme Court's going to get into them.

Now, Eagle Pass, Texas, is the epicenter of the immigration crisis in the United States right now. It is where the federal broken immigration system collides with the state of Texas who wants to take this issue into its own hands.And I want to show you exactly what I'm talking about. If you look over my shoulder, you'll see that these are men, women, children who are waiting right now out in the cold to be transported for processing. And what you're looking at right now is a federal issue in the United States. It's up to the federal government to apprehend these individuals, process them and hold them. But Texas Governor Greg Abbott has just signed a bill known as SB4, that would -- that has created a new state law for illegal entry into the United States. And what that means is, is the images that you're looking at right now could turn into a state issue. Now, I've talked to state leaders all along the border who are very concerned about this. Why? Because it's going to cost their communities money. I talked to the sheriff here in Maverick County, and he says that his deputies don't have training in immigration law and that he doesn't have space in his jail to house all of these individuals. His jail can only house 250 individuals. There's already 180 in custody and there's thousands of people behind me. So why is all this happening and why is there this bottleneck? Well, right now there's about 23,000 migrants in border patrol custody and holding capacity is only 10,000. So do the math. There is an overwhelming number of migrants who are in custody right now. And it has created this bottleneck which raises the question why? What's happening? Why is this different? I'll tell you why. There's a few factors. Of course, the capacity issue, the flow issue. There's a lot of migrants who are coming to the United States from all around the world. And then there's this. The Biden administration is trying to implement and use legal consequences for illegal entry into the United States. And what they're doing in certain processing areas along the U.S. southern border is they're using something called enhanced expedited removal. And what that means is that asylum officers make a determination on a migrant's case while the migrant is in custody, which means that migrants are spending more time in custody. And as I've mentioned, they only have holding capacity for about 10,000. They're already holding 23,000 migrants. And so what this is doing is it's testing the infrastructure on the U.S. southern border. Rosa Flores, CNN, Eagle Pass, Texas.",
