In fact, they had not spoken actually since December 2020. But on Thursday, they interacted. In fact, they had a warm interaction. They shook hands, and at one point, Donald Trump even praised Mitch McConnell, saying that praising him and crediting him for electing more Republican senators along the way, a sign of how the party is falling in line very quickly behind Donald Trump. And when I asked a bunch of Republican senators today and House members about whether there was any dissension and whether January 6 came up, they said no. Did he talk about January 6 at all?

The FDA, as any possible decision restricting their regulatory authority, would have an enormous impact on many industries, including, of course, the pharmaceutical industry. And of course, depending on which way this went, it also could have had an impact on anyone seeking office this year. Right now, they have effectively preserved the status quo, but because the justices did not decide the issue and instead just sort of tossed it out based on standing, it is possible, even likely, that this issue could return to the high court in the coming years. Now, for anyone who has concerns about Mifepristone, but does not have standing to bring a lawsuit, here is Justice Kavanaugh's advice for them. Quote, \"citizens and doctors who object to what the law allows others to do may always take their concerns to the executive and legislative branches and seek greater regulatory or legislative restrictions on certain activities\". So now all eyes on another abortion case before the justices as they release most of their key opinions over the next few weeks.
