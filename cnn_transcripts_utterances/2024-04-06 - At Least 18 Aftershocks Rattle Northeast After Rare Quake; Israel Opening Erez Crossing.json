Mattias is going to zoom in there and you're looking at the Erez Crossing.Now, this is a crossing that traditionally was used for Palestinians mostly to come out and do their day jobs in Israel and then and then go back into Gaza at the end of the day. But of course, this is one of the main places that Hamas attacked and kidnapped IDF troops there and shot up the, you know, shot up a lot of the facilities there. It can get aid trucks through there and this is what we're expecting to happen and we know that the IDF was down there speaking with the World Food Program yesterday. We know that the government's under a lot of pressure to make it happen but I have to tell you we've been along the border here. We tried to have a live broadcast with you in the last show and there were the IDF troops there said we couldn't broadcast from there, so we came here. It's still a tense situation around here. We can hear gunfire from the other side of the border. You can see that's Gaza on the hilltop behind me there. You can hear explosions still. So, the question in my mind is, the White House is looking for action from the Israeli government. They've said that they'll open this crossing, but the action will be those aid trucks going in with gunfire and explosions so close by on the other side that seems that's going to be difficult to achieve. And we know from satellite imagery just over the border there many of the roads leading to the border have been hit by heavy bombs over the last six months some of those roads are so cratered there's no tarmac. So, how are these big aid trucks going to get in and out of there? So, of course, all these questions and the focus really is on because the White House, State Department, safely blinking here in February, asking for this border crossing to be opened. It didn't happen. We know at other border crossings there are problems. Protesters come and block the route. We know that there are people in Prime Minister Netanyahu's right-wing cabinet who don't want this border crossing to be opened, think the way to pressure Hamas is to hold back the humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, the U.N. says people are close to starvation in the north of Gaza. The government's allowed in, it says 20,000 aid trucks into Gaza since the war began. The U.N. says four times that number of trucks would have been needed under normal circumstances. So, the picture of the need is great. The picture here is, it feels a bit like uncertainty. With gunfire, you know, getting the trucks in, that's not going to be straightforward.",

Trump suffered back-to-back setbacks in trying to get his Georgia election and federal Florida classified documents cases dismissed. Joining us now is CNN Legal Analyst Joey Jackson. Always good to have you, Joey. Let's start with these major setbacks you're talking about where Trump is trying to get his cases thrown out. First, the federal documents case. So, you have Judge Aileen Cannon, who rejected Trump's bid to dismiss the charges based on the Presidential Records Act. But it seems that she and the Special Counsel Jack Smith, they're clashing.

That is OK. The real essence of it here, what the judge had made a decision on already is that the case is not going to be dismissed on First Amendment grounds. That, I don't think, Amara, was a surprise. The reality is, is that yes, you have a right to free speech. Yes, you have a right to political speech, but that right doesn't give you the ability to try to circumvent an election in any manner. And so, I think the judge made the appropriate call. Yes, I do think we could see the potential for neither party moving forward to make comments. And I think that would be fair, I think it would be appropriate. And I think it would be about the case, the facts, and the law. Once the case gets underway. When it does, it's anyone's guess, we just don't know yet.",

In the lawsuit, she alleges that Christian Combs sexually assaulted her after pressuring her to drink tequila that she says in the complaint she believes was laced with drugs. Now, I want to read you a piece of this complaint, which says, \"Defendant Sean Combs turned what was sold as a wholesome family excursion into a hedonistic environment.\" According to the plaintiff, \"It resulted in an unexpected increase in workload for her and her colleagues, as well as unwanted exposure to unlawful drug use, sex work, and general chaos.\" Now, in the complaint, there are photos that are allegedly of the accuser's arm that show bruises, which her attorney says came after this alleged physical assault. There is also audio recordings that are referenced in this complaint, in which the accuser is allegedly asking Christian Combs, if he is drugging her and asking her to stop touching her inappropriately. Now, we at CNN have not obtained those audio recordings, and have not listened to them. I reached out to an attorney for both Sean Diddy Combs and Christian Combs, and they do not address the allegations specifically, but they attack the attorney of the accuser. And here's part of what they told us. \"We have not seen this woman's claim, but I'm sure we can expect the same kind of manufactured lies we've come to expect from Tyrone Blackburn and his client. Now, Tyrone Blackburn is the attorney of this accuser and he is also representing two other people who have accused Sean Diddy Combs. Now, Sean Diddy Combs is not accused of sexual assault in this lawsuit, but he is named as a defendant. This is the sixth lawsuit to come against the mogul and rapper. And, of course, this comes as he is the target of a federal investigation, where we saw last month that two of his homes in Los Angeles and Miami were raided by the feds. Victor and Amara?",
