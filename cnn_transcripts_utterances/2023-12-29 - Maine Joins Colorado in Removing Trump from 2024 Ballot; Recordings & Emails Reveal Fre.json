Take a listen to what Ken Chesebro, who's been described by prosecutors as the architect of the fake electors plot, what he told investigators in Michigan about this scramble and about sort of the panic that ensued when they realized the certificates were stuck in the mail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KENNETH CHESEBRO, PRO-TRUMP ATTORNEY: The general counsel of the Trump campaign is freaked out that Roman reported that the Michigan votes are still in the sorting facility in Michigan, which doesn't look like they're going to get to Pence in time.

We do know that when approached with the - about the documents, Pence and a Pence staffer refused to take them, so - and ultimately certified Joe Biden's win.But really a look behind the curtain here about what was happening behind the scenes as Trump campaign officials were trying to make sure these certificates got to D.C. on January 6th.",

According to Chesebro, Matthew Morgan, who was at the time the general counsel for the Trump campaign, one of the top Trump campaign lawyers, he was overseeing and helping oversee the day to day sort of operations related to the fake electors plot. And emails that he has given to prosecutors in Michigan do show that Morgan was communicating with Chesebro and other operatives about how to get these certificates to Washington, D.C.Now, that does not match up with what Morgan told the January 6th Committee. He said that he tried to distance himself from the fake electors plot. He had a problem with it. He was concerned that it would make life difficult for Mike Pence. But ultimately, documents do show that he was still engaging in these discussions as late as the day before January 6th. So it'll be interesting to see how Morgan squares those two comments. We asked his attorneys. He - they said that he stands by his testimony to the January 6th Committee, but really a gap there. And it does show how these two teams of Trump operatives and Trump lawyers really - it was messy and there was a lot of overlap happening there.",

And if that's possible, and I suspect it's not now, certainly they knew what they were a part of and now is the time to say, you know what, this was not something I want to be a part of and I want to help those seeking justice as opposed to standing in the way of the efforts to seek accountability.",

The legal definition of aided and abetted has really never been decided or interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in this type of context and we really as a country need that.And ultimately, the Supreme Court's job is to provide that clarity if we're going to move forward into this 2024 Election cycle with our ducks aligned and with voters empowered to make the best decision for themselves. So we'll continue to call and be a part of any effort to push the Supreme Court to make a decision sooner rather than later on the merits.

Ukrainian armed forces are saying about 158 drones and missiles were sent including hypersonic ones and they managed to shoot down 114. We have not seen such a big barrage since about - of November of last year when 70 or so were sent at once Ukraine's way. Look as for timing it's hard to say, hard to get into the twisted mind of Mr. Putin but part of me believes that this was payback for Ukraine's missile or drone attack on a quite a big ship in the Russian Black Sea naval fleet and that has resulted in Ukraine over the past few months destroying about 20 percent of that fleet. The Russians might have also been targeting a critical infrastructure but they hit other targets instead or this could be a harbinger or precursor to other attacks, ground defenses on Ukraine. One more thing Boris which is absolutely mind boggling when you think about it is that one of the Russian missiles according to the Polish military spent about three minutes or 24 miles in Polish airspace. Now this is not the first time that's happened but that is the longest time I believe a missile has lingered, it entered Polish airspace and then it entered back into Ukraine. NATO's response to that is we are going to remain vigilant. But look, it was either a malfunction or incompetence on the Russian part or the Russians are probing testing NATO defenses and that, of course, will be of interest to Xi of - President Xi of China who is looking carefully how the United States will respond to a possible invasion of Taiwan.",

And the Ukrainians are saying if nothing comes, they will have a very difficult time. So hopefully when they come back from their break they are approved that 61 billion.And Boris, I have to be very blunt with you on this one. I fall on the side of the lecture of CNN's Nick Paton Walsh who said, if one or both of those funding packages do not come through, Russia will occupy all of Ukraine within two years.

But I think what Mr. Putin is doing is keeping a very close eye on what's happening in the United States, not only, Boris, in terms of the funding that's supposed to come through, but I think he's also trying to run down the clock until the elections in the United States, hoping that Mr. Trump or MAGA Republican will get in, and then a quick deal could be made that will not be in Ukraine's favor.What the Ukrainians are now preparing to do in case of that eventuality that funding doesn't come through, they're, for example, tripling their domestic production of weapons. They're upgrading their drone technology and I think that's going to see more very surgical strikes on the Black Sea fleet way inside Russia to get as much of Russian military capability diminished. Just quickly, I'll throw out a figure there, with pretty limited resources over the past almost two years, Ukraine has been able to denigrate about 50 percent of Russian conventional military capability.
