But Jeffries has been getting an earful from his colleagues in the House throughout the week. There was a formalized meeting of all Democratic members on Tuesday, where the lawmakers emerged with no consensus.But after that, members continued to raise concerns with him despite the fact that Jeffries publicly reiterated the support that he had publicized the day after President Biden's debate debacle that inspired this crisis of confidence within the Democratic Party. Now, the question is what the President does with that advice. Just last night, when he was delivering that press conference, he was asked multiple times about why he believes he is still the candidate who can beat Donald Trump, whether his vice president Kamala Harris, could also beat Trump. He said, there are many Democrats who could do it, but that he's the right person for this job at this moment in history. And he even suggested that his team had showed him polling that said that he still had a path forward in the race and that he would only exit the race if two conditions were met, not only that his vice president could effectively beat Trump, but that he couldn't. And he said into the microphone in a hushed tone, the polls don't say that. No poll says that. That's where the President was, as of last night going into that meeting. And we are still trying to report out exactly how the President is feeling at this hour with that information in tow, Wolf.",

Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. I know you strongly support President Biden. But as you know, the House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries says he shared the full breadth of your caucus, the perspectives that are ongoing with the President during their conversation last night. It could include some serious concerns, though, about the path forward. Do you think the President was receptive to what he heard?REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA): I have no idea. But I do know this President was on his game yesterday. Anybody that watched that press conference had to be impressed with his breadth of knowledge, detail, and willingness to go into the extraordinarily important international issues, as well as the domestic issues, 50 minutes standing up there, as well as the eight minute presentation. It was a tour de force. So what's wrong here? What's wrong is that we have a feeding frenzy underway as a result of the very poor performance in the debate. But being President is not debating every day, it is governing, it is understanding that the breadth and the depth of the national and international issues, and Biden knows that. He's on top of it. He's clearly showed yesterday that he is on the game, and he's ready to be on the field.",

It just gives you and the other media an opportunity to continue the feeding frenzy. We need to recognize that Biden is capable, he's understands the issues. He is on the game. Is he going to be a great debater? Probably not. They've got one more debate coming up. But the reality is he can and has governed and he will be able to govern in the future.In addition to that, it's like going into the Super Bowl. In a 120 days or so we're going to have the Super Bowl of politics, the presidential election. We have a very capable, competent and experienced quarterback that is on the field today and will be on the field after the election and into the next four years. We also have a terrific backup quarterback should that become necessary. Wolf, none of us know the day that our life ends. None of us do. But should that happen to Biden? We have a quarterback, a backup quarterback. And that is Kamala Harris, who has the experience of three and a half, almost four years now as vice president, dealing internationally, dealing with the domestic issues, and all over and on top of the women's issues, which is a profoundly important part of this upcoming election. So we've got a great team. And as Democrats we ought to get behind that team stop this internecine warfare that we are now engaged in.",

And that's an a conversation that is ongoing and should continue to ongoing. Let's get real here. Biden is not going to bow out. Now, what are we going to do? Continue to fight amongst ourselves? That would be a major problem. We need to rally, we need to understand that we have a individual, the current president that knows the issues inside and out, the domestic issues. Take a look. Inflation is down, inflation is down and we're probably going to see that from the Fed in the next couple of weeks as they reduce interest rates.Employment is up. We've had the longest stream of significant job growth, perhaps in the last two decades. How did that happen? Consider the legislation that Biden put together because of his skill set as a senator, as a vice president and as President. The American Rescue Plan keeping businesses and people able to survive the shutdown of the pandemic. Think about what we've done with the infrastructure bill, building the foundation for America's economic growth, look at the climate issues, the Inflation Reduction Act, the most extensive effort to deal with climate change by any country ever. And it's there. And what is Trump wants to do, take every piece of that apart, including giving the corporate America and additional tax cut, not that they're already not already fact happy with what he gave them in 2017. He wants to extend that and increase the tax cuts for corporate America. More than 50 of whom the biggest don't pay any tax at all. It's outrageous.",

The cancer research that he was able to put in, when he was vice president. Think about where we are for this particular illness, the multiple myeloma illness.There are extraordinary new technologies. And I'm benefiting from that as a direct result of the work that Biden and others have done over the last decade or two to advanced cancer research. Yes, I'm going to beat this thing. I'm going to be back. I'd love to be in Washington right now. But the doctors are, oh, no, don't do that because your autoimmune system has been is being seriously compromised as a result of the treatments. That's good to go.

I am told it could be anytime between right now and Monday when he is officially nominated at the convention. And so we're all kind of holding our breath on that.But look, next week's convention is going to be really a Trump coronation. And it's been interesting because if you look at the past two times, Donald Trump went through this process. This is the third time he's going to be accepting the Republican nomination for president. But he never got the show that he wanted. Donald Trump is a reality television producer at heart. But in 2016, remember, there was a lot of internal fighting and hand wringing over him becoming the nominee and kind of punctuated by Senator Ted Cruz getting up on stage and telling people to vote your conscience. And then 2020, he couldn't put on the show he wanted because it was in the middle of the pandemic. But this year, it is really going to be the Trump show. They are rolling out the red carpet. They're going to have all of Donald Trump's fiercest defenders with him. They have very much themes on brand relating to his MAGA agenda for each of the four nights next week. And of course, Wednesday, we're going to see whoever his VP nominee is have their night they will give a speech on stage.

That is exactly what we need to be talking about.Next week, they're going to have the whole Republican Party with Donald Trump focused on a MAGA agenda. We know that the vast majority of the American people reject the MAGA agenda. But if we're not talking about it as Democrats in terms of what we are offering, instead, the hopeful vision, the accomplishments of the last four years, what additionally, Joe Biden wants to do in terms of protecting our democracy, protecting women's bodily autonomy, protecting immigrants who have been here for years and have contributed to our economy, protecting our kids, protecting our seniors in terms of health care, then we are giving it all over to Donald Trump right now.
