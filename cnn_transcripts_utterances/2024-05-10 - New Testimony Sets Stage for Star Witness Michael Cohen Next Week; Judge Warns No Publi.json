Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer with a special report in The Situation Room, the Trump Trial Today. Donald Trump's historic criminal trial now on the brink of a blockbuster week with Michael Cohen's pivotal testimony and the prosecution revealing it could soon rest its case. Today's testimony and legal wrangling all building toward Cohen's star turn on the witness stand, as CNN's Kara Scannell reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Prosecutor star witness Michael Cohen is expected to testify on Monday in former president Donald Trump's hush money trial. Cohen, Trump's former attorney and fixer, is at the crux of the criminal case against him. Prosecutors say Cohen paid off adult film star Stormy Daniels on Trump's behalf to kill her story of an alleged affair before the 2016 election. Trump denies the affair. DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Somebody paid a lawyer, and in paying the lawyer, so it was a legal expense, that somebody happened to be me. I didn't do the bookkeeping. I didn't even know about it. This is what the case is about.",

She later clarified Trump did not specifically speak about his family in that conversation. Trump's lawyer suggested he made the 130, 000 hush money payoff to Daniels in order to protect his family.

Cohen would say that he was being paid pursuant to a retainer. And that is what the prosecution says is the heart of this case, the falsification of those business records.

Maybe that's because it's something that the defense team wants to try and pick at in their closing arguments. But also they're not stipulating to anything in this case. They wouldn't even stipulate to some of the allegations from Stormy Daniels that they could have to avoid some of the more embarrassing testimony.

I also just want to point you to something we saw Michael Cohen post on TikTok. There's been all this talk of a gag order. He actually shared an image, we have it up now, of Donald Trump depicted in an orange jumpsuit with his hands handcuffed behind his back.

That's the underlying leverage of the court. And while the judge did not specifically say that today, he alluded to it in a previous written decision, finding defendant Trump liable for contempt violation. This judge is serious. So if Michael Cohen does not heed this judge's warning, public warning in a public court being delivered to him by the district attorney's office, and he is removed from that gag order, and then Trump would be free, defendant Trump would be free to do the usual things he does on social media and other venues.

It also finds, we should note, that Israel did not arbitrarily impede humanitarian assistance from getting in to Gaza.That's noteworthy because, of course, CNN has its own reporting that Israel has impeded that assistance from getting in. The Biden administration has called on Israel repeatedly to do more to get that humanitarian assistance into Gaza, but the State Department determining that Israel didn't make arbitrary decisions about keeping that assistance out at times. Now, we should note that the report says it's challenging to make determinations on these specific incidents, that there are ongoing investigations particularly because Hamas hides in population centers, hides in population areas. And so therefore it's hard to determine if these strikes actually violated international humanitarian law. It also raises questions, Wolf, about Israel actually using its capabilities that it has to drive down civilian deaths. I want to read to you a part of the report saying, quote, while Israel has the knowledge, experience and tools to implement best practices for mitigating civilian harm in its military operations, the result on the ground, including high levels of civilian casualties, raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases. So, there are a number of instances that this report looks at, again, not making a definitive conclusion on those incidents.

And, you know, a bunch of reasons were offered why, some of some of which Kylie just walked through, including the fact that some of these instances are still being investigated, the U.S. is still waiting for some information from Israel. And the State Department is basically saying, look, one instance can't really speak to overall compliance by all of Israel. But I think a lot of people are going to have a really hard time squaring that conclusion with even some of the things that the president himself has said. You know, he has said that Israel was engaged in indiscriminate bombings, for example. He has said that their conduct has been over the top. And then, of course, he said this to Erin earlier this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And humanitarian organizations have made determinations that Israel did, in fact, violate international humanitarian law in some of these instances. So, he is really not happy as he is reviewing this report while he said that it has some useful bits in it.

Get away from city lights, kind of looked down at the horizon the farther you are to the south. But we've already seen some unbelievable pictures out of Europe where it is obviously dark already.Solar flares earlier, that was May 7th and 8th, and then all of a sudden, this coronal mass ejection came right at the earth. We know that because this puff is a circle, if it was kind of going one way or the other, then it wouldn't be going at the Earth. But because it's all around that middle, we know that that ejection is coming right toward the North American continent for tonight, all the way across into Europe and Asia tomorrow. And then back around for us for tomorrow. So this is not just a one night thing. If you miss the corona tonight, if you miss the aurora, then all of a sudden, you could see it again for tomorrow, maybe even a couple of days. There's the coronal mass ejection made contact with Earth about 12:40 this afternoon, really lit up the atmosphere. There are plasma magnetic ions flying all around inside the atmosphere right now and that's causing a few things that are to go wrong. We know this happened because kind of like a seismogram and when you look at an earthquake, all day everything was flat. Sun was just fine. Then all of a sudden, right. About 12:45.
