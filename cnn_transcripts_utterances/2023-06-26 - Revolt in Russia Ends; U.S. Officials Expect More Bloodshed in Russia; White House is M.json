Now, we do not know when or where this video was shot, and Putin made no mention of the rebellion. Major questions remain this morning. Where is the man who launched the revolt against Putin? What impact is this all having on the ground in Ukraine? And what has this done to Putin's grasp on power? CNN has reporters and analysts stationed all around the world to find answers to these questions. Questions that get to the heart of international security and world order. An order that was thrown out of balance in a remarkable 48 hours.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says it shows cracks in the Russian regime, a crisis in which he says we have not seen the last act. Now, the march of the renegade mercenary Wagner group was halted before it reached Moscow as part of what the Kremlin claims was a deal to drop charges against the leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, and for Prigozhin to leave for Belarus. But Prigozhin has not confirmed the deal and has not been seen since Saturday night. And as we said, Putin himself only just appeared in video for the first time since Saturday.

So, relief in Moscow. They've lifted the tight security measures that were imposed over the weekend in preparation for that entrance of Wagner forces. But it's really - I have to say, John, it's relief that's coupled with a high degree of anxiety as well about what this armed rebellion will unleash, whether it will spark more kind of cracks appearing in the regime of President Vladimir Putin, and what President Putin might do in order to consolidate now his very increasingly tenuous grip on power, John.",

But there was some surprise about how this actually unfolded. Namely, they were surprised that it wasn't bloodier. U.S. officials did expect that there would be a lot more resistance from Russia's actual troops to Russia's -- to the Wagner troops that were entering the country. And they expected that there would be a lot more bloodshed. Essentially they thought that there would be more of a fight put up by Russia's troops to Wagner's procession into Russia and, of course, up towards Moscow. They were also surprised by the swiftness of the deal that was reached between Belarus and Wagner forces, between Belarus and Prigozhin, that essentially ended the entire thing. Part of this, of course, may have to do with the fact that Prigozhin did not actually end up getting to Moscow, which is where U.S. officials would have expected the fiercest resistance to come from Russian troops. And so he kind of turned around before there was an opportunity to do that. But there are big questions here about why Russia's military did not put up a bigger fight. Now, in terms of what comes next, U.S. officials are still unclear as to what happens from here. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that it is too soon to say where this all goes and what it means for Putin's leadership, but that cracks have certainly emerged. Here's what he said.

And the indications are at the moment, the Kremlin saying, well, they haven't dropped the charges against him.We know Putin likes loyalty and dislikes and will distance himself from people who aren't loyal to him. Prigozhin was in his inner circle. He was having a big spat with Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister, also in Putin's own inner circle. Putin didn't handle that so well. So when Prigozhin decided to do this about face and u-turn and pull his troops back from their road to confrontation in Moscow and cut this deal, it was Lukashenko, the president of Belarus next door, who got to cut the deal. But I don't think anyone's fooled that he was the front on it. That Putin wasn't really behind it. Belarus is a weak client of Russia right now. Lukashenko only just scraped through in his last elections, widely seen as fraudulent, brought out massive protests on the street in 2020. He's been in control of the country since 1994, seen as Europe's last dictator, and he needs Putin to prop him up. And Putin's used this country has a base to attack Ukraine. So, Lukashenko, the cheap and, if you will, weak partner to Putin. So, this is the place that Prigozhin has gone. So, really? If he still faces charges, is he really going to feel safe there? Do we expect him to pop up and spend any time there? It's -- again, it's all unclear. And would Putin, in this scenario, want to leave Prigozhin with his troops?

But what is clear, the mutiny itself seems to have ended as quickly as it began. It started Friday morning when Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin blamed Russia's defense minister for what he said was an air strike on his mercenaries in Ukraine. Now, we don't know if or how many Wagner fighters died in the strike, but Prigozhin responded by questioning the Kremlin's motives for starting the war in Ukraine, and said its military leadership must be stopped. Then, Wagner mercenaries began their march toward Moscow.Within hours the FSB, Russia's main intelligence agency, opened an investigation against Prigozhin for armed rebellion and military officials began deploying armed vehicles and the Russian national guard in the Capital. As Saturday unfolded, Prigozhin led his fighters into the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, where they took over the headquarters of the southern military district. Wagner forces continued to push north, getting within about 150 miles of Moscow. There were few signs of resistance, which surprised a lot of people, from Russian troops, but there were a few skirmishes. [09:20:06] Wagner forces appeared to have shot down at least two Russian helicopters and a plane. A visibly angry Putin gave a nationally televised address Saturday calling the mutiny treason, betrayal and a stab in the back. He warned of punishment. But then an abrupt reversal from the Wagner chief. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and a Putin ally, suddenly announced he had brokered an surprise agreement with Prigozhin. Prigozhin called his troops back and agreed to go into exile in Belarus. But as he left Rostov-on-Don, he was greeted like a hero. And people in the streets chanted for his fighters. Listen.

In fact, very few. A week later we see a huge crack that's out there.You heard Secretary Blinken on TV on Sunday making the point that 16 months ago we were wondering what it would take for Putin to take Kyiv. Now we were wondering whether or not he could defend Moscow. So, he's got order back. He's, once again, got a monopoly on violence, which has always been the main thing for him. But we don't know where Prigozhin is. I doubt this is over in some form. And the fact that you heard that cheering, that we didn't really see much military opposition to Prigozhin as he was heading to Moscow with the possible exception of this set of air strikes that we're still trying to learn something about, tells you that Putin's got to be a little bit nervous.

But Putin, if he had taken Prigozhin out right now, he would be taking out a folk hero who Moscow helped build up. And every man who was at the front lines at this tough war against Ukraine, and who spoke truth to power over and over and over in a way that Putin allowed. I think then he was faced with Prigozhin holding the Wagner gun to his head, the possibility of open warfare on the outskirts of Moscow that made them both blink.
