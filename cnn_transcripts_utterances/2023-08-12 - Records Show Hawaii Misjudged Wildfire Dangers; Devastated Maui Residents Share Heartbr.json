And that's feeling hopes that the economy can achieve a soft landing where a recession is avoided.New numbers released Friday show that producer prices increased in July a bit more than expected. We watch this closely because it measures inflation that's in the pipeline, before hits all of us as consumers. Still, wholesale inflation has cooled dramatically over the past year. We are miles away from those alarming price spikes of last summer. And that, of course, is great news. The latest consumer price metrics are also giving investors hope that the Federal Reserve can end its war on inflation. Consumer price inflation, it did pick up in July, breaking a record long streak of 12 straight months of cooling. But don't be fooled. Economists say there is really no reason to panic over this. The July inflation report came in cooler than expected. And the uptick was mostly driven by the comparison to a year earlier, when inflation had just started to cool off in very high levels. Bank of America economist say that the latest inflation reading is encouraging and gives them confidence that the disinflation process is \"not a headache\". Now, taming inflation could not happen soon enough for consumers. The typical U.S. household spent $202 more in July than they did a year ago to buy the same goods and services. That's according to Moody's Analytics. The impact is even greater when you zoom out. Two years of high inflation has had a snowballing effect on family budgets. Moody's found that the typical household spent $709 more in July than two years ago. Again, that is to buy the same goods and services. This is just another reminder of how important it is to get inflation back to healthy levels as soon as possible. Rahel and Amara?",

Now, this is something that has been long sought after by gun control advocates. And as you said, it gets President Biden closer to his goal of universal background checks. Now, those who are advising the campaign also say that it does something that benefits President Biden.
