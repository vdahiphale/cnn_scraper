Well, imagine doingthat to a computer from the 1970s located 15 billion miles from Earth. That`s what a team of NASA scientists did to Voyager 1, a spacecraft launched in 1977 to gather data from the deepest recesses of our universe. Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, were only meant to last five years, but they`ve been sending back data from outer space for 46 years now. Or at least Voyager 1 had been sending back information until the end of 2023, when the space probe began experiencing some issues and sent a bunch of code that scientists just couldn`t figure out. Now, after some long-distance troubleshooting, NASA says Voyager 1 is operational again and sending usable information again for the first time in five months. Next we head to Minnesota, where a driver is thanking a group of good Samaritans for saving his life. He survived with only superficial injuries after fellow motorists saw an accident on the highway and jumped into action. Check it out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Drivers and passing vehicles rallied together to save him as the flames grew. After breaking the driver`s side window, they pulled him to safety. The driver was taken to the hospital, but reported no serious injuries, authorities say. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It`s the longest river in both China and all of Asia, with a length of 3,915 miles. It`s also the third longest river in the world, right after the Nile and the Amazon. What would you do if someone called your outfit gross? Well, in China, some young people would be thrilled, all because of a new trend on social media where young people are competing to see who has the dorkiest drip. It`s happening on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. Our Marc Stewart explains how this became a thing and why the hashtag gross outfit for work garnered more than 140 million views.

Part of a bigger online movement reflecting concerns of this current generation. We`ve been scouring social media and essentially young people are wearing what`s being called gross work outfits. We saw a young man wearing a flannel shirt and sweatpants, a young woman in pajamas and a bulky sweater. Business suits and high heels are out, puffy jackets and slippers are in. These videos that are circulating are going viral. It`s a reflection of protest, bad bosses, low pay and long hours in the workplace. An extension of sorts of the lie flat movement, rejecting consumerism and the office rat race. It`s a statement about the rough economy here in China. In fact, if you look at government data, the jobless rate for young people was nearly 15% in December 2023. Many young people don`t feel optimistic. Some of the postings online have messages such as my ugly outfit matches my salary. And how gross my work is, how gross will my outfit be? We`ve seen generations express themselves through art, music and writing. And for the current moment here in China, fashion. Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
