Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And we begin with this breaking news a deadly missile strike in the Syrian capital Damascus. Syrian state television says several Iranian military advisors were among those killed when a building was targeted today. Iranian and Syrian news agencies both saying Israel was behind the attack. The Israeli Defense Force, says they won't comment on the report. And you can see video from the scene that shows the building in ruins. We're also getting reports from the Lebanese state-run news agency that four people were killed when Israel targeted a car traveling near the border between the two countries. CNN's Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv, Israel. And Ben Wedeman is in Beirut, Lebanon. Ben, let's go to you first. What do we know about this -- the target of this strike in Damascus?",

So-called al-Quds Force, which is international or foreign branch, and they named four of those who were killed. One of them is Hojjatollah Omidvar, who appears to be the head of intelligence for the al-Quds Force in Syria. And this does seem to be a significant strike in terms of the seniority of this individual. Now, keep in mind that last month, on the 25th of December, there was a similar strike on Damascus, or rather a farm outside Damascus, killing also a senior advisor with the IRGC. And in the aftermath of that, or at least the Iranian say that this Monday, they struck what they called Israeli spy headquarters in Erbil, in northern Iraq, in retaliation for that strike itself. Now, it does appear that the Iranians who normally work through other allies like Hezbollah, like the Houthis, like militias, in Iraq, to strike the U.S. and Israel, it appears that Israel is going for the Iranians themselves. Now, this certainly does threaten to broaden the war that is raging in Gaza, but we're seeing ripples of that war here in South Lebanon, as well as in Syria, with the Houthis in the Red Sea, and in Iraq as well.

There are casualties among U.S. service personnel. We don't know how many casualties, we don't know the severity of those casualties. But it's -- at moments like this. And exactly as Ben was saying, you get the sense of the ripple effects, you get the sense of the escalation that Iran's -- that Israel strike and that they haven't claimed obviously, they, don't acknowledge that, but it has the hallmarks of them. That the strike in Damascus can be connected to something earlier in the week, and in the north of Iraq, and so on, and so on. But on days, like today, when you see the strike in Damascus early in the day, and then, the strike on U.S. troops later in the same day, you do get that sense of this sort of escalation at the moment. And to bring in the north -- the southern Lebanon, northern border of Israel, where I've been most of this week, you get a sense of that tension and escalation there. Hezbollah literally on the border, firing shoulder launch rockets at the homes of Israelis just inside the north of Israel. The tensions there, the tempo there is also gradually heating up, and that does create that big picture across the region of a -- of a drumbeat to escalation.",

Former President Donald Trump picking up a big endorsement last night from South Carolina Senator and one-time presidential candidate Tim Scott, as you see right there. Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley is going right after Trump at her campaign stops in the Granite State today. Meanwhile, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is spending his time in South Carolina, hoping a victory there will catapult his path to the GOP nomination.

The South Carolinian who appointed Tim Scott, Nikki Haley has also had a flurry of events over the course of today, as well trying to find any support that she can. Ron DeSantis is in South Carolina today, but as expected to be back in the state tomorrow. But when you go back to Nikki Haley for a second, polls have shown her within single digits of the former president, obviously, this is still a major hill to climb to challenge him in a way that he has not been challenged up until this point, especially coming off his dominating win at the Iowa caucuses. But what we've seen in the past few days is Nikki Haley going directly after Donald Trump, in a way that she really has not before, this particular week, yesterday, or today, in particular, talking about a rally that Trump held last night and criticizing him for what appeared to be confusing her for Nancy Pelosi when he complained that Nikki Haley didn't do more, didn't do a better job with January 6th, when she wasn't in D.C., and she wasn't even in the office at the time. Take a listen to some more of what Nikki Haley had to say to them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not saying anything derogatory.

The ones that were hesitating though, said it was because they didn't think she was going directly after Donald Trump, enough.So, we've sort of seen a little bit of that shift here.

Well, he has a big message for his supporters here, in New Hampshire, and that is to not get complacent.It's a similar message that he also used in Iowa, which was really warning voters to ignore the polls do not look at how high of a lead he has in this state. And to come out for him. He told his supporters last night at his rally in Concord, Manchester, that margins matter, and that he needs them to turn out for him on Tuesday. Now, part of that messaging, as well has been really recognizing the stakes in New Hampshire. Donald Trump and his team really do believe that if he can win in New Hampshire after winning in Iowa, that it will essentially end the primary early and force his rivals, namely, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. out of the race. Trump spoke about that last night in Concord. Take a listen to what he said. Oh, I don't think we have -- oh, we might not have this on. I will read. I can read for you what he said. He said, \"we'll finish it off is what he told that crowd in Concord, he said this could end it, get the big vote, it ends it. He also said, then we can focus on Biden and his thugs. Now, Fred, I can tell you that historically, Donald Trump has a point. If he were to win New Hampshire right after winning Iowa, he would be the first non-Republican or non-incumbent Republican, I should say, who had done so in 40 years. And so, that is really the hope for the campaign. Now, as Omar mentioned, as well, Donald Trump is really ramping up his attacks on Nikki Haley. He did that last night. He's going to continue to do that in his speech tonight. And throughout the rest of the weekend. He's been throwing cold water on the notion that she might be his V.P. arguing that she's not tough enough or smart enough to be president and really trying to undercut any momentum that she has in these final days before Tuesday.",

Attorneys for Alec Baldwin, say they are looking forward to having their day in court, after grand jury in New Mexico indicted the actor with two counts of involuntary manslaughter.The charges are in connection with the 2021 fatal shooting on the set of the Western film, \"Rust\". Baldwin had been rehearsing a scene and holding the gun that fired live ammunition, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin was initially charged a year ago, but those charges were dropped. Here to discuss is defense attorney Misty Marris, and stunt coordinator Scott Kasha. All right, good to see both of you. Let's begin with you, Misty.

Is that during this testing, when this forensic report was generated, it was done with a different gun that was -- made new parts. It was done with a sample, because the original gun was destroyed in the context of testing. So, the defense is going to have a lot of fodder to attack the results of that forensic report.

      "sentences": "So, I feel this was one of the most colossal break down of safety protocols, maybe in the history of film. There is a lot of blame to go around. And I feel Alec Baldwin has none of that blame.He is an actor. He is not supposed to know how a gun works. I'm the expert. OK? I'm an armorer. I'm a former police officer. I understand how guns work. There is a complicated kind of gun to work with the cowboy gun. It's not like your regular revolver where you just crack open the cylinder and you can see what rounds are in there. You have to open a little hatch and then spin the cylinder. It's not an easy gun to work with. So, let's start from the working backwards. The A.D. handed -- Dave Hall handed Alec Baldwin the gun, said, clean gun. Dave Hall is not authorized to handle weapons on the set. I, as the armorer and the only one. I give a talk for safety every time I walk on a set and I say I will not go up to your camera and touch your camera do not touch my props. OK? Do not touch my weapons. These are not toys. They are fun. Yes, everybody likes when I walk on set and I've got the cool stuff the A.R. 15s. But nobody is allowed to touch them. So, we have that right there. This is a modified gun. OK? First of all, the armorer should have been there, these guns should not have been left out. Jon-Eric Hexum, with a story I tell every single set I walk on, he picked up a gun, so I can't believe this director is making me stay late, put it through his head, pulled the trigger and killed himself. OK? He was joking around, but these are not toys. These are absolutely not toys. So, the armorer should have been there. Why it was loaded? I have no idea. There have been changes since Jon-Eric Hexum. And then, if we look at the gun itself. A common practice from some armorer, is not all of them, is they use unmodified weapons. So, when I say modified, I mean modified where you can -- you can't put a real bullet in there. You cannot put a real round if you want it. OK? Any weapon I bring on a set, it is modified, so you can't put around in there. It's my understanding I have read somewhere that this gun was modified, so we could fire it quicker. So, you could do kind of a quick draw scenario, you could press the trigger, and you slit -- you take the hammer back like you see in these old west movies where they fire, hammer fire it. That made it easier to fire. So, Alec Baldwin story of getting caught on his shock it's very plausible in my -- in my expert opinion. How the rounds get there? I have no, no idea. Hannah Gutierrez Reed, OK, was very inexperienced. If you can't tell the difference between a live round and a blank, you should not be an armorer. Plain and simple. She -- there is her fingerprints I've read on it in article in Vanity Fair. Her fingerprints are on at least one round. If you cannot tell the difference, I don't know what to say, you should not be an armorer. She should have shut down production right then in there. OK? She should have shut down production right down in there, done an inventory of every round, and then, production could resume. But you tell -- you tell the production, look, I found a live round. We cannot go forward with anything involving firearms.",

That trial is scheduled to go forward. And I think it a month from now. And so, it's coming up.And we might learn some more of these questions. But Scott Brooks (PH) brings up great points because some of the other issues that are going to take front, center stage in this trial will be her qualifications. Was she qualified in that role? And again, how those live rounds got on set is the unanswered question that we have not learned from what's out there in the public. And I would expect the defense of Alec Baldwin to really be focused on that. And look, it's going to be a blame game. It's going to be, this person, that person, the other person, whoever is responsible to cut up the criminal culpability. And on that front, Fred, you hit the nail on the head, you might want to sit in my seat as a lawyer. One of the questions is going to be what were his role as a producer in the hiring of the staff assessing qualifications? He said he didn't have those responsibilities.

You saw him in Allentown, Pennsylvania, going from small business to small business, trying to speak with the owners about what he calls a small business boom and just last week, he was in battleground state, North Carolina, and he actually dropped by an individual's home for what the campaign called a kitchen table talk about his efforts to reduce student debt. And what Biden's campaign advisers say is that they're using this time, ten months before the election day, to really try and figure out new ways of putting Biden among the people, trying to interact with people because they do say this is sort of his secret weapon. It highlights his best at attributes. His ability to connect at a person to person level with voters in a way that sometimes his speeches haven't necessarily been able to do. And you did mention this disconnect. There is all kinds of signs the economy doing well, whether it's consumer sentiment, whether it's inflation easing, whether it's the stock market reaching record highs, but President Biden hasn't necessarily been able to improve his own approval ratings. And so, the real question going forward is whether these attempts to try and connect with voters will breakthrough, will help Biden improve his standing ahead of next year's election.

They're getting awarded zero delegates because of the way they went against the Democratic National Committee's calendar, that they upset a nominating calendar that was preferred by President Biden and his team where Carolina goes first among all the other states.But it could have a symbolic impact. Obviously, there is a write-in campaign that's being waged and how significant that, how significant the margins are, how you know, how many people write in Joe Biden or variations of acceptable answers for Joe Biden compared to people who actually vote for Dean Phillips or other Democratic candidates in the race. That could signal some sort of, sign of, you know, enthusiasm for the current president. But the official line is, you know, this is a primary that doesn't really matter. They're not getting any delegates. He's obviously not, you know, the Biden campaign is not formally competing in the state and right now for them, all eyes are on South Carolina. President Biden is traveling there for a Democratic Party dinner and that's a state they are focusing heavily on to kick start their campaign and kick start the road, the road campaign for President Biden this year.",

He's got a rally every day, which is a busiest stretch of campaigning he's had since joining the race essentially. And he's really trying to make the case that Nikki Haley does not have what it takes to be president. Last night obviously he had Tim Scott on stage and just reported that they're expecting the bring Governor McMaster and a bunch of other South Carolina Republicans here which will be a twist of the knife to Haley to show she doesn't have much political support at home.I think Haley is really focused on making stops connecting with voters and making the case there needs to be an alternative to Donald Trump in this race. I think it's also worth northing that Governor DeSantis has essentially signaled that he's shifting his focus away from New Hampshire where he has not been polling well, and he's focused on South Carolina. My colleagues have reported it seems like he's clearing a pathway to drop out because it's going to be an expensive fight to go for another month especially after putting up what is expected to be a middle finish here. I think the big question here is how many independents come out on Tuesday and whether those people are as moderate as the Haley campaign is expecting and whether they will ultimately support her.",

A motion filed by the Los Angeles Innocence Project says key evidence was withheld from his first trial.
