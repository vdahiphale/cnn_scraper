Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Israeli military action continues to devastate the civilian population in Gaza. A three-day siege at Al-Shifa Hospital is ongoing, though thousands are sheltering there. The IDF claims the site is being used by Sidja (ph) Hamas terrorists and says it's killed 90 of them. The bombardment is pushing Gaza towards a devastating humanitarian crisis. A U.N.-backed organization reports that half of Gaza, which is more than a million people, are on the brink of catastrophic hunger. The British Foreign Secretary, David Cameron, says the status quo is unsustainable. And earlier this week, the U.S. National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, had even harsher words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  Instead of pause to reevaluate where things stand in the campaign and what adjustments are needed to achieve long-term success, instead of a focus on stabilizing the areas of Gaza that Israel is cleared so that Hamas would not regenerate and retake territory that Israel has already cleared, the Israeli government is now talking about launching a major military operation in Gaza. More than a million people have taken refuge in Rafah. They went from Gaza City to Khan Younis, and then to Rafah. They have nowhere else to go. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's be clear what kind of items we're talking about. A pair of scissors for use in a health center. My own organization has doctors, orthopedic surgeons working in one of the hospitals, not the Al-Shifa Hospital, another hospital in Gaza, but they lack the most basic, the saline drips, the saline at all, the most basic implements with which to do their work.

However, secondly, we cannot be in a position where the complicated search for a ceasefire precludes other action in the interim. And that's why I went through the detail for you of the truckloads, of the limitations, of the turning back, of the dual use, of the passage of trucks inside Gaza. But it's not just how many go across the border, it's their ability to get to people and then people to get to the food that's needed. Remember, this is a legal as well as a moral imperative and a legal right that these people have, not just to life and limb to survival, but to aid delivery. And here's the most shocking thing.

And that's why the urgency for the U.N. Security Council is not just to be -- to work on the ceasefire, it's got to work on these very practical, very localized decisions. Because here's the thing, the amount of aid that went in in February, according to David Cameron reporting to the House of Commons, was half that that went in in January.

And that leaves the whole of the region less safe rather than more safe. That is the fundamental fear. We have operations in Lebanon. We have operations in Syria. We have operations in Iraq. We have operations in Jordan, humanitarian operations. And I was in Jordan recently, and obviously the whole region is roiled by this. And so, the humanitarian imperative is not just a moral one.

A poll that month from the Jewish People Policy Institute found that 26 percent of Israelis advocate the reconstruction of the Gush Katif settlements after the war is over.

Since 1949, the State of Israel itself joined to this convention on genocide and actually recognizes the authority of the ICJ in investigating such accusations. So, for me, it was very clear that the ICJ is the authority to investigate the ongoing in Gaza and not the Israeli government itself. That was one thing. The other is that in the appeal of South Africa, as well as in a petition that I joined, and eventually, by the way, there were almost 1,000 Israeli citizens who signed this petition. There was a very clear call to stop the war. We all know that the death toll of Palestinians in Gaza is more than 30,000. And there are also Israeli soldiers and hostages. We want everyone to live. We don't want victims anymore. So, it was very clearly for me.

Because, again, some people believe that if I'm against the wall and against the occupation, that means that I support the crimes of Hamas. Absolutely not. So, I want to be very clear about that too. So, three or four days before the massacre committed by Hamas, I visited the Jordan Valley, some pastors, you know, communities of Palestinian ones in the West Bank. And I realized then that already four communities were totally eliminated. They had to flee because of the ongoing daily progress committed by settlers under the auspices of the occupation forces.
