Now, at least eight former top Trump White House aides, including his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, along with top aides, Stephen Miller and Dan Scavino, all must testify in that criminal investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And a barrage of rockets targeting a U.S. base in Syria. New attacks only one day after a drone affiliated with Iran killed a U.S. contractor and wounded six others.

Any moment, President Biden is set to hold a news conference along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. They are both in the capital of Canada, Ottawa. The pair is expected to take questions from reporters. We will cover that live. One topic likely to come up, tensions with Iran after that suspected Iranian drone strike killed an American contractor and wounded five service members in Syria just yesterday. President Biden ordered a retaliatory airstrike, although the Pentagon clarified the U.S. is not looking for war with Iran. Again, we'll bring that news conference to you as soon as it begins, but until then, let's turn to our politics, lead and our other major story of the day, a federal judge handing a significant blow to Donald Trump today, rejecting the former president's claims of executive privilege in that January 6th investigation. The judge ordering a number of Trump's former top White House aides to testify before a grand jury, sources tell CNN. The list includes, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, former national security adviser Robert O'Brien and others. Some of these aides have already testified, but now they're likely before forced to appear before the grand jury once again for even more testimony and ordered to turn over more documents. But as CNN's Jessica Schneider reports, Trump's legal team is expected to try to appeal this decision.

Let's talk about the start, with the judge telling all these Trump people that they have to testify, sources say Trump's legal team they're expected to appeal. Do they have a case to make an executive privilege case? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:  No, they don't. Jake. They certainly have the right to appeal, but they're not going to win. They've got two major problems. First of all, executive privilege is meant to design to protect governmental conversations about legitimate policy, legitimate strategy. It's not designed to cover up for disclosure about malfeasance or wrongdoing or criminality. This is a criminal grand jury subpoena. Judges are very likely to enforce those subpoenas, very unlikely to allow an assertion of his executive privilege. And second of all, Trumps a former president. And while a former president can exert executive privilege in very narrow circumstances. It is a stark uphill climb to do that.",

You won't be incriminating yourself.And then you go to and then what do I do if I'm Mark Meadows and what do you do as the prosecutor? HONIG:  So this is not optional. If a prosecutor gives Mark Meadows immunity, he has to testify. It doesn't matter whether he wants immunity or not. And if he refuses, if he just says, you can't force the words out of my mouth. Then we're in a contempt of court situation and you made those who remember history may think of Susan McDougal, who was a witness in the Clinton investigation, the Whitewater investigation. She went to prison for 18 months for refusing to testify.

There's a good chance I'm told that he will address it himself at the beginning of his remarks before this press conference, and that would be his first public response to the drone attack that killed an American contractor and wounded U.S. service members.I think the real question right now as this is kind of loomed throughout this 27-hour trip into Canada, it was a packed schedule throughout, but on the president's way up here on air force one is when he was first briefed about these attacks, was given the options to respond and ended up choosing the option that he did with the F-35 last night is what happens next. And I think that is a looming question has been out there. His national security team has obviously been engaged throughout the course of the day in a series of meetings with their Canadian counterparts, but this has still been a significant issue that they've been dealing with as well. Now, he will be standing side by side with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau coming after lengthy remarks to the Canadian parliament, where he really underscored the warmth and to some degree that necessity of the relationship with the brother to the north if you will. But underneath, there certainly have been a series of policy issues that they've been trying to figure out resolutions. Though the president making clear, though, to some degree that those challenges that they face in the bilateral side of things are challenges that are addressed through the mode of friendship, not necessarily adversarially. You might not reach agreements on everything, but the relationship remains intact and the broader state of the relationship with which one has officials made clear they really wanted to elevate the importance of in the steadfast nature of it during this trip was certainly laid out in great detail by the president in his remarks. But I think, again, looming over everything has been these strikes and I thought would Secretary Esper said prior is also a critical question at this moment as the president deals with this series of geopolitical issues right now, the fact that Iranian proxies have conducted more than 78 attacks since 2021 on U.S. service members. At the same time, Iran itself has rapidly advanced in terms of their ability to weaponize -- enrich weaponized uranium certainly creates a significant issue that has been looming over. Not just this visit, but really the entire administration, national security team, Jake.",

And yet this issue has certainly been kind of front and center at least talk to the side a little bit throughout the course of his more than a day here, and certainly something he'll have to address not just at this press conference, but in the days and weeks ahead.And as you noted earlier in the show, that's whether or not there will be another response. Give and what we've seen since the initial drone attack is still very much a live question right now as they weigh options, even in the midst of these very serious and significant bipartisan bilateral talks, Jake.",

But then he said, something we didn't know, which he said is, he thinks it would only take about two or three months for the Iranians to actually fabricate that into a weapon.

It seems in their toolbox to deal with it, except for what we are seeing here on the ground in Syria, which is airstrikes to fire back at some of these attacks. But that's not a containment strategy.
