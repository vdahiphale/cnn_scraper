I think the German example you just mentioned is especially complex here. The coalition run by Scholz that has three parties in there, the center left, center right, and the Greens together scored less than their opposition parties, CDU, CSU, Merkel's party that sits at the EPP in Brussels, and you have a federal election coming up a year away, it makes that coalition's ability now, I think, to legislate in Germany all the more complex.

But I think the broader question is the kind of adherence to, or proximity to Russia and the way in which the Ukraine conflict will play out moving forward. And along those far right lines, there are divisions there as well. And I think that moving forward, thinking about Europe as a kind of security space, is going to be the number one challenge in bringing unity.
