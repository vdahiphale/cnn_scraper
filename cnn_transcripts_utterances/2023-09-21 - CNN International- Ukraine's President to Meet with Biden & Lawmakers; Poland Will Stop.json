Just ahead Ukraine's President heads to Capitol Hill, while he's looking to shore up critical support from U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.This is Ukraine season escalating dispute with neighbor and ally Poland with a grain imports. The latest on that, plus King Charles addresses the French Senate pledging longer stronger relations between the U.K. and France. We're in Paris with all the details on that state visit. Well, in just about an hour Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, will meet with U.S. lawmakers in Washington. It's the next stop on his whirlwind visit to the U.S. that included an address to the U.N. General Assembly whilst in Washington Mr. Zelenskyy will also meet with President Joe Biden at the White House. Mr. Biden is trying to shore up support for $24 billion aid package for Ukraine. But some Republican lawmakers aren't on board. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): If there's a path, if there's some path to victory in Ukraine, I didn't hear it today. And I also heard that there was going to be no end to the funding requests. And can I just say, by the way, I'm sick and tired of hearing all of these people in that room for the administration applaud Congress for being so generous. This isn't our money. For heaven's sake, it's not our, we're not being generous. It's the American people's money, and they spent 115 billion of it and so far, they have basically nothing to show for it.

      "sentences": "Well, CNN Congressional Correspondent Lauren Fox joins us on Capitol Hill with the details and these meetings with some Republicans are absolutely key, aren't they? Because there's some suggestion that Zelenskyy himself might become a partisan issue. LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENTAll members of the Senate are invited but when Josh Hawley, the man that you just saw, talking about Ukraine aid was asked if he was going to attend that briefing, he told my colleague Morgan Rimmer just a couple of days ago, he wasn't sure if he was going to show up. Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, where there are even more conservatives who are opposed to more funding for Ukraine, there is not going to be a House wide meeting with President Zelenskyy. Instead, the meeting this morning in the house will be with Republican and Democratic leaders and key Chairman, giving Zelenskyy fewer opportunities to talk directly and make his case to some of those detractors. The other question, of course, is that this is going to be a very different visit than the one that he had just last less than a year ago last December in which he was greeted on the House floor was able to talk to the full House of Representatives and support has started to dwindle. There's also a question of whether or not Kevin McCarthy who is facing a rebellion on his right flank is going to be willing to cross those members and put Ukraine aid on the floor. House Republicans are currently trying to rally around a spending bill to avert a government shutdown. But the latest draft of that one month spending bill doesn't include additional money for Ukraine. So those are some of the challenges that Zelenskyy is going to face today. It's just a very different political landscape up here on Capitol Hill than it was last December when he came and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was in charge, Max.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Max. And amid all of the diplomacy in the talks in New York, perhaps this wasn't something that Zelenskyy was expecting. What's happened here is that it started with a green dispute, like you mentioned.So Ukraine has been exporting their grain at a cheaper price. And that has been undercutting the grain prices in for example, Poland, but also in other countries in Europe. Now, what Poland decided to do was ban the import of Ukrainian grain as a result, understandably, for Ukrainian leadership. We're not too happy about that. So what's happened since is the European Union just last week decided to suspend that ban But Poland and a few other countries have decided they will defy that and continue not importing Ukrainian grain. That is where the dispute started. But it has now led to the Polish Prime Minister saying they will no longer be supplying weaponry to Ukraine. And clearly all of this escalation is not ideal for the Ukrainian leadership as they are trying to persuade U.S. lawmakers to give them more agents. So it's notable today, we've seen potentially a sign of a climb down from the Ukrainian side, a less alarming language. Clearly, there was a call just today with Ukrainian -- ministry. The minister there called his counterpart in Poland, they had a conversation. And at the end of that he had a statement which said they discussed the situation and Ukraine's proposal to resolve it. So, clearly Ukraine now saying that they are considering other methods to resolve the situation, rather than continuing on the offensive effectively the language yesterday from Ukrainians leadership was really quite strong, saying that this importation ban was unnecessary and unacceptable. So clearly, the situation is evolving, diplomacy is underway. But this is, as you mentioned, one of Ukraine, staunchest allies throughout this war and as a neighbor, a European neighbor that also fears Russian invasion. Poland has traditionally been very supportive of Ukraine throughout this war. And clearly any military equipment any support for Ukraine is something that Ukraine wants to maintain and support, particularly as we head into these challenging winter months, Max.",

You know, every Thursday, almost every Thursday, there's a weekly briefing chaired by the spokesperson of India's Ministry of External Affairs.Today, there was a weekly briefing, it was a packed room. Unlike the other days at least, I haven't seen something like this in the last two years or more. And that press briefing lasted for 45 minutes. And of the 45 minutes, 42 minutes plus was just spent on answering questions on the deteriorating tensions between India and Canada. And almost 35 plus questions were asked on that issue. Now very important to note here what you've also said right at the top is that India is temporarily suspending Visas to Canadian nationals. Now here's what the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Arindam Bagchi had to say when he was asked this question by a journalist. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ARINDAM BAGCHI, SPOKESMAN, INDIA'S MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS: You are aware of the security threats being faced by our high commission and consulates in Canada. This has disrupted their normal functioning. Accordingly, our high commission and consulates are temporarily unable to process Visa applications. We will be reviewing the situation on a regular basis. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They said with some diplomats having received threats in various social media platforms, Global Affairs, Canada is assessing its staff complement in India. As a result, and out of an abundance of caution, we have decided to temporarily adjust staff presence in India. Now that question again was put to the Indian government, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs did respond to it. And he said there should be presence, or rather there should be parity in rank is what he said, because there seem to be more diplomats. And the presence of Canadian diplomats in India seems to be a lot more than that of India, in Canada. So, huge developments happening day by day, Max, as you pointed out, and the tensions really going south between the two nations. No word from the Indian Prime Minister yet. But this was the first official press briefing where a lot of questions were asked on this route and a lot of very strong worded statements there from the Ministry of External Affairs, back to you.",

He actually spoke about Queen Elizabeth in a speech in the Senate this morning in thanking all the tributes that poured in from France because she was a hugely popular figure.Now Charles is trying to define his new role, but it constantly refers back to the Queen because he wants to create a sense of continuity in the monarchies. That's what he's there for. But he's also there to stamp his own mark on his own monarchy. So he's going in there finally a bit more about France. But this is all about solidifying those relationships between France and the U.K. to key allies have been some pretty tense moments in the relationship, particularly politically since Britain left the European Union on the second day of the state visit here to France. The King did address the Senate passionate speech switching between French and English, praising the two countries commitment to democracy and freedom in Ukraine actually, what he called the biggest challenge of our time, as well, which is climate change.

Certainly, if you compared it to his mother, who wouldn't have got involved in issues like that at all, he did very much talking about how Ukraine must win the war. What do you make of that as a slight difference in this monarchy?I think he is, in some ways, a little bolder, a little readier to say what he thinks on important issues, whether it's climate change, whether it's about the political relationship, or whether it's about the importance of Ukraine, winning against the Russian invasion. So of course, as the Head of State visiting France first official visit, his remarks would have been cleared in advance with the government so there isn't a gap there isn't a problem. There isn't any sort of political tension there. But he is indicating not only I think, a personal view, but also the view of the British government. But you're right I think he goes a little bit further on some of these important issues than we used to expect from the late Queen.",
