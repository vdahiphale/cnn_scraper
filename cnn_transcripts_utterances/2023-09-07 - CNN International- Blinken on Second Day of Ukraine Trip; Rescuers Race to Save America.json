Just ahead, the U.S. Secretary of State continues his visit to Ukraine as Russia slams Washington over the decision to send depleted uranium munitions to Ukraine more on the controversial weapons also ahead.Bad news for President Biden a new CNN poll reveals numbers that could spell trouble for his hopes for re-election in 2024. And a rescue is underway for an American man trapped in one of Turkey's deepest caves. America's top diplomat is striking a positive tone when it comes to Kyiv's grinding counter offensive now in its fourth month. A U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on a second day of his trip to Ukraine. His first stop was a border guard facility on the outskirts of the capital. He later visited a de-mining center. Blinken says that Washington agrees with Kyiv that its forces have been making real military progress in recent weeks. CNN's Melissa Bell joins me now live in the Ukrainian capital. They keep emphasizing this progress, because it's so slow, isn't it? But they don't want to give the impression that Ukraine is falling back in anyway.",

      "sentences": "That's right and in fact, and Secretary Blinken had arrived here with the American assessment, Max, that real progress was being made. He was here he said to hear from the Ukrainians himself President Zelenskyy had been to see the troops in the eastern front on Tuesday.And what he reported back to Antony Blinken was positive progress. So a much more upbeat assessment from the Americans than we've had over the last few weeks when there had been criticism of the way the Ukrainians were going about this counter offensive and the progress that they were making. What Antony Blinken also announced was this fresh package, a billion dollars, Max, of American aid, part of it military aid, some of that made up of Pentagon stockpiles of the kinds of munitions that the United States believe and equipment that will help the Ukrainians make progress against those formidable Russian defenses. We've been speaking so much about these last few weeks. In that package, of course, as you mentioned, those controversial depleted uranium munitions. Now, when the United Kingdom had announced that it was going to send some last March, Vladimir Putin had reacted in person. There would be a reaction to this, it would not go unnoticed. And so inevitably, a reaction came today to the latest announcement by the United States. It came from Sergei Ryabkov, the Deputy Foreign Minister who slammed the decision, calling it a criminal act and showing that the United States had no regard at all for the environmental consequences of what he was doing in Ukraine. What the American administration believes is that these kinds of munitions which really allow the penetration of the kind of armor that surrounds tanks, for instance, could help Ukraine make a difference. It follows of course, just a few months after their controversial decision as well to send cluster munitions. It is up for Western allies all about helping Ukraine now at this critical juncture, and its counter offensive, Max, to penetrate those deep Russian defenses, and help Ukrainians make the progress that they need, Max.",

But studies show that actually, the uranium that's used in depleted uranium shells is less radioactive than naturally occurring uranium.And naturally occurring uranium then has to be enriched to put it in a state where it can be used in nuclear power stations and all these sorts of things. So there's that word, and this is what the Russians are reacting too, as we heard them react to over cluster munitions when the British then they're challenged to tanks. They come with depleted uranium shells, as Melissa was saying, depleted uranium shells punched through heavy battle armor and concrete too. This is a stuff of that --",

And the reality is that the effort to decriminalize abortion in Mexico has been going on for years, especially in major cities like the capital Mexico City where abortion rights groups have taken to the streets to say things like my body, my decision, we've heard that for many years now.In fact, by the time the Mexican Supreme Court issued a ruling Wednesday to criminalizing abortion at the federal level, and you mentioned this at the beginning, 12 states out of, a total of 32 had already invalidated laws banning abortion. In a statement announcing the ruling, the court said that banning abortion is unconstitutional because, \"it violates the human rights of women and people with the capacity to gestate\". Pro-Life groups in Mexico blasted the ruling as you can imagine, saying that there are millions more Mexicans who are in favor of life from the moment of conception until natural death. On the other hand, the so called Green Wave groups in favor of abortion said that they were celebrating the decision and call that a major step in advancing women's rights. Now, Max, the Supreme Court's first ruled that it was unconstitutional to criminalize abortion in 2021 in September of that year in 2021. As a matter of fact, exactly two years ago today, the Court issued a decision on a law enacted in the Northern State of Guatemala which said that women who get an abortion may be punished with up to three years in prison and a fine. But in any case, and many pro-abortion groups celebrating today in Mexico, Max, back to you.",

I want to go a little bit in depth into that video, Max. It's all right. You can see it was released by local law enforcement just yesterday for the first time. Cavalcante putting his hands up against one wall, his legs up against another and as you said, crab walking up to the roof. Law enforcement officials say he ran across the roof, push through multiple layers of razor wire up there and ultimately escaped. And law enforcement said the tower guard on duty did not see the escape or report it which means that basically Cavalcante had an hour head start after he escaped out of the prison last Thursday. And Max, there's also an interesting point that I want to mention here. This escape that happened just a week ago is very similar to an escape that happened at the same prison about four months ago back in May. Law enforcement officials say that they put in security measures to prevent further escapes after that one in May. But obviously that did not work out. Now after that second big question. Where is he now? State police here are still searching the area they have actually expanded their search area from what was a somewhat limited search radius over the weekend. There have been multiple sightings, the last setting though on Tuesday night the manhunt right now still underway. But honestly intense heat and humidity have been challenges for law enforcement as they continue this search, Max.",

As far as the economy is concerned, nearly 60 percent of voters think the President's actions are making things worse.And here's one more bitter pill even Democrats don't really want Mr. Biden as a candidate. Almost 70 percent of Democratic and Democratic leaning voters would support somebody else, anybody else as the Democratic nominee. Voter fatigue is certainly present. So is President Biden a liability for the Democratic Party? Let's bring in CNN Political Director David Chalian to break down all of the numbers.

We'll open ended question, what's your biggest concern about Biden as a candidate. 49 percent say that his age, 7 percent mental sharpness, 7 percent health, all sorts of interrelated there. Also, we asked more broadly beyond Democrats to Americans overall, if there are serious concerns that his age might negatively affect his ability to serve as President, look at that nearly three quarters of Americans say yes.
