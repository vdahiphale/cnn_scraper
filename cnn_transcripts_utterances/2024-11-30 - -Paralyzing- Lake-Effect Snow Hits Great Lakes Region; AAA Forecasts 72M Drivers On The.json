Lake-effect snow is topping 3 feet in parts of the Great Lakes region, with the worst still to come. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro just issued a disaster declaration for Erie County after heavy snowfall shut down several highways in that area. And nearly 2 million people are under snow warnings throughout -- through the weekend and all the way to Monday. Meteorologist Allison Chinchar is here with the latest forecast.

We're starting to be able to actually see the lake in the background. But again, it just kind of goes to show you what you're actually seeing in these areas.So now we take a look at the radar. You can see a lot of those lake effect bands, again, continuing to make their way across the region in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, all of them. However, the heaviest bands have really been focused across portions of Lake Erie as well as Lake Ontario. And some of these spots have already picked up several feet of snow. Take a look at this. Northeast Pennsylvania, 42 inches of snow. You've also got Ashtabula, Ohio, picking up 39. Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, all of these places already picking up well over 2 feet. And we still have the rest of the day today and all of tomorrow to continue to see more snow. You've got all these winter weather alerts in place across the Great Lakes. But then also this swath a little bit farther south. Totally separate system here. And it stretches from St. Louis kind of down through Louisville, Kentucky and over into West Virginia. Now, that particular system is not going to have quite the levels of snow that we're talking farther north. Most of these areas, about 2 to 5 inches, whereas farther north, now we're talking 2 to 5 feet of snow. And that's to take in mind on top of what's already fallen. So when we say 2 to 5, we mean that's on top of the 2 to 3 feet that's already come down in some of these spots. Not out of the question, especially some of these areas in and around Watertown, they could see as much as 6 feet total when it's all finally said and done. And it's the cold air in place that's really what's been fueling that lake effect snow. But even if you don't live near the lakes, you are likely going to see that cold air as well. 70 percent of the U.S. population is expecting those temperatures at or below freezing in the next few days. But look at how far south that spreads. Look at this. Places like Tallahassee, Mobile, Alabama, all looking at freeze alerts in place for tomorrow morning. That's how far south this cold air is expected to go. When you look at the temperatures themselves, people may say, OK, well, I know we're headed into winter, right? This is close. Now, this is where we would normally be, Fred, say, in mid to late January.",

So go in, make sure that your flights are still on time and that the airline has your information. And just know the Department of Transportation has new rules that went into effect in October. If your domestic flight is delayed by three hours or more, you can cancel for a full refund. You don't have to take a voucher. You can just try travel again. And that's six hours for internationally. So for some families, you might say, you know what, we're going to put our travel on hold this week. At least knowing that you can get a full refund is peace of mind.

He said that it was an excellent conversation but did not go into further details from there.But, look, I do want to take a step back and just explain kind of why this is so important. One, we know that Trudeau and Donald Trump know each other quite well. They worked together during his first term. They had a bit of a rocky relationship also as it related to trade while Donald Trump was trying to renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement. But, again, they have entered into a new agreement since then, the one that Donald Trump himself negotiated, the USMCA with both Canada and Mexico. Unclear how Donald Trump's new tariff threats could impact that deal that Trump negotiated himself. But all of this is something I know in my conversations when I talk to Trump's team, talk to those who work on the transition, that this is a huge priority for Donald Trump. Remember, he had promised throughout his time on the campaign trail that he was going to impose tariffs on countries he believed were maybe undermining the U.S. and wanting to really deal with inflation and improve the economy. And this is how Donald Trump believes he can do that. And so I think it's very clear that Trudeau took him seriously in order for him to fly and come to Florida to meet with him. I'd also just point out that this is the first G7 leader that is meeting with Donald Trump since the November 5th election.

She was able to avoid detection at two security screening stations. These had to do with her -- verifying her identity.Now, she did go through the initial TSA screening. Both her and her bag went through that initial TSA screening. But she was able to avoid detection at those two stations. One of which included the boarding process itself, actually getting on the plane without a ticket. Now, while she was on the plane, she was able to avoid detection as you mentioned by going between laboratories on what one passenger called a completely full flight. The airline crew only discovered her at the end of that flight when they had already arrived in Paris. When Paris authorities quickly took her into custody, and she will be sent back to the U.S. Now, one thing that could explain the security lapse is simply the high volume of people that were going through TSA security.

It started just this Wednesday. They took dozens and dozens of villages in the western part of Aleppo Province and within a matter of hours we're able to go from the western outskirts yesterday morning of Aleppo to the very center and beyond. What we've seen in the later hours of today is that they appear to be in control of Aleppo's international airport, which is no longer functioning. They've taken over key Syrian government facilities. It appears they've overrun the Iranian consulate in Aleppo as well. And now we're getting reports that rebel forces are moving south in the direction of Hama, which is the next largest city on the sort of the north-south axis that links Aleppo to the capital of Damascus. So definitely the government, which says that it's only a temporary situation and it's going to launch a counteroffensive against these rebel forces.

So you can count Hezbollah out of this. The Russians still have a presence in Syria. They still are using their air power to help the Syrian regime. But also their presence in Syria has been reduced as a result of the need for Russian forces to be taking part in the war in Ukraine. And finally, there's Iran, which was also a main backer of the Syrian regime. But what we've seen is, time and time again -- again and again, the Israelis have been targeting the Iranians.
