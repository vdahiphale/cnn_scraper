That means, it will be status quo for the administration of this drug, women can continue to take it up to 10 weeks pregnant, they can continue to receive it by mail and via telehealth visits with their health care providers, and the generic version will remain widely available. This is exactly what the Biden administration and the FDA, what they were asking for. They warned that if there were restrictions imposed on this drug at any point, there would be confusion and chaos. So, now, this chaos has really been averted. So where does this go from here? Well, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal appeals, they'll be hearing arguments on the underlying issue in this case, and the underlying issue is whether the FDA properly approved mifepristone in 2000. Those first briefings in the appeal, they actually must be filed with the Fifth Circuit next week. And the case, as a whole, is being fast track because arguments are set for less than a month from now on May 17th. But regardless of what the Fifth Circuit decides, any possible changes to the drug, are being put on hold indefinitely by the Supreme Court order. So, women can continue to fully access mifepristone until the Supreme Court acts again, at some point, which wouldn't be for months, if at all, guys.",

So, let's start with the political potency of this decision. And we're going to start at the White House, where Kevin is now. The President, as we're expecting he will announce his re-election campaign next week, has an enthusiasm problem.Is this an issue that can close that? And is it something that this President is comfortable with? We can note that the president didn't say publicly the word abortion until more than a year into his administration. Is this something that can energize the Democratic Party? Is he comfortable with it? CATHERINE LUCEY, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: This is absolutely an issue that's going to energize Democratic voters. And we've seen it happen already, right, Victor? I mean, we saw this in the midterms, heading into the 2022 midterms. There was a lot of chatter and discussion about how this was going to be a bad cycle for Democrats, about how issues around inflation in the economy, were going to really dominate. And we really saw a much better than expected results for Democrats. A big reason for that was anxiety around abortion access. And we saw it again, more recently in this Wisconsin judicial race. So, we know, we have, we have, we have data. We know that this is an issue that energizes Democrats, Democrats are concerned about the polling around mifepristone that shows, you know, the majority of voters want there should be access to that drug. And, and Democrats know that. Democrats are really running on this issue. There's an expectation that this is going to be a big issue in 2024. And that this is really something that gets their base out. And to your question about President Biden, yes, he is someone who tried his career has not always been the biggest -- this has not always been the front-of-mind issue for him. It did take some time as President to say the word \"abortion,\" as you noted, but he has come out very strong on this recently. You saw his statement last night (INAUDIBLE) mifepristone. Both he and the Vice President had been vocal on this, and this is going to continue to be a big, a big focus for them.",

That's why they're asking for the F-16, but they need more than that. They need air defense, in particular, because when they roll out these brigades, they're going to be vulnerable to Russian airpower. Russians also, by the way, have a strike force -- 20, 30, 40 battalion tactical groups that have been held back for over a year, that they are waiting to apply.

These 18 attorney generals from 17 states in Washington, D.C. found this issue so alarming and deadly. They sent a letter to the Highway Traffic Safety Administration, calling on Kia and Hyundai to recall 11 years of vehicles on the market. YURKEVICH (voice over): That puts that number in the millions. And these vehicles have become so easy to steal, according to these attorney generals. They are causing serious safety issues, including eight deaths, injuries, property damage, and the diversion of emergency services from other priorities to deal with these events. And in this letter, the A.G. say, Kia and Hyundai have not done enough to address this issue. The two automakers have been offering voluntary software updates to help with the theft issue. But these A.G. said this is not enough because it will take months to release all the updates and it isn't available for all their models. Now, Kia and Hyundai cars were so easy to steal that in 2021, a TikTok challenge started, called, the Kia Boys Challenge, where people would show just how easy it is to steal one of these cars. Now, the letter also notes that even more theft took place in 2022 across major cities, thefts of Hyundais and Kias in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, increased 836 percent and 611 percent respectively. YURKEVICH (on camera): Not to mention the absolute headache for the car owner whose car is stolen, and if they get it back, it's incredibly expensive to repair. Victor, Amara?",

It's also important to us that all 50 states have warmth. So, this isn't just a couple states here and there, all of the states have been impacted. [07:55:02] CHINCHAR: Now, when you look at the contiguous U.S., basically, the lower 48 as a whole. They've all warmed about 2-1/2 degrees Fahrenheit. Warmer than we were for the very first Earth Day back in 1970. And the reason that number is important is because it's dangerously close to that limits that we've always talked about, you know at all these COP -- you know, COP meetings that we have internationally speaking. And that number, the limit is 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1-1/2 degree Celsius. So, knowing that we're getting close to that, and the concern here is that when we set forth those limits, you know where we want it to be? We were looking decades into the future. The concern is that the last nine years in a row have been the warmest nine years on record. So now, the concern is, can we even make it to that 2030? 2050?
