      "sentences": "You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin with fears of growing escalation in the Middle East. The Pentagon says an Iranian attack drone struck a commercial ship operating in the Indian Ocean on Saturday. A U.S. Defense official says a fire broke out on the chemical tanker with nearly two dozen crew members on board, but no one was hurt. The strike comes as newly-declassified U.S. Intelligence suggests Iran has been deeply involved in a series of attacks by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is announcing a deepening of the conflict in Gaza saying the fighting will intensify until there's a victory over Hamas. At the same time, Israeli's military assault, one of the deadliest days of the conflict with 15 soldiers killed since Friday. The IDF says it struck more than 200 targets over the past day and killed several Hamas militants all this as mounting civilian deaths grow beyond 20,000 according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza. And we're covering this story from all angles. Let's go to Kevin Liptak who's over at the White House for us. Kevin, how are the U.S. and other players in the region responding to this attack on that chemical tanker? It's another provocation, it sounds like, from Iran. The question becomes does the Biden administration, does the U.S. respond at some point? What can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Yes. They are simply watching this. There's a heightened level of concern because it is fueling these concerns inside the administration that this conflict could widen any further.And I think this incident in the Indian Ocean really does underscore two things, Jim. One, this is the first time that the U.S. has directly accused Iran of one of these kinds of attacks since the October 7th terror attacks. Their focus previously had been on the Houthi rebel group inside of Yemen. And second, this is well outside of the Red Sea, that area that they had previously been focused on. So it does sort of underscore the concerns that these tensions, that this conflict could be spreading outside of that region. At the same time yesterday there were these continued incidents inside the Red Sea, certainly a tense and chaotic day there as well. CentCom saying that the Houthi rebels targeted a U.S. warship, a number of commercial vessels as well. So certainly the U.S. is watching this with a lot of concern. And what the U.S. has done is tried to organize this coalition to try and beef up security in the Red Sea because as well as the military concern, there's also economic concerns. You've seen a number of global ship companies cut off access to the Red Sea over concerns that their vessels could be targeted. And so what you've seen the U.S. do is apply sanctions on Iran, on the companies that back their drone program. You've seen the U.S. beef up its military presence in the region as well. But certainly this is something that they're still very much trying to get a handle on and certainly something that President Biden and all his top officials are watching as this holiday period unfolds, Jim.",

And I think it's an open question of why. Sort of underscoring all that is the concern that that could potentially escalate this conflict further.

We've just confirmed with an Israeli military spokesperson that they have recovered five bodies of male hostages, three of them military, two of them civilian. We know that they were found at the Jabalia refugee camp. That is in northern Gaza.Now we do not know the identities of these hostages as of yet, but we will, of course, continue to get more information about that, just another unfortunate development. But there are major developments to the south in southern Gaza at the Rafah Crossing with Egypt. Take a look at what happened just a few hours ago. Absolute chaos in the streets at that vital crossing where aid trucks come in from Egypt into Gaza. The crowds apparently so desperate to try to grab whatever aid they could get from the trucks, in a situation where you have the entire population of Gaza with acute food insecurity. A catastrophic level of people who just don't have enough to eat, the desperation, the anger, the outrage growing. People becoming so enraged that they were trying to run from the trucks with whatever they can have in their hands. We don't know how that gunfire erupted or exactly who was firing the shots. We don't know if anybody was hurt or killed. But clearly, if this video doesn't underscore just how desperate the situation is inside Gaza right now, all you have to do is look and listen, Jim.",

Is this where the gunshots were taking place? Or I mean, it looks like people are carrying aid on their shoulders and on their backs away from aid trucks.I'm just trying to get a sense as to, do we know if gunfire was going off because of that rush to get those supplies, or was this fighting that was going on near the scene?

They were trying to steal items off the trucks. We have other videos where you see people just with bundles of items in their hands. They might not have even known exactly they were grabbing for. But they grabbed what they could and they ran. And then at some point shots were fired and a lot of gunfire could be heard. We don't know who was firing the shot. We don't know where the gunfire came from. Those are all still unanswered questions but it really does underscore just how volatile the situation is inside Gaza right now, Jim?",

And by the way, the problems, Jim, are not just inside Gaza.Of course, Gaza is enduring the bombardment. They are enduring the ground combat. You have more than 20,200 people now reported dead by the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza. But there are also problems in other Palestinian areas here like the occupied West Bank. We visited there and the West Bank includes the very historic and iconic city of Bethlehem. This is where people normally would rush in huge crowds to celebrate the Christmas holiday. And yet unlike the mass hysteria you see there in Gaza, it is an absolute ghost town in Bethlehem because the city has essentially been blocked off. There are military checkpoints preventing tourists from coming in, although not a lot of tourists are wanting to visit there this stage. And it is really catastrophic for the people in that area who rely on Christmas tourism for their livelihoods, not to mention the overall feeling of sadness on what is supposed to be a special holiday.

Here in the U.S. Donald Trump is arguing that lobbying election officials to overturn the 2020 election was within his official responsibilities as president. That argument was part of a brief filed last night in which attorneys for the former president asked an appeals court to dismiss his criminal election subversion case, one day after the Supreme Court refused to decide for now whether he is protected from prosecution. In the filing Trump's attorneys argue that, quote, \"President Trump has absolute immunity, adding that under our system of separated powers, the judicial branch cannot sit in judgment over a president's official acts. That doctrine is not controversial,\" according to his attorneys. We should note as the question of as the question of immunity is being decided by an appeals court, it's clear the scope of presidential immunity is in fact quite controversial. CNN's Marshall Cohen is following all of these developments. And the Trump attorneys, they're trying to make this case for absolute immunity. What chances does that stand to have in the courts?

It's not just election overturning, where would it stop. They could do bank robberies, kidnappings, murder. That is inimical to American law. There's no hint of such absolute immunity anywhere in our Constitution, the prior cases of the Supreme Court. As you point out, if Trump's arguments were correct, Richard Nixon would have refused to resign because he wanted to take advantage of his absolute immunity and take his chances that Congress would acquit him.
