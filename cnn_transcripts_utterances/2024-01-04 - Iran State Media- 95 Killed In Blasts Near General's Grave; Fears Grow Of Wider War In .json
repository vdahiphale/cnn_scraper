Thousands had gathered to mark the anniversary of the death of military commander Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad four years ago. The twin blasts less than a mile from Soleimani's grave, killing more than 100 and injuring many more. Iranian officials say this was a terror attack. State media reporting that one of the explosions was caused by a bomb inside a suitcase in a car. Soleimani was Iran's revered top military general. This attack on his supporters seen as a strike against the Iranian regime, which has many enemies, both inside and outside the country. In Lebanon, the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah commemorated Soleimani's death. But also use his speech on Wednesday to condemn Tuesday's killing of a top Hamas official on his own soil. HASSAN NASRALLAH, SECRETARY GENERAL, HEZBOLLAH (through translator): Yesterday's crime was large and dangerous. This crime will not be left without a response and punishment between us and our enemies. There is time and the battlefield. BASHIR (voice over): The strike in southern Beirut targeted Saleh Al- Arouri and several others, in what Hamas has described as a cowardly assassination.

Another big task that is still taking place is locating what is known as the black box, the cockpit voice recorder as well as the data recorder on board the Japan Airlines Airbus. It can withstand the most intense of circumstances, such as a big explosion or a big fire as we saw with this aircraft -- with the Airbus. That still needs to be located. The Coast Guard's black box has been located though. So hopefully, we'll get some indication later today if the one belonging to Japan Airlines will have been found. Not a surprise, as we've seen from some of the pictures, what remains today of that Airbus, the Japan Airlines Airbus, is just a shell. Not a surprise, there are some delays taking place at Haneda Airport, some delays and cancellations from Japan Airlines. We do know that investigators from Airbus, the French company that is the manufacture of that plane, are here -- are in Japan, I should say, and moving forward on their role in this broader investigation. You know, Rosemary, despite these horrible scenes, air travel is the safest it's ever been. And that's because of redundancy, doubling down, extra steps to make sure that safety is not compromised. The key in this investigation is to see if there were any failures, anything that could've been prevented, so this certainly does not happen again. Rosemary? CHURCH: Yeah. Indeed, it's certainly still shakes the trust in the airlines though, doesn't it? Marc Stewart, joining us live from Seoul, many things from that report. Still to come, it's been days since a deadly earthquake in Japan. The extent of the damage is still unknown. We will show you the conditions hindering recovery, after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

Each year, people would come here to enjoy the seaside town and this market that I'm standing in right now. But after a very powerful earthquake struck Ishikawa prefecture on New Year's Day, thousands were forced to leave. Right now, we're standing in a part of the city where hundreds of buildings used to stand.But after that initial earthquake created a fire, all that remains are door frames and people's lives just among the incinerated debris. Those who do remain in the city are going house to house, trying to find any remaining survivors. And rescue operators who are coming to this prefecture are having a very difficult time because all the roads are either cracked or blocked off by landslides and trees.

It also brought winds of up to 130 kilometers per hour, knocking out power and interrupting train service. The Met Office has now issued a new severe weather warning for heavy rain, set to go into effect in the next few hours. Forecasters expect up to 50 millimeters of new rain across Southern England, which could cause more flooding and travel disruptions.And before we go, they said it was impossible, but after 34 years, someone has finally beaten Tetris on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and it was a 13-year-old boy.
