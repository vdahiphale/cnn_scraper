Sources tell CNN the two leaders will talk one-on-one at that time, although it's not clear if that meeting will take place in New York or Washington. The last time they spoke in person was on the sidelines of July's NATO summit in Lithuania. Ukraine's military is now reporting it has retaken a key village south of Bakhmut, and in its words, liquidated the Russian garrison there. It's being called a significant victory in breaching Russia's defenses. Ukrainian troops are often outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield, and it shows as both sides trade non-stop artillery fire across the frontline. CNN's Melissa Bell spent time with one unit and has this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Aiming for a specific target, the fury of Ukrainian artillery. Nothing in this war goes unseen. Not even the Russians walking into this house eight kilometers away. The target spared by a Ukrainian miss. As they try to move the Zaporizhzhia frontline forward, these gunners must now wait for better coordinates from the surveillance drone, even though they too are constantly watched and more often than not outgunned. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translated text): The Russians are learning. They copy our tactics. As soon as our guys strike, they strike back. They can respond to one of our howitzer with two or three of theirs. BELL (voice-over): And 20th century artillery is slow to move and far too easy to see with 21st century technology. MARIAN, GUNNER, 128TH MOUNTAIN ASSAULT BRIGADE (through translated text): There are a lot of enemy drones flying here. That's why we constantly hide our positions because when the enemy sees us, they start shooting. BELL (voice-over): Russian surveillance and attack drones are never far. But neither are Ukrainian ones, says Odesa, the battery's commander. \"ODESA\", BATTERY COMMANDER, 128TH MOUNTAIN ASSAULT BRIGADE (through translated text): We use aerial reconnaissance. We watch the flight of the shell and adjust (the gun) to hit target so we waste less ammunition. BELL (voice-over): Odesa tells his men to lower the gun one notch.

We've been talking about this attack on Sevastopol on Wednesday, the next day, Thursday, Russia reported 11 Ukrainian drones that they intercepted. And then just overnight, we've been hearing the Ukrainians say that they intercepted an air defense system in the Crimea area as well. All of this is being hailed. Zelenskyy described it as a triumph last night in his nightly address. There is a lot of messaging, public messaging from the Ukrainian side here that is saying this counteroffensive is very much still making progress and is very successful.And Crimea is key really. They've always focused on it. It's been annexed by illegally by Russia since 2014. And there's been a strategic logistical hub in Crimea for Russia during this war. So targeting these areas, for example, that ship repair facility in Sevastopol is key for hampering how Russia continues this war. Now Ukraine have argued that apparently, according to them, after this attack, they actually destroyed several ships, which resulted in Russia being unable to produce any more ships for this conflict. Now, of course we can't independently confirm that. I'm sure Russia would deny that. But that is the kind of ambition here that Ukraine are trying to achieve. They want to show and there is a lot of signaling here as well. It is not just about the achievements on the battlefield, it's what their allies see and what the West sees and where the U.S. see their money going. Remember, there's a $1 billion assistance package that has been put into Ukraine. Are they making these achievements? And they are showing with Andriivka, as you mentioned, that village they've just claimed to have recaptured. And also with Sevastopol that they attacked earlier this week, that they are still making some quite considerable gains.",

That's not just at the UN General Assembly, but also there are now reports he meant to be going and seeing him in Washington and DC meeting other members of Congress as well.And again, this is key because while the U.S. have been openly supportive of this war, Blinken, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in town just last week and President Biden is now considering giving these long-range missiles that could help Ukraine counteroffensive. There is some indication that U.S. public support is waning for funding this war, and that is obviously a concern for Ukraine and what Zelenskyy wants to see when he goes to the United States to talk about and ensure that that support is very much still there.",

Kim is expected to visit several military sites following his high stakes summit with the Russian President, fueling Western concerns about a possible weapons deal.The Kremlin has confirmed the two leaders will meet again in Pyongyang, but did not reveal exactly when.
