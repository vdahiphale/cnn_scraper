The storm pounded southern Jamaica with 215 kilometer an hour winds, torrential rains, and storm surge of almost three meters. The storm knocked down trees, damaged buildings, and knocked down power lines. And Jamaica's prime minister says the country isn't out of the woods yet. He warns heavy rainfall from the passing storm will likely still cause flooding, landslides and road damage.Hurricane Beryl is expected to pass just south of the Cayman Islands in the coming hours before heading to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Forecasters expect it to weaken a bit in the next day or two, but it's still an extremely dangerous major hurricane.

And the big danger is that there's a possibility of the ocean gettinginto the street because the storm surge is supposed to rise at least 10 feet. So these are very dangerous conditions here in Kingston, and of course authorities are asking people to remain and shelters. They tell us that nearly 500 people are in shelters right now. Again, this is only the beginning and you can tell how strong the winds are here in Kingston, Jamaica. And people are wondering here, why is this happening so early in the season, and after seeing what happened in Barbados and places like Grenada, they feel like it's possible that the same devastation seen there can be seen here as well.

We know recent polls, there are national polls, CNN, the Sienna poll, find that Trump is up six percentage points.That is a huge gap. And I know polls this far out from the election, but that is a big gap to make up. But more importantly, did Biden lose ground in key swing states?

So the overall number might not be catastrophic, but the pace at which that dropped is significant. But beyond that, I think the bigger percentage to look at is, and I'm not trying to make a case here.I'm just thinking like, if I'm Biden's advisees, I'm looking at the 72 percent of Americans who don't think he has a fitness. I'm looking at the 74 percent of Americans who think he shouldn't be in the race. At this point in time, even though the Democratic bench is very deep and there are lots of folks who could step up to the plate who would do better than Biden, it's risky to do it last minute. It's risky in terms of fundraising, and moving those funds over to go new candidate and selling that new candidate. And this is not somebody who's been tested and Biden has been tested, so there are all of these reasons why maybe Biden should stay in the race. And the biggest one may be being that people in positions of power don't like to give up power. That's why Donald Trump is running again. But at the end of the day, it looks bad for Biden.

You were talking about the bench, the Democratic bench.

I will say as somebody who researches the presidency and gender and race, being a woman of color means that she will have some barriers with some voters that are non-Democratic.But that's a fact. And so there are questions, though, about, OK, so let's say she's not the most competitive in the bench. If you pass her over, do you disaffect black voters? Do you disaffect voters of color in the Democratic coalition? So that's a risky move. There are lots of kind of safer bets with, you know, white men who are not going to face those barriers. I think, for example, like a Pete Buttigieg who's going to face LGBTQ Plus bias. Josh Shapiro is going to face Jewish bias. And if you're looking at this from a pure strategy perspective, you put a white dude in there who doesn't have any marginalized identities that might cause some voters to be turned off.

Taking a look at the European ensemble, and sometimes we make these all different colors because they're all different models. This is actually one model, but changing just a few different things in the model to make it react differently. The reason why they do that is to try to find where the center of the consensus is. So yes, there are some to the right that move on up to the north into parts of the Gulf of Mexico. And some to the left that go kind of squiggly and they all go the wrong way, just changing the wrong things in the model. But still, we get the same cone here. In the middle, we still get landfall here, likely as a category two, along the Yucatan Peninsula and then somewhere up into northern Mexico or southern Texas. Now, overnight tonight, we are seeing an awful lot of wind and waves in the Grand Cayman islands, from Cayman Brac all the way to Little Cayman and Grand Cayman itself.

And we will kick off today with two very big football competitions which are starting to get really interesting. The group stage of the Copa America in the United States was concluded on Tuesday with a box office clash between Brazil and Colombia. Now, Colombia are one of the formed teams in the world right now. They haven't lost in over two years and they were on a ten-game winning streak, but it was Brazil who went ahead. That's a stunning free kick from the Barce star, Raphinha. But Colombia drew level just before half time with a pretty nice goal of their own. That's Daniel Munoz on target. That is how it finished, one all. Colombia won the group. As a result, they are now 26 games unbeaten. Brazil have also advanced to the quarter finals.The defending champions, Argentina will be in action next. Lionel Messi's men will play Ecuador in the quarterfinals. Venezuela have Canada, Brazil play Uruguay and Colombia take on Panama. Both the Copa America and the European Football Championship have had the day off. The Copa's quarterfinal stage starts on Thursday. The euros will resume on Friday. This is how the draw in Europe is looking. And the games on Friday are just massive. Spain against Germany and then Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal against Kylian Mbappe's France. On Saturday, it's the other side of the draw, England against Switzerland and then the Netherlands against Turkey. Earlier, I caught up with our senior sports analyst, Darren Lewis, to preview the action and he thinks that Spain are looking like the team to beat. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

You've got to give an honorable mention to the likes of the Manchester City midfielder Rodri, undefeated with his club side for 18 months, and now very much the man who makes the Spanish tick.Also the sublime 21-year-old midfielder, Pedri, the incredible 16- year-old winger, Lamine Yamal, and the 21-year-old athletic Bilbao forward, Nico Williams. He scored that special goal as the Spanish fleet destroyed the Georgians last Sunday night. Just to give you a little stat here, the Spanish went 44 years without a major trophy before they lifted the Euros in 2008. Then they won the '22 on World Cup and then they won Euro 2012. And last year they were winners of the Nations League. This year, they look as though they could find themselves, Don, in a league of their own.",

My grandfather and Luz Long through their competition, actually became allies, became friends. Yes, eventually, my grandfather did win the gold, but Luz got the silver.
