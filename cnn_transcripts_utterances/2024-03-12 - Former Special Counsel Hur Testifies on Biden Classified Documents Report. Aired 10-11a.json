And that was also addressed in the report. So Robert Hur noting specifically the differences that he saw in these two investigations, in the handling of the documents by the former president. And of course, this was when Joe Biden was the former vice president. Writing that Mr. Trump not only refused to return documents for months but also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then lie about it. Michael, how much of that do you expect we will hear today, both an effort to talk about whether there is an apples-to-apples comparison between the two investigations and the handling of documents by Biden and Trump and also Hur's assessment.",

And so you'd think there's an apples-to-apples type of comparison in respect to the mishandling part of this investigation. The principle (INAUDIBLE) that which led to the charges against Trump and not against Biden was the obstructive behavior. I think, had Trump returned the documents in the same way that Biden returned them, he would not have been charged. But when he obstructed the investigation, it put the prosecutors in an untenable position and required them to bring criminal charges. And I think that we'll hear, from the Democrats, apples to oranges and from the Republicans, apples (ph) to apples with a different standard and, therefore, Trump is being persecuted and that whole mantra of Trump is being singled out for political purposes because he's the principal opponent, blah, blah, blah. Will be what we hear a lot of.",

      "sentences": "-- 2023. He had a fundamental question to address.Did Joe Biden unlawfully retain classified information? The answer, yes, he did. Page one of Mr. Hur's report he says this. \"Our investigation uncovered evidence that President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen.\" He further writes, \"Mr. Biden willfully retained marked classified documents about Afghanistan and handwritten notes in his notebooks, which he stored in unsecure places in his home.\" Joe Biden kept classified information and Joe Biden failed to store classified information properly. Mr. Hur made these determinations after interviewing witnesses and looking through emails, text messages, videos, phone records and other materials from both classified and unclassified sources. But there is more. Joe Biden not only kept information he was not allowed to keep and not only failed to secure that information properly but he also shared it with people who were not allowed to see it. He shared that information with his ghostwriter. And, remember, this is information that only individuals with a security clearance are supposed to see. Mr. Hur told us on the 200th page of his report that it is the kind of information that, quote, \"risks serious damage to America's national security.\" And what did Joe Biden have to say about all this? What was his explanation? On page 94 of Mr. Hur's report, Joe Biden said he took his notebooks with him after his vice presidency because, quote, \"they are mine. And every president before me has done the same exact thing.\" Never mind the fact he had never been president when he took this information but what comes through is Joe Biden felt he was entitled. You can almost hear it. You can feel the arrogance in his statement, \"They are mine.\" But even with all that, Mr. Hur chose not to bring charges because, quote, \"Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did in our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" A forgetful old man who Mr. Hur said did not remember when he was vice president, forgetting on the first day of the interview when his term ended and forgetting on the second day of the interview when his term as vice president began. Mr. Hur produced a 345-page report but, in the end, it boils down to a few key facts. Joe Biden kept classified information. Joe Biden failed to properly secure classified information. And Joe Biden shared classified information with people he was not supposed to. Joe Biden broke the law. And because he is a forgetful old man who would appear sympathetic to a jury, Mr. Hur chose not to bring charges. Mr. Hur, we think it is important that you be able to respond to President Biden's response to your report. So we will provide a short video of Mr. Biden's press conference after your report was released, because there are things in this press conference that the President of the United States says that are directly contradicted by what you found in your report. So if we can play that video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hey, everybody. (CROSSTALK)",

As a senator or vice president, Joe Biden did not have that. So now we get to this glaring double standard. I think it would be toxic to the rule of law on its face if it was just two ordinary citizens. But the fact that the only person being prosecuted for this offense happens to be the president's political opponent makes this a unprecedented assault on our democracy. This is worse than we could expect from a banana republic. And I wonder how you square this.",

I found your report very interesting and I learned some things about the law and the precedence. There are clear differences between the cases of -- in precedents set by Presidents Reagan, Trump and Biden. Now it was widely known that President Reagan kept diaries from his presidency that included classified information. What I did not know and learned in your report was that the Department of Justice, quote, \"repeatedly described the diaries in public court filings as Mr. Reagan's personal records, unquote, and that no agency ever attempted to remove his diaries. That is on page 185 of your report. Very interesting. So the investigation found that President Biden believed that his notebooks were his personal property, including work and political notes, reflections, to-do lists and more that he was entitled to take home. You found that on page 232. So while much of his notebook was work-related, he still had some purely personal subjects like -- again, I quote, \"gut-wrenching enterdies (ph) about the illness and death of his son, Beau,\" and that is on page 82 and 253 of your report. So it is clear, based on the Reagan president, that no criminal charges were warranted in this matter relative to personal notebooks. Now I want to be clear that, although the notebooks contain some very personal information and President Biden considered them his personal property, the president allowed your team to seize and review all of the notebooks you found. Is that correct?",
