And of course, it's important to remember that whilst they had been hoping to win this election and indeed become the biggest party here at the National Assembly in Paris, they still achieved their biggest ever victory, and they've doubled the number of seats that they have in parliament. And that's a pretty considerable feat for a party.Remember that a couple of decades ago, it had no MPs, little by little got more and more, changed its image, managed to hear and speak to the anger a lot of French people, especially outside of Paris, that find that times are hard economically, that feel that they're not listened to, really playing on that disenchantment, and it had looked after that first round, Max, like they'd actually finally achieved their hope of getting to the center stage of French politics. In fact, they're now the third largest force within parliament. They're bigger than they were. And they remain the force that is most likely to continue growing. And I think that's also something that's at the heart of the celebrations that we saw yesterday, Place Publique (oh). Everyone there was very excited that the left had come together, but also worried about the fact that this had been a coalition of circumstance and the deep down, perhaps the forces on the far right still remains strong and concerning, Max.",

The targets included a children's hospital in Kyiv that was hit during a rare daytime attack. One nurse described it this way, everything was in smoke. There was no air to breathe. Residential buildings and other facilities also badly damaged. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the exact number of casualties at the hospital isn't yet known and there are people under the rubble.

This is a very well-known location in Kyiv, the main children's hospital in that city, but also in all of Ukraine, a place where people would bring their children to get the most sophisticated treatment. We're seeing children having to evacuate, those who are undergoing treatment for things like cancer, having difficulty moving.This is -- there was also operations going on at the same time. A pediatric nurse telling CNN that they were midway through an operation on a two-year-old and had to essentially stop and sew the child back up without having completed the operation when the bomb hit. There was also another air raid siren several hours later which sent people running to the basement. We're now hearing that another medical facility in another part of Kyiv has been hit. We think preliminarily, according to officials there, by debris, but seven people that killed, according to the General Prosecutor's Office. So, an extremely deadly day, not just in the capital, but in other cities, and it was cities mainly targeted, the Defense Minister saying, during morning rush hour and involving overall some 40 or so missiles. All of this, Max, was happening on the eve of the NATO summit in Washington. This is leading, of course, to calls not only from Ukraine, but its allies for more to be done, and more quickly to provide the air defenses that could, of course, prevent these missiles from hitting their targets.",

It's hard to distinguish, of course, as I said, revenge from the general course of this war, and it is possible that this is being timed to coincide with the NATO summit.

It's not just coming from his Republican opponents. It's not just coming from voters. It's not just coming from people who have worked with him. It's coming from really across the board.And that is why the President this week faces such a critical week for his candidacy. He is really racing the clock to assure all of those parties that I just listed that he is up to the task. And as he said on Friday in an interview with ABC News, that his disastrous performance at the June 27 presidential debate was an episode, a singular event, not something that indicated a broader condition that could impact his ability to run in 2024 or to serve another four years. But so far, Democrats have not been buying that. You heard that -- those House Democrats held the call yesterday, the senior most members of the party in the House of Representatives, and discussed the potential to replace Biden and the potential need to do that. And so, they're going to be convening on Tuesday as a party in full to discuss that very issue. Similarly, Senator Mark Warner, who has been leading that effort that you just mentioned, while those discussions have taken place, they are likely to continue at a lunch that the Senate is hosting within the party on Tuesday midday. Before then, I'm told President Biden is going to be working the phones, reaching out to these members of Congress to try to assure them that he has heard their concerns. But, whether that means taking the rare and unprecedented step of bowing out of the race is unlikely. Up until this point, he said he is not going to back down, that he is digging his heels in, and that he is not going anywhere. So, that is certainly something that we will be watching what his message to these lawmakers is and what he says to assuage their concerns. Last week, he spoke with 20 members of the House Democratic Party. Some of them were assuaged. Others were not. So, certainly, President Biden has a tall order, not only with members of his own party, but also with those dozens of world leaders who will be here, trying to understand what the future of the NATO alliance, the future of geopolitical stability will be, and the U.S.'s role in all of that.",

Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud U.S. regulators for its role in two 737 MAX airplane crashes. As part of the plea, Boeing will pay a fine of almost half a billion dollars and has agreed to have an independent monitor oversee the company's operation for three years to ensure it complies with all safety regulations. But, the families of the people who died in Boeing 737 MAX crashes say the aircraft maker isn't being punished enough. They want a public trial and a bigger fine. CNN Aviation Correspondent Pete Muntean is following this story for us. I mean, the reality is they have reached a deal, and for the families, it's pretty distasteful.",

Another huge blow to Boeing's once-sterling reputation here, and the company really not saying all that much this morning, Max, only that it has reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice. Here are the terms of that deal, according to the government. Boeing is being fined $487 million. The Department of Justice says that it is the maximum fine allowed by law. Government will also be appointing an independent compliance monitor to oversee Boeing for the next three years, and that monitor will give reports to the court each year.But, the biggest part of this is Boeing agreeing to plead guilty to criminal charges. Remember, this is for the 737 MAX 8 eight crashes; the Lion Air crash in 2018, the Ethiopian Air crash in 2019. 346 people killed in those two crashes. Boeing agreed to plead guilty to defrauding the Federal Aviation Administration about the MAX 8 that Boeing hid major design changes that led to those two crashes. Originally, Boeing was able to reach a settlement with the government to avoid criminal charges. But, that deal also came with three years' probation. And the January 5 door plug blow out at an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 happened just days before that deal was set to expire. So, that made the Department of Justice look at that original deal again, ultimately triggering this new deal. Now, victims' families are calling this a \"sweetheart deal\" because they wanted Boeing to face a nearly $25 billion fine. Paul Cassell is the leading attorney in their civil case. And in a statement, he says, \"This sweetheart deal fails to recognize that because of Boeing's conspiracy, 346 people died. This deceptive and generous deal is clearly not in the public interest.\" Of note here is that Boeing executives avoided criminal charges themselves. The Department of Justice says this deal gives them no immunity that applies to the MAX 8 crashes as well as the door plug incident of earlier this year, Max. So, this is really just now unfolding.",

We saw that equally in the UK for the Reform Party most recently.But, it is the case that she is, I think, nonetheless, disappointed by this result. You could see it on the face of her deputies last night that they thought they were about to govern. They thought they were about to take over control of parliament. And that isn't the case. They're not even in first or second place. They're relegated to third place. So, for the party, for Marine Le Pen, it's a disappointment. But, as you said, she sees this as a sort of long -- this is a long project and the phrase she had last night was \"it is victory postponed\", and that's I think the way she is looking at it.",

If all else fails, then there is the option of having a technical government, sort of Italian-style when Mario Draghi was brought in.But, we're quite a long way from that. And I think that you have to exhaust all the proper political options first before even France would be ready to contemplate the idea of being run by sort of faceless bureaucrats.

This is the first time Narendra Modi has traveled to Moscow since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly two and a half years ago. The Prime Minister is expected to discuss quote, \"perspectives on various regional and global issues\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin. This is an attempt by both sides to forge deeper strategic ties. Mr. Modi's visit comes as the West continues to try to isolate Moscow over its war on Ukraine.Let's take a closer look with CNN's Ivan Watson.

But, I think what we're seeing from the Indian government is that this relationship with Russia is simply too important to ignore. This is the first time that Modi and Putin will meet face to face in nearly two years.The relationship between Moscow and Delhi goes back to the Cold War. India has long purchased Russian-made weapons for its military, but trade has spiked between the two countries over the course of the last two years. Russia has become a gas station of sorts for India, which has been sucking up cheap Russian crude oil that used to go to Western markets that now have imposed sanctions on Moscow for the full-fledged invasion of Ukraine. India clearly has no qualms with taking advantage of that cheaper crude oil to serve its -- service its own economy. There are areas of concern in the relationship, and experts I've talked to have highlighted the blossoming relationship and alliances between Vladimir Putin and China's leader Xi Jinping. This is particularly of concern, because the Russia -- the Indian and Chinese relationship has been on the rocks for years now since the Indian and Chinese armies have gotten into these deadly skirmishes over their disputed border in the Himalayas, skirmishes that have sometimes turned deadly. So, this can clearly be seen as an effort to kind of find a counterbalance there to try to perhaps woo Putin back a little bit to New Delhi's side. While talk of trying to revitalize this partnership that's on the agenda, there are also areas of friction between Moscow and New Delhi. In particular, the Indian diplomats have been talking about Indian citizens showing up in the ranks of the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Listen to what a senior Indian diplomat had to say earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VINAY KWATRA, INDIAN FOREIGN SECRETARY (Interpreted): At every level of Russian leadership, both official and political, we have expressed strong concern that Indian citizens who are being taken to the Russian army through improper procedures must be returned promptly.
