He's also identified as a former football player for the University of Virginia, was listed on the team in 2018, although we're told he did not play a game with UVA.He's also said to be driving a black SUV. So, those are the parameters that the police are dealing with. They do have a tag number. But so far, we have not been told that they have been able to locate Christopher Darnell Jones. This all started around 10:30 last night right down the street here behind me on the University of Virginia campus. And three people killed, two people were injured, according to the university president. And we didn't -- we haven't been told the conditions of the individuals who were injured. That is about it from here. But if we get any more information, we will let you know.

He lost his $16 billion fortune, all of it, in less than a week.CNN Media Analyst and Media Reporter for Axios Sara Fischer joins us now. Sara, this is remarkable, stunning to watch here. How did so many powerful, wealthy, successful people get fooled, in effect, it seems, again, I mean these are people in finance and on Capitol Hill? [10:45:01] SARA FISCHER, CNN MEDIA ANALYST:  Yes. Well, I think due diligence is a problem here. Moving forward, I think investors are going to proceed very cautiously with crypto. But, Jim, you'll remember during the height of the pandemic, crypto was hottest thing. Everyone thought if you could put money in, you will be able to get so much out. And I think their desire to be at cutting-edge of block chain and crypto and Bitcoin and all of that sort of obfuscated the efforts that they should have been doing to do due diligence both on SPF, the leader of FTX, but also the company, its financials and its structure.",

People thought that this company was very secure because he was coming out and for regulatory support, not so dissimilar to how Meta is approaching some of its woes.But I think moving forward, you're going to see a lot less capital pumped into the crypto industry, which could actually slow some of the regulatory movement because there is not as much pressure to get ahead of building momentum. I think you're going to see the entire industry hit a stasis while we investigate what happened with FTX. Eventually, long-term, yes, there will be regulations.

When things like this happen, Jim, the most important thing to remember is that everyday retail investors are the ones that are usually the last to get their money back.
