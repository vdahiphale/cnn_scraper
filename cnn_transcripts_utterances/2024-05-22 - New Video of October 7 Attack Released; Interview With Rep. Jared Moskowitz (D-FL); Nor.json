Happening right now, indeed, the judge is holding the first hearing since delaying the trial, and it comes as new photos show Trump's personal aide moving boxes around Mar-a-Lago. And happy to be alive, that's what a passenger on that turbulent Singapore Airlines flight told reporters before leaving the hospital. We have new details on what happened and why. Hello. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. Right now, a federal judge is considering whether to dismiss some of the criminal charges against former President Donald Trump. Along with his co-defendants, the former president stands accused of retaining highly classified documents after leaving office. Last night, an unsealed opinion from another federal judge revealed that Trump's attorneys found additional documents in his bedroom four months after the FBI's Mar-a-Lago raid. And take a look at this. Here in new footage -- there's new footage from the Department of Justice. A Trump aide has seen moving boxes just days before Trump's lawyers searched his Florida residence. CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez is outside the courthouse.",

      "sentences": "Wolf, right now, at the federal court here behind me, Judge Aileen Cannon is here, is having one of two hearings, motions by former President Trump and his co- defendants seeking to dismiss the charges.Walt Nauta, the former president's aide and still employed by the former president and one of the co-defendants, is asking for charges against him, obstruction mostly, to be tossed, because he says this is a vindictive prosecution by the government. In the case of the former president and the other co-defendants, they're asking for evidence to be suppressed, to be tossed from this case. Donald Trump says that evidence from the FBI search should be removed because of mistakes that they say occurred on the part of the government, as well as suppressing testimony from Evan Corcoran, a former lawyer for the former president. He's the one that received the subpoenas from the government seeking to turn over these documents, these classified documents, that were being stored at Mar-a-Lago. Now, ahead of the hearing, we saw hundreds of pages of documents released as part of this case. And it really explains a lot of the behind-the-scenes machinations, a lot of the fighting that was going on and why a judge in Washington ruled that Evan Corcoran, the former lawyer for the president, for the former president, why he needed to provide testimony and documents. Very unusual for a lawyer to be forced to essentially testify against his own client. One of the things that we saw in these documents, for the first time, we saw these images of Walt Nauta moving boxes after that subpoena had been received, again, according to the government, trying to conceal documents. We also saw evidence, according to the government, that the former president had documents, classified documents, in his bedroom and in an office at Mar-a-Lago months after that extraordinary FBI search. Here's what Judge Beryl Howell said to explain why she required Evan Corcoran to provide evidence against his own -- his own client. She said that: \"The government has proffered sufficient evidence that the former present used Person 18\" -- that's Evan Corcoran -- \"as a front man to obstruct the investigation.\" [11:05:09] Again, that hearing is still under way today. And one of the things we're waiting for, Wolf, at this point is whether we might get a new trial date from Judge Aileen Cannon -- Wolf.",

As you know, the White House responded to this announcement from those three European countries that they will soon recognize Palestinian statehood saying -- and I'm quoting the president's -- the White House now: \"The president is a strong supporter of a two-state solution and has been throughout his career. He believes a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\" Congressman, do you agree with the Biden administration's position right now? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL):  Well, thanks, Wolf. Thanks for having me. Yes. No, I agree with President Biden. And that's always been the position. First of all, these -- these latest announcements are nothing new. There's already 140 countries that have gone out and unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state. I mean, there is no Palestinian state. I am for a two-state solution. I think there should be a Palestinian state, but it's only going to come with direct negotiations. Let's not forget a little bit of history here, which is, we tried to create a Palestinian state in the '90s. Remember, President Clinton worked on that, offered East Jerusalem, right of return, 95 percent of the West Bank. And the Palestinians said no, and that led to the intifada. And so this is only going to happen through a direct negotiation between the Israelis, the Palestinians when they get new leadership, with the United States at the table, to make it happen. And I hope, one day, it does happen. But this move actually is going to hurt the Palestinians. Norway was involved in making sure the dollars that are collected through taxes from the Palestinians go through Norway to get back to the Palestinian Authority. Now that Norway has made this move, Israel has pulled back their ambassador. Now Norway can no longer be a partner. So this move actually doesn't get us closer to peace. It gets us further away.",

There are still people here, for political purposes, saying it's a genocide. Of course, no one's saying that about what's happening in Darfur, where there's actually ethnic cleansing. There's no protests in the street. There's no campus protests, right? There's nobody walking around Capitol Hill fighting for the people in Darfur. It's always Israel.

The jury will now move forward without hearing directly from the former president at the center of this criminal trial. They will have six days to digest what they have heard just ahead of next Tuesday's scheduled closing arguments.

Here, we have a week between the end of evidence and the closing arguments. Now, it's nobody's fault. It's sort of just an accident of the calendar. I think the judge did the right thing by moving all the closings to after the Memorial Day weekend, because, otherwise, the risk would be you split up the deliberation around the weekend, which is not a good idea for anybody. But I think what this does, Wolf, is, it really heightens the importance of closings. Now, closings are always crucial, but, here, the parties are going to have to really bring the jury back to the evidence, some of which is over a month ago that the jury heard it. So, closings are always crucial, but especially here, when you have this kind of gap.",

They are bloodied. Their hands are bound. They are being lined up against a wall. You can hear some of the Hamas militants in the video shouting at them, some of the young women trying to understand the situation, trying to show these militants that they are people. One of the young women, Naama Levy, it says: \"I have friends in Palestine.\" The young woman next to her, Liri Albag, asks for someone who can speak English. And you can just see the fear on the faces of these women as they are being taken into captivity by Hamas on October 7. Two of the seven women who were taken captive on October 7 by Hamas have -- one of them is Noa Marciano. She was killed in captivity, according to the Israeli military, and her body has since been retrieved by Israeli forces. Another one of the women, she, Ori Megidish, was actually rescued in an Israeli military operation in Gaza. But five of these other women are still being held captive. And their families are the ones, we understand, who decided to release this very graphic video today because they want to bring back attention on the plight of their daughters and try and pressure the Israeli government further to secure a hostage deal that could secure their release. The Israeli government, for now, is also sharing this video, actually, on its accounts on social media, and so questions about how much this will actually help pressure this government. But, certainly, Wolf, it is bringing back attention on the plight of these five women, all 18 and 19 years old at the time that they were taken captive. We know, of course, that those hostage negotiations are stalled at the moment. They have been for the last couple of weeks.
