New details on the first batch of Obama-era classified documents, which were found back in November but only acknowledged on Monday, more on that shortly. This comes at the end of the day that saw the naming of a Special Counsel to investigate President Biden's handling of those and other classified documents found at a private office of the current President in his home in Wilmington, Delaware. The most recent discovery just this morning at the same residence that's according to Attorney General Merrick Garland. This afternoon, he named Robert Hur, a veteran Federal prosecutor and former Trump appointee Special Counsel, and he laid out a timeline of the case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It informed him that the White House had notified the Archives that documents bearing classification markings were identified at the office of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.On November 9th, the FBI commenced an assessment consistent with standard protocols to understand whether classified information had been mishandled in violation of Federal law. On November 14th, pursuant to Section 600.2 (b) of the Special Counsel Regulations, I assigned US Attorney Lausch to conduct an initial investigation, to inform my decision whether to appoint a Special Counsel. On December 20th, President Biden's personal counsel informed Mr. Lausch that additional documents bearing classification markings were identified in the garage of the President's private residence in Wilmington, Delaware. This morning, President Biden's personal counsel called Mr. Lausch and stated that an additional document bearing classification markings was identified at the President's personal residence in Wilmington, Delaware.

Keeping them honest, though, it is not like there has been a flood of timely information about this at all from this White House about documents whose existence was first known on November 2nd, nothing was said publicly back then nor on December 20th when the additional items were found. And on Monday, when the administration did acknowledge the existence of that first batch, nothing was said about the second discovered nearly three weeks before. Here is how the Press Secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre explained that late today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The lawyer said we have been working closely with the Department of Justice and coordinating a search that was still ongoing to ensure any additional documents were in the proper possession of the government. After that search -- after the search concluded last night, we released a statement disclosing the facts from that search, as you all know, this morning. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And if they do, if someone does, did that person tell the President making that denial just heard untrue?Lastly, but certainly not finally, there's a question of what the President now thinks of what he said just a few months back when asked about the former President, admittedly quite different version of what he is now facing.

Those calls one was with the British Prime Minister. The second was with Donald Tusk of Poland, who was the President of the European Council from 2014 to 2019.For clarity, Anderson, these were classified documents, but it is unclear how much of this material remain sensitive.

When it comes to the packing of the office, the moving of those materials that are going to go with the former President, and how that stuff is stored wherever they end up.

He has not seen these documents, at least since he had them initially, when he was the Vice President. He has not seen them recently. But I am told that there was a conversation among White House officials and some top level allies in Washington in the hours after the story broke, essentially downplaying it, and saying that these documents were not particularly sensitive, or of high interest to the Intelligence Community. So I'm told, while the specifics of the classified documents haven't been seen by the President or others, the general topics have become known through the course of the investigation; and now of course, through Jamie Gangel's reporting. And as she was saying, someone simply can go over to the Archives, and look at this. But I think in the context of this, as I've been talking to many people in former presidencies, the offices of the former Presidents and Vice Presidents. Vice Presidential material is handled in a very different way. The Presidential Records Act really pertains to the President, but the Vice President's staff largely is left on its own, in some respects. So yes, the classified material was being taken out for months, but it seems like a few random papers were sort of caught up in the mix as he was in a flurry, a whirlwind of activity in the final week of his vice presidency. So he is saying, he was surprised by the finding of it, and he doesn't know, but that is not necessarily the fact that people don't know the topics, the general topics of these memos.",

Just as a side note, Anderson, you know, it is unprecedented to have a President and a former President, with these two Special Counsels being investigated at the same time. I do think it's important, as David Axelrod said, the way they've handled it has been not the greatest damage control in the world, but they are very different.

This is especially true when the lie seeks benefit from the murder of millions of Jewish people.Now, there are five others from the New York delegation also calling on him to resign, but very significantly, Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican -- the House Speaker is not doing so. He says that it's up to voters in his district to decide. He said that there is a process by which things can get determined in the House, that the House Ethics Committee reviewing it and then they could decide any recourse. But the very real issue here for the Republican leaders, Anderson, is that he comes from a district that Joe Biden carried by eight points in 2020. If he were to resign, this would open up a seat that could very well flip to the Democrats and Kevin McCarthy right now, battling to hold his razor thin majority, does not want to make his margins tighter.

But again, because he's in custody, they can take their time, do the test they need to and make sure they're gathering the evidence properly, thoroughly, so that it can be used if there was to be an indictment. And I'm sure they feel that getting it done right, so it can withstand appeal down the road is more important right now than getting it done quickly.Remember, this is still a missing person's case and we have a person of interest. What the DA has to decide with this investigative team is, was there a murder and who did it? And so, that's what they are working on now, determining circumstantially with other evidence. Was there a homicide that took place here or not? And if so, who's responsible for that? And you can see where circumstantial evidence is going to play a big role in this case.",

There is some optimism about the flow of weapons, the type of weapons coming in, the fact that we're going to see up to 100 Ukrainians traveling to the U.S. next week to get trained on how to use that Patriot missile, the fact that air defenses are improving, but it's a grind and it's a slog and it is tough.",

That training will come to an end sometime probably in February or in the springtime.And so, theory is, or the logical supposition is that they will then push to make another big offensive. Whether that's in Donbass, whether that's in the south, whether that's in Kiev, as General Zalushnyi, the commander in chief of armed forces here in Ukraine, has suggested, nobody knows. But it's definitely a big fear.

So clearly something's not going right that they keep shifting and changing tactics. I think for people who are really watching the minutiae of, like, why would he change leader now? And why would he choose Gerasimov, this general who's basically the de facto leader of all of Russia's armed forces. And different people have come up with different kind of conclusions as to why that may be. It may be that Putin is looking for a fall guy ultimately, if things don't go right, that he would be the one to take full responsibility for it. It may also be a kind of declaration of intent that not only are we going to slow things down, we're going to maximize things, we're going to get the Navy more involved, we're going to get the Air Force more involved. We're going to actually try to increase the pressure and the scale of this operation. So, different people have different perspectives on why this may be, but certainly a lot of people saying that it doesn't really bode well for the Russians that they have such a high turnover.

The Federal Aviation Administration has been in the crosshairs of critics since this air travel meltdown first broke yesterday, 10,000 flights delayed, another 1,300 canceled. And we were the first to report that the computer system that crashed, which stores critical safety information for pilots, was 30 years old. Now, the FAA says it knows the cause of the failure, not the age of the system, but rather who was working on it. In a just released statement, the FAA says it determined that a data file was damaged by personnel who failed to follow procedures.Government sources tell us the FAA first noticed problems on Tuesday night. The Notices to Air Missions or NOTAM database crashed because of that damage file. And that file also impacted the backup system. The FAA tried to reset, essentially unplugging the system, plugging it back in again in the early morning hours of yesterday. But that restart failed, triggering a nationwide ground stop for 90 minutes. All air traffic paralyzed, Anderson something we have not seen since the 9/11 attacks. Another government official tells me the computer system was not slated to be updated by the FAA for at least another six years. That caught the attention of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the FAA falls under the Transportation Department remember. Now, the source tells us, Buttigieg is really not happy with how this update was planned, and he wants that system that caused these cascading cancellations fixed fast so this does not happen again, Anderson.",
