      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers watching us here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Michael Holmes. Appreciate your company.And we begin, of course, with the dramatic turn of events in Russia. At this hour, Moscow is calm, as you can see there. Traffic restrictions still in place on a major highway in Moscow and the Tula region, that's happening because of an insurrection led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner mercenaries, that came to an end as suddenly as it started. On Saturday, the Kremlin said it cut a deal with Wagner leader, Prigozhin, to stop the march of his forces to Moscow, but not before an apparent clash between Wagner and Russian troops, which was followed by a fire at that oil refinery you see on your screen there. Now, under the deal done, the Kremlin says Wagner troops will not face any legal action, but they'll sign new contracts with Russia's defense ministry, while Moscow will drop its charges against Prigozhin who will go to Belarus. Wagner's leader says he agreed to that in order to avoid bloodshed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGHOZIN, HEAD OF WAGNER PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANY (through translator):  Therefore, realizing all the responsibility for the fact that Russian blood will be shed from one of the sides, we turn our columns around and leave in the opposite direction to the field camps, according to the plan. (END VIDEO CLIP) HOLMES:  The Kremlin says it doesn't know where Prigozhin is right now. What you see there is video of people cheering as he left Rostov- on-Don where his troops seized military facilities on Saturday. Officials now tell CNN the U.S. intelligence believes Prigozhin was planning to challenge Russia's military leadership for a while, while Washington did not see any change in Russia's nuclear posture despite all the turmoil. Ivan Watson monitoring the developments in Russia. He joins me now from Hong Kong. An extraordinary day by any measure. Where do things stand now in terms of Prigozhin and his future?",

He's a bit of a loudmouth who's all over social media normally, but since his final audio message where he announced he was turning his troops around, that they had accomplished their plan, we haven't really heard from him. And even the Kremlin says that it does not know where he is right now.I think that Russians, including the elite, are just beginning to digest the whiplash of Saturday's mercenary mutiny, which apparently has come to an end. I'm going to play you a clip from one of the chief Kremlin propagandists, that's Vladimir Soloviev, where he went into a long soliloquy about this. He was clearly troubled because he has done a lot of work alongside the Wagner fighters in Ukraine, promoting them as heroes. And all of a sudden, in his own words, Russia was on the brink of a civil war. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR SOLOVIEV, RUSSIAN TELEVISION PRESENTER (through translator): The country was on the brink of tragedy. It was a very difficult day. It was a day where, if not many, then very many have revealed themselves. A day that cannot be forgotten. Lessons that have to be considered. It should be closely examined who said what and when and how they behaved. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it's very much the junior partner and ally of Vladimir Putin, that is, Alexander Lukashenko, very much beholden to his godfather, so to speak, Putin, who has helped save him from an uprising after a fiasco with elections in Belarus two years ago.Out of the blue, in the midst of this very serious crisis and challenge to Vladimir Putin's authority which Putin himself compared to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, out of the blue, suddenly, the Kremlin and the Belarus government announced they've brokered a deal with Prigozhin. The Kremlin arguing that, well, Lukashenko has known Prigozhin for more than 20 years and that's where some of the trust is and that Prigozhin will go there, with no kind of further details of under what conditions and will he still have command and control over the Wagner mercenaries, not only in Ukraine and in Russia, but also in Africa, where they're involved in mining and all sorts of business there. So, these are big questions. And recall, Michael, on Saturday, the Russian security forces were raiding the Wagner offices in their headquarters in St. Petersburg and going through there, that's how volatile this situation was. And then, just hours later, the Kremlin announces it's dropping all charges against this man who was conducting, leading a march, a military march on the Russian capital.",

Someone who can still threaten from abroad, someone who has enormous credibility as a military leader, who has loyal troops. Although, he separated from them for now. And someone who's anti-corruption, anti- elite. His anger at this sort of self-satisfied oligarchs in Moscow resonates very strongly. So, he could be a future threat as well.Again, I draw the analogy with a Julius Cesar, who came to power that way with his private army challenging the corrupt elite.

And they said, at the time, that they believed that that would mount, that that would escalate over the coming months. And of course, it did.And as recently as just this past week, the intelligence agencies did brief members of Congress, as well as briefing the White House and the Pentagon, that the Wagner Group had -- was making these preparations to do what he eventually did over the last day or so. And so, that does give you an insight into how closely this is being monitored. Now, do think that how quickly this escalated yesterday really did catch the White House off guard somewhat, and you could see that a number of officials, including the Joint Chiefs chairman, Mark Milley, and the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, had planned overseas travel. They did have to scrap that travel. So, it does give you a sense of how quickly this was escalated, how even though they had this intelligence, they didn't necessarily think that it would happen when it happened.

The Kremlin says it doesn't know where Prigozhin is right now. He was last seen leaving Rostov-on-Don in a vehicle you see in there, pausing briefly to shake hands with people and then driving away.And while this showdown may have been defused for now, the threat to Putin's regime may be far from over. The Wagner leader showed just how easily he could take over a major Russian military installation and city and then send columns of troops racing towards Moscow. Some Wagner mercenaries were halfway to the capital when Prigozhin abruptly ordered them back. A personal appeal by the president of Belarus, a close Putin ally, is credited with persuading Prigozhin to call of his rebellion. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, says that the Russian president is \"very afraid\" following Wagner's chief's insurrection. He also claimed that Putin had left Moscow, adding that the Russian president's own actions were to blame for the situation facing him. Meanwhile, an adviser to Ukrainian presidential administration says the insurrection almost nullified Putin. In a tweet, he criticized the Wagner chief for turning his forces around from a march towards Moscow and reaching that apparent deal. Kyiv also took advantage of the chaos in Russia. The country's deputy defense minister says they launched simultaneous counter offenses in multiple directions on Saturday. Now, for civilians across Ukraine, the chaos that unfolded in Russia seemed to change little about the war, as Russian troops launched more missile attacks across the country. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 41 out of 51 Russian cruise missiles and two Iranian-made drones on Saturday, that's according to Ukrainian state media. At least three residents were killed in Kyiv, more than a dozen injured after falling missile debris landed on an apartment building. Meanwhile, an overnight Russian missile strike hit a residential area in Southeastern Ukraine. According to a Ukrainian official, four houses were destroyed, more than two dozen damaged during the attack. Ukraine, of course, was watching closely as that day of turmoil unfolded in Russia.

And obviously, we have to say that given the new laws in place in Russia since they started the war in Ukraine, you definitely cannot speak out against the war in Ukraine, and there have been examples where people have been punished for doing so. Having said that, Michael, it's extraordinary just having reviewed some of the Russian newspapers and what's on them right now that they really did cover this straight up in a way, and that's been interesting to me in the sense that Russians, if they wanted the information, were able to get it. In fact, one of the newspapers, Kommersant, even quoted the reporting we just had with Kevin Liptak. And in that sense, they continue to try and toe the line between giving Russians information that they know cannot be denied, and at the same time, make sure that they do not have any dissent from it. It's an interesting line that they have been trying to tread, and I suggest that perhaps they might work a little harder, unfortunately, on that internet censorship in the coming days or weeks, depending on how precarious the situation becomes in Russia.",

Order was not what we saw on the roads leading to Moscow today. And there has been this slow creep of Ukrainian conflict coming to the Russian doorstep. It has in economic terms for months now.

But many of Ukraine's European allies were on edge. Many of them expressing concern over political instability in a nuclear power. Meanwhile, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said Russia's war in Ukraine was driving instability within its own borders. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIORGIA MELONI, ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  At the moment, it's hard to know exactly what is happening. But it's a situation of chaos inside the Russian federation which clashes a bit with some of the propaganda we have seen in recent months. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The biggest concern, of course, is Russia's massive nuclear arsenal. CNN's Kylie Atwood with the latest from the State Department.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  U.S. officials say they have seen no change in Russia's nuclear posture since Prigozhin has carried out this attempted insurrection. And we have seen President Putin engage in nuclear saber-rattling throughout the course of the Ukraine war. U.S. officials have been concerned that any escalation, any threat to President Putin as a result of what happens on the battlefield could potentially lead him to feeling like he needs to assert his power and use those nuclear capabilities. But of course, at this moment in time, the threats to his power are not coming from Ukrainian aggressions on the battlefield, they're coming from internal divisions within Russia's fighting force. But still, he is presented with a situation that is threatening to his standing, to his power, presenting questions about what he could potentially do with Russia's nuclear capabilities. We should note that just earlier this month, President Putin said that Russia had moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus. Now, a State Department spokesperson confirmed what U.S. officials are saying, saying that there has been no change to the disposition of Russian nuclear forces and also saying there's no reason to address the conventional or nuclear force posture of the United States at this time. Kylie Atwood, CNN, the State Department. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "It's been pretty brilliant, but that shouldn't surprise us given the fact that Prigozhin himself is no amateur when it comes to social media.You'll remember, if we just wind the clock back seven years ago, he was running the internet research agency, the group that went out, sent people to the United States to go figure out divisive issues, came back and started posting from the internet research agency on Facebook and elsewhere efforts to basically send out disinformation and try to get -- to open up divisions within the American body politic. And they did it very effectively. They declare a protest in one place and then a counterprotest for the same day in the same place and try to create a small riot. They did this in Texas. They did this in other places. So, speed forward seven years and he's using Telegram, a widely used messaging app and social media app as well, and he's announcing each of his moves, but he's also using it to declare that the defense ministry -- the defense minister, General Gerasimov, the famed head of the chief of staff of the Russian armed forces, are corrupt, incompetent. And the amazing thing is until, you know, today, he didn't get shutdown. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
