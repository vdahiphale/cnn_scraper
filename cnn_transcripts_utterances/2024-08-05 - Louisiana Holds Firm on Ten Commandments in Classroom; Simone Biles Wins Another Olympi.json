Also new this morning, a tornado watch is now in effect for 11 million people from Central Florida to Southeastern Georgia, the threat whipped up by the Category 1 hurricane that charged ashore with 80 mile-per-hour winds in Florida's Big Bend region. Another huge concern is the catastrophic rainfall and the potentially deadly flooding that will follow. Some areas are bracing for as much as 30 inches of raining. And joining us now is the mayor of Charleston, South Carolina, William Cogswell. Mr. Mayor, thank you very much for joining us. What are you expecting over the next couple of days? And I know Charleston has some of those low-lying areas, flood-prone areas. I'm sure you're concerned about all that. MAYOR WILLIAM COGSWELL (R), CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA:  Absolutely. You make a good point. We are at basically zero sea level, and we are anticipating unprecedented amounts of rainfall. And when you couple that with potential storm surges and just, again, the level of rainfall, we're going to have some real issues here.",

Unfortunately, this is not their first rodeo. They are well-trained. They are professional and organized. So while I do have confidence in them, again, this is going to be an unprecedented amount of rainfall that will result in pretty severe flooding and in areas that don't normally flood. And so we're trying to take all precautions that we can, collaborating with our federal, state and local partners. And I'm optimistic that we're prepared.

We are asking, of course, for people to stay home, to prepare their properties, gather supplies now, well in advance of the storm, because we do not want people going out once the storm really hits. Again, we have our emergency responders. They are well-prepared. They are very organized and trained, of course, to rescue people.

Let's take a look at the medal count.The U.S. is still dominating overall with a total of 75 medals. But China has the most gold medals with 21. It was a photo finish, by the way, for the world's fastest man in the 100-meter dash Sunday night. American Noah Lyles took that title and the gold medal by just five- thousands of a second. Let's put that into perspective. The blink of an eye lasts 20 times longer than the gap between Lyles and the silver medalist. If you watch that race, it was just unbelievable. The race was so close that seven of the eight sprinters saw the word photo next to their name on the scoreboard, meaning a closer inspection was, of course, needed. And over in the gymnastics competition, it's been amazing. Simone Biles secured a silver medal in her final event of the Paris Olympics. She took second in the floor exercise behind Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. But in a shocking turn of events, Biles failed to medal in the balance beam final earlier today. CNN Sports' Coy Wire joins us now from Paris. Coy, Simone Biles is a force. She's been amazing. Love the tweets, everything that she does. It's been incredible, but there was a little bit of a stumble today on the beam. What can you tell us?",

It's been the complete opposite.It's just been frustrating this year with injuries and setbacks and kind of asking myself, like, can I get back to the level that I need to be at to be competitive against these guys, questioning, like, can I get to where I need to be? And so just kept moving forward, doing what I still was able to do. So that kind of makes this one mean the most, because the most kind of went into this, kind of committed just to making it through. Like, when I couldn't throw because of the elbow, you only have so much time in the day. So instead of throwing, all right, we're going to spend some more time doing sprints, more time doing plyos. If I can't bench, OK, I'm going to have an extra squat session this week. So it was kind of figuring out a way to stay productive, despite constant setbacks. So I feel like this medal reflects that.",
