BROWNSTEINAnd I also thought what was important about this speech was the way it bridge what has been the debate about -- among Democrats about how to close the race. I mean, obviously there are Democrats who believe that she needs to stress democracy rights, abortion rights and the threat to the constitutional order that Trump has articulated so explicitly in the final days, an argument aimed mostly at White Collar voters who respond to that most powerfully. And then there are others who say that she has to emphasize what she will do to deal with the kitchen table concerns of working-class Americans and really what she unveiled in the CNN town hall about a week ago has continued right through this speech tonight. It really was the cornerstone of the speech when she essentially argued that Trump will come into office with an enemies list and I will come into office with a to-do list. And that really kind of bridges those two views about Democrat -- among Democrats about how to close the race and puts it in, I think, a very powerful final package for her.",

Pennsylvania still feels to me like the Battle of the Bulge in this election. I have felt all year that someone is going to win Pennsylvania by 50,000 votes or less, and that person is very likely to be the president.And, you know anything that might hurt either candidate at the margin in that state and here is something that could certainly have a cost for Trump among Puerto Rican voters or a big constitutive there, about 500,000 Puerto Rican residents, I think it's about 300,000 voters. But more broadly, I mean, the rally really did symbolize the argument that Harris is trying to make, that, you know, if you re-elect Trump, it probably is a pretty good preview of the tone and tenor of national life that you will see over the next few years. Not only with, you know, divisive rhetoric but policies that could pit Americans against each other, like the mass -- the militarized mass deportation that he is talking about. I mean, Trump, I thought, you know, that rally reflected their confidence that there are enough voters to satisfy with the economy, particularly inflation under Biden that they are in the driver's seat and they can kind of let it rip. But that might be premature and if it is, I think it again, it is precisely because of those voters who might lean Republican in their policy preferences on things like the economy and immigration but really are unsure whether they want to return Trump to power. I think that gave them a pretty good clear -- pretty clear vision of, you know, that there is more to returning him to power than potentially lower prices for eggs and gas.",

That's the computerized forecast of how much precip is going to come down. Now there's going to be, obviously, flooding damage. But this is a wind event. Everything has a certain factor. Is it a wind? Is it a surge? Is it a flood? We know the one that moved through Philippines didn't have much wind, but it certainly had flooding just last week. So, this is what we're seeing here, as the wind and the surge will probably be equal to, or not even greater than the flooding potential here. An awful lot of wind damage here, many spots here, all the way even into China, are going to see tropical cyclone winds. Somewhere, maybe even over 100 kilometers per hour, and then on up toward Kyushu. Now, Taiwan is no stranger to these big things. Since like 1950 there have been 30 Taiwan landfalls of what's an equivalent of a category four or five Atlantic hurricane. So yes, major damage can happen there in Taiwan and it does. But this year, we've already had two, and really in another but Krathon and Gaemi on and also get me has already taken its toll there in damage across the eastern parts of Taiwan. There's going to be more. Obviously, we could even still see this continue to increase in intensity, probably likely go down before landfall but we're still going to have to watch this.

The fire in Vancouver destroyed hundreds of ballots say state election officials, while a fire suppression system on the Portland drop boxes minimized damage there. Investigators found incendiary devices that they say connect the fires in both states, and they're looking for this suspect vehicle. A 2000s dark colored Volvo sedan with an unknown tag number and missing front plate. City and election officials in both Portland and Vancouver say they're bumping up police patrols and enhancing security around their ballot boxes going forward.
