Those are the markets, and the main events that you and I are talking about today. Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. George Clooney calls for President Biden to bow out. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg will speak in this hour. You'll hear him on this program. And a CNN investigation: Airbnb fails to protect guests from those hidden cameras. Midweek, live from New York. I'm Richard Quest on Wednesday, July the 19th, back in New York, yes, I mean business. Good evening. We begin with more calls for Joe Biden to bow out of the election and that is coming from the Halls of Congress to the hills of Hollywood. George Clooney, a lifelong Democrat, wrote a devastating column in \"The New York Times\" entitled, \"I Love Joe Biden, But We Need A New Nominee.\" Mr. Clooney has been one of Biden's biggest supporters. Only last month, he led a Hollywood fundraiser, one of the largest ever that brought in $28 million for the Biden campaign. He now writes, \"It is devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe \"Big F-deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" The Biden campaign is struggling to calm democratic doubters, particularly in Congress. New York lawmaker Pat Ryan has urged Biden to step aside for the good of the country. Senator Blumenthal says he is deeply concerned about Biden's election bid. Even the former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has vigorously defended Joe Biden appears to be changing her tune. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): It is up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision. I want him to do whatever he decides to do, and that's the way it is.

It is onething to lose the White House to Donald Trump, it is another thing to lose the House of Representatives and possibly the Senate. So certainly there is a growing groundswell, at least behind the scenes and publicly, people are cracking as well. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado told Kaitlan Collins on CNN just last evening that Biden can't win, that Donald Trump will win the election. So people are speaking out who are not in competitive races, who feel that they don't have anything to lose necessarily, but this remains one person's decision, that's President Biden's. He has been meeting with world leaders today and by all accounts, having a very good NATO meeting. So we do not know if he is going to respond to any of these calls to get out. So far, he hasn't.

They are collection of people and interest groups who want to win and I am hearing -- yes, I am hearing the same as George, by the way, who came from Northern Kentucky to be the biggest movie star in the whole wide world. He is a very impressive man, a really smart guy, very politically savvy. But he is not the only one. Zeleny's report is exactly right. We've heard today from Ritchie Torres, who is in his 30s. He is a remarkable progressive young congressman from New York. We heard from Pat Ryan, who is from upstate of Ritchie, who is a combat veteran and from a different wing of the party from Torres. Senator Bennet last night on CNN. Michael Bennet of Colorado, no bomb- thrower heat. He fears a landslide. So it is all lining up. I think, look, as a longtime Democrat, here is my counsel to Democrats. Nancy take the wheel. You know, there's that great country song, \"Jesus Take the Wheel.\" I just want Nancy to take the wheel, and I think she is. I think she is the most able leader in the Democratic Party today and she herself, after she crossed 80 or 81 handed off the gavel to Hakeem Jeffries. The world still turned on its axis.

The 75th NATO Summit is critically important with Putin on the march on the European continent, critically important to stiffen NATO's resolve and by the way, under Joe Biden, we've gone from nine countries spending two percent GDP on defense to 23. Twenty-three of the 33 under Biden. It was nine under Trump, 23. So Biden is doing a masterful job of leading the free world. I think Speaker Emerita this morning said, let's all back off. Let him lead NATO and lead the world, and then once the NATO Summit is over, Sunday, maybe Monday, he will go to Austin, Texas. Hell speak at the LBJ Library commemorating the Civil Rights legislation. LBJ himself handed off power. Nobody loved power more than LBJ, but he handed off power and declined to run.

We will continue to support Ukraine in a very robust manner. So there is the symbolism of sending not just these F-16s which Secretary of State Antony Blinken said would be in the air this summer, but also the air defenses that President Biden promised last night. Tomorrow, a number of the allies here are going to be announcing a defense compact, which is just more of this support that the NATO Alliance is showing for Ukraine. So you have both the short-term implications of how this military weaponry can affect the battlefield, and Richard, those two things I just mentioned, air defenses and F-16s, they are not going to have immediate implications in terms of being able to push the Russians back, but they certainly do send a very strong message. So while so much of this Summit is distracted by what is going on here in the US politically, no doubt that the 32-country Alliance, now it is 32, are going to emerge from this summit with a very strong message of support for Ukraine. But of course, Richard, the question then becomes, what happens in November? And that's exactly what President Zelenskyy said last night. Everybody is thinking about November, about the US election because things could change very quickly if Donald Trump is the next US president. He is tepidly supportive of NATO at best, he has shown distain, of course, for the NATO Alliance. He has talked about letting Russia \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO Allies who don't pay their dues, in his opinion. So there is a lot of thinking about what could happen in the next few months here in Washington -- Richard.",

You see the prosecution there saying that Alec Baldwin violated the cardinal rule of handling guns safely. They're saying that this was a movie set, but this is very much real life where someone lost their life. Then you go to the defense and they're saying that the defendant Alec Baldwin is an actor. He was not responsible for handling the guns safely. That was someone else's job and responsibility on that set. His role was to remember his lines and to perform the job of an actor.",

They've shown body cam footage from tworesponding officers who have taken the witness stand today. They played part of the 911 call. They have showed some clips from the movie. But, you know, when it comes to the defense, they're basically saying that the prosecution's entire argument doesn't even matter because who put that bullet in that gun and why was a live bullet on set any way? That's going to be a major question and something that the defense will absolutely focus on. But earlier this week, Richard, there was a significant victory for Baldwin's side because the judge ruled that his role as a producer cannot be brought up in trial. The reason why that matters is because the prosecution had intended to say, as a producer that Alec Baldwin was essentially the boss and that he held more responsibility on that set. Now this morning, what we are seeing from the defense is they are really relying and drilling in on the fact that our client is an actor. It is not the job of an actor to handle a gun safely. The last point that I do want to bring up is the armorer from \"Rust,\" Hannah Gutierrez Reed. She was convicted and sentenced already. So that will be interesting to see what the jury thinks about that. If the armor was already held accountable, then does that absolve Alec Baldwin in any way? Again, that will be for the jury to decide.",

So there is somewhat of a media circus and we saw yesterdayin jury selection that many of the questions revolve around whether these jurors could be fair and impartial towards Alec Baldwin, who, as you point out, Richard, is a celebrity and has been in the public eye for decades. Many people have some pretty strong opinions about him. So the jurors, they all said that they could be fair and impartial, but of course that is an element here, and that is why this case is getting so much attention. But, again, we do have to focus on the fact that an innocent life was lost. And again, that's not what this trial is about. Nobody is saying that anyone here was a cold-blooded murderer. Everybody agrees that this was an accident and a terrible tragedy. But the prosecution is saying an accident could still be criminal. Baldwin's defense is saying, no, this was an accident, he should not be held criminally liable.",

But CCTV video taken outside that house showed a man carrying what has been described and appears to be a crossbow, puts it in the back of a vehicle. Now that's when the big manhunt kicked off and the police ending up in this area of North London, leafy suburb of Enfield. And in this cemetery is where they discovered Clifford. Now when the police found him, he was injured. In fact, there was footage taken of him being taken out of the cemetery here on a stretcher. Now the police say no shots were fired. There were very, very heavily armed police here involved in the operation to apprehend him. He was believed to be a danger. Local people on the street told to lock their doors. People we've talked to here told us that they have that advice to lock the doors. And one lady just across the street here said she was shocked when she came home and found all these police in her streets. Obviously, it goes without saying, a triple murder involving a crossbow.

NATO is simply serving as the sort of Amazon or Walmart clearing house. It's getting all the promised supplies and then making sure in terms of just in time delivery that it's delivered on time, whereas a common complaint from Ukraine has been that things that get promised are arriving all higgledy-piggledy and not when they need it on the battlefield. But, yes, it does take NATO a step closer to being much more closely involved in this war. What remains a red line that no one wants to cross is these trainers, et cetera, all of this will still be done outside Ukraine. Foreign officials that I've spoken to this past week have said in the corridors, yes, we're talking about putting NATO troops on the ground, trainers on the ground in Ukraine. But no one is ready to do that yet because we don't know how we keep them safe. Then again, a year or two ago, no one was ready to send F-16s in and now we're sending those. So --",
