But as it relates to changing in the sense of culture, I think it's necessary in order to move forward as a community. That every individual who showed up to this event. Mr. Hempfield especially. ANTONIO ROMANUCCI, ATTORNEY FOR TYRE NICHOLS' FAMILY: Everybody on the scene was complicit in this man's death. In one way, shape or form or another somebody failed Tyre Nichols. They either failed him by using excessive force. They failed him by severely beating him. They failed him by not intervening. They failed him by not rendering aid. I think charges are warranted and here's why. We know what his words where that they wanted to stop him. I won't say the whole phrase for the benefit of the viewers. But he said, I hope somebody stops him. Clearly, I looked at that as an ignition source. He was somebody, if he has any command position at all. Which we do not know yet that if he does. But if he has an command position at all on that scene, that would be considered in order. And if that somebody is ordering a stop, we really have a problem with the whole system. We really see what's called ratification here. This unit thought that it could work with impunity. And that they would operate under a code of silence amongst all of them.
