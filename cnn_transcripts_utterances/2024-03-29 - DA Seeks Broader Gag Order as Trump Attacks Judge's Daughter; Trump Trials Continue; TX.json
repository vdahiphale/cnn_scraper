      "sentences": "Well, there's a new twist in Donald Trump's war against the judge in the New York hush money case. And we remember the legendary Louis Gossett, Jr. His \"Roots\" co-star, LeVar Burton, is with me tonight on LAURA COATES LIVE.All right, so here is what's happening. Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg is apparently fed up with Trump's war of words against the judge in the hush money case. The D.A. is now asking Judge Juan Merchan to expand the gag order against Trump. Now, right now, the gag order does not apply to the D.A. and it doesn't say anything about it applying to the judge or his family. It does apply just about everyone else, court staff, their family, et cetera. So, what does that mean? Well, that Trump saw a window. And Trump, well, he jumped right through that window. He has been attacking the judge and his daughter in Truth Social, writing that judge is totally compromised and that his daughter, Loren, is a rabid Trump hater. Just so we're clear, the daughter is not a part of this case at all, full stop. It's random and yet oh, so calculated. And it seems that this may have been the last straw for D.A. Bragg. And by the way, that straw landed on several camels' backs because also, it led to a stunning moment that took place right here on CNN. A sitting federal judge, Reggie Walton, telling our own Kaitlan Collins this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REGGIE WALTON, JUDGE, U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: It is very troubling because I think it is an attack on the rule of law when judges are threatened and particularly when their family is threatened. And it's something that's wrong and should not happen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Now, just so we're clear, that does not happen, that federal judges often speak out or seldomly speak out. They don't really speak out on issues at all. That tells you a lot.And if for some reason you think this is all hyperbole, that the judge is somehow overstating this threat, then just consider what happened in Texas late last year. Prosecutors say a woman threatened to kill Judge Tanya Chutkan. That is the judge overseeing Trump's federal election case right here in Washington, D.C. The woman left a voicemail that said, and I'm quoting here, \"If Trump doesn't get elected in 2024, we are coming to kill you, so tread lightly, B.\" Now, she pled guilty and is now serving three years in prison. So, again, you got to understand that sitting federal judges do not come out and regularly speak on television. That's why some have called this appearance by this judge nothing short than an act of bravery. And it also raised a question for retired Judge Michael Luttig, the question of why it had to be a sitting judge to be the one to speak out when, frankly, there are so many others who could or should. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) J. MICHAEL LUTTIG, FORMER FEDERAL JUDGE:  No one, not one single person in a position of responsibility to address this issue has done so for want of courage and want of will. And until or unless we as a nation address this issue, then we're careening toward the effective end of the rule of law in America. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But what it is, is blanket bullying.And so, Laura, his whole game is about bullying people, pushing them, intimidating them. He has found throughout the course of his five- decade career that lots and lots of people cower to him. And what he's hoping with this wave of bullying in the judicial situation is if it's not this judge, it'll be another judge that's working on a case with him that may throttle down a little bit as a result of the bullying. And so, it's intimidating. It's wrong. But no one is standing up to him. And so, I just take you back to \"The Wizard of Oz.\" When the water got thrown on the witch and she melted, the guards were like, you know, sorry, Dorothy, you know, somebody got to stand up to him in a position of power and melt him before, frankly, it's too late.

I mean, Trump is in the news every single day, in the same court that Judge Walton sits on with his peers. He's seeing the stress that this is causing to the court.And he's not the only one speaking out. Other judges are speaking out to their court orders. I mean, just a month ago, Judge Lamberth, a Reagan-appointee, in a pretty regular sentencing memo, talked about how we are politicizing January 6th in a way that's going to be dangerous for our country moving forward. Judges are repeatedly putting out these signs of where we're heading as a country. Hopefully, the former president be held accountable for his actions. I think April 15th will be the start of that. And maybe once we start seeing some accountability, other people might have the bravery that Judge Walton showed this week to continue holding him accountable in their own courts of law or cases that are being brought against the former president.",

I think he was just trying to make the point that there's 74-ish million people that voted for Trump. We have to look at why they voted for him.I've said this to people on the Biden campaign. Don't demean these people. Reach out to these people. Explain to them the sinister danger of Trump and pull them to the other side. And so, I think that's important. If you're making a case that there are billionaires out there that like cuts in taxes, they like cuts in taxes. That's how they got to become billionaires. And so, there's a group of them. It's much smaller than it was in 2016 or 2020. They're going to highlight those people. He's very upset, Donald Trump is, about the $26 million that was raised this week by President Biden with the help of President Clinton and President Obama. And so, he's going to raise more than him because that's Mr. Trump's personality. But he's going to run out of money, Laura. Okay? You'll see that happen. He's got a 40, 50 billion-dollar spread right now with the president. He is bad for business. If you're a billionaire out here watching Laura Coates's show, bad for business. I'd be running away from Mr. Trump right now because he does really harmful things to people. And he's also very transactional. So, he's your friend today, but he's going to back the truck over you tomorrow. And so, that $860 or $816,000 that you're spending is going to go into the toilet. And last time -- he's going to lose the election. So, this is a really bad investment for these people. But have at it, it's your money, and that's the way it works in America.

And so, this would have to be a politically-motivated loan or this would have to be him coming up with some collateral for that loan. I think the real big issue, and this is going to happen in in the end of the election, is what happens with this D.J.T. stock, which is a meme stock that's virtually worthless, but it's trading right now for billions of dollars. Will he get the opportunity to sell some of that? And then what does he do with that money? And then I think the big question is, is that a backdoor way of avoiding a lot of our campaign finance laws? And by the way, when I say backdoor, it's actually going to be done legally.
