Harris has now enough delegate endorsements to win the Democratic nomination for president, though nothing is official as of yet. President Joe Biden is expected to return to the White House this afternoon. He's been self-isolating at home in Delaware since testing positive for COVID-19 last week. The president has no public event scheduled for today. And the EU is moving its August meetings out of Budapest in protest over the Hungarian prime minister's stance on the war in Ukraine. Viktor Orban recently angered EU leaders by claiming the union as a pro-war policy.",

The authorities in Gaza have said that now at least 81 people were killed as a result of airstrikes and artillery fire in the southern city of Khan Younis, at least 250 others injured. And what we've been hearing from the Israeli military now is that they are warning civilians in the eastern part of Khan Younis to evacuate, to relocate to what they've described as a readjusted humanitarian zone and in the Al-Mawasi coastal area.Now, it's important to note that we've heard these evacuation orders before. The Al-Mawasi coastal area has previously in other forms been designated as a humanitarian safe zone. But we have seen airstrikes targeting this area. We have seen airstrikes targeting other so-called safe zones as well. So there is very little confidence from many civilians who are now being forced to flee again over their safety in this adjusted humanitarian zone. And, of course, for many civilians, this is not the first time they've been told to evacuate. They've had to move time and time again. Oftentimes, they have been targeted in the areas that they have fled to. So there is real concern there. And as we continue to see the security situation in the south worsen, there is real concern for what that will mean for humanitarian organizations as well. The south, again, a vital gateway for aid. We've seen for weeks now obstructions in aid getting in through these areas. But, of course, the situation is only worsening. The famine situation is only deepening. And that will certainly be a key focus as ceasefire talks continue.",

GEN. ERIC CHASBEOUF, OLYMPIC GAMES MILITARY FORCES: We'll have more than 10,000 soldiers, more than 35,000 policemen. It will be completely secure. BELL (voice-over): Street patrols leave regularly from the largest military camp erected in France since the end of World War II. And beyond the terror threat, there are also fears linked to crime, social unrest and cyber attacks. NICOLAS NORMAN, PARIS DEPUTY MAYOR FOR SECURITY (through translator): There are lots of exercises, crises, simulations, sometimes quite extraordinary events, where everyone during an entire day tries to anticipate and then to manage them. And so today, we're ready and we're calm. BELL (voice-over): The Olympic flame arrived in Paris to welcoming crowds, but nothing compared to what is to come. Officials say that some 10 to 15 million people are expected, far too many for human eyes only to watch. So AI has been brought in to help monitor CCTV. MATTHIAS HOULLIER, CO-FOUNDER, WINTICS: The idea is to detect abnormal situations, like, for example, when there is intrusion of people on railways, when there is unattended item that could be suspicious package, etc. We detect them and then the operator gets notified in real time so that he can decide what should be done. BELL (voice-over): An unprecedented security operation made up of police, military, foreign forces and even AI start-ups that officials hope has made Paris ready for anything.
