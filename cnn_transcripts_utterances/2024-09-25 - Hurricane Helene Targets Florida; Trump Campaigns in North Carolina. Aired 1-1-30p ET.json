Alayna, you have new details about what former President Trump is expected to say. ALAYNA TREENE, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER:  That's right. We actually just got some of his prepared remarks. Obviously, he is going to be taking the podium up behind me shortly. But I want to point out what he says, because there's actually some newsy bits in this speech. He talks about referencing the U.N. General Assembly in New York this week, talks about the leader of Iran being in the U.S. right now following the reports and what DOJ had said was a potential assassination attempt by Iran on him. I'm going to read for you what exactly he is supposed to say. Of course, Donald Trump doesn't always stick to the script, but this is what they have in their prepared remarks. It says -- quote -- \"Meanwhile, we have the president of Iran and our country this week. We have large security forces guarding him. And yet they're threatening our former president and the leading candidate to become the next president, certainly a strange set of circumstances.\" The speech goes on to argue that -- Donald Trump saying that: \"If I were president and a former president, leading candidate to be the next president, was under threat, I would inform the threatening country, in this case, Iran, that if they do anything to harm this person, we are going to blow your largest cities and the country itself to smithereens.\" So, clearly, very harsh rhetoric there toward Iran. The speech also goes into detail about some of his assassination attempts, but he's really putting pressure on Iran right now, which is in the U.S. for this U.N. General Assembly and trying to argue that, look, if I'm president again, I am going to come after you very hard. We know that is something that Donald Trump often says, that his campaign often says. They actually just put out a recent statement arguing that they believe that Donald Trump would be very bad for Iran, that Iran does not want Donald Trump to win. So that's in line with what I think we're about to hear in just a couple of moments.",

She's also the president of AxAdvocacy. So, Kate, Trump continues to poll better on the economy significantly than Harris. And I think something that is also very interesting that you see in our new CNN poll is that, even among those who say that Trump's views and policies are too extreme, 15 percent say they trust him over Harris to handle the economy.

She's communicating to voters that she understands what their lives are like. She also talks about the future. We don't really hear Trump talk a lot about the future. You hear Harris, and you will, I'm sure, hear her do this again this afternoon,you hear her lay out a really forward-looking plan to bring down costs, particularly around health care, around housing. She's put concrete policies out there. But she talks about this in a way that I think is accessible and relatable to voters, whereas Donald Trump, somebody who comes from the wealthiest class and whose signature economic accomplishment of his previous term as president was a major tax cut for billionaires and the wealthiest in this country. So there is a really good contrast there for Kamala Harris to draw. And she has to continue to draw it.",

So I don't think she has to completely abdicate this issue. Obviously, Republicans want to paint her as having not been effective here, but there is substance there that allows her to push back. I also think she can be more aggressive in calling out Trump's fearmongering. This Haitian immigrant lie that he and J.D. Vance have been telling is a good example. I mean, they're talking about people who are in this country -- in this country -- excuse me -- legally. They're smearing them. That's more of the kind of divisive, hateful language that voters don't like about Trump. They will -- they do like some of what Trump says about the need to be tougher on immigration. They don't like -- especially moderate voters, swing voters who are going to be determinative in this election, they don't like the hateful language. They don't like the sense of chaos that Trump brings. So I do think that V.P. Harris has an opportunity here to be aggressive about the fact that Trump scuttled the bipartisan immigration bill that was going to tackle some of these issues. And instead of putting meaningful solutions on the table, he's using this kind of inciteful language, because we see that, again, swing voters reject that.",

Look, this is happening in real time. We know that President Trump, when he's out giving these speeches, always creates news. From a political perspective, I think it's probably a chance for him to try to remind Americans of his strength, especially when it comes to adversity and dealing with some of our foreign adversaries. That's the most I can make of it from a political perspective in this moment. ACOSTA:  I mean, Kate what do you think of this, I mean, bombastic rhetoric that Trump is using there, threatening to go to war with Iran? I mean, we should note the last -- the two assassination attempts that have been in the news obviously since this past summer were involving people that were not backed by the Iranians. We have no information to say that that's the case. We do have this new information that's coming from intelligence officials that Iran may have some interest in taking a shot at Donald Trump.

I mean, certainly, what he's saying about potential threats to his life, he is right. He has -- should have every expectation that the United States Secret Service and the U.S. government keep him safe, keep the president safe, keep any nominee for the presidency of a major party safe. He's absolutely right to have that expectation. Of course he should. But the idea that throwing out this language we're going to bomb Tehran off the face of the earth is responsible or would make the United States more secure, would make Americans more secure I think is ludicrous. So I agree he's trying to show strength here. Obviously, the political imperative is he's trying to draw this contrast between strength and his assessment of the Biden/Harris administration as weak. But what he is casually tossing out there would mean a war for U.S. men and women in uniform in the United States. And I don't think that's what the American people want.",

It was just named a tropical storm yesterday, and we are expecting it to rapidly intensify again.Here's a look at Helene, 80 mile-per-hour winds, gusts up to 100 miles per hour, sitting about 500 miles south-southwest of Tampa, Florida. But we have had tropical-storm-force and hurricane-force winds lashing Cancun and even parts of Cuba, Havana, as well, because this storm is really wide and getting even wider. We have sea surface temperatures that are incredibly warm, up near records, upper 80s in this area, and then even middle 80s as we go into the Gulf of Mexico. That's what's going to fuel this rapid intensification as it gets closer to the Gulf Coast, so it could still be an intensifying stronger storm. That's why we're worried about a Category 3 landfall, somewhere in that Big Bend of Florida. That red that you see, those are hurricane warnings that are in effect. But look at all that blue, tropical storm warnings in effect for the entire peninsula there of Florida, because the storm, again, will be so wide. Tropical storm watches extend in the yellow up to Atlanta, because this thing could still keep its organization, still keep its wind field even that far north. With those winds, you're going to get that slosh of the ocean coming inland. That's that storm surge, 10 to 15 feet in that Big Bend of Florida, but even getting five to eight feet of storm surge down towards Tampa Bay. Again, you can see where we're very concerned about that ocean water coming inland for places like Cedar Key. I mentioned we're finding Helene not only intensifying, but growing wider. The wind field could expand more than 400 miles. So we're looking at tropical-storm-force winds again stretching from South Florida up towards Southern Georgia. And that's what's going to take that risk for some intense winds and power outages, not just in Florida, but we're talking Alabama, Georgia, even into the Carolinas, winds up to 73 miles per hour possible even as far north as Atlanta as this thing makes landfall going into tomorrow, winds, of course, 110 miles per hour near that landfall center on the Big Bend. Also looking at a huge footprint of heavy rain, because with this very wide wind field, it's going to suck up a lot of tropical moisture. So some of these rainfall totals could approach foot in parts of the Southern Appalachians, and that could cause some landslides -- guys.",
