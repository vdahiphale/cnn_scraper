I'm Fareed Zakaria coming to you from London.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): Today on the show, polls predict that Britain's Labour Party will win big in next month's election after being out of power for 14 year. If that happens, my guest, David Lammy, is likely to become the country's foreign secretary. I'll ask him what Britain would do differently in Ukraine and the Middle East, and how he would deal with a potential President Trump. You have called him woman-hating, Neo-Nazi, sympathizing psychopath. It's going to be an awkward meeting in the White House. (Voice-over): Across the channel, France will hold elections even sooner. It's one of the most dangerous political gambles in recent memory played by President Emmanuel Macron. I'll ask \"The Economist's\" Paris bureau chief Sophie Pedder whether it can work. And a sneak peek at America's mess with Mexico. My new primetime special. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

LAMMYof the British Conservative Party is that they have reduced our armed forces to a size that we haven't seen since the Napoleonic Wars. That is how bad it is. When the British Labour Party left office under Gordon Brown, we were spending 2.5 percent of GDP on defense. Our party is committed to returning to that 2.5 percent as soon as the fiscal climate allows. We will have a defense of strategic review that will begin on day one so we can chart a course to get to that 2.5 percent. And we must lead and encouraging others to Europe to get to that point.

He hopes this new election will stave off the far-right coming to power in 2027 when France has presidential elections. But it is a risky gamble for the immediate future of French politics. Macron's party is polling in a distant third place behind Marine Le Pen's party in first, and a coalition of leftist party is in second. So, what could the future of French politics hold? Joining me now is Sophie Pedder, the Paris bureau chief of \"The Economist.\" Sophie, welcome. So, first from everything you can tell what was the logic behind this? He does badly.

And the one argument is indeed the one you've just pointed to, Fareed, it's that this could in time help make the hard-right look less electable for 2027 when the presidency is at stake, not just the government and the parliament. And the other is that he felt himself boxed into a corner. This is an alternative explanation that he would be running a minority government for two years, the president has been. And that he was probably going to face a vote of no confidence in September when his parliament voted on his budget. And that this could have forced that kind of election on him.

Those were the two parties that have dominated post-war politics in France and post-war governments.And in doing so, in creating this center, he has sort of really shaken up the party political system. We're seeing the aftershocks of that now because we are seeing two blocks emerge, which are essentially led or dominated by the extremes, the hard-left and Marine Le Pen's hard- right.

So, it isn't impossible, but it's an incredibly difficult case to make. And in this era, it seems increasingly more so. So, that is, I think, what Macron is up against. That's what his party is up against. The mood is not positive among a lot of the members of parliament that I've spoken to and I've watched on the campaign trail.

But if you don't see a fall in your standard of living, you've got to produce more over your lifetime. And I think unless A.I. comes along and makes us all much more productive and solves the problem it means we have to work for longer.I think people, obviously, don't like that. And I think that's a very valid point because you've got to think, well, what job can I do that I want to do? What's out there that's available. As a university professor, it's relatively easy for me to carry on working for longer. If I'm a construction worker, it's not. I'm going to have to try and shift into something different. So, career has changed a great deal with this longer life.",

In the 20th century, we invented what I called a three-stage life. We invented teenagers. We invented retirement, and we have education, work, retirement. And as we're living these longer lives into our 90s, we can't just stretch that out. There's not really anything you can learn at 20 that's still going to be relevant when you're 70 or 80. So, careers are going to become much more multi-stage. You're going to have different jumps and sequences. Perhaps sometimes you're working full-time, sometimes part-time. But you're going to have to sort of think a little bit more ahead and say, well, this is what I'm doing for now. What comes next? We got to invest in our future now. And that's not about money.

By the age of 65 that has fallen to about 30 percent. And that's not because people are choosing to retire. They get ill. They have to look after someone who is ill. Their skills are out of date.

Sheinbaum is set to take office in October and may offer a reset in relations with her country's neighbor to the north. And America's relations with Mexico, especially where the southern border is concerned, are playing an oversized role in the Biden-Trump contest.Tonight, I'll examine it all in my new documentary, \"AMERICA'S MESS WITH MEXICO,\" airing at 8:00 p.m. eastern right here on CNN and CNN International. I want to show you a clip from that special that illustrates Mexico's burgeoning importance for America, whose southern neighbor is no longer just a key player on migration, but is also becoming a major economic player.
