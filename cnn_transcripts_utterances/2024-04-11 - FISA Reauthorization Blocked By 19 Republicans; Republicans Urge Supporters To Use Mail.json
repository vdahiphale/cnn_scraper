It is just before 5Just in, FBI director Christopher Wray preparing to tell Congress that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act -- this is known as FISA -- is \"an absolutely indispensable tool\" for national security, calling this moment in history crunch time. A group of Republicans just sank the latest effort to reauthorize the FISA law after -- you guessed it -- Donald Trump told them to kill it. It was another blow for Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. This is the fourth time in Johnson's tenure that the House has defeated what is known as a rule vote, which is a disaster for any party trying to control the House of the chamber that they are, in theory, in charge of. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TROY NEHLS (R-TX):  We've got seven more months until the presidential election. Let's try to not completely the (bleep) place down. We're dysfunctional -- we are. It's become somewhat embarrassing to me and will bite us in the butt a little bit in November. But my focus is Donald J. Trump now because we can't -- nobody can manage this conference.

A tweet comes down and the whole thing falls apart.Trump is not president at the moment but he is the presumptive Republican nominee. He does the same thing here. Again, it all falls apart over these allegations that he levels that this law was used against his campaign back in 2016. Deja vu all over again.

We've been having this debate for a long time in this country. That debate does not seem like it's happening though at the moment because of Donald Trump's grievances against a separate part of the FISA Act that implicated a part of his 2016 campaign. Therefore, we are having a bit of an adjacent debate here mixed up with Donald Trump's personal grievances against parts of this law and his frustrations over what he sees as enemies within the national security apparatus.So that is why you are seeing, really, the loyalty that Republicans have to Donald Trump in this moment colliding up with longstanding frustrations that progressives and hard-right conservatives have had with this bill -- including, I should note, up until very recently, Speaker Mike Johnson.",

They have, arguably, the most draconian law against abortion on the books and voters -- I mean, that could potentially drive a lot more Democratic voters to the polls that otherwise might not go.

And the Masters sent out an update just a little while ago saying they're going to delay the opening of the gates and the tournament is not going to start until at least 9:00 a.m. this morning. So we're only on about an hour delay as of right now. But yesterday, it looked like it could rain all the way until the afternoon. But we could get lucky. This storm system -- it's moving east and Augusta National -- it's sitting right there on the edge. By 10:00 a.m. all of this rain could be gone and that would be great. Now, once the rain does clear, the weather -- it's just going to be awesome here in Augusta. And that's something that Tiger Woods is really looking forward to. He withdrew last year due to injury before a cold and rainy third round. And Tiger says if everything comes together he still thinks he can win, but it certainly won't be easy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TIGER WOODS, 15-TIME MAJOR CHAMPION:  I ache every day and I prefer it warm and humid and hot. And I know we're getting some thunderstorms but at least it will be hot. It won't be like last year. Every shot -- knock on a tee box -- is -- it's a challenge. So, yeah, once we start the holes it's going to be challenging. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
