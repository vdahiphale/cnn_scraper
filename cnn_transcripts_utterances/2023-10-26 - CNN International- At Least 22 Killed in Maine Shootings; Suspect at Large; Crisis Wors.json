And then he was medically cleared to go and released. More recently, it appears he lost his job. So we're seeing an individual who is -- got experience, has got tactical training with firearms, who has had some mental health issues and who apparently or allegedly snapped tonight and put his experience and his training to work in a -- in a terrible, terrible way.

The way he walks. The way he is walking one direction and addressing a target or looking for a target 30 degrees off the direction he's walking. These are all indicators of very high tactical prowess. And that that is terrifying to me, for the officers that are going out and looking for him at night. And the problem is you might find it and then what? You've got a somebody who is probably more competent with a weapon in the woods than any of the policemen are.

Person of Interest is a way of saying they're a suspect without saying their person is a suspect. The reason is that in in different courts and certainly in the federal system, calling somebody a suspect attaches to it of many different legal protections. For instance, if I'm just talking to somebody as a person of interest, I can ask him questions. But if they are a suspect, I cannot ask some questions without offering them a lawyer and things like that.It also has to do with possible discovery later on. Or indicate, you know, the defense attorneys -- if this person survives and goes to trial -- would say, well, he was a suspect before you had all the evidence in. So that's -- you had pretty much decided he was guilty before you ever set eyes on him. So these are things that have legal standing, but really no factual that he's the suspect.",

The area that you are -- the area where you are searching for him increases every minute the person is out of custody. And you have to assume that they are at least on foot, could have a vehicle. If they have a vehicle within 24 hours, your area of search is immense. It's hard to calculate. But I believe from what I've been hearing on their radio feeds and things like that, they are setting up fairly effective roadblocks. Things where a person would not be able to cross from one side of the forest to another or cross a road. Couldn't drive out of the area. This is not a guarantee, obviously, that they've got him bottled up. But it makes it more likely that they have kept him contained. We just won't know until he's found.",

At least six hospitals have shut down due to a lack of fuel and hundreds of patients from premature babies to the many wounded in ICU's are at risk. If the hospital is not provided with the necessary fuel for the generators, we are issuing a death sentence, this doctor says. The execution is in the hands of the free world. Everyone is guilty. Water pumps will soon stop working too, making it even more difficult to get clean drinking water.

And of course, our hearts go out to your colleagues over there who are having to suppress their own emotional reactions and I guess humanity in some respects, just to get on with the job and try and help patients and save their lives. I mean, it's truly unthinkable. So the WHO, as you mentioned, said a few days ago that around a thirdof the 35 hospitals in Gaza were already out of action. Are you hearing from your colleagues in contacts on the ground that more hospitals are having to shut because of not having enough fuel and critical supplies? HAJ-HASSAN: Yes. So I think that's going to be what we hear constantly over the over the next few days. Two days ago, the Indonesian hospital in the north of Gaza was closed down. They can only operate a very small generator for the operating room, but they cannot accept any more injuries. El Shifa Hospital, which is the largest trauma hospital in in the Gaza Strip, is occupy -- is operating at in enormous capacity. Normally its occupancy is about 700 beds or patients. And they're -- they have close to 3,000 right now. They are using the ER as an intensive care unit. They are resuscitating patients on the ground because there's just no space. They're operating -- operating in areas that are not operating rooms because there's too many patients coming in. I mean, I hate to be graphic, but I think we need to be -- dismembered. You know, yesterday I heard the story of a young person coming in, having lost three of their limbs and asking to be covered because they don't want to be exposed. You know these stories are horrifying and they should be horrifying to everybody. And I think it's really important to note because we keep talking about this as a war with a goal. 70 percent of the victims so far, 68 percent of the deaths actually -- according to the Office of Humanitarian Affairs for the United Nations today, 68 percent of the dead so far are women and children. You know, there's 2,700 children that have been documented as having been killed by aerial bombardment. That excludes 900 children that are not accounted for in those numbers because their bodies are still trapped under the rubble, so they can't be counted amongst the dead. You know, these are -- these are someone's children. And you know Palestinian parents love their -- love their children like anybody else. Like you love your children, like my family loves their children. You know, this is -- this is a human catastrophe. And if you hear the desperation in my voice, it's because I feel like the world is not awake to it. We're not responding to it. And I think part of it is the ongoing dehumanization of this population by people who've had a voice. And my colleagues unfortunately in Gaza, many of who have not been able to have a voice in this, tell us over and over again, we just want to be treated like humans. Day before yesterday, one of them said, we feel like the entire world has come together to eliminate us, and I think those words should be very alarming to everybody listening to your program right now.",
