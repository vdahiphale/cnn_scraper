The judge made clear -- although we don't have the actual ruling, it's under seal. But based on CNN's reporting, the judge made a distinction when it comes to the vice president. Everything before January 6th when he was acting in his vice presidential role as part of the executive branch, not protected by speech and debate.Some January 6th conduct, for example, when the vice president was acting as the president of the Senate presiding over the January 6th meeting of Congress that is covered by speech or debate protections. Which say in the Constitution, you can't question a participant in Congress for any speech or debate on the floor in Congress. So it's a good decision, and I think Pence saw that it was a good decision. He got some protection, and now he's going to appear. As for when, nobody knows.",

It was such a hero on January 6th, but it's a far cry from that to the kind of flamboyant Trumpian and dangerous rhetoric that we saw last night in the Mar-a- Lago remarks. Still, this represents the rule of law. I wish the vice president hadn't said that. I wish Mr. Pence hadn't resisted this subpoena.I will say in terms of timing, Jack Smith has been moving extremely quickly on both of his cases, the Mar-a-Lago documents case, the January 6th case.

Whatever the debate about the vice president's protection under this speech or debate clause of the Constitution that he can't be questioned when he's for example, sitting in the chair as the president of the Senate, presiding officer.Donald Trump has no such protection. So I don't think Donald Trump has standing -- we call it -- to raise these claims. I suppose he could try a last minute executive privilege claim just as a desperate, stalling tactic. He's lost all of those. I don't know, those claims may have been waived already because they weren't raised sooner. We're a little handicapped and knowing the contours because we don't have these grand jury related rulings. They're under seal. But we do know this. Donald Trump doesn't have a legal leg to stand on.

What else is he saying, Kara?[15:40:00] KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so our colleague MJ Lee spoke to the former doorman of Trump World Tower who was included in the statement of facts here. And he told her that he was in complete shock by his inclusion in this and that he was never contacted by the district attorney's office. so, how they're not required to do that. And they used him as an example of a pattern to say that the former president was involved in this so-called catch and kill deals to stop negative stories from going public before the 2016 presidential election. And the way that they use this here, is that the \"National Enquirer.\" who was part of, you know, run by David Pecker at the time, Donald Trump's longtime friend. They say that he paid this doorman. His company paid the doorman $30,000 so he wouldn't go public with an allegation that he knew that Trump had fathered a child with a former housekeeper. Now CNN has never verified that allegation to be true. But in order to stop it from going public AMI paid the doorman $30,000. And prosecutors are saying that's one of several payments that they made, including the one to the former playboy model, Karen McDougal, who story they bought and she never went public with her allegation of a long-time affair with the former president. And also, of course, the Stormy Daniels payment. That was the $130,000 payment that Michael Cohen had facilitated to Stormy Daniels. And that's really the heart of this case because the 34 charges are focused on the false financial -- or the false business records that were involved in the reimbursement of those payments through checks and faulty invoices to Michael Cohen.",

On Monday, they were stripped of their committee assignments. And then tomorrow there will be a vote on whether or not they should be stripped and expelled from the State House of Representatives. The speaker compared their actions -- believe it or not -- to the violence, the deadly violence we saw in January 6th. Saying, quote, what they did today was equivalent, at least equivalent, maybe worse, depending on how you look at it, doing an insurrection at the Capitol.
