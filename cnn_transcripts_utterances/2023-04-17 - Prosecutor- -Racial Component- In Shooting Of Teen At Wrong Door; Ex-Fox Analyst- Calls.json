The idea that a Black teen, goes up, to the door, to the wrong home, and gets shot twice. Fortunately, tonight, he is back at home, recovering, which is really incredible. But now, the man, who shot him, has been charged with two felony counts. But you just heard there, Laura Coates, from the prosecutor, saying that there was a racial component, in this shooting. Why wasn't he also charged with a hate crime? LAURA COATES, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, HOST, \"THE LAURA COATES SHOW\" ON SIRIUSXM HOST: Well, it seems that in Missouri, which is where this is based, a hate crime is actually a lesser felony than the two that he was charged with. The latter one, the idea of the armed criminal conduct, is really an enhancement, based on what you're actually using, to commit a felony. So, I think their thought there is charge the highest crime possible, even though there's a racial component, because that would put you in a lower rung. But you're absolutely right, Pam. I mean, as a mother, I cannot imagine the idea of sending my son, to pick up his younger siblings, and he just gets one part of the address wrong. Just one part! There is no words that are exchanged, it seems. And he has shot out in the arm, and in the head. And to have even the person, who is the suspect now, be temporarily released, while they were pending charges? That's part of the shockwaves, here, in this country.",

There's this case in Saratoga County, where a woman pulled into the wrong driveway, and was shot dead, by the owner of the home. He ended up being charged with a crime. But what is it in our society that we are so afraid of people, we may not know, or somebody who approaches us that we may be unfamiliar with?

But there will be talking points that conflate that. A. JONES: Well also, you're seeing, on Twitter, you always see a lot of details that people don't -- they don't have the full story. And so, people are saying, \"Oh, well, did he go into the house? I would have shot him too. Did he walk up to the house? Get the facts straight.\" But the bottom line is that for centuries, people, certainly White people, many of White people have been afraid of Black people. And violence against Black people, because of that fear, has gone unpunished. And so, I think that this is an instance, where certainly at first it looked as though that might be happening again, because they released this man, after only a couple of hours. But now, they've done the extra -- the extra investigation, and they've brought charges here. And so, I think that was really one of the biggest concerns.

So, if it's a lower standing felony, that's one thing. But that also becomes the thing that throws this, on the news, right? Like this becomes a thing, is it becomes a polarizing issue, when you do this. And the sad irony of it is, it seems very apparent, from what we can see that the fact that the dude was Black, and knocked on the door, and then got shot. I don't remember the last time I turned on the news, and our lead story \"White kid shot because he knocked on the door.\" I haven't seen that one, right? But you can't. I can understand in this county that I think is 87 percent White, you avoid the hate crime part, unless you absolutely have to, because that's when we start getting into this basically the who's the real racist discussion, right, which gets completely away from the fact that separate for race, or anything else, you shot somebody for knocking on your door. And I think that they're going to have to play this delicately, to make sure that that part stays, front and center, even though we can apparently know, the other part really matters, and that's the one that gets people charged up.

And people can track them and say, \"Well, why is this different than that? Why is it not a regular sort of murder,\" et cetera.  But the reason we have hate crime legislation is because we want to add an additional deterrent that people do not believe that they have carte blanche, to act, on the basis of skin color, national origin, sexual orientation, religion, or anything that's perceived as such.

Some of them did not hit him. But he was hit 46 times. He was cuffed, after he was shot, which his lawyers said, just added, to the frustration and the misery.

Dominion says, it was defamed, after Fox hosts and guests falsely claimed its voting software illegally rigged the 2020 election, against Donald Trump. Fox denies any wrongdoing. Well, tonight, a unique perspective, on this trial. Mo Elleithee is joining us now. He is the Executive Director, of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, and until recently, a former Fox News contributor, who was with the network, at the time, when all of this was going on. So Mo, thank you, for your time, here, tonight. And really, really interested in hearing your perspective on this. Because, you used to be a paid Fox News contributor, as a Democrat.

MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS &amp; PUBLIC SERVICE, FORMER FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, FORMER DNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Yes, well, thanks for having me. I joined Fox, as a Democrat, right after I left my job, as Communications Director, at the DNC. I did it because at the time, we weren't engaging much, Democrats weren't engaging much, with Fox News. And I thought, I can go on and tell people what a Democrat is, or I could let Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity keep telling them, what a Democrat is. I trusted my perspective, a little bit more. My first night was the 2016 presidential election. And for the next six years, I would go on several times a week, just to provide a Democratic perspective. My last contract was renewed, right before the 2020 election. And then, we know what happened. In the days and weeks following, when I was doing four to five appearances, a week, they kept putting me on with election deniers. They kept putting me on with people, who were spreading these baseless conspiracies. And I eventually told them, I'm not going to do hits with those people anymore. Suddenly, my hits started decreasing. They just stopped booking me. They kept me on. But they just stopped booking me.

And it's been well-documented that they're just not getting a lot of airtime, to this story.I'll say this. In the years, leading up to the 2020 election, I could name dozens of instances, where I would be at an airport, or at an amusement park, with my kids, and someone would come up to me and be like, \"Hey, you're that Democrat from Fox, right? Don't agree with you. But I like hearing what you have to say.\" In the post 2020 election world, that became further and further in between. Instead, I was getting a lot more trolling, on Twitter, saying \"I don't know why Fox even pays you. You should go to one of the other networks, where you belong.\" And that tracks with what the lawsuit seems to be indicating about Fox reacting to the ratings hit that they were taking, worried about bleed, to places, like Newsmax. So, again, I can't say that my fewer appearances had anything to do with all of this. All I can say is that as I was facing a more hostile audience, I was getting booked less, and they were making some very clear editorial decisions.",
