He is advancing with his forces along four different access, it is something that I called, initially a demonstration, which has a doctrinal definition, that is a force that is going into an area where a decision is not sought, but it's perceived by the enemy to be a threat. They have exceeded what I think are many people's suggestions of what they could succeed in this area. Now the question is, how long can they hold that ground, and what kind of risk are they taking on an extended front, inside of a salient. It's very good that they did what they did.

In fact, some of the airfields they've been able to pull air defenseforward in a very good combined arms operation. So they are threatening the Russian forces, and they are causing Russian forces to be pulled off. I'd agree with the Foreign Minister when he says, we're not there to seize territory. They're not. They're going to eventually go back to their front lines, into the territory of Ukraine. But what they have proven is they can go there, not that they want to, but that they can, and they can threaten the Russian forces and cause Russia to look at the disposition of their forces.
