This hour, golf superstar Scottie Scheffler facing a felony charge after being arrested outside the PGA Championship. Russia is advancing in northwest Ukraine in a lightning offensive. CNN is on the frontlines. And as the renewed push by some European countries to recognize Palestinian statehood, I'll speak to the prime minister of Slovenia about how his country is planning to move forward. Well, the world's number one golfer is now out of jail and back at a Kentucky Golf Club and on the course. It comes after he was detained by police earlier this morning. Officers booked Masters champion Scottie Scheffler into Louisville jail on four charges, including second-degree assault on a police officer, which is a felony offense. Take a look at the pictures coming in to us. This is Scheffler at the course at Valhalla Golf Club for the second round of the PGA Championship. He is expected to tee off in just a few minutes, about seven minutes from now. We do have video of the arrest from an ESPN reporter who was at the scene. He was handcuffed after he tried to drive past a police officer into the Valhalla Golf Club before the start of the second round of the PGA Championship. Now Scheffler's attorney says the charges against the golfer for bypassing police outside the tournament resulted from a, quote, \"miscommunication.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE RAINES, SCHEFFLER'S ATTORNEY: He's charged with assault second, and criminal mischief and disregarding an officer signals. The assault is second, it's actually a felony.",

He is a deeply religious man, a very kind sort of soft-spoken guy with a very clean image and rightfully so. And this is not an uncommon thing that happens with golfers in the morning. Obviously the accident -- I doubt Scottie knew about the accident. I don't know. But there's security all around golf courses all the time, police cars, and the players are in cars that are marked with PGA Championship. It sort of designates them as a participant. And usually the cops just kind of waved them through. So I'm sure that's what Scottie was trying to do. Other players have said that's what they did. They kind of went around the traffic because players obviously need to get to the golf course. When there's a traffic situation, they make room.

There's almost zero percent chance that he was trying to do anything nefarious. But I also understand from the police perspective, you know, this was a chaotic situation. Someone passed away at 5:00 a.m. They're trying to make things. It's pouring rain. The roads are slippery, so I just think it was a horrible sort of confluence of circumstances that led to this outcome, and the rain delay actually kind of saved the day because Scottie was able to get an abbreviated warm-up in and I was stunned at how loose he was on the driving range. He was laughing with his coach and, you know, there was a report that he went into the player dining area this morning and just kind of said, hey, everyone, so it looks like he is at least going to try to --",

So the idea is that we initiate the process immediately, showing the solidarity with the Palestinian people immediately, and then clearly stating the expectations to both sides. Both sides to cease the fire, to release the hostages, and work towards the two-state solution.

And that is potentially hideous for the hundreds of thousands of people who live here, who began to see their life get back to normal in the past two years since Russia was kicked out from near here in 2022. And in fact, in the last hours there's been another heavy strike here in the city. Smoke still blowing across the skyline. And also too last night, we heard drones, we heard other explosions, too. So clearly this city in their sights. A lot of the analysts talking about Russia lacking the resources for a strategic success, not entirely clear what they mean by that. I suppose they're saying they don't have enough troops to take Kharkiv or advance on Kyiv. But remember, the slow incremental advances they're making are putting a lot of Ukrainian supply lines, key towns within their reach for a summer ahead. They're in a tight window until U.S. weapons start getting into Ukrainian hands. But some Ukrainian officials are suggesting that 25,000 Russian troops have been committed to this new push from the Russian territory towards Kharkiv. That is a huge number and it's certainly showing some progress at this stage. A tough mission, frankly for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to at time sound like they have a situation under control, but also sound the alarm to their allies to get weapons in here faster.

And if you would've asked me thismorning, which golfer from the tour would end up in a jumpsuit being booked by Louisville police, Scottie Scheffler would be at the absolute end of that list. I mean he is such a clean cut, new father. He's just such a good guy. And so this was really shocking to see and like you noted he said that this was really a misunderstanding. A big misunderstanding. I mean, you consider everything that he's been through right before teeing off in a major in the second round in which he's favorited to do really well at, and so he was making his way into the course from everything that we've gathered. ESPN reporters were on the scene and detailed this and have video of him actually being taken into custody, but it sounds like according to Scheffler, he didn't understand what he was being asked to do in a chaotic situation. And so when police tried to stop him from entering Valhalla, he proceeded forward and one of the officers, according to ESPN, was still attached to the vehicle, which may have been the reason for this felony that has been levied against him. One of these four charges that he's going to now have to deal with. But eventually when he did stop, he got out of the car, according to ESPN, was handcuffed right away. And then we saw him cooperating, being taken down to be booked on these charges, but a very confusing morning for sure. And all of this set against the backdrop of tragedy an hour before all of this happened. A man was unfortunately killed, lost life hit by a shuttle bus near the course. And so that might have had something to do with increased police presence. You always see police officers and a lot of security, and there's a lot of moving pieces around these majors, getting people in and getting people out. But, you know, that extra level of chaos and unfortunately tragedy might have added to this. And afterwards Scheffler's mind was very much with them, with the family of the man who was killed and said that his deepest sympathy is actually there, despite everything that he's been through.",

But you would have to think, especially when you consider the fact that on the video that was recorded by ESPN's Jeff Darlington, you know, he mentioned, he looked at the reporter Jeff and said, can you help me? I mean, especially being in such unfamiliar territory with somebody who is so used to staying inside the lines, would never imagine finding them self in a situation like this, that it was probably rattling to him to a certain extent. So, you know, he's the best in the world for a reason. Mentally, he is sharp. Physically he's sharp. He'll probably be able to move forward and do quite well, but a surreal scene. I mean, I can't even describe what we were all thinking this morning when we were just watching all this unfold, it didn't seem to make sense.",

It starts to get major and extreme from Corpus Christi and then part of it headed into some of those Houston suburbs. We're looking at highs in the 90s feeling like 100 degrees or hotter once you add in the humidity. With the power outages ongoing without the access to AC, that means that that could leave more people vulnerable to heat sickness. So officials really urging people check on your neighbors as we go through the next couple of days. Here's a look at the storms, what's left. We have a line of storms up in parts of Mississippi and Alabama, a couple of showers and storms in the Florida Peninsula. Right now this is the most intense that we've got, but we haven't had any watchers or warnings with this. It is still pumping lots of lightning and some heavy rain. The severe risk continues as we go through the day today. We still have that level two out of five slight risks there.

In Northern Gaza, the Israeli military now says that its troops are now fighting in the center of the Jabalya refugee camp. And that's particularly notable because that was the site of some of the most intense fighting in the early months of the war. It's also where from my vantage point back then in Sderot across the border with Gaza, we could see some of the most intense airstrikes and explosions taking place in that Jabalya refugee camp. But just overnight, the Kamala Adwan Hospital in Northern Gaza says that 12 people were killed in these operations. The Israeli military has also said that there were Israeli troops among casualties over the course of the last several days from the fighting in Jabalya, including one friendly fire incident. And of course this is notable because the Israeli military withdrew from this area months ago, only to have to go back in, as it said, that Hamas was seeking to re-install itself in that area. So intense military operations continuing, having a price obviously in terms of casualties as we're seeing on the ground, both militants, but also civilians among the dead.",
