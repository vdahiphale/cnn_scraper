Right now a jury is deliberating, weighing and measuring the facts presented by the prosecutors and whether they've made a convincing enough case to convict Donald Trump.The 12 Jurors spent the morning listening to a court reporter read pivotal excerpts from testimony of Michael Cohen and former tabloid publisher David Pecker. Donald Trump is inside the courthouse. He's not allowed to leave the building until there is a verdict or the jury breaks for the day. So what's going through his mind? Well, you might call it the Freddie Mercury strategy. He's convinced that nothing really matters. And he actually believes that he will likely be found guilty. Now, this is all reporting from our very own Kristen Holmes, who starts us off outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan. What are you hearing, Kristen?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Dana, I mean, to be clear, the big hope for Trump's team and the former president himself is that there is a hung jury that this ends in a mistrial. Not that he is convicted. However, when he is talking about this case with his allies, with his donors, he has told some of them that he believes it is likely he will be convicted.He cites the fact that the jury is from Manhattan, a area that is mostly made up of more liberal leaning voters. Remember, Donald Trump's team believes at the heart of this, that whatever the verdict is, at the end of the day, that it's going to be political. In fact, yesterday, they were actually circulating around the 2020 election data. They even sent it to me saying, essentially, if you look at this map, it would mean out of 12 residents in Manhattan, at least one of them is a Republican or right leaning voter. Their excuse for that, or the reasoning behind that is that that could lead to a hung jury or a mistrial. Now, we have no reason to believe that this is going to be a political decision. We know that these jurors are taking this very seriously. You have to remember that Donald Trump and his team, they're sitting there in this room, and they really have no idea what is going to happen. They are reading through the same tea leaves that we are reading through right now and trying to decipher if there is any movement within that jury. If there was going back through, any kind of potential for a sympathetic jury. But at the end of the day, they really don't know how that is going to end.",

And so that also will factor into how the campaigns respond to it.Is there a truly moveable universe where there is a return on investment, for digging into this? Obviously, the Trump team, I think, if you look at the predicate that they've set throughout this whole thing, I think we'll see nothing change in their messaging in the aftermath. It's been that this is a rigged trial. This is all a political prosecution. And I think they're going to stick with that. Because that does, they think, sort of walled off a swath of the electorate from being open to having this impact their thoughts. I think the Biden calculus here is going to be a little bit trickier for them to figure out what targeted voters of theirs are really going to be interested, a Biden either hammering away if he's convicted that Trump is now a convicted felon, and using that as framing every day. Or perhaps trying to stay above it all, and just respect the jury process. Whatever they come down on, I think they have a trickier calculus.",

So it's like press F4 on the computer.LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR: Yeah, I mean, it's heads, Trump wins, tails, you lose. So I mean, that's the -- and strategy that they're using here with these criminal cases is also the strategy that they use with the election writ large, which is laying a foundation of no matter what the system is rigged. So if he ends up winning the election, or if he ends up, you know, being found not guilty, then great. But if he does, well, the system's rigged anyways, and my voters believe that. Now when it comes to Biden's campaign, you know, we just have a new poll out at PBS NewsHour that finds it 10 percent of Republicans and 11 percent of independents, if Trump is found guilty, that they could be swayed.

But they live with the implications of it. One of the conventional wisdom isn't right. What if there's the boomerang effect? What if it somehow either helps Donald Trump or makes no difference at all? And in the back of their minds, they were like, well, let's see how the case plays out. Right. So -- but it is -- for the base, they've already decided and the conviction might even ramp up turnout. For the diehard Trump opponents, their minds are already made up. He's already guilty in their minds. What about the Nikki Haley voters? What about the disenfranchised kind of independents who aren't really sure they want to turn out anyway? Would a conviction make a difference? We've seen in polling people saying that a conviction against a candidate would make him less appealing candidate for president. But is it this conviction?

So they can't get that enthusiasm. It needs to come directly for the president. And so I was talking to Democratic strategists on the ground who said, look, we need to fan out. There's not going to be these other candidates that can get voters excited to go to the polls, so it needs to come from the president.

Thank you so much, gentlemen, for being here. Ron, I want to start with you and read to you and to our viewers a section that the jury asked to be reread to them earlier today. And this is the metaphor that the judge used to explain reasonable doubt. For example, suppose you go to bed one night when it's not raining, and when you wake up in the morning, you look out your window, you do not see rain, but you see the street and sidewalk are wet and that people are wearing raincoats and carrying umbrellas. Under those circumstances, it may be reasonable to infer, that is, conclude that it rained during the night. In other words, the fact of it having rained while you were asleep is an inference that might be drawn from the proven facts of the presence of the water on the street and sidewalk and people in raincoats and carrying umbrellas.

I think part of the reason why they wanted both the Pecker version as well as the Cohen version was to see how much that lines up. [12:25:00] Did they tell basically the same version of what happened, or is it different? Because the big issue in this case is going to be Cohen's credibility, and this is going to be one way for them to test that. I want everybody to know, we are not in a sprint. This is a marathon.

And the rule about jury instructions, not going to the jury, which is a New York rule, not a universal rule, seems to have originated with the idea that you want to make sure that all the jurors are getting exactly the same instruction at exactly the same time. And the only way you can do that is if the instructions are read orally in open court to everyone.The same is true to a large extent of the transcript. But the other issue with the transcript is that not everything in the transcript is read to the jury.
