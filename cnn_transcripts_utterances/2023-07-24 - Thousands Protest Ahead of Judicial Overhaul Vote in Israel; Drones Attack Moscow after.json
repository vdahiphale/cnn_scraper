So whether those strikes on Crimea and Moscow overnight are in response to what we've seen here, that is a major question. But it has been a week of regular attacks, almost daily attacks by Russia, some of the most severe coming just yesterday on this historic center where I am in the middle of Odessa. It's a UNESCO heritage site. And we are in the building that was perhaps most damaged, the Cathedral of Transfiguration. The cathedral authorities asking us to wear these helmets, because there is so much damage that could then fall down. But I want to show you what has happened. This is the most damaged part of the cathedral, this corner up here in the top right. This is where we are told a missile or a rocket came plunging through the ceiling, crashing down at least two floors, we're told. Just look at this. Incredible levels of damage. And then I mean, ask my cameraman, Scott McQuinney (ph), to just spin around. You can see here in the floor, this marble floor, how powerful the blast was. Shrapnel digging out pockets of that marble. It is just incredible to see the ceilings of this cathedral blown off. It's as if there is no ceiling at all. The daylight, the sun coming right through there. And then over here is the knave, and the altar. And when you look up at the altar here, you can see that it is blown to the side. Those pillars leaning to the side. It's only standing up because it is leaning against the wall there. And if Scotty (ph) pans up to that beautiful dome, all of the windows have been blown out because of this blast. The frescos have come off the wall. The chandeliers have fallen down. Those golden ceilings are falling down. This is what remains of the knave of the cathedral. This would normally be filled with pews. People come here for services and for prayers. Now it is covered in this -- this smokey, acrid dust that really scratches your throat and your nose. You can see how -- how thick it is. Damage done to -- to the walls here. You can see, that is from the blast of -- of this strike. This church, this cathedral has a long history. It was destroyed in 1936 by Stalin when he was in power. It was rebuilt when Ukraine became independent. Now, once again, under attack and severely damaged -- Poppy, Erica.",

In parts of Arizona, the heat is so brutal, emergency rooms are filling up with people being treated for heat-related illnesses. Dr. Frank LoVecchio shows us the ice bed used to treat some of the worst patients. DR. FRANK LOVECCHIO, EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN: We try to throw a little bit of ice, you know, on here, on the bottom, get a little bit on the bottom. And then when they get their body on here, we like to throw it all above them. So what's going to happen is the only thing showing is going to be their head, OK? That in an ideal world. We also like to throw water on there. This has been shown to drop their body temperature a degree almost every five minutes, if done properly. ELAM (voice-over): It's not just heat stroke. The director of the Arizona Burn Center says people are getting burned on the pavement, accounting for half the patients in the Valleywise ICU. DR. KEVIN FOSTER, ARIZONA BURN CENTER DIRECTOR, VALLEYWISE HEALTH: The pavement is so hot it only takes a fraction of a second to get a pretty deep burn. And to lay on a hot pavement or a hot surface for ten minutes, 20 minutes, a half an hour, an hour, that's full thickness burn. The skin is completely destroyed. ELAM (voice-over): Phoenix's mayor explains how they are battling the heat. MAYOR KATE GALLEGO (D), PHOENIX: We have mobile cooling units that can go to an emergency site like a fire. We even have tactics where we can go out with IVs that have been cooled, and that can cool people from the inside, which can save lives. Another program we have that's very popular is our Cool Pavement program. So we are really just looking at how we design the city. (END VIDEOTAPE) ELAM (on camera): And they have been really working to help out the unhoused population there in Phoenix. And also the other thing to keep in mind, people may be collapsing because of heatstroke. And that's when they're coming in contact with that super-hot cement and asphalt. And that's where they're seeing these burns. But what we're seeing here in the West is going to start to move its way East. And you should see temperatures rising to about 20 degrees above normal.

Now the United Nations Command is a multinational military force that includes the U.S., and it controls the South Korean side of the Joint Security Area, which King, along with others, was touring last week.

Now we do know that U.S. officials have been trying to get in touch with North Korea and talking to their allies to get some information about this U.S. national. But on Friday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that they have no update yet, though he maintained that they would continue to try. Now this is bringing a lot of concerns here back at home.
