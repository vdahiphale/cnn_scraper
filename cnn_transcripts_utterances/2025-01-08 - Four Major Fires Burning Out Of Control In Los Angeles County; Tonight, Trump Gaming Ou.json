In Southern California catastrophic wildfires, are ripping through the Los Angeles area, forcing thousands to evacuate, scorching entire neighborhoods and killing at least two people so far. CNN's journalists are live inside the fire zone with all the late breaking information.Plus, here in Washington, Donald Trump is making final preparations before he takes the oath of office. Tonight, the president-elect is huddling with Senate Republicans as he games out his first moves once he begins his second term in the White House. We'll bring you details from inside these critically important meetings. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Will Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Our coverage begins tonight with the breaking news in California as truly historic wildfires are tearing across Los Angeles County. Right now, four fires are burning out of control, fueled by extremely strong dry winds, including one gust of a hundred miles an hour. The damage already apocalyptic, with officials now calling this the most destructive wildfire outbreak in Los Angeles' history. CNN's team of journalists is on the ground covering the disaster from every angle. Let's go first to CNN's Anderson Cooper. He's in Altadena, California. That's just northeast of Los Angeles. Anderson, give us the latest. What are you seeing? What are you hearing?",

I mean, it hasn't changed much. I kind of thought it would have died down by now. But what you see is that, yes, the buildings that have destroyed, eventually, there's nothing left to burn and it's just smoke coming out of them, but these fires keep jumping.So, these are fresh fires. This is brand new. This is not something -- that house there, that now, just in the time we've been talking, those flames now, you see them pouring out of that attic window. They're soon going to spread to the entire roof. There's a Prius parked in the driveway that authorities are concerned about. You know, it seems like when the cars catch fire, it's the tires first, then it spreads to the rest of the vehicle, and then the gas explodes. You know, you think it's dying down, the wind dies down and you think, okay, now it seems like it's less, and then you suddenly look and you realize, oh, wait a minute, it's jumped a block away. And you go up to that block, which we just did, we just came here and this is the situation. There wasn't a fire here an hour ago, two hours ago. The fire was down there.

And he's got big things that he wants to get done, including relating to the tax cuts that he passed the first time he was in office and whether or not they're going to do that again, of course, as well to the promises that he's made about what he's going to do for the southern border inside the United States, and there's a divide over how to get that done.

You're absolutely right. We are a massive school system of 540,000 students across 1,000 schools, through 720 square miles. And as a result of going to bed last night, none of us slept. But going to bed last night, around midnight, facing two fires, waking up this morning facing four fires with intensified winds surrounding these fires put us in a position of shutting down close to 300 schools and modifying the schedules of about an additional 100 schools. We're looking at the data. The biggest concern at this point is air quality, which varies from location to location. And obviously, we're making decisions going into tomorrow based on the conditions as we see them today. In fact, we'll be joining the mayor's press event to make a joint announcement about conditions and what the day will be like tomorrow.",

We're talking about Marquez Elementary and Palisades Elementary, and then a high school, Palisades Charter High School, you know, providing educational services to over 2,000 students, sustained serious damage. In fact, when I visited, there was an ongoing fire consuming about 30 percent of the school. It is -- it is burning bungalows and portable classrooms, as well as athletic facilities. The old legacy building was still pretty intact, but we lost two schools valued at millions of dollars and about 30 percent of Palisades High is being threatened as we speak. That's why we are working with Sacramento, our state leaders, our federal entities, utilizing our channels to FEMA to achieve the necessary reimbursements for the reconstruction of these sites.",
