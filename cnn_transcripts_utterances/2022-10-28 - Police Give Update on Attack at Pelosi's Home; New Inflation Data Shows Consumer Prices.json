      "sentences": "At approximately 2When the officers arrived on scene, they encountered an adult male and Mr. Pelosi's husband, Paul. Our officers observed Mr. Pelosi and suspect both holding a hammer. The suspect pulled the hammer away from Mr. Pelosi and violently assaulted him with it. Our officers immediately tackled the suspect, disarmed him, took him into custody, requested emergency backup, and rendered medical aid. The suspect has been identified as 42-year-old David DePape. Mr. Pelosi and Mr. DePape were transported to local hospital for treatment. This is an active investigation currently being led by the San Francisco Police Department Special Investigations Division. We are working closely with our partners from the FBI, the U.S. attorney's office, the U.S. Capitol Police, and our district attorney here in San Francisco county, D.A. Brooke Jenkins, and her team. The motive for this attack is still being determined. Mr. DePape will be booked at San Francisco county jail on the following charges: attempted homicide, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, verbal abuse, and several other additional felonies. Before I go any further, I'd like to thank the responding officers for their swift action this morning -- those San Francisco police officers are Officer Colby Wilmis, Officer Kyle Cagney and Sergeant Edmund Huang. I'd also like to thank our emergency dispatcher, Heather Grimes, who is standing her, to my left, for a really amazing job. For inquiries regarding Mr. Pelosi and his condition, we refer you to the statement issued by Speaker Pelosi's office this morning. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to our district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, for a few brief comments. Let me say in advance, this is what we know at this time. We'll update you further but we will not be able to take any questions after this statement.",

Her husband was there at the time when they arrived with the suspect. He said both were holding hammers at the time. It sounded like, if I was understanding it correctly, you heard as well, that when they arrived, the suspect then attacked Paul Pelosi with the hammer and then officers moved in and apprehended him. Both Paul Pelosi and the suspect were taken to an area hospital where we're told Paul Pelosi is expected to fully recover, according to the statement we got from Nancy Pelosi's office earlier today. We also learned the identity of the man in custody -- 42-year-old David DePape is his name. We don't know much about him but we have learned he will be booked on several potential charges, including attempted homicide, elder abuse, burglary and others. I think that sums up the new information that we got from this press conference. Let's bring back some of our guests. I'll start with you, Evan Perez. Just bring our viewers up to speed, now that we have a little bit fuller picture on what we know at this hour.",

And I'm sure search warrants have been executed. They already probably, obviously, have gone through all the social media they can. So, there's a lot of things that have gone on right now. It seems to me, at least it sounded to me when I was listening to Chief Scott, that perhaps a -- the alarm was triggered when the person made the entry into the home. When you have high-profile individuals like the speaker of the House or someone in your jurisdiction, your computer-aided dispatch system, your CAD system would flag that address. So if anything came up at all, whether it was a phone call, whether an alarm or whatever, that would be a priority-one response. He called it a priority-A. That's what they call it in San Francisco. That's \"get there as quickly as possible.\" Lights, sirens and so forth. So, that would get a very, very rapid response. That very well could have been how they knew that something was going on and they responded so quickly.",

Right now, they're the lead on this. But behind the scenes, believe me, the FBI is a major player in this, along with the U.S. Capitol Police. They're trying to see whether or not there are other people that, perhaps, when they go to his Web site, there could be other names that were there. And they're checking and making sure that they have adequate security. I'm speculating a bit, but you don't know what they may have found that would cause them not to put out any more information than they already have.

      "sentences": "Yes. And our team, CNN investigative team, has gone over a number of these conspiracy theories in which he was listed. Evan mentioned some of them. But some of them also, I think, we're still hearing on the campaign trail today.One that he posted was about the MyPillow CEO, Mike Lindell, saying that the 2020 election was stolen. He posted apparently multiple videos from the MyPillow CEO making that false claim we hear the former president make, as well as some others. He also posted some -- apparently some transphobic images. He linked Web sites falsely saying the COVID vaccines were deadly. He attacked the January 6th committee. And also went after George Floyd, of course, who was killed by a Minnesota police officer, Derek Chauvin. He criticized that conviction as a modern lynching. These are the kinds of theories and world views that he was espousing online, 42-year-old David DePape, who police identified as a suspect who entered the Pelosi home around 2:30 in the morning local time in San Francisco. Attacking Paul Pelosi with a hammer and Pelosi being hospitalized. Mr. Pelosi, as they expect him to recover. But learning more about the kind of theories, the kind of disinformation he was post willing online and that, apparently, we'll see whether -- how much that -- what the exact motivation is. Police are not saying exactly why he was in the household. Saying it's still being investigated and whether or not he was actually out for the speaker. We've heard from our colleague, Jamie Gangel, the speaker was his target. Saying, \"Where is Nancy,\" as he entered the home. But police not yet going that far as they continue to investigate exactly what he was doing, why he was in there, but at least we know what he was posting online, a lot of disinformation and conspiracy theories.",

JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): We don't have an actual update on his condition at this moment. But what we're told from multiple sources, who have been briefed on the attack and his hospitalization, is that he was taken into surgery this morning, but that the family was told he is expected to make a full recovery. That said, we know that he was attacked with a hammer. He was hit multiple times. And just to go back to what Manu was saying, what we've been told from sources briefed is that when the assailant came into the house, the -- he confronted Paul Pelosi. First, he was shouting, quote, \"Where is Nancy, where is Nancy?\" And we are also told that he was trying to tie him up. That when police arrived, he was saying, \"We're waiting for Nancy.\" So, it's -- we don't know all the motivation involved here. But it's quite clear from the reporting thus far that this was directed at the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. And again, just to reiterate his condition, we were told that he went into surgery this morning, but that the family was told he's expected to make a full recovery.",

And wish Mr. Pelosi a speedy recovery.\" So, that is tinged, as you might say, with politics there. I think Democrats are outraged. There are Republicans who are outraged. And I think there are Democrats who say, every Republican should be publicly denouncing this. And just like Republicans said that every Democrat should have been denouncing the attempt on Justice Kavanaugh. So, you know, it's not -- politics is not going to go away. As Chief Ramsey said, you know, I think the question is, how you deal with this so close to an election. And how much manpower it takes to actually protect not only our elected officials but members of the Supreme Court, et cetera, and federal judges. So, you know, this is a conversation we're going to be having. But in the meantime, we are having an election soon. And the question I have, is this going to inspire other people?

So broadly, inflation and prices still moving in the wrong direction, which is up, right?We learned in this report today, just released this morning from the government, that prices on average rose about 0.3 percent on a monthly basis. Annually, that's closer to 6.2 percent. That's certainly better than the peak we saw this year. But it's so much higher than the Feds' target. The Fed's target is 2 percent. Still quite a bit of work ahead of the Fed. In fact, KPMG putting out a note today saying that this report in the data we got today essentially solidifying that we are going to see a massive rate hike again next week, potentially, when we hear from the Fed perhaps of another three quarters of a percent, Ana. As you know, that would be the fourth time consecutively that we heard from the Fed this year that they raised rates in that magnitude. On the other hand, we got data that consumer spending actually held up. Consumers continue to spend on things like services but also even physical goods. Not necessarily huge, large, big-ticket purchases but still physical things. It's encouraging to see, even despite this inflation, even despite the Fed's rate hikes, consumers are still holding on.",
