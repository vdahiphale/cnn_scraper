And we begin in Ukraine, and the longstanding demand from President Zelenskyy to use western weapons against Russian targets. In Kyiv this week, the U.S. secretary of state and the British foreign secretary gave no concrete commitments on that issue. But Antony Blinken today said the White House will quote, \"adapt as the war changes.\" Now, how that translates on the ground could not be more critical for Kyiv as Russia pushes back now against the counteroffensive into its Kursk region and Ukrainian troops struggle to hold on to the key town of Pokrovsk in the east. In an exclusive exit interview, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg tells me, this land war, Europe's biggest since World War II, is one of the worst catastrophes of his 10-year term. That full conversation in a moment. But first, as the fighting continues, so too does the flood of casualties from the front. There is a lifeline in the form of Ukraine's constantly running railway hospitals. They've never been filmed before, until this exclusive report. This operation is considered a military secret, so we're not revealing its route or identifying those on board by their full names. Here it is. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AMANPOUR (voice-over):  On a hot late summer morning, departure time is fast approaching at this railway station in Ukraine. But this is no ordinary train, it's a hospital on wheels, evacuating dozens of wounded military personnel away from the Eastern Front as Russia's brutal offensive grinds on. Paramedics carefully loading patient after patient, many of them unconscious, onto repurposed carriages. It's a highly organized special operation and it's never been seen before. CNN gained unprecedented and exclusive access to what so far has remained a closely guarded military secret. Before the train moves off, I meet 35-year-old Oleksandr, wounded by a drone strike, which has caused him to go deaf in one ear. His call sign is Positive, but he doesn't feel it.",

If electrician Oleksandr was feeling down after 18 months fighting this brutal war, Stanislaw, who signed up in March, is still full of patriotic fervor. He can still summon a smile, even though he has shrapnel in his body and damage to his lungs. STANISLAW (through translator):  Personally, I was ready for it. I was ready to trade the shower stall, the good sheets and the bed, the good conditions that I had at home for a foxhole. I knew where I was going and what I was doing. OLEKSANDR, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES MEDIC (through translator):  The most difficult part is evacuation from the front line. Combat medics who work on the front are dying, just like soldiers. AMANPOUR (voice-over):  As these carriages rumble on through fields of gold, think for a moment of history repeating itself in Europe when thousands of ambulance trains evacuated casualties from World War I's trenches, more than a million to the U.K. alone. Tonight, darkness descends as we arrive at the destination, and suddenly, there's activity everywhere again. As ambulances line up, collecting and dispatching to hospitals across the country.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AMANPOUR (on camera):  Now, Russia's brutal war in Ukraine and a land war in Europe has been one of the biggest challenges for NATO since perhaps its inception from the ashes of World War II. And we filmed that report in Ukraine just before interviewing Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels. He's the man we've grown used to seeing lead that organization, and after a decade at the helm, he is stepping down at the end of this month. I sat down with him at NATO headquarters, the center of the allies' military power for his first exit interview.

So, we were only going to leave when we had the confidence that the African government was able to take over and secure the country. But after 20 years and after paying a high price in blood and treasure, we realized, NATO allies realized, the United States realized that we could not continue this. And therefore, we made the decision to leave Afghanistan. I believe that was the right decision. But I believe that we should have in a way understood it earlier and stayed on the first mission fighting terrorism. That's a focused mission, and we achieved a lot. We degraded al Qaeda, we prevented Afghanistan from being a safe haven for international terrorists, and we actually gave a million of girls education. And that's a lasting achievement.",

There was no discussion with the Afghan government, no discussion with Afghan women. And so, I want to ask you then, you had to deal with President Trump, who's appeared to be very anti-NATO, very anti the alliance, very transactional.

And, on those issues, it was possible to have a working relationship with the Trump administration, because the main message from the Trump administration as actually from the Obama administration and now the Biden administration was that European allies had to spend more.

So, military support to Ukraine is the path to peace. Second, when there is an agreement on a line, then it's very important that this is the end. Because first, they took Crimea and we said that was unacceptable. After a few months, they took Eastern Donbass back in 2014. Then we have something called Minsk 1, that was an agreement that lasted for some months. And then, Russia violated that one and pushed the border even further west. We have Minsk 2. And they waited for eight years and they had a full-scale invasion. So, now, if we have a new agreement on the line, then we need to be sure that's -- it really stops there.

We need to stand together to ensure that this authoritarian neighbor is not able to control neighbors.

And he cited theWharton School and all of its professors saying he had the greatest economics plans. But the Wharton School said he would add more than $5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. And you've even mentioned that Trump, while president, added $8 trillion to the deficit. That's been your biggest dispute with him. Is that why even though you say you're in favor of Trump, you haven't given a full-throated endorsement of Trump?",

The Harris-Biden administration will add another $8 trillion. So, I think both parties are terrible with spending and with debt. And I don't think there's enough concern with this. I've been proposing for years we should look at all spending. Most people up here say, well, we can never talk about entitlements. Well, entitlements are two-thirds of the spending. I consider anybody who takes entitlements off the table for discussion to be a non-serious person. Harris has definitely taken that off the table, but so has Trump now. So, both of them have taken two-thirds of spending and say, we're not going to do anything. Well, then the remaining spending, which is about $2 trillion, half is military and half is nonmilitary, most Republicans take the military off of the consideration as well, and military gets automatically increased as well. You're left with a tiny sliver of government, and most of that government is government that Democrats support as well. So, there really is a constituency for all the spending, but there seems to be nobody or very few of us have up here are worried about the ramifications that one day America may wake up, have a bond sale, and have nobody show up to buy our bonds or have to pay exorbitant interest. Even now with the slight tick up in interest to paying, I think the Fed -- you know, we're paying a little over 3 percent on our interest for our debt now, interest is now bigger than the military budget in our -- it's a -- it's one of the largest items in our budgets now, interest, squeezing out other spending. So, I think the debt needs to be discussed. It's part of the reason I haven't enthusiastically endorsed Trump, but it doesn't mean I think Harris is better. I think Harris is actually worse on spending and has shown no concern for the deficit.",

No, it was spending. Spending went up. Reagan was not very good with spending and neither were the Republicans or the Democrats back then. When you look at cutting rates, revenue typically goes up. So, if you look at the 2017 tax cut, there's a slight dip in revenue, but if you look at in two-year cycles, 2017 to 2019, 2019 to 2021, what you find is in every two- year cycle tax revenue has gone up since the tax cuts. So, the revenue, cutting tax rates, having the government take less of your check expands the economy, you get more growth and you actually get more tax revenue coming in. So, I don't think letting the tax cuts would -- expire would do great things for the deficit, but I think it would be very destructive to the economy.",

But -- and that Vice President Harris is trying to do a future looking thing.

And a lot of it's about personality andthe way you present yourself and not so much about policy. But I meet people every day who will say, well, you know, I'm not a big fan of Donald Trump's decorum, but I love his policies. That's what I hear every day from Republicans who lean towards voting for him. And I think there are many people in that camp, I think there are people even in the independent camp that may not always like his presentation may not always like the way he presents himself, but are conservative in the sense that, you know, for example, Kamala Harris wants to give everybody $25,000 to buy a house. Well, that's a ridiculous economic notion. There is no money to give them. Where would she get it? Is she going to take it from someone else? Is she going to print the money? So, most economists have said that's a bad idea. The idea that you would set price caps on things being sold and charge people with -- you know, that make goods with charging too much or price gouging. Even on CNN, the economists came forward, not typically conservative and said they ought to, you know, rethink that and think about what's happening in Venezuela with price controls. So, I think Trump can win on the policies because I think Harris' policies are so bad. It's still, though, a challenge for him to get to people in the middle because there's a long history, he has a long public history with the folks, and he has to convince the people in the middle that maybe there's a softer side, or maybe there's a side this less bombastic. And I'm not saying -- I support Donald Trump versus Harris. I'm more supportive. I haven't endorsed him, but I still think his policies are a million times better than Harris'. But to get to people in the middle, he has still more work to do",

And I haven't said I wouldn't endorse, but I have said that things like, you know, the debt are important to me. The lockdown, I think, was a mistake. And I think there needs to be a promise that there won't be a lockdown again. I think the lockdown was a horrible mistake. I think also that we need to investigate the U.S. funding of the lab in Wuhan and make sure that doesn't happen again. Not only just in Wuhan, I'm concerned that we are funding research to create super viruses, basically gain of function viruses that don't exist in nature. We're doing that in the United States, and I'm concerned that an accident here could have a death toll, not a 0.3 percent, which is what COVID was, but I worry about a death toll of 5 percent of the public or 10 or even 50 percent of the public. There are viruses they're creating that could kill 50 percent of all America. That should be more strictly regulated. And I'm putting forward a bill to regulate gain of function. And I'm hoping to have a bipartisan bill. I'm hoping to have this within the next month or so, maybe pass the Senate. This will be a big step forward.

And so, what would happen is we have a lot of revenue coming in. We have $4 trillion in revenue coming in, that would pay for most of basic government. Why don't we just agree not to shut the government down when revenue is coming in while we have a dispute and figure it out? The other thing we could do is we could try to divide up the spending. So, instead of having all the spending in one bill, where if it doesn't pass, everything shuts down, the parks shut down, and it's disruptive. If we pass the bills individually -- you know, our founding fathers in the history of the Congress was, you had 12 appropriation bills. And then, if you had a dispute over one, and let's say with the IRS, the Democrats wanted $80 billion to collect more taxes, Republicans thought that was too much money and was going to be too aggressive tactics on honest working people. And so, we have a dispute over that. If we had only that item to dispute and maybe the Department of Treasury or whatever shut down for a few days, but everything else stayed open, then we can have a debate over it. But from a fiscal hawk's point of view, we have this discussion. We have a debate. Sometimes government shuts down, but we never reduce the cost of spending. We never win. Those who want less spending never win. We always lose because everybody finally folds and says, we don't want to be blamed for shutting the government down, which is disruptive. But also keeping it open and not reforming it is bad, I think, ultimately for the country and for the future of the country. To run a $2 trillion deficit is just not good.",
