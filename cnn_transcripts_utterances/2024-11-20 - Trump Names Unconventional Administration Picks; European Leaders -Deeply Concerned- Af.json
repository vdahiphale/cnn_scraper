But it may be a place where Gaetz has a chance to push back in a way that of course, Donald Trump would see.Do you think were going to get as far as actually having a hearing on this? I think what were hearing from a lot of senators, and it is seeming to be bipartisan, is that they deserve the chance to do you know, what is typically done. Obviously, there have been instances of recess appointments in the past. This is something that Trump has said he had wanted to do. But there seems to be, you know a bit of a more consensus that they should have the chance to pepper him with questions and see, you know is he qualified? What are his you know, positions on -- you know, the Department of Justice, obviously, you don't have to tell you, it's extremely important. We've seen how the Department of Justice has operated the past four years. This is something that Trump really wants to switch up. And so, you know he would have the opportunity to convey how he would do that. And of course, as you mentioned, you know, this is somebody with the sexual you know, abuse. You know, there's an investigation going on where figuring out at this moment whether we will get that report released you know, whether senators might subpoena for it. So there's a lot, you know, at play here but a confirmation hearing is at the point where they'd be able to figure out what he would do.",

From the economy to politics to, you know, everyday life, but also just the idea that these -- these cables are often literally just laid along the seabed and you could get to them and intercept them, and, you know, put something on there which would give key information to whatever authorities they're trying to reach. So it's a massive vulnerability, but the cost of laying these cables is huge. The cost of protecting them would be even bigger. You know, digging them into the seabed would be a massive mission.

Here's just one instance of that across the state of Washington. You can see the destruction that's left behind by hurricane force gusts that have toppled trees within this area. Unfortunately, some of these trees are splintering. This home, in fact, trapping two of its residents inside, took over an hour to extricate one of those residents. And here's a close up inside of one of the homes. Look at the tree landing and basically slicing that roof right in half. Now, this is the storm system. You don't have to be a meteorologist to understand what's going on here. This powerful, rapidly strengthening, low pressure system that spin in the cloud cover. We called it a bomb cyclone because it dropped more than 24 millibars. That's a unit of pressure in less than 24 hours. In fact, it doubled that criteria yesterday. So, a very powerful storm system energized with winds gusting equivalent to hurricane force gusts and that is, of course, toppled the trees and power lines, leaving nearly 700,000 customers without power this morning. And guess what? We're not done. Another round of wet weather, wind mountain snows and high winds expected over the coming days from northern California through the coastline of Oregon and into the state of Washington that has been impacted so badly, our radar lighting up like a Christmas tree here.
