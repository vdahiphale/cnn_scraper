There are evacuations underway. There are some mandatory and some voluntary evacuations now in 20 counties. Why is that? Because a storm is coming.We know now that it's no longer a tropical storm. It has gained in strength to a category one hurricane, and we are expecting that to grow even more powerful as this hurricane hits those warm Gulf waters and intensifies to potentially a category three. And just to remind people what kind of damage a category three storm can do, it is not about the wind so much as it is about the water. A category three storm, you will remember, hit in Louisiana in 2005, hurricane Katrina, and you remember the story there with the breaking of the levees. It was all about the power of water. That is the fear right now. The storm surge, you see how these beaches are so flat. That water can be pushed right up and into very populated areas. So they are telling people to get to safer ground. You don't have to go hundreds of miles. You don't have to go to another state, but you do have to get to safer ground, and that is all spelled out for people. I want to go he go to our Derek Van Dam. He has been beside me all day, but now he has got another view as he watches this hurricane get ever closer. Derek?",

The temperatures are running two to three degrees Fahrenheit above where they should be this time of year. So that's like jet fuel for an incoming area. As it approaches this area, it's going to feed off of those warm waters.But as Sara was talking about, how this coastline is so susceptible, particularly the west coast of the Florida peninsula, the Gulf side, right, and into the Big Bend area. Let me show an aerial perspective to give you an idea of what we're talking about here. So side by side, hopefully, you have got this up, you can see the storm surge projections. eight to 12 feet near Cedar Key. That is incredible. But look at the vast miles of flat beaches that go as far as the sky can see. There's Clearwater Beach just to the north. And we are in Sand Key particularly just to the south of this. And we are going to get on the granular details. The National Hurricane Center has this storm surge prediction map. And what you are looking at is Tampa Bay. And those shading of orange, that's anywhere from four to seven feet, perhaps up to nine feet of storm surge inundation that's above normally dry ground. Near Clearwater, we zoom in a little bit closer where I am located, and you see the yellows and the orange right on that barrier island where we are currently set up with our camera crew. But let's go a little further north into Cedar Key, and what you are going to see there is a lot of red and a lot of orange. That is because that topography of the Big Bend, it's like a catcher's mitt literally taking all of that piled up water from the very shallow and very warm Gulf of Mexico that you see behind me and it's going to pile up all that water. Remember, Hermine, back in 2016, was only a category one. That brought six feet of storm surge to Cedar Key. We are projecting eight to 12 feet that could inundate that area. Sara?",
