      "sentences": "President-elect Donald Trump spent his Saturday locked down at Mar-a-Lago, meeting with his transition team and going through a series of candidates that he is considering selecting for top cabinet roles as well as White House positions. Now, on Saturday, he did not announce new people that will be servingin his second administration. But he did announce who would not be. He talked about not wanting his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, or his former U.N. Ambassador, Nikki Haley, to have any part in his second term. I'm going to read for you some of what he wrote. He said, quote, \"I will not be inviting former ambassador Nikki Haley or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to join the Trump administration, which is currently in formation. I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously and would like to thank them for their service to our country. Make America Great Again.\" Now, to give you a little bit of context on where some of this is coming from. Mike Pompeo is someone who many people in Donald Trump's inner orbit still are close to and believe that he did a good job as Secretary of State. However, his relationship with Donald Trump has really soured in recent years, particularly because Pompeo had in many ways distanced himself from the former president after he had left office in January of 2021. I'd remind you as well that Pompeo did not endorse Donald Trump until after the Republican primaries this year, something that, as we know, Donald Trump viewed as not being as loyal to him. And in my conversations with senior advisers, they argued that in private conversations over the past few days now, Donald Trump had asked them whether or not Pompeo would be loyal to him or whether he could trust him in a second term. Now, as for Haley's part, Donald Trump has said that he appreciates that she had gotten up on stage at the Republican National Convention in July, called for unity. And also remember, she had actually been in discussions with the Trump campaign in the final weeks before Election Day about potentially meeting for a joint appearance and helping him campaign. That never materialized. But again, Donald Trump had said he appreciated that on some level. However, I am told that the president- elect still harbors a lot of animosity toward Haley for the attacks that she had lobbed at him during the Republican primary, but also that she had remained in the primary for so long. Donald Trump has remarked that he believes that she hung on longer than was appropriate. Alayna Treene, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Biden extended this invitation to Trump in their phone call on Wednesday when the president congratulated the former president on his victory in the 2024 election.Biden has said that he directly told Trump that he is committed to a peaceful and orderly transition, which is not something that occurred when Biden beat Trump back in 2020. At the time, Trump put up many roadblocks in the transition process, never conceded the race and did not extend this same invitation to Biden. Now, Trump did come to the White House in 2016, days after he had beaten Hillary Clinton and was hosted by then-president Barack Obama in the Oval Office. Now, we're also told that an invitation was extended to First Lady Melania Trump to come to the White House to meet with First Lady Jill Biden. It's unclear if and when that meeting will take place, but this is all part of the Biden White House's efforts to try to show that they will assist in this transition. It could be an interesting meeting between the two men, given the fact that one of their last substantive in-person engagements was back on that debate stage in June, which really derailed Biden's candidacy and eventually prompted him to drop out. The two men have spoken since then. Biden had called Trump following the assassination attempts against him, and they were both at the same New York City 9/11 event a bit earlier this fall. But this will be an interesting meeting, as the two men are set to meet face-to-face in the Oval Office. Biden is now facing this reality where the man who preceded him, who he had beat in the 2020 election, will now be returning to the White House in January. Arlette Saenz, CNN, Washington.

      "sentences": "So, the race for the White House is over, but the battle to control the Congress has yet to be settled. Republicans have secured the Senate, but the House is still up for grabs. Democrats right now have 205 seats. Republicans, 213. Remember, the magic number to reach a majority is 218. Republicans now just five seats away from a unified government.There are still races to be decided in California, where Democrats could pick up seats. And in the Senate, Republicans will have at least a 52-seat majority. Votes are still being counted in two seats. All right, joining us now from Allentown, Pennsylvania, is Charlie Dent. He's a former Republican congressman and the Executive Director of the Aspen Institute Congressional Program. Thank you so much for being here with us again. So, let's start there. The balance of power, where do you think we'll end up and how might that help or hurt Trump's chances of passing his agenda? CHARLIE DENT, FORMER U.S. REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE: Well, first, it appears that the Senate is going to be firmly under Republican control, whether it's 52, 53, or 54 seats remains to be seen. So, you can already mark that one up. The second issue is the House. The House will likely be under Republican control. I suspect somewhere between 220 to 226 Republican members. I can't tell you if it's going to be the low end or the high end of that range, but you need 218 votes. So, expect a narrow Republican majority in the House. So, think about that. Now, in terms of governing, it won't be easy for President Trump with that narrow majority in the House. He's promised to do a number of things, including making changes to the tax code, obviously deportations, tariffs, and other issues, mass deportations. Some of these items will require congressional approval, some will not. And remember, in the United States Congress, the Senate has a 60-vote threshold for most issues outside of some budgetary matters, which is done through a process called reconciliation, but 60 votes are usually required. And so, that does demand some type of bipartisan collaboration. And so, that means that Democrats in the Senate will have a significant amount of leverage over many of the items that must be passed into law. So, keep that in mind as we deal with the Trump administration, which is now standing up its team and beginning to populate that administration.",

It's hard to argue that the American people haven't given him a mandate.So in the first administration, Trump didn't accomplish some of the things that he wanted to because of sort of the chaos surrounding the process, how things were carried out. Often the courts reversed what he was trying to do. Project 2025 provides a detailed playbook on how to actually push through some of these plans to, quote, \"take down the deep state and return the government to the people.\" So do you expect that to be, if not a template, then a rough guide?",

      "sentences": "Well, first, let me say something about a mandate. Donald Trump won the election decisively. Now, a mandate is quite another matter. What was the mandate for? Was it for tariffs, for example? You know, was it to go after his enemies from within? Was it to populate, use the Department of Justice to go after his enemies?So I'm curious, I think we're all kind of curious to see, you know, how far he will go in trying to disassemble, disassemble, you know, how the government works in terms of political appointments versus those career civil servants where Trump wants to reach down deeper into bureaucracy and make some of those nonpartisan civil service jobs, political appointments. That is a big question and we're anxious, I think we're all anxious to see how he actually intends to execute on that promise and other promises where he's, again, threatened to go after, you know, his enemies. And so I'm watching most carefully the Department of Justice and how that administration will be populated and how they would execute some of these orders that many would find highly questionable or unethical. The Defense Department is another one too. You know, he's -- there's already a discussion about whether or not he'll keep the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. So these are all the -- these are all the kinds of things that we simply don't know the answers to because he did make some very strong statements. And we'll see if Donald Trump, you know, keeps all of those promises. He is keeping a list. He will try to execute on some of those, but on tax policy, for example. You know, he's talked about reinstating the state and local tax deduction. Well, this is something that the Republicans have opposed and Donald Trump, he helped limit that. And now he's saying he wants it back. And so he's going to run into some issues with his own members of his party. On Ukraine, he has many Republican members who don't want to surrender Ukraine to Russia. And there'll be issues. He has many members who don't want across-the-board tariffs because the impacts on their districts will be significant. So even his legislative agenda with a narrow majority, especially in the House, might be difficult to enact. Some things he can do through executive order. And those he will probably try to do rather quickly.",

He said that Donald Trump likes to surround himself with winners and that Susie Wiles has certainly earned her stripes as a winner given all of her campaign victories that she stacked up here in the state of Florida and the most recent presidential election. Now, keep in mind, though, of course, that Donald Trump had four chiefs of staff during his first term as president, but Susie Wiles seems to want to bring an anti-chaos environment to this next Trump White House. So we'll see how that plays out. Randi Kaye, CNN, Palm Beach County, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
