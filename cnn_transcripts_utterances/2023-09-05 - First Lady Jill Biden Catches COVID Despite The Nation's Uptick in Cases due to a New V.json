The White House says she's currently experiencing only mild symptoms and will in fact remain at Biden's home in Delaware. However, President Joe Biden has tested negative for the virus and that is good news. Both were in Delaware, though, for the Labor Day weekend.An official tells CNN there are currently no changes to the president's schedule at this time. The president is scheduled to depart for the G20 Summit in India later this week. And as COVID cases increase across the United States, lab tests indicate the new coronavirus variant may be less contagious than previously thought. And vaccinated Americans should have some protection against it. Scientists say the new BA.2.86 variant is highly mutated. It's been detected in 11 countries so far, including the United States. Two groups of scientists, one in China and another in Sweden, have also reported the results of the analysis of the new variant. Joining me now is Dr. Scott Miscovich, who is president and CEO of Premier Medical Group. So good to see you again. Here we are again talking about COVID. I'm going to steal that headline from the \"New York Times.\" They said it seems everybody has COVID. They asked why. I'm sure Jill Biden wants to know, Dr. Biden wants to know why she has it as well. Just to state the facts here, she's doing fine, she's 72 years old, in very good health. What can you tell us about any risks that you know those people that age might encounter from getting COVID and if she should start maybe Paxlovid? DR. SCOTT MISCOVICH, PRESIDENT AND CEO, PREMIER MEDICAL GROUP: Absolutely what a way to start that's exactly what I was going to say. I really hope that she is on Paxlovid because, you know, Paxlovid has worked so well. It does reduce up to 90 percent risk of hospitalization and even higher with death. Now, with First Lady Biden, the good news is, from what we know publicly, she's in pretty good health for, what, 72. And so that also goes in her favor. But I really hope that she is on Paxlovid right now. And back to your other point at the beginning, masks in public. We don't see any masks anywhere, especially, well, anywhere, let alone our politicians and other people in other areas, but people over 65 probably should be wearing a mask when they're in public.",

So right now we're back at square one, anybody over the age of 65 should be getting it. All the nursing home residents should be getting it. Anybody who's immunosuppressed should be getting it. But some of the early looks we're getting are that the lines aren't gonna be that long when it comes out in a couple of weeks. And at the same time, please everybody get your flu shot and adults now over 60 get the new RSV vaccination. So, it's an important time to prevent infection that will be happening for sure.

But this is what we know about this potential reported meeting, that Kim Jong- un may meet with the Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia. This is what we've learned from the U.S. National Security Council.And they are set to discuss potential arms deals. Russia to get even more North Korean weapons to use against Ukraine. The timing of this meeting is unclear, but according to \"The New York Times,\" citing U.S. officials, it first reported about this potential meeting. The Times says that Kim would travel from Pyongyang to Vladivostok, where he would meet with Putin at an economic forum that is set to run this weekend, starting from September 10, roughly around the same time as the G20 in Delhi. Vladivostok is not far from North Korea. It's also where this scene took place a couple years ago in 2019, where Kim Jong-un and Putin met for the very first time. And Kim made that journey on that famous, highly armored green train. Now, as for this new potential reported meeting, The Times reports that in exchange for North Korean weapons, what Kim Jong-un wants is advanced technology from the Russians, technology for satellites, for nuclear-powered submarines, as well as desperately needed food aid. Now this potential meeting follows that recent visit in July by the Russian defense minister. He visited North Korea then. It also comes as the United States says that these two countries are actively advancing their talks over another potential arms deal. Now last year, the U.S. said that North Korea delivered rockets and missiles to Russia for use by Wagner forces, which was something that North Korea denied. Now Russia and North Korea, though, their relationship has been getting stronger. In fact, we just learned that the Russian defense minister says joint military exercises are currently being discussed. And Kim and Putin have been exchanging letters to each other, pledging to increase their cooperation. I want to show you this letter. This was published on August 15th by the North Korean state news agency, Kim's message to Putin, saying, quote, \"I am firmly convinced that the friendship and solidarity between the DPRK and Russia will be further developed into a longstanding strategic relationship and that the two countries will always emerge. Victorious,\" unquote. Now, the U.S. is urging North Korea to end its weapons talks with Russia. Back to you, Paula.",

He is going to be returning to the campaign trail in other parts of the country this week, even as he contends with his legal cases around him.
