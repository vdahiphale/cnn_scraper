The Fed Chair beginning two days of testimony before Congress, this starts on Tuesday. Investors hoping, he will clarify the Federal Reserve's rate hike path, good luck with that. The best economic picture goes to the U.S. labor market for those blockbuster January jobs numbers. Economists say do not expect a repeat performance however, when new numbers drop this Friday. And finally the award for best makeup goes to Wall Street stock markets making up lots of lost ground last week. Even in the face of continued interest rate uncertainty tech leading the way in fact up more than 2.5 percent a bit U.S. centric. I have to say on those awards, but the award fever on \"First Move\" does not end there. Later on the program, we will hear from the Director and the Producer of the Oscar nominated short Docu film, The Elephant Whispers. As you may have seen it on Netflix the story of a South Indian couple who adopt and raise and orphaned baby elephant Raghu the film delivering a powerful message about the impact of climate change on animal populations and the critical need for greater conservation efforts a package and packed show indeed. Let's begin with a look at global markets no elephant size gains so far at least, U.S. futures are currently high as you can see there, green arrows in Europe too offer a mixed Asian handover stock and solid gains in South Korea and Japan but a sluggish start to the trading week for SHANGHAI. As you can see they're down two tenths of 1 percent. Investors are reacting cautiously I think to Beijing's modest 5 percent economic growth target for 2023 and its goal to increase military spending by some 7 percent plus. All this unveiled at the ongoing Chinese National People's Congress will be discussing all of this. As well as President Xi's latest moves to shore up power with Leland Miller, the CEO of China's Beige Book, who of course, is the biggest private data collected in China. So what they're seeing in terms of growth rebound, also going to be interesting too, plenty to come on the show. But first, we do get and begin with the latest from Ukraine, where Russian forces are fighting to encircle the Eastern City of Bakhmut. This map helps explain that the situation today as you can see Russian forces now have the city surrounded on three sides and are attacking Ukrainian forces from both the air and the ground. Kyiv vowing to continue to defend the city and to keep a key supply line open. Melissa Bell is in the capital for us. Melissa, Russia spent months now trying to capture this particular region, even the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin saying today and emphasizing the symbolic nature of this fight rather than the strategic and operational value not to detract away from the work of forces there. Just talk us through the latest.",

These are some of the early announcements from the country's annual legislative session of the National People's Congress. And Marc Stewart have been watching all the details very closely a growth target of around 5 percent, maybe the lowest in decades.

      "sentences": "Indeed, Julia, I think one thing that we're looking for from Beijing is the shift in political leadership underXi Jinping. We could see wholesale changes in the figureheads of different departments, including those that dictate economic policy. That could mean perhaps a new approach to regulation, a new approach to the west enter the U.S. That's something we're going to have to see in the next few days. As you mentioned this revision of economic projections from 3 percent last year to 5 percent this year, I think you may have said it's minus. I've been hearing a lot of different opinions from economists on this, I heard from one economist who felt that it's very much a reflection of the reality and where China is today, especially with its potential to spend or restrictions surrounding spending. Other economists though, feel that this 5 percent figure maybe a little bit conservative. If you look at some of the data since the zero COVID policies were lifted, things actually may be a little bit more encouraging, especially when it comes to spending. With all of that said China still does have a lot of challenges. It's still dealing with local governments that have a lot of economic strain because of the lockdowns, the quarantine and the constant testing. Young people are still looking for jobs and then we have this ongoing housing crisis in China. Also, you did mention an increase of 7.2 percent in military spending. In many ways that is a reflection of the environment in the region. For example, in Japan, where I live, we have also seen an increase in military spending because of perceived threats from places including North Korea. Also late today, we heard from Taiwan's Defense Minister, he feels that this increase in spending from Beijing is perhaps an indication that China may take military action against Taiwan, if it feels that it's necessary. So that's where we stand right now, Julia. These next few days, with the People's Congress, in in Beijing will be very telling about both the political and economic direction of China.",

And you had this little calf walking around holding onto Bomman's hand. And I saw that there was this very special bond. So I pulled my car on the side, and I jumped out. And I went and joined them to the river. And they were just splashing around in the water and were just really beautiful. I noticed that there was this unusual family dynamic that was there. And during this time, I also realized that there was a bittersweet beginning to the story, because the Asian elephant is just losing its habitat at a very rapid pace due to encroachment and climate change. In a fast developing country like India, there are roughly about 35,000 to 40,000 Asian elephants left, and the situation is very grim. We're losing elephants at alarming rates due to poaching and human animal conflict. But I wanted the story to be positive. Why focus on all the depressing parts when we were living in this beautiful place. And I think in this time, there are just so many stories of animals being killed, species dine out. And this was a positive story that highlights the beauty of man and animal working together. I believe coexistence is the way that we move forward into the future. And only with mutual respect and cooperation, can we save the planet?",

And there is just so beautiful things that Bomman says, like, you know, we get everything we need from the jungle, and we take only as much as is sufficient. Here also, whatever we need, we have put the concept of sufficiency is so important. And that's what the indigenous community really takes care of. And, yes, we do have Ganesha as a Lord in India and they do pray and they do relate to blessings of elephant for their as that is the work that they do, is working with elephants.

And I think this is one of the most prevalent examples of climate change in our day to day life. You had this wild herd that wandered into a nearby village and searched food and water. And that's when she got electrocuted, and she died on the spot. And you're you had baby Raghu, who was hanging around next to her body for many days, and posts that he went and moved off and he joined a herd of cows where he started eating grass, and I think he was not able to get enough food because he didn't have the stomach of a cow. And then after that, he sort of resorted to moving towards the local village where he started stealing fruits and vegetables from the local shops nearby. And that's when he got attacked by stray dogs. And that's the reason he does not have a tail at this point. And that's when the forest officers intervened and the local people. And that's when they realized that they couldn't actually take care of an elephant calf. So they gave him some water, they had to dress his wounds. And they call Bomman from the forest department to come over and to look after him. And after about a month or so after he got slightly more recovered this when they took him back to the camp. And they also tried to reunite him with his herd during that time. Because the forest department really looks at trying to reunite calves that are orphaned or abandoned, to try and find their wild herds and when everything fails, is when they actually think about bringing the calf back to the camp.",
