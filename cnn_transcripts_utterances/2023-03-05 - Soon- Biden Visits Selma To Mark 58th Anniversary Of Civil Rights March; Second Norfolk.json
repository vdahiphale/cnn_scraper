      "sentences": "Hello everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right. Moments from now President Biden will arrive in Selma, Alabama to mark the 58th anniversary of the day known as Bloody Sunday. On this day in 1965, 600 people began a march from Selma to Montgomery, demanding an end to discrimination in voter registration. Marchers were beaten by white state troopers, marchers including the late Congressman John Lewis, as they tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, an event that sparked outrage and helped rally support for the Voting Rights Act. CNN's Arlette Saenz is joining us right now. Arlette there in Selma for the event today. So the president is expected to make his own case for maintaining, restoring lost voter rights.",

      "sentences": "Yes Fred, he is. The president will make his arguments against the backdrop of what was a brutal, yet very historic moment in the Civil Rights Movement.The president will be here on the -- to celebrate the 58th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, as you recapped, that moment where civil rights and voting rights activists crossed that bridge right behind me and were severely beaten by police officers, many of them white police officers. Now, the president is traveling here to Selma, the White House says in order to try to ensure that the history and the memory of Bloody Sunday is not erased from Americans' memories. But he is also expected to make the case for voting rights, which so far voting rights legislation has floundered on Capitol Hill. Trying to pass a new voting rights legislation was something that was really a core tenet of President Biden's 2020 campaign. But so far the legislation that has gone up to Capitol Hill has simply been unable to pass, including one piece of legislation that was named for the late Congressman John Lewis who was one of those marchers here on Bloody Sunday 58 years ago. Now, President Biden, this is going to be his first time to Selma as president, but he has been here for these commemorations in the past, most recently in 2020 when he was a presidential candidate. He did not march at that time. He spoke at one of the historic chapels that is just a few blocks away from where we are. But that year was also the same year that the late Congressman John Lewis made his final appearance here in Selma around the Bloody Sunday commemoration. I remember being on hand for that and it was a surprise when he arrived here, and the crowd was simply electrified by the moment. The president hoping that coming here to Selma will allow him to reenforce his case for voting rights especially at a time when many activists have been frustrated with the White House and their inability to get legislation passed so far. Now, I also want to note that while much of the focus today will be on voting rights and remembering Bloody Sunday, the president is also visiting Selma for the first time since that devastating tornado ripped through the city in January. He may get a firsthand look as he's driving the site of that devastation. But in just a few hours we do expect the president to be making his case for voting rights once again.",

This one near Springfield, that's about 200 miles away from East Palestine, the site of the company's fiery train derailment and toxic spill one month ago. 20 cars came off the track early Saturday evening. Nearby residents were temporarily asked to shelter in place out of an abundance of caution, that is. That order lifted earlier today. Norfolk Southern officials say there were no hazardous materials on board. Still hazmat teams from the EPA and Clark County each independently examined the site to confirm that. CNN's Polo Sandoval is following the latest developments for us. So Polo, tells us more about the train and what the federal response had been?",

Authorities also adding that there were at least four tankers that were identified as having non-hazardous materials. Two of them containing non -- rather residual amounts of diesel exhaust fluid and two others that were containing with (INAUDIBLE). It's basically a water soluble solution and that there were no, sort of any leaks.Also this accident happened in an area with no protected sort of water source -- rather, it occurred in a place that was not established as a place that had that protected water source. So that's certainly good news. But nonetheless this is certainly going to be raising questions, Fred, about why this actually took place. When you look at the broader scope, the Federal Railroad Administration does report that it sees at least a thousand derailments a year. So certainly not unusual but this, given what we saw a month and one day ago, is certainly something that is going to beg a closer look in terms of they why this occurred. And this of course, happening as the federal authorities said that they were bound to see another derailment. And that's why the procedures, the practices, the designs when it comes to the rail industry had to be closely examined. Fred, back to you.",

The \"New York Times\" is reporting today on just how panicked top brass at Fox News Channel were after the 2020 election. Fox was first to correctly call the battleground state of Arizona for President Biden. After election night the network held a Zoom call to discuss the Arizona decision, as well as how to keep from angering its conservative audience in the future. In a taped recording of that meeting reviewed by \"The Times, a top Fox News executive argued that if the network had not called Arizona for Biden, its ratings would have been bigger. And some Fox anchors suggested viewer reactions should be considered before calling a state. CNN has not independently verified the contents of the recording. In a statement, a Fox spokesperson says in part, \"Fox News stood by the Arizona call despite intense scrutiny. Given the extremely narrow 0.3 percent margin and a new projection mechanism that no other network had, of course, there would be a wide-ranging postmortem surrounding the call and how it was executed no matter the candidate,\" end quote. So this comes as Fox currently faces a $1.6 billion lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems which its talent (ph) frequently criticized during the 2020 election. Elahe Izadi is a media reporter for the \"Washington Post\" and co-host of the podcast \"Post Reports\". Elahe so good to see you. So how do you think this reporting may impact how Fox News covers elections going forward? ELAHE IZADI, MEDIA REPORTER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Well, it's unclear whether it's going to affect their coverage going forward. But what this call -- this Zoom call that took place a little over a week after the election shows that internally the network was debating how to approach elections going forward. And we also know in the days following they did fire, or let go, depart, two top people involved who were in calling that election. And so it's important to know that Fox at the time had developed this new way of projecting elections. So it did call Arizona first ahead of every other major news organization. AP Followed soon after. And so there was a question about what will Fox do in an election where it is very close and a Democrat prevails? I mean this call raises that question of whether they've already sort of changed their approach to calling elections when it is very close. We did have the midterms 2022, there weren't, you know, any contested races very close as far as who is going to hold the House or who's going to hold the Senate. But it raises the question of what internally are they doing or what will they do going forward. I'm not sure whether the revelation of this call was reviewed by \"The Times\", it did not come out necessarily, you don't know, as a result of this lawsuit. But I don't know whether the public knowing about this will impact how they cover elections going forward. Because we also have to consider their viewers, who is watching Fox. Are their viewers even aware that this call exists and how much do they actually know about the lawsuit and the revelations coming out about it?",

      "sentences": "I think the fallout today, you may see some folks, especially media watchers and other conservatives who were defending Fox for how it approached the election or were reticent to criticize it and seeing these internal communications from top, not just executives, but news anchors, hosts saying that, you know, perhaps other elements should have been considered when calling an election and that, you know, maybe we should have waited, maybe that would have bolstered ratings.But as far as their loyal viewers, you know, this call paints a picture, it adds to the picture that we already know about that internally there was a lot of panic at the network after the election in the days following when they did see viewers slip away. But now Fox is still the most watched cable network. They still have a very strong viewership there. And again, I'm not sure whether their viewers, their most loyal viewers are aware of all the details that we're discovering because you know, how much is Fox actually covering this lawsuit? Their media analyst said on his own program that he was prevented by the network from covering the lawsuit because the network was being sued and they didn't want him to cover it because of some sort of conflict perhaps. A decision that he disagreed with. So I always wonder, like how much do they know about what is coming out in these calls.",

You know, there was a block an hour where Fox lost in the ratings to Newsmax.Now since then, they're far and away the most watched beyond their competitors on the right. But you know, the 2024 election is going to shape up to be very interesting in this regard considering that former President Donald Trump is winning and he's already taken very sharp aim at Fox and now Rupert Murdoch and other individuals based on what is being revealed in these filings. So if the question is of how is Fox going to navigate the primary season? You know, everyone is sort of looking at Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to see if he's going to run.

Tennessee is now the first state to restrict drag shows this year. But other similar measures are working their way through GOP-led state legislatures around the country.

O'HARA: You know, honestly, I went to school at East Tennessee State University as a trans individual, and I walked on campus every day in fear for my safety and for my health, honestly in that sense (ph). And I was picked on, I was bullied and I was pushed around until the GSA actually started doing a drag show on campus where it brought awareness to queer individuals, female impersonation, male impersonation and also just the art form and the expression of it. It caused us to have a similar celebration around opposing gender expression versus identity, and it actually became a way that it was celebrated on campus. So it's fearful to me because this law would obviously ban even something like that because obviously it's a public campus.

You know, up until a few years ago the small town of East Tennessee Bristol, where I'm from, that's (INAUDIBLE) area, never had a Pride event. And they finally did, and they had a great turnout. It was really good for the economy in that local area. It was also really good for the queer citizens as well as the allies in that area to be able to celebrate who we are, what we represent and also the equality that's in an area like that where you don't necessarily find it so easily. And that I think is what's going to affect, not only entertainers, but also the citizens of these small towns in Tennessee the most. I think that people that are supporting this bill are a little misunderstanding what it directly affects. It affects public view of drag altogether. It's also putting us in a box with strippers and nudity and exclusivity of adult entertainment when a lot of times drag performance can be very good. It can be family oriented. It can be very beautiful and artistic. And I just hate that all drag is being put into this box.",

And then we've seen a decrease in this most recent year.That we're seeing mirrored in the academy award nominations with a particularly glaring omission for \"The Woman King.\" And so, I think it's largely the voting body is being exclusionary once again because this is a consistent message, particularly with women behind the camera in that director role, women of color being excluded when they have the talent, they're not given the same access to opportunity or accolades as their white male peers.",

This was likely a female moose. This was a cow moose. We often think of bull winkle, these docile, big, lanky-looking herbivores, but they are incredibly fast, they're incredibly agile. And when they feel threatened, they can be incredibly dangerous, especially females, cows, as we enter the time of year where they're producing offspring. These are creatures, Fred, that live in a world with grizzly bears and other predators. So a mother moose, a mom, will do anything to protect her baby.",

They tend to do that. But that, too, is very serious. You mentioned, of course, a mamma bear, mamma moose, fierce.
