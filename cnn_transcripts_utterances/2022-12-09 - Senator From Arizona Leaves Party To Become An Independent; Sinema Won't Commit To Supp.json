I'm Kasie Hunt in today for Jake Tapper.We start with our politics lead and that major shake-up on Capitol Hill that could have major ramifications not just immediately, but in 2024 as well. Today, Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona announced she's leaving the Democratic Party and registering as a political independent. The top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and the White House are downplaying the news, pointing to ways they've worked with Sinema before in a bipartisan fashion. And Sinema says in an interview with Jake, that she doesn't see much changing, but her move does cause uncertainty about how Democrats could control the Senate in the next Congress given their incredibly slim majority. And it could throw the 2024 Senate map into chaos if Sinema runs as a third-party candidate in the crucial battleground state of Arizona. In just a moment, we're going to bring you part two of Jake's exclusive sit-down with Senator Sinema. But, first, CNN's Jessica Dean with new reaction from Republicans and Democrats so Sinema's announcement.

Kim, for this to happen this way, I mean, the Justice Department must be getting really frustrated with the former president. Are you surprised that they took this step? KIM WEHLE, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. SECRETARY:  I'm not. We have seen over almost two years, the Trump team saying they would overturn the documents. We have no more documents. As of June, there was an attestation that everything had been turned over. And then there was the execution of the warrant in August, when thousands of documents were found. And as was indicated just recently in the last week or so, additional documents. So, you know, this reason that the proceeding is sealed is because we are talking about classified information. We are talking about national security. This is important to broader interests beyond Donald Trump and I think the Justice Department is tired of the games. As Evan said, that lawyer over the summer who signed that erroneously reportedly has her own criminal defense counsel at this moment.
