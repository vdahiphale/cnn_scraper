      "sentences": "It's very good news, John. You know, Memorial Day only two weeks from today, but the real rush begins on Thursday on the roads according to AAA. Only ten days out. So, make your plans now if you've not already.The big thing here AAA says is that this is really foreshadowing a huge summer for travel, especially on the roads. The vast majority of people will drive 50 miles or more, 37 million of that 42 million people expected to travel during the AAA holiday travel period over Memorial Day. The good news here is that gas prices are down pretty significantly compared to where we were back just this time last year. $3.54 is the average price for a gallon of regular according to AAA. Compare that to a year ago when it was $4.47. So, we've gone down nearly a dollar a gallon. The worst times to travel, and this is the thing you should really listen to, 3:00 to 6:00 p.m. on Friday, before Memorial Day, then coming home, 12:00 noon to 3:00 p.m. on Monday, Memorial Day itself. The real thing here, and you can really tweak your schedule, if you have the ability to work from home, AAA says if you come home on Tuesday that might be better, even stretch your trip into Wednesday, that might be even better because that is when the traffic really subsides on 395, 95. You know the hot spots on the East Coast. It's going to be really bad. AAA says, in some cases, the traffic could be double than what you normally see. So, a two-hour commute would be a four-hour commute over the Memorial Day long weekend. The real thing that is driving the big rise in travel here and the numbers, air travel, up 11 percent AAA forecasts compared to 2019. So that is a huge difference. We may see numbers, new records set in the pandemic era, maybe numbers even higher than what we saw back before the pandemic when travel was huge. A lot of things driving that right now, John. Really international travel is a big growth period that we will see in the summer travel, holiday travel period. So, so many people are waiting to get out and they are really undaunted as the pandemic subsides here, John.",

Trump's comments come from a new interview with the messenger just days after severe weather forced him to call off a rally in Iowa.And while it rained on Trump's parade, DeSantis was able to capitalize on that moment, reportedly organizing a last-minute event close to where Trump was set to take place. So, Errol Louis is joining us right now. He's a political anchor for Spectrum News and a CNN political commentator. All right, a few things seemed to go well for DeSantis in Iowa this weekend, mostly that Trump wasn't there because of bad weather. Did you see a man, though, that could successfully challenge Donald Trump?",

You know, if you get a lucky break, you've got to take advantage of that.And Ron DeSantis did rearrange his schedule. He got to meet with a lot of statewide Republican leaders in the very conservative northwest portion of the state. So, he was sinking his roots where they most need to be exploited. You've got to keep in mind, Sara, in 2016 Donald Trump lost Iowa in the Republican caucuses. It was Ted Cruz who came in first and Trump, in fact, was tied with Marco Rubio. So, these are voters, as we say, every four years that are very used to being catered to. And so Ron DeSantis, I think, is doing some of what they expect there. And he may see some political benefits from it.",

And that's because he doesn't think of them as his immediate problem. His immediate problem is Ron DeSantis, make no mistake about it. They're polling, you know, sort of neck and neck in -- depending on which poll you're looking at.

And, you know, over the weekend staff said that they were making some slow progress, but it sounds like this meeting tomorrow is going to be even more important to see whether or not they can overcome some of the hurdles that they found themselves in over and over again in those closed door meetings. John, there's a couple things to keep an eye out here. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy did emphasize once again this morning that he thinks that they need to have a deal in principal or a framework for a deal by this weekend. And that is because he believes it's going to take some time to get this through the Senate and to get this through the House of Representatives. We should also note that there's not much time when the Senate and House are scheduled to both be here in Washington. That's not to say that both chambers can't be called back to make sure that this happens. We are expected to get more guidance this week from the Treasury secretary on when that important x date is, that means when the country will reach it's borrowing limit on the debt ceiling.
