It was an empire of making a mess in the world,The Iranian -- the Islamic Republic of Iran is a horrible regime despised by its own people, stoning women, stoning the gays and exporting -- manufacturing and exporting terror like no one else in the world. It sent its arms across the world, across the Middle East, the seven different arms of terror. The only way to turn off this whole huge terror machine is to topple this terrible regime. Any regime will be better than this one. I think that since the Iranian people are a great people, they seek freedom. It's a very advanced culture. I am convinced that the regime that would come after would be much better than this exporter of terror.",

Ferguson police say that Officer Brown suffered a severe brain injury, that he remains in critical condition. And all of this happened, as you mentioned, last Friday night, as part of a 10-year commemoration marking the death of Michael Brown. That was a resident there in Ferguson who was shot and killed by a Ferguson police officer. That shooting kind of galvanize the Black Lives Matter and police protests -- protests against police all across the country and led to very violent protests. But officers there in Ferguson say all of this really started after what were peaceful demonstrations, led to a group of demonstrators pushing and trying to take apart a metal fence that led to a parking garage -- a parking lot of the Ferguson Police Department. Last night, there was a vigil outside the police department honoring Officers Travis Brown. And the police chief says that he is frustrated and doesn't understand why the current police force is suffering because of what happened 10 years ago. The chief points out that most of the officers who now work in this force were not there in Ferguson 10 years ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
