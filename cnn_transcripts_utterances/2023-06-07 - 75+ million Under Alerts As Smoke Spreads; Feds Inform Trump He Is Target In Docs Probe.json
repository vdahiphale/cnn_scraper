The choking haze isn't going anywhere anytime soon.Plus, all eyes on Florida where a grand jury of the Trump classified documents case heard for another witness just today. \"The Washington Post\" reporting that if Trump is indicted, a majority of the charges will be brought in Florida. So, what does that mean? And Ukraine gaining back ground around Bakhmut as the chief of Russia's private army admits there will be major Russian losses in Ukraine and inside Russia itself. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the hazardous air now choking more than 75 million Americans. It's an unbelievable situation. These are live pictures I put up on the screen of New York. Thick smoke from wildfires burning hundreds and hundreds of miles away is now smothering the city, that more than eight million affected just there. And it's way bigger than New York. Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Syracuse -- all of them the images that you see there as I said, 75 million Americans are suffering from the hazardous haze. It is so bad particularly in New York City that the air quality index there which basically is a measurement of pollution, that they get from a range of zero to 500. Zero to 500, was a 352 this afternoon. Okay, that sounds bad. It is bad. It's not only the worst since the EPA began recording air quality measurements, but it is the absolute worst on the entire planet today. I mean, it is amazing. And I want to show just how quickly the situation deteriorated in New York. Those of us who were here sort of saw it. I mean, it was like at the sending doom. This was the scene at 11:00 a.m., within three hours. The skyline goes from being covered in haze too bright orange. It felt like being on Mars, and it smelled like being in a sauna. New York's governor telling people, quote, don't go out if you don't have to. Officials recommending avoiding outdoor physical activities of any sort. Schools canceled recess, the New York Yankees postponed tonight's game, and the three major airports and they are continue to post delays. And right now, there is no immediate end in sight. The forecast has the smoke expected Tuesday for the next several days. We have Athena Jones and Bill Weir standing by. I want to start with Athena OUTFRONT in New York. And, Athena, you have been outside obviously double mask, N95, otherwise probably would be impossible to even swallow at this point reporting on these conditions all day. What are you seeing now?",
