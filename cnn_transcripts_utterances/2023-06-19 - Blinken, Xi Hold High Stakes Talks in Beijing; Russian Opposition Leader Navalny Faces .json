Plus, a submersible that takes tourists to see the wreck of the Titanic is missing off the coast of Canada. What we know about the search operation, coming up. All right, U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken says progress has been made following two days of high stakes meetings with top officials in Beijing, including President Xi Jinping. The two global powers have agreed to the need to stabilize U.S.-China relations, which plummeted to a new low earlier this year after an alleged Chinese spy balloon was detected floating across the U.S. and hovering over sensitive military sites. Key issues remain unresolved, but Blinken says he now expects better engagement going forward. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Alexei Navalny; the prominent anti-corruption campaigner here first poisoned and nearly killed, then arrested and sentenced to nine years in jail, is now facing new extremist charges that could see his prison term extended by up to 30 years, sparking new outrage amongst his supporters. Well, the hearing was at a remote Penal Colony where Navalny is being held. And neither journalist nor his parents were allowed inside the courtroom.
