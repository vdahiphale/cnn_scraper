There is one culpable for this. There is one group of people with blood on their hands, and that is Hamas. And whether you are pro- Palestinian or whether you are pro-Israeli or, whether you are pro- both, you have to be against Hamas. And that is where our focus, as Americans and certainly the members of our government, and those who have platforms and our leaders should be directing their fire and directing their works. And the contrast again could not be starker. At a time when you see billboards thanking America and thanking Joe Biden, at a time when you see Israelis gathering around our secretary of state, hugging him, and they are hugging him as an extension of America.
