      "sentences": "Hi, Jim. Well, as you mentioned, the Ohio Valley has been struck by two damaging storms back-to-back starting Tuesday morning and continuing into the night. I want you to look at some of the wind damage we have seen in spots across the county.This is a historic bridge, the Kirker Bridge, it dates to the 19th century. And until this storm last night, this bridge had a roof. But as you can see, a lot of that roof has fallen down, blown around. It's going to take a lot of work to get this bridge looking like it once did. And you can see part of the roof here, blown into the creek. And over here on the other side, we see some of the broken tree branches and tree limbs, the kinds of things that are leading to so many power outages in the region. We know 18,000, 19,000 customers are without power in Kentucky and in Ohio. More than 100,000 people remain without power in West Virginia. We've seen this, the high-water levels begin to go down, but flooding was also an issue. Now, there were reports of tornadoes, overnight, touching down here in Adams County where we are right now. We don't have confirmation of that yet. National Weather Service teams are going to be out today assessing the damage. And so, we'll have to wait for -- to hear from them for confirmation of whether tornadoes did touch down. As of right now, one good thing is that while some injuries have been reported from incidents across the region, no deaths have been reported so far. But still a very strong system that has led to damages -- damage in various places across the state of Ohio here in Adams County. The schools are going to be closed because of the extensive damage. And again, many businesses remain without power. So, folks beginning to get a sense of the damage this morning and thankful that at least, so far, no deaths reported. Jim.",

They say, they have been working on it since 2022. Now, what does it do? As you said, from only 15 seconds of a source audio, it can build a voice synthesis, an A.I. model of someone's voice. They can say anything in any language that you type into it.Now, this is something that other companies have out there. There's ElevenLabs, Google, pretty much anyone working in the A.I. space has some kind of model on it. What's different here is that 15-second input or really small amount of input you need to build a powerful Voice Engine. Now, obviously, there are concerns that come along with this. And these aren't some, kind of, theoretical concerns about how it can be misused in the future. We're already seeing how voice, deep fakes can be misused right now. You've got with Joe Biden, the Robo call in New Hampshire that happened that wasn't his voice. Scammers are using this technology. OpenAI says, they're aware of those. They're not releasing this to the public yet, but they say there's good this technology can do as well. One thing they say is, as you mentioned, reading to children, a reading assistance tool. Another way, building someone's voice who lost their voice due to an accident, they posted a clip of a girl who lost her voice due to a tumor, rebuilt her voice using her previous voice using this technology.

They say they're cautioning people about where this technology is heading, making specific recommendations like banks should move away from voice, you know, voice authentication in their systems. In a statement, they say they're taking a cautious and informed approach to a broader release due to the potential for synthetic voice misuse. We hope to start a dialogue on the responsible deployment of synthetic voices and how society can adapt to these new capabilities. We recognize that generating speech that resembles people's voices has serious risks, which are especially top of mind in an election year. We are engaging with U.S. and international partners from across government, media, entertainment, education, civil society and beyond to ensure we are incorporating their feedback as we build.",

Love the Fernbank Center. Mark, thank you so much for being with us. Really appreciate it. So, tell us what are we going to see on Monday?
