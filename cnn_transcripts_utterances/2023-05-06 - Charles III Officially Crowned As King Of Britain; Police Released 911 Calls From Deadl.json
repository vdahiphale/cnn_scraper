One of them was that the king actually arrived at Westminster Abbey in his carriage just slightly ahead of time and Prince William and his family arrived a little bit late, it seemed.And so, he sort of sat in the carriage for a few moments before deciding ultimately to go inside of the abbey ahead of his son. Also, there was the balcony moment -- the balcony is just right over here. This area was filled with people as the royal family came out to wave. The King and Queen came out and did a curtain call afterwards. But in the initial photo missing there was Prince Harry and people have all kinds of mixed feelings about you know, his absence from the scene. A lot of people thought it was the right thing to do. But everyone seems to agree of just how difficult a decision it was for the King to actually make that decision. seemed like there was really no good answer as to how to treat that.",

And what are they doing now? Well, they had a reception last night. They've had quite a busy day. They've been out meeting the crowds.

I mean, this idea of crowning your queen goes right back to William the Conqueror, the first coronation in 1066 that we know happened in Westminster Abbey. So, it is a custom, but we're not used to it because there's no role for the husband of a female monarch in the British monarchy. It's one of the anomalies.And Camilla very much was Queen Consort. She was wearing the Queen consort's crown, but also she was wearing Queen Elizabeth's actual coronation robes. So, she was wearing the robes of a Queen, in fact she was wearing the necklace of Queen Elizabeth and these are all Charles's possessions now. And I think it was very much both a representation of the relationship between them, but also very much Charles was saying, you know, for a long time we had thought Prince -- that Camilla was going to be Princess Consort. Up until even as late as 2020, the palace was saying she won't be Princess Consort, not Queen, i.e., not crowned. I think Charles has always intended that and this was today when he said this is Camilla, she is my queen and she is wearing the robes of one of the greatest queens in history Elizabeth II.",

But it was this gorgeous, stunning piece. And I know we keep saying it was King Charles's day, and certainly that's true. But yes, both Kate and Princess Charlotte certainly did you know have all eyes on them. And I think just as we haven't had Queen Consort in a very long time. We haven't had a little princess in a very long time.

It means that they're charging someone. We don't know who and we don't know, for sure, with what, but I think there will, for sure, be charges coming.

What's interesting in this case, though, it is that the community was the one that led police to Dominguez. We know that on Wednesday, about 15 different people called police saying, look, we see someone who looks or may be the suspect in this case. One of those callers even followed him to the exact spot where police were able to arrest him. Initially, they went through his backpack and they found a large knife. So, that's what he was arrested for, and police took him in for questioning. They say they spent hours trying to interview him, trying to figure out exactly what happened here. Unfortunately, police saying that they do not have a motive at the moment.But, they do believe that all of these stabbings were connected. They believe that Dominguez is the person responsible for them. And while they don't have a motive, they do say they have evidence of that links Dominguez to the crimes, and evidence that shows that a lot of these victims actually fought back. This has been very difficult for the community, but they're rallying around that one survivor, a woman who was able to essentially survive and be taken to the hospital.

PETA, that's People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, putting out a tweet about Chloe's Dream's death saying. \"We urge the track to shut down so stronger safety protocols could be put in place. They should have listened.\" Two of the horses that died earlier in the week were trained by Saffie Joseph Jr. He was suspended, and the horse he was training for the Derby, Lord Miles, being pulled from the race, Saffie saying he has been made out to be a scapegoat and did nothing at all wrong. Now, five horses have also had to drop out of the derby, the first time we've seen that many pull out since, well, you have to get back to 1936, the latest one being Forte, who was riding high on a five race winning streak and was a three to one favorite as well in the race. But, during training on Thursday, he injured his right front foot. He went out to try and work it out again this morning. But, well, after that, the horse's trainer, one of the co-owners, in fact, meeting with the state's head veterinarian, and they decided he wasn't fit enough to run. The field will be cut to just 80 for this evening's race. Angel of Empire and Tapit Trice are now considered the betting favorites. But, despite all of this happened, Fred, tens of thousands of fans are getting ready for the horse racing's biggest race, the Kentucky Derby. Post time is set for 6:57 p.m. Eastern. Don't be late.
