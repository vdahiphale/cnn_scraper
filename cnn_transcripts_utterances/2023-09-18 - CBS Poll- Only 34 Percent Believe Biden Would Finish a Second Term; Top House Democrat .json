Six Iranian banks have opened bank accounts at these two Doha banks. And we have heard both from the source both here on the ground and from the Iranian side that that money has now arrived in that -- in those two Doha bank accounts. So the Iranians, this is Iranian money that was frozen in accounts in South Korea, does now, it seems, confirmed to have arrived in these Doha accounts. Which is all important, because as I say, this was a complicated and complex deal. Perhaps nobody really expected it to go completely to plan. But as things stand at present, certainly, it does appear that those U.S. detainees are on their way to the flight.

That is the good news that unlike the Danelo Cavalcante case, which lasted for about 14 days, this one lasted less than 12 hours.But let me tell you a little bit about what we know and how they got to this point of capturing all nine of those escaped inmates. It all started around 8:00 p.m. last night at the Abraxas Academy. It's about 50 miles west of where we are here in Philadelphia. It's a juvenile detention center, but Phil, importantly, it's only 15 miles west of where Cavalcante was captured late last week. So a similar area, similarly on edge after learning last night that nine teens basically in this facility had escaped. They're all between the ages of 15 and 17. And as you said, we learned this morning, they overpowered two female security guards, they stole their keys, were able to get out of the facility that way, and then crawled under exterior fences, ultimately escaped. The escape was much shorter than afterwards. They were spotted between midnight and 1:00, trying to steal a car. Homeowners turned on the light, they got scared off. And at 5:47 a.m., they were able to catch four of the inmates, and then less than hour later, after successfully stealing a pickup truck and trailer, police were able to capture the remaining five. Of course, as we started, the comparisons to Cavalcante were brought up in a press conference with Pennsylvania state police just recently. Take a listen to what they said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Hunter Biden is going in court with this new lawsuit this morning against the IRS, specifically because there were two special agents within the IRS who became whistleblowers for Congress earlier this year. And he says that those two IRS agents who had been working on his tax investigation over many years, that did ultimately result in him trying to make a guilty plea to a misdemeanor and then that plea deal falling apart, he's saying those two agents essentially went out and did interviews at a point in time when they shouldn't have been talking about his tax returns.And his lawyers, Hunter Biden's lawyers are alleging that they disclosed quite a lot about Hunter Biden's tax returns, what he had not been paying, the tax years that were under investigation, also liability he had, some deductions he may have needed to pay. There's a lot in here based on what those two whistleblowers were doing publicly around the time that they became whistleblowers, while also working for the IRS, complaining about the handling of that investigation. And so now this is in the court system with judges going to look at it. Hunter Biden wants about $1,000 in damages for every time something about his tax returns was disclosed, when he says that it was unlawfully disclosed and that his records weren't appropriately protected by the IRS because tax returns are confidential by law. We haven't gotten a statement from the attorneys for these whistleblowers yet, these two special agents with the IRS, but there are some questions about what exactly they did disclose, because at the time they weren't using his name, but it was very clear to everyone when they became whistleblowers about this investigation that it was, indeed about Hunter Biden.",

HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY):   What they are fighting for fundamentally is the American Dream, and so we stand with the UAW as they fight for a fair contract, as they fight to benefit from the fruits of their labor.

So Congressman, thanks for being with us this morning. I'm so fascinated by Democrats and Republicans, many of them on the same page when it comes to supporting the UAW, but for very different reasons. Do you agree with Republicans who think that this is an opening for the party in Michigan, maybe take that open Senate seat, which hasn't happened from Republicans since '94?",
