But there is a question about when they are going to pass that.Remember, in the Senate, it requires cooperation from every single Senator in order to move quickly. And right now, there is a holdup over amendments for some Republicans seeking some votes on issues like the border and immigration and many other topics. So they are in the process of trying to work out an agreement on potential amendment votes and how to move forward. And it could potentially drag late into the night or early morning. But I would say the bigger hurdle is two weeks from now, because that is when the rest of the government is going to run out of money. And those are some of the most complicated and tricky and hot-button bills in the federal government. Including the Department of Homeland Security. And of course, Republicans are really trying to make the border a chief campaign issue in November. Now, I will say that Speaker Mike Johnson has so in a willingness to defy the demands of his right flank on this spending package. But he is going to have to do it again if he wants to avoid a government shutdown in just two weeks from now. So it really good shape up to be a battle over the border -- Boris?",

A huge tire landed in a nearby parking lot. It crushed multiple cars. Fortunately, no one was injured in this terrifying incident.

Exactly what happened at 11:35 a.m. Pacific Time there in SFO yesterday. You can see the United 777 climbing out here of runway 28, right? There goes the tire from the left assembly of the main landing gear there. These tires way about 265 pounds in total. That is not accounting for the wheel hub. So naturally, there was a lot of damage when this tire went bouncing across the ramp, into the fence there, and then into some cars. There's a crushed Toyota Corolla there. There was also a crushed Tesla. How San Francisco, of the twist of the story. The good news here is that this didn't hurt anybody on the ground, although it's so easily could have. What was really interesting is that this was captured on camera by plane spotters doing a live stream on YouTube. Typical that the crew does not feel this come off the airplane. So it's really on air traffic control to alert the pilots and, of course, the other airplanes that they had to abort their landings as they're coming into land there at San Francisco International Airport. Here's what they said over the radio. (BEGIN AUDIO FEED)",

The question now is, was this a maintenance issue? This plane flew in about 24 hours prior from Paris. There is a maintenance base there at San Francisco International Airport for United Airlines. Or was this something simply that broke? These wheels take a ton of punishment as they come in for takeoffs and landings, supporting a 300-ton airliner. It is not an easy job, especially when you consider the fact that these airplanes take off and land multiple times a day. Unlikely that this is a Boeing-specific issue, the question that everybody has, because this was not a 737 Max-9 like we saw on the door-plug incident back on January 5th. This was a triple and it wasn't really even all that new. It was about 22 years old. So of course, they will be digging into this at United Airlines and at the FAA. United does say it's going to help the customers that were initially displaced by this incident. They were going to Osaka, Japan. Also helping out the customers who had their cars obliterated by this. Can you imagine getting a phone call -- (CROSSTALK)",
