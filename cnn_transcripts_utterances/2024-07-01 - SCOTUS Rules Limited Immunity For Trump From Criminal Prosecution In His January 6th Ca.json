He's been given a big legal win by the U.S. Supreme Court but it is also one that affects presidents going forward in this country, writing a rule for the ages as Justice Gorsuch said in advance of this decision. The court has, Zain, as you said found Trump and other presidents have some immunity from prosecution for official acts while president. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority, \"The first step is to distinguish a president's official from unofficial actions. In this case however, no court has, thus far, considered how to draw that distinction in general or with respect to the conduct alleged in particular.\" The court has now sent Trump's case back down to a lower court to determine which acts are official, which were unofficial as relates to attempts to overturn the election. But it did provide some guidance saying that, for example, any conversations that Trump had with his vice president, Vice President Pence, must be considered official acts so they could not be part of the evidence in such a case. The court's three liberal justices, they disagreed strongly with the conservatives. Justice Sonia Sotomayor penned just a blistering dissent saying, quote, \"The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country and possibly the world. When he uses his official powers in any way under the majority's reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. \"Orders the Navy SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold on to power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune, immune, immune, immune.\" Those are the words from Justice Sotomayor dissenting in this case. We're going to be covering this important story from many angles. Let's begin with CNN senior crime and justice correspondent Katelyn Polantz. You could sense the sharpness of the disagreement on this decision between the court's conservative and liberal wing, but also there are different reads of the consequences of this decision. Because Roberts seemed to be writing in some degree -- to some degree to say, oh, the liberals, they're overreacting here, whereas the liberal justices writing in their dissents that this is democracy at stake, in effect, and that in effect democracy has been undermined.",

      "sentences": "No, you're exactly right. They are very happy with this decision, Jim. And I'll tell you, I mean, first of all, when theyhad brought up this case initially and it was going to the Supreme Court, from my conversations with Donald Trump's political team, but also his legal advisors, they had initially thought this was some sort of Hail Mary pass. They were not sure how this would land in the courts. That had changed after they had heard oral arguments in this case, particularly the line of questioning from Justice Kavanaugh. And then going into today, they were very optimistic, I'd say cautiously optimistic, that they would receive some sort of ruling that did lay out some sort of limited immunity. And of course, that is exactly the decision that we saw today. Now, I think a big question, and they tell me they're still going through this decision and reading through it carefully with a fine-tuned comb. But what they need to decide is, okay, what will count as official acts and unofficial acts? And that's, of course, been kicked down to the district court, lower than the Supreme Court. And so, they're waiting to see what happens there. But I think the big picture here is two things. One, they are hoping that this argument can not only be applied to this case and see how it could impact the special counsel Jack Smith's indictment against him in the January 6th case, but also how could this potentially even be used to help him in his other cases, potentially the classified documents case in Florida. And then, of course, the second part of this is this will likely delay a potential trial until after the election. And I hear many people ask me often, do you think that if Donald Trump were to win the White House and win a second term, that he would just dismiss this case outright? And I tell them, it's not a certainty. It's not a question. It's a certainty. Donald Trump's team has been very explicit that if he were to win, this case would go away. And so, of course, a huge goal of theirs in all of his cases has been to delay this as much as possible. And so we're really seeing them celebrate that decision, even fundraising off it shortly after this came down. Jim?",

And yet here it is, I think you could say with confidence, a partial victory for the Trump team, perhaps a big one.

So, they may decide to go back to the grand jury, get a superseding indictment, knowing that this case is going to go back up on appeal anyways and clean things up.

And saying, for example, that this has handed Trump the keys to a dictatorship, saying, too, that it would potentially allow the former president to go after his political opponents if he were to be elected in November. So, all of that really echoing what we heard from the senior adviser to the campaign earlier this morning, again, sort of noting that he, being former President Donald Trump, thinks he's above the law. Now, the White House has not yet issued a statement on this. We have asked them for comment. But there's certainly implications for the office of the presidency. Of course, historians have said that over the last several years, there has been more power given to the president. And this type of ruling is one that would enhance that power for whoever is sitting in the Oval Office. Now, the White House and President Biden have not weighed in as much or at all on Donald Trump's legal troubles over the last several months. But the president was asked about this last December by reporters who asked if he believed the president is immune from criminal prosecution. The president responding at the time, quote, \"I can't think of one.\" Now, President Biden is at Camp David -- Camp David. He'll be returning to the White House later this evening. So, we await the response from the White House and the president.

How they parried that, they sent out some Democratic grandees, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for example, allies of the president on television to say, look, we need to stay the course. Trump -- Biden will be the nominee. The real danger is Trump. Now, there are behind the scenes, a lot of questions being asked by Democrats, not just whether the president should step down or what would happen if he did and all the complications that would bring to bear. So, I think the question now is to try to keep the dam from holding. I think one important data point here will be if we get some polls coming out in the next few days that show that the bottom has fallen out of the president's already very questionable support in this election, he's got big problems with the Democratic coalition that could start a movement in the House of Representatives in particular from lawmakers who are worried about their seats.

So, there's a good chance they would lose this where all of this comes together. The debate, today's Supreme Court decision, is that it is now pretty clear to envisage a period of complete conservative control of government. An aggressive Supreme Court, President Trump in a second term who would see almost no limits on his power. The House would be the only check on that and if Democrats lose that, as well, it will be quite an interesting era of conservative governments. There will be no checks on Trump. So that I think argument is going to get a lot stronger in the days ahead. And, you know, Democrats hope that the courts would deal with Trump, that he'd lose the Republican primary.

He failed that test. Now, there's a big debate over whether he's fit for the presidency now. The presidency has a number of different functions.

There is no case, no justice, even Justice Alito would not agree that you can enter a conspiracy to submit false electoral college delegates for January 6th certification. Under no circumstances would that be considered a core function or even a presumptive function, it's purely one motive and that is to preserve his ability to maintain his office. That is easy. The other one is, others are hard. When he was telling Department of Justice officials to investigate something, to issue a statement, that gets very tricky and that may survive the presumption of official acts. So, there's a lot to work with.

Just look at what Donald Trump hassaid and done, even yesterday, implying through one of his posts on a social media outlet that he wants a televised military tribunal for Liz Cheney and probably others on the January 6th Committee. Just unbelievable stuff that never would have come from a prior president, but which frequently comes from Donald Trump. I think most people say correctly, he has proven in the past that you need to listen to what he says because he tries to do it or he actually gets it done. This is very important to him -- retribution and revenge. He talks about it a great deal. So, the fear, Zain, is intense and it is justified.",

We've talked a lot over the past couple ofhours about the ideological divide, the fact that this was a split 6-3 decision right down ideological lines, and also the fact that this decision was so delayed. I mean, they ruled on it on the very last possible day. Some, not all, but some people believe that that in and itself has, of course, political implications because the chances of there being a trial before November is minuscule and it only serves to benefit Donald Trump. Take us through just the amount of faith or lack thereof the American people have in the U.S. Supreme Court at this point in time.",

The systemwill, through his eyes or his purposes, saying that's the way he governed the first term, but he is likely to be much worse in the second term. And the people he's bringing in, frankly, some of them are kooky. And they do not believe in the system of democracy we've had or a democratic republic. They talk about, openly, about a post-constitutional presidency. Well, we all know what that means. So, people have to be clear-eyed about this.

That's usually the time of year when you see these stronger hurricanes develop, as Beryl has, you know, it really is terrifying. On Saturday, Beryl was just a tropical storm, something that is something of a common occurrence here in the Caribbean and have it blow up and intensify so rapidly. That just means that people have less time to prepare, less time to ready their homes, to find shelters, to get gas, to load up on food, all the things you need to do before facing a storm like this. And of course, in the Wynwood Islands, where Beryl is currently rampaging right now, of course, more people don't have the opportunity, the ability to get out of the way of the storm. And the only real option is to hunker down and ride it out. And of course, time makes all the difference when it comes to preparing. So, this storm is expected to continue through the Caribbean, stay south of Cuba, where I am right now, but certainly have an impact on Haiti and Jamaica, as it's expected, and then head in towards the Yucatan Peninsula and Mexico. Of course, you know, it's July 1st, so still very, very early in the season, a season that forecasters are saying might be the busiest on record. So, it's certainly starting off with a bang, and it will be hours before we get any clear picture, most likely, of the damage that it's already caused.",

Boeing has until the end of the week to decide whether to accept the agreement or go to trial. France's far-right party is celebrating a surge of support in the first round of the country's parliamentary elections. The party of Marine Le Pen is leading, getting more than 33 percent of the vote. The left-wing coalition known as the Popular Front came second. President Macron's centrist alliance slumped to a dismal third in the polls with just over 20 percent of the vote. The second round of voting takes place this Sunday. And at just 28 years old, national rally leader Jordan Bardella could be the next French prime minister. CNN producer Saskia Van Dorn has more on who he is and what exactly he wants for France. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SASKIA VAN DORN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He's been called the TikTok king and young people love him. But who's the slick 28-year-old French far-right leader on the brink of power? Jordan Bardella has transformed the national rally, taking it from the fringes into the mainstream, solidifying its rural base. JORDAN BARDELLA, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL RALLY PARTY (through translator): What we want is to take agriculture completely out of the free trade agreements so that we can protect our domestic markets. VAN DORN (voice-over): And using social media to reach a new generation of voters. BARDELLA (through translator): Go out and vote to stop the migration surge that threatens our security, identity and values.
