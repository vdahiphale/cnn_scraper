With just 25 to go -- days to go until Election Day the must-win state of Pennsylvania is still as close as ever. A new Quinnipiac poll released earlier this week shows Kamala Harris with a slight edge over Donald Trump in the Keystone State among likely voters there. Harris is at 49 percent while Trump is at 46 percent, and that is just barely outside the margin of error. Now, CNN reporting, \"...the commonwealth is being flooded with advertising money -- more than $250 million just between July 22 and September 30. Now, Democrats have outspent Republicans in the Keystone State by about $144 million to $105 million over that stretch, and both sides have spent more there than any other battleground state.\" Now, it's also been the backdrop of some notable campaign moments. Of course, the first Trump assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania where Trump returned just last week alongside Elon Musk. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "All right. Joining me now, capitol reporter for Spotlight PA, Stephen Caruso. Stephen, thank you so much for joining me this morning and sharing your expertise.Let's talk a little bit about what's happening on the ground. Just to remind viewers about just how close this race was in 2020 between Biden and Trump, Biden barely winning the state there. He got 50 percent to Trump's nearly 49 percent. That's about 81,000 votes he won the state by. If you're Kamala Harris, do you -- is -- you know, how do you see her biggest challenges right now to essentially surpass or meet what Joe Biden did in 2020? STEPHEN CARUSO, CAPITOL REPORTER, SPOTLIGHT PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, I think her biggest challenge is just like she kind of does have a different coalition than Joe Biden. Joe Biden was Scranton, Joe. He spent his time in Delaware, but he was famously born in Scranton, Pennsylvania. This is a part of the state that's ancestrally Democratic, I think is how folks like to put it. A place that backed Democrats since FDR, but it's gone a little more Republican in recent years under Donald Trump. So I think that her goal is what does her coalition look like. She's spent a lot of time, and her surrogates, in western Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh -- Allegheny County. She's also put a lot of resources into south central Pennsylvania. This is the area around the state capital -- Harrisburg, Lancaster, Carlisle, York. This is an area that Democrats are increasingly competing in. It's a lot of suburbs. It's small cities. It's growing increasingly diverse. This is a (INAUDIBLE) area. And, of course, also you've got to drive a turnout in Philadelphia and its suburbs. This has been Democrats' bedrock of winning statewide elections, and they've won a lot of statewide elections basically since Trump won in 2016. So I think if you're Harris, you're thinking what does my coalition look like and how might it differ from Biden a little bit.",

Do you see that essentially whatever happens -- whoever wins the -- Pennsylvania, whether it's Harris or Trump, the winner will be the same party? It will be Casey if Harris wins and McCormick if Trump wins, or is there a possibility of split-ticket voting in your state? CARUSO:  I absolutely think there's a possibility of split-ticket voting. Pennsylvania loves splitting their ticket. I really can't emphasize that enough. Like, down from statehouse to our row offices, up to presidency and the U.S. Senate and Congress. Like, I think I've encountered more people who proudly state I've never voted for all the candidates of one party in my life than when I go out knocking doors with candidates in Pennsylvania. So I think that Casey also has a brand that's been established. He has a famous last name. His dad was a very popular governor of this state -- one of the last real rural Democrats -- and that gives him an edge potentially with some Trump voters. And that's something that I think Spotlight PA is trying to explore in the next couple of weeks as well.",

So you've got FEMA on the ground, you've got what appears to be a pretty well-coordinated response by the federal government, and you've got the former president politicizing this.
