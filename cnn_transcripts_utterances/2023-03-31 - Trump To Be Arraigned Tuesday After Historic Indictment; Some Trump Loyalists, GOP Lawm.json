I'm going to be looking for a couple of things.First of all, there're two kinds of indictments in the world. There's the bare bones indictment, which just says the language of the statute. The defendant honor about such and such a date hereby did conspire combined confederate, blah, blah, blah, a bunch of legalese. You don't get that much out of that. Then there's what they call a speaking indictment, which is narrative, which has details. So, we don't know which one it's going to be.

There is plenty of evidence that the person who put together the structure of this deal is Michael Cohen, starting with the tape Michael Cohen made of his own client. By the way, kids, do not tape your own client. That is bizarre behavior. But in that tape, Donald Trump is just saying to Michael Cohen, how are we going to do this? And Michael Cohen says, me and Allen Weisselberg, we will handle it. So, that's going to be a problem.The second part of this, and this is the legal problem, this will be the lead motion that we will see, and we heard Trump's attorneys today talking about motions, they're going to argue that New York State law cannot incorporate a federal election violation race for president.

I would much rather the Fulton County D.A. or Merrick Garland sometime ago have brought cases for significantly more serious crimes, but as someone who has had to comply with campaign finance law and is really proud of that compliance, I think we should take this very seriously.

That's not our fault, and it's certainly not the fault of the, you know, New York D.A. who is responding to alleged crimes.

Still in this red zone, tornado watch boxes in effect. And you're thinking, come on, this has to be over. It's dark. it's getting cooler. No, because not much of the atmosphere was used up yet. Used up meaning, yeah, it's rained a lot appeared. This is done. This will rain for much of the night, but the chance of severe weather is over, really. But in this zone through here in Illinois, Indiana, the zone here is not used up. That moisture, that humidity, that heat of the day is still there. And so, these storms will rotate for much of the night. A tornado emergency on the storm right here, which means we know a tornado is on the ground. We can tell by the radar. We can look at the debris, the leaves and the sticks and the insulation that might be in the air. We can tell that that storm right now is still on the ground. And then south of Memphis, one storm cell moved here from about Tunica just to the south of Memphis and now another one has built up almost in its same path. So, this is the event for tonight. You need to have some way of getting warnings if you're in that zone because this will continue through the evening overnight hours and you need to have something that we can wake you up. Tornado sirens are not made to wake you up. They're made to tell you, if you're outside, to go inside. They're not made to go through the walls in your windows and wake you up while you're sleeping in your bed. So, you need to have something. The (inaudible) weather radio always worked and our phones work just as well. There is what it will look like later on tonight hour by hour as we move you through Columbus into Pittsburgh, and yes, even into the northeast by morning. So, there will be severe weather. There will be warnings going off. There will be tornadoes on the ground for much of the night. Alisyn?",
