I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where the state of our union is thankful, thankful that an American detained in a Russian penal colony is finally home.You're looking at new pictures of Brittney Griner, the WNBA superstar, who touched down on American soil early Friday morning. She reunited with her wife, Cherelle, and was taken immediately for a medical evaluation. President Biden celebrated her return and now faces questions about his decision to trade convicted -- convicted Russian arms dealer Victor Bout in exchange for the WNBA star and the American left behind in Russia, Paul Whelan, who has been held prisoner there for nearly four years. My guest now is working to free Whelan and dozens of Americans held hostage in other foreign nations, and he has a pretty good track record. Special Envoy -- Special Presidential Envoy, I should say, for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens helped secure Griner's release and was there to greet her and bring her home. Thank you so much for joining me this morning. What an ordeal and what a saga. Let's start with the sort of the personal. You flew to UAE. You welcomed her on the tarmac. What was the moment like for both of you? And what was it like for her specifically? ROGER CARSTENS, U.S. SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR HOSTAGE AFFAIRS: It's always kind of an exciting moment when you jump on the other country's plane and walk up to a person, in this case, Brittney. And I will tell you what I told her. I said: \"Brittney, my name is Ambassador Roger Carstens. I'm with the U.S. Department of State. And on behalf of the president of the United States, Joe Biden, and Secretary of State Tony Blinken,I'm here to take you home.\" And, at that moment, I think every person finally starts to realize that it's going to happen, it's setting in. Certainly, Brittney felt that way. And, at that point, we have to go through a little more of the choreography to get her on the plane. Usually takes about three minutes. But here's what I wouldn't mind telling you. When she finally got onto the U.S. plane, I said: \"Brittney, you must have been through a lot over the last 10 months. Here's your seat. Please feel free to decompress. We will give you your space.\" And she said: \"Oh, no, I have been in prison for 10 months now listening to Russian. I want to talk. But, first of all, who are these guys?\" And she moved right past me and went to every member on that crew, looked them in the eyes, shook their hands and asked about them, got their names, making a personal connection with them. It was really amazing. And then, later on, on an 18-hour flight, she probably spent 12 hours just -- just talking. We talked about everything under the sun. And I was left with the impression that this is an intelligent, passionate, compassionate, humble, interesting person, a patriotic person, but, above all, authentic. I hate the fact that I had to meet her in this manner, but I actually felt blessed having had a chance to get to know her.",

BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT):  I don't want to spend a whole lot of time on Senator Sinema. She has her reasons. Dana, I happen to suspect that it's probably a lot to do with politics back in Arizona. I think the Democrats there are not all that enthusiastic about somebody who helped sabotage some of the most important legislation that protects the interests of working families and voting rights and so forth. So, I think it really has to do with her political aspirations for the future in Arizona. But, for us, I think nothing much has changed in terms of the functioning of the U.S. Senate. The good news is that we now have 51 votes. We will have the majority on committees. It means that we can go forward and start protecting the interests of the working families and deal with the reality that we are increasingly living in an oligarchy, where the billionaire class and large corporations control almost every aspect of our country.

One of your colleagues, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, tweeted the following, \"Bye, Felicia,\" after news broke about Sinema. He's obviously -- he's a progressive. He's not upset to see her leave. Should Democrats get behind an alternative that's officially on the D column, like your colleague Ruben Gallego? REP. COLIN ALLRED (D-TX):  We will have a Democrat running. I think what a lot of us who represent districts who got elected by Republicans and independents, and proudly did so as Democrats, take issue with is the idea that this is about principles, when it's really about politics. She was likely going to lose her next primary. And that's why she's doing this. It's not a principled change. She's voted with us, I think, 96 percent of the time. So it's not about that.

This is the state that gave us folks like John McCain, Jeff Flake, this mavericky streak. The challenge she's going to face is, when she says there are a lot of Americans who don't identify with either party, they pick some from column A, some from column B, she's right, but many of those Americans don't necessarily, say, want to see policies that support the rich and powerful, et cetera. And that's what the allegations from her Democratic opponents have often been. So there are lots of different ways you can be an independent.
