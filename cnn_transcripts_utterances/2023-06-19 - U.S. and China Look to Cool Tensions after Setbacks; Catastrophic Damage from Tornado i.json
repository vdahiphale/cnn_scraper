This visit seems to have cleared a very low bar, achieving what both sides have set out to do, which of course, was to resume this kind of senior-level dialogue. But the underlying challenge facing this relationship, as Kylie was pointing out, very much remains the same. Xi Jinping not only said that the U.S. is out to get China, to contain, to suppress China, but more recently, he's been using language like this -- China is facing this external threat environment with dangerous storms ahead, with -- warning officials here to really prepare for extreme scenarios, which has been interpreted by many as hinting on an eventual and a potential conflict with the U.S. But of course, Xi Jinping can play the long game, because he doesn't face elections and such. So he can still right now publicly saying he's willing to work with the U.S. to stabilize and -- and improve this relationship, which of course, is now the next step for the officials here to really climb down -- back off that anti-U.S. rhetoric and to really prepare the nation to -- to prepare for what their leader has told them to do. And that reason, of course, as you heard Kylie saying, one of which being the economy. The other, of course, is they very much want to have their leader go to San Francisco in November to have that state visit -- Victor.",

And will you see it today? JOSH ROGIN, COLUMNIST, \"WASHINGTON POST\"curious to see what specific agreements that Secretary Blinken mentions in his press conference. We can expect them to be on sort of the most low-hanging fruit: countering narcotics, maybe commercial flights, that kind of thing. If gets a couple of Americans home, that would be great, too. So there's no doubt that there's an interest in preventing the relationship from getting worse than it is. But I think the problem really is that still, the United States and China do not agree on why it is, as Ron just said, that relations have gotten so bad in the 20 years since we had a great relationship with China. I think some would say that that's because of some sort of U.S. bipartisan hawkish consensus, but I think it's actually more because China went a different way. Because since Xi Jinping took power in 2013, they decided that engagement wasn't the path that they wanted; and they amped up their economic aggression and military expansion, and started a genocide, and started menacing Taiwan. And I don't think we're going to hear any overlap between Blinken and his Chinese counterparts on any of those issues. And that's why I think we're really -- this is only really a speed bump as the relationship is going to continue to get worse. And not because of Congress's hawkishness, but because the Chinese government is now presenting a new face to the world and to the United States, which is, Don't tell us anything about Taiwan; don't tell us anything about the Uyghurs. If you want to have good relations, then you have to have them on our terms. But I don't -- I think it would be hard for any U.S. president to accept those terms, and that's the fundamental problem that Blinken's trip will fail to solve.",

You know, and the question is whether you can prevent this from becoming, in effect, a new cold war, recognizing the limits of -- of how much we are going to agree with the direction that they're on. And I think that that is where Biden is. I mean, I think there is still a meaningful space between how Biden views this relationship, more of a competition than, say, Trump and some of the other Republicans, who view it more flat-out adversarial. In many ways, it's an echo of the 1950s, when you had Republicans arguing for disengaging from Europe and focusing more on confronting China. I think we are moving back into that.

They're worried about it, because China is a threat to them. And you know, if we always look at it as, Oh, what can Biden and Washington do to improve U.S.-China relations, we're playing into their trap. We're playing into their frame, which is that the U.S. is the problem and not China. But the demand signal is coming from the region. And there are a lot of countries around the world that have the same problem with an aggressive China that's not following the rules of the road, that's using its power in malign ways, and using it to influence, to control other countries' economies. And so I think -- I just think we just need to remember here that it's really not all about us. It's not -- good U.S.-China relations are great, but that's not the goal of U.S.-China policy. The goal of U.S.-China policy is to work with our friends and allies and partners to protect ourselves from the actual threat that China's aggression presents as China rises. And if China wants to play ball on any of that, that would be great, but that's not really just about Tony Blinken. It's about making sure that China understands that it can have a peaceful rise but not on any terms, and not while it continues to be aggressive and genocidal and threatening the region and the world.",
