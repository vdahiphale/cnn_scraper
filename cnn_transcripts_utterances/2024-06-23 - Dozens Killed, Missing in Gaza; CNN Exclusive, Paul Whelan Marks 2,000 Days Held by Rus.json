Israel's military says it's going after Hamas' military infrastructure. CNN speaks exclusively to detained U.S. citizen Paul Whelan as he marks 2,000 days in Russian custody. And getting young minds off constant conflict, how a chess champ in the Democratic Republic of Congo is offering children an escape from war. 52 people were killed or are missing after Israeli strikes near Gaza City on Saturday. Now, those numbers come from the Hamas controlled Gaza government media office. Have a look. This is the aftermath of a strike on a residential block in the Al Shati refugee camp. The Israeli military says its jet struck Hamas military infrastructure in the area. A rescue worker told CNN the airstrike felt like an earthquake. One man whose family members were injured in the strike described what happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, Elliott, let's start with those demonstrations. What more can you tell us? ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST:  Kim, these demonstrations we've been seeing taking place on a weekly basis, sometimes more frequently. The main demand, of course, has always been the same, which is for the Israeli government to do everything humanly possible to get those hostages back home. There are still 116 hostages being held captive in Gaza after being kidnapped during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October the 7th. Around a third of those are believed to be dead. And these protests taking place in Tel Aviv, as you say, and other cities across Israel. But, increasingly, they've also been demanding fresh elections and for the current government to step down. Now, on Saturday night, these protests took on added poignancy, as Saturday was the 20th birthday of Naama Levy. Now, you may recall in one of those many viral videos of the Hamas led attacks of October, Naama was the young woman who was seen being dragged by her hair at gunpoint with sweatpants soaked in blood before being bundled into a jeep and driven off. It was her 20th birthday on Saturday, and in Tel Aviv, her parents addressed the crowd. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Israel's been firing back. They've been daily tit-for-tat firings of drones, of missiles, of tank shells and the like.And as a result, you've got tens of thousands of people of Israelis in the north who are displaced from their homes, tens of thousands of Lebanese in the south of the country there displaced from their homes as well and concerns that this could escalate into all out war. So, that is one of the topics of discussion between Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister and senior U.S. officials. They'll also be discussing trying to unfreeze shipment of weapons that the U.S. paused out of concern for the way they might be used in any operation in Rafah and also, of course, discussing the ceasefire deal that is still on the table.

As the death toll mounts from the scorching heat at this year's Hajj pilgrimage, witnesses are describing what they saw was poor infrastructure and organization at this year's event. They tell CNN there wasn't enough water, shade or medical support to protect them as temperatures climbed past 51 degrees Celsius.CNN's Scott McLean has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  A ritual journey of faith that many Muslims will only make once in a lifetime. But this year under a blazing hot Saudi sun, roughly a thousand people are feared dead during the Hajj pilgrimage. Countries are still trying to account for the dead and why so many people lost their lives. The heat is an indisputable factor. Temperatures reached 51 degrees Celsius on some days, or about 125 degrees Fahrenheit. One pilgrim, Zirrar Ali, who just returned from the hajj, says he saw several people passed out from the heat during the journey.",
