We are just five hours away from the first presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The EU's top court orders apple to pay Ireland more than $14 billion in taxes says, and Australia wants to set a minimum age for using social media. Live from London, it is Tuesday, September 10. I am Isa Soares, and of course, I too mean business. Good evening, everyone. A very warm welcome to the show. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are five hours away from what's for now, their one and only presidential debate. The event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania it reshape a deadlocked race for the White House. For many people, it is their first real look at Harris as a potential president and it comes just eight weeks before election day. That gives her an unusual challenge. She will be introducing herself to some voters while making a closing argument to others. Without another debate on their schedule, the two candidates will be looking tonight to create some memorable moments like these. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That is more than any other presidential candidate in modern American history. Certainly since the televised age of debates for more than a half-century here in America. So there is a lot of debate film for Vice President Harris to watch. I am told she has been studying all of those. She has been having conversations with Hillary Clinton, with Joe Biden and of course, just asking what it is like to be on stage with Donald Trump. She is asking that because she never has been even in the same room at close range with Donald Trump. They've been barring, of course, from long distance, but we certainly know if the outlines of this fight are going to be. She, of course, I am told talking to her advisors is trying to present herself as the candidate of change, someone who would turn the page into a new era. She talks about the way forward. That is her objective. But Donald Trump's objective, his advisers tell me, is to try and just remind Americans that she is part of the Biden-Harris administration. Her name is literally on the record that has been front and center on the economy, on inflation, on immigration. So those two competing moments there -- can she be seen as the candidate of change or is she part of the status quo, that is going to be one of the underlying factors in the entire debate -- Isa.",

What does Kamala Harris need to do tonight to move the needle, you think, Governor? GOV. JAY INSLEE (D-WA): Be yourself, and I am excited about this. I am more excited than the last time the Seattle Seahawks were in the Super Bowl because what she needs is to share her vision and she has such a powerful one to reduce energy costs for middle-class Americans, to create jobs by the hundreds of thousands, to bring more equity, to restore -- and you want to talk about a change, she wants to have change where women actually have reproductive liberty in our country. So she has such a powerful message as opposed to her opponent who really wants to go back and just take care of his political buddies in the oil industry, who is looking out for himself and his political friends rather than the individual American people. So I am very confident in her ability to do those things. She has a strong message. She has been a great leader and I can't wait for tonight.",

When she has been very effective on the stage of building consensus in her vice presidential role. And if you recall, when she was a senator, nobody got away with any bunk when she was a senator and she will display that tonight. I am confident she will tame this weird narcissist that she is up against, so I am confident of those character issues. But listen, these policy issues are very important, too. She is the candidate who wants to build clean energy jobs, which we are doing clean. Energy jobs are growing twice as fast as the rest of the economy. They represent eight times more jobs, for instance, in Pennsylvania than the gas industry. And now she wants to understand reducing costs as well by working on the new sources of energy rather than the ones that are becoming more expensive. Look, the guy she is running against has said wind turbines cause cancer. They cause jobs and she is creating them all over the country. Look in my state, I've got so many companies where electricians and plumbers, and pipefitters are getting work and here is something I really like about her, she wants all of our kids to have careers, not just those who get a four-year colleges and she has a plan through the development of these clean energy jobs to make sure that you get a great family wage job even though you didn't go to a four-year college, that is a vision that I really appreciate.",

Unlike Donald Trump, who literally went begging for a billion dollars from the oil industry with an agreement to protect their hides. That is a starkly different approach to a person who understands job creation associated with clean energy, but simultaneously reduces climate change gases, creates jobs up and down the spectrum across the United States and somebody who wants to be wedded just to the special interests. That is a big difference, that will be clear tonight and she is going to come out on top.",

What Vladimir Putin invadedUkraine, and by the way, her opponent will not stand up for democracy because he likes autocrats, when that happened, she recognized that we need to have some transition gas and she has the right approach, I think now to make sure that we have the right safety so that we don't have spills and the like. I think that is the right approach and it is succeeding in Pennsylvania. I just looked at some stats where I mentioned this, where there are eight times more people working in clean energy today in Pennsylvania than in the gas industry. These jobs are growing faster than the rest of the economy in Pennsylvania. This is a growth-oriented strategy that is simultaneously going to reduce pollution that we know is causing climate change. And you're right, this is a really important issue. My state is on fire, California is on fire because of climate change. But she is doing it in a way that will recognize the reality. By the way, how does anybody in this world expect to be president of the United States and call climate change a hoax and windmills cause cancer, that person shouldn't be allowed within a quarter mile of the White House and that's Donald Trump. So I am very confident of her economic growth strategy and again, one of the things that I really like about it is not just for the rocket science, it is not just for the CEO, it is for the people who actually do the work, the electricians, the plumbers, the sheet metal workers, the truck drivers. She has a plan to bring those people into these clean energy careers, like we are doing in the state of Washington. We have already created 330,000 jobs just from the Inflation Reduction Act and she cast the deciding vote on that, so I am very confident going forward, both on jobs and climate. She is the person for the job.",

When brussels accused Apple of getting illegal tax benefits. I remember covering that. After the ruling, Apple says the European Commission is trying to retroactively change the rules and that the company's income was already taxed in the United States. You can see there in that statement. In a separate case, the court upheld the EU's $2.6 billion antitrust fine against Google. Hanna Ziady is with me to make sense of all of this.

You, from what I understand from my team, you are currently gathering data around the use of social media with young people between the ages of 11 to 22, just correct me if I am wrong at any stage. You are perfectly then positioned to talk about this initiative. Would it work in your view from the research you've done thus far? JO HICKMAN DUNNE, RESEARCH FELLOW IN SOCIAL MEDIA AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, MANCHESTER INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION: Hi, Isa. Nice to talk to you. Yes. Yes, we are currently been with people, we work, I think with people up to older than 20, but were really interested in young people's experiences. That's the age of 15 to understand exactly what those experiences are in social media and the positives and negatives around its relationship to their mental health. In terms of banning social media of young people, whatever that is, 14 to 16, I guess my first point would be that the question about whether it would be successful or how it will be successful needs to kind of be backed up by actually why we are creating these policy and the real challenges that we don't actually have a lot of evidence around the negative effects of social media. We hear a lot of scary stories and we know there are risks. For example, around harmful content and we know there are challenges, but there are also lots of positives and a lot of those kind of negative stories circulate in the media more widely than the benefits. So we assume there are lots of negatives, but actually the evidence that we have is not very consistent, so it is quite difficult I think to bring in policies like this without really grounding them.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As rescue workers scramble for survivors, eyewitnesses say the Israeli strikes targeted what was meant to be a safe zone in the Southern Gaza Strip, ripping through tents and makeshift shelters, leaving deep craters and dozens of killed and injured. They told us this area was safe, says this man. I swear the people here were just normal, he says, not fighters. By daylight, you can see the extent of the destruction. Israel's military says it conducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists operating a command and control center inside this humanitarian zone. An IDF statement says prior to the strike numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians. But this was a heavily populated area and civilians were caught up in the powerful blasts. This man says his two daughters were completely buried under the sand. Only one survived, he says. And he says he found the body parts of his neighbors strewn around. This 12-year-old girl is nursing a broken shoulder, suffered when her tent collapsed, she says, trapping her and her mother inside. I was scared because the strikes were so close, she says. Israel accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields and insists the Israeli military takes extensive measures to enable civilians in Gaza to avoid combat zones.

Donald Trump is notoriously reactive. Everyone around him knows that. They are hoping that he does not react to Kamala Harris. Now, in terms of actual debate prep, when it comes to policy, he has been holding what they call policy sessions. This means it's not your traditional debate prep. There's no one filling in for Kamala Harris. There's no one filling in for the moderators. Instead it is conversations held by senior advisers as well as lawmakers, former lawmakers, who sit down with him and go over various policies, go over potential questions as well as go over how to pivot away from topics that he doesn't want to talk about. They don't believe that abortion is strong for him politically. So one of the things they've gone over is how to pivot away from talking about reproductive rights to talking about immigration or the economy or crime. These are all the things that his team believes are most important. They also believe these are the things that are going to help him get across the finish line and win back the White House in November. But even with all of this, even with all of this preparation and talking about policy, the big question of course is how Donald Trump will present when he gets on that stage. Donald Trump is a volatile person. He is somebody who again is incredibly reactive. If Kamala Harris gets under his skin, will he respond? And one of the things that I've heard from ally after ally is this warning to Donald Trump, not issue any kind of verbal response. If he feels like he needs to react to do it in a facial expression. They do not want him lashing out at her, do not want him attacking her, but it's still Donald Trump. And whoever comes on that stage, whichever version of Donald Trump, it's going to be up to him later tonight.",
