The whole airport actually sits right on the bay. It's a beautiful approach when you fly in there. It's probably my favorite airport when I fly into Tokyo. My cameraman, John, flew in there just a few hours before this happened.But in this case, this Coast Guard aircraft somehow ended up on the same runway as this Japan Airlines jet was flying in, a packed plane coming from the tourist hot spot of Sapporo in Northern Japan. And these two planes had an incredibly fiery collision. We know that according to NHK Japan's national broadcaster, five crew members were killed. The captain was able to escape. But he is currently being held, or currently on life support. I've also lost my IFB signal. So, let's not ask a follow-up question until I get reconnected. But what we know is that this Coast Guard plane was headed to assist with the earthquake relief efforts that, within hours of the New Year, there was a 7.5 magnitude quake that rocked the central western coast of Japan. I know we're going to talk more about that in a moment. There's the number of dead in the dozens right now. But what is truly extraordinary is that what could have been a horrific mass casualty situation was averted because, in a matter of seconds, despite the fact that passengers say the rear and middle exits of this aircraft were damaged in this collision, there was a fire rapidly engulfing the plane, and yet everybody, 367 passengers, 8 children under the age of 2 included on the passenger list. So, a lot of parents, they're clutching onto their young babies and these 12 crew members, they all were able to make it off of that aircraft safely.",

You channel out, you go to your nearest exit, as they always tell you when you get on the airplane, look for your nearest exit, it may be behind you. This is what they did. They were aware. They were conscious. They were ready for any kind of accident. And this crew is amazing that they got everybody out of there so quickly by just channeling them through the aisles. There's already smoke, if you can visualize this, there's smoke in the cabin at the time. There may be fire going on at the time. People are getting out these exits and jumping onto the slides and coming out to the out to the ramp. And then once they clear that, they have to get away. So, this is all an incredibly urgent situation. And to have someone to be able to manage it, a crew to be able to manage it and get them all out of there safely is really testament to the work that they did to prepare for this type of tragedy.",

We need to look first at what happened, and it's too early to assign blame to anybody or anything like that.But what we can conclude is that we know that the Coast Guard was heading out to provide relief to the earthquake victims. We know that they were in a hurry to get out and do that. They were moving. If you look at how busy that airport is, that's a very, very active airport. There's a lot of moving pieces. And we talk about this a lot in the United States. We've had a really large increase in the number of near misses and runway incursions, such as this one. But we haven't had a fatality. We haven't had anything like this one so far in the United States. But the FAA has started a panel to investigate these types of incidents. So, where I would start with this investigation first is the communications, the communications between who said what to whom. And, as you know, there's been a lot in the United States. One of them most recently was where the air traffic controller had said, go ahead and go onto Runway 17 left, or I don't know exactly which one it was. And when the pilot repeated that back to confirm, he said something different, like 17 right. And the air traffic controller was busy, fatigued, had worked several shifts, and then it didn't recognize the fact that he didn't get the message properly. And then that airplane taxied onto an active live runway where there was an airplane landing. So, these types of communications are something that's under close scrutiny right now with FAA in the United States and also in Europe and in Japan. We have to really look at how this is happening. As these airports get busier and busier and busier, you still have a human being trying to figure out what I call the fourth dimension. It's not only where the airplanes are, but where will they be if they make a mistake or even if they do what they're supposed to do, where will they be in the future? And do those times intersect with each other? And so it's an extremely difficult job, and I hope that it improves. We really have a lot of efforts going forward to improve that over the next year or two, with the FAA at least and in the international community.",

It's gas canisters found inside a vehicle and a vehicle ramming through a crowd of people.Let's back up a bit and give you a little bit of the facts of what happened here. So, this is not even an hour into the New Year in Rochester, New York, at the Codex Center, which was having some sort of concert. About a thousand people attended that concert. And as they were leaving the concert, there were actually police helping a group of people across a crosswalk, and a Ford Expedition rammed into a car that was exiting, crossing over that crosswalk. So, two people inside the car it hit, which was a Mitsubishi Outlander, were killed. There were people that were injured in the crosswalk.

Well, you could say he was out there for New Year's Eve. The fact that he is alleged to have gone and rented this vehicle at the airport earlier, you know, that's a pretty hard one to explain away, except maybe he's an Uber driver and looking for a different vehicle. That's part of the business plan for some. So, what you're doing is taking this apart, each separate fact, and trying to find out what is the legitimate reason for this. And if you can't explain these things as you go down, it's kind of hard to explain a dozen gas cans, then you have to come to a conclusion about whether it's terrorism or not.

So, there's going to be some kind of indication that they wanted to take credit for this. And that's going to be found a lot of times in social media, a search of the residents, talking to friends and neighbors. That's going to be number one. You might also speak to this person.

No person shall hold any office who shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.It seems fairly straightforward. The problem is it is being interpreted and applied very differently across the map. Let's take a look at the current status quo. These six states have rejected challenges, efforts to try to remove Trump from the ballot. Some of them are still being appealed, Arizona and West Virginia. These 11 states we've had challenges to Trump's eligibility brought, but then withdrawn by the challengers for reasons that are varied. Now, we have, of course, now two states, Colorado and Maine, who have decided Trump is off the ballot. He committed insurrection. 14th Amendment applies. We could see appeals in the Colorado case to the U.S. Supreme Court, in the Maine case into the Maine state level courts at any moment.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, this is a complex sort of legal question. There's a lot of different issues swirling, but let's break it down into three questions. First of all, who decides?Now, if we look at Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, it tells us that the Congress, meaning the U.S. Congress, shall have the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article. Trump's team will argue that means Congress, and it's not up to the states. The opponents will argue, no, states can still make their own processes to go along with Congress. If that's true, if the states do have the right to do their own processes, that brings us to the second question, by what process? How much due process is owed here? If we look, for example, at Colorado, look, these don't have to be criminal trials. That's the highest level of due process. But the question is, was there enough? Colorado had a five-day trial. They had some live witnesses. They had a member of Congress. They took in documents. Some of it has hearsay that wouldn't be admissible. But, again, it's not a criminal trial. If we look at the Maine process, there was less. That was a one or two day hearing. The only witness was a law professor. The secretary of state relied on documents, including YouTube clips. So, the question is, was either of these enough due process? And then the final question is, and this one may seem a little odd, is the president an officer of the United States? I think, logically, you go, of course. There actually is an argument that's made sometimes that if you look at the construction of the Constitution, the president is actually separate from an officer of the United States. I think that one is a long shot, but look for that argument to be made as well.",

But if Trump files that appeal today, they can tell us, yes or no, we're taking it. That could happen at any moment. And then, of course, if they take it, how will they rule?Let me just say this.
