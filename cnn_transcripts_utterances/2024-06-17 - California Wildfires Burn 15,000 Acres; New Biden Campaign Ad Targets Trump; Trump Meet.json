We have new reporting this morning on how the campaigns are getting ready.And then evacuation near Los Angeles. Winds whipping our correspondent as firefighters race to get a fast-moving blaze under control. Then, 175,000 marijuana convictions erased. One of the most sweeping pardons ever. New reporting on who it impacts this morning. Kate is out. I'm John Berman, with Sara Sidner. And this is CNN NEW CENTRAL. Happening now, a wildfire north of Los Angeles has consumed nearly 15,000 acres so far and has forced 1,200 people to evacuate, and it is on the move. The Post Fire, as it's called, is spreading due to ferocious high winds and dry conditions. And at last report it was barely contained at all. CNN's Camila Bernal is live near Gorman, California. Camila, what's the latest from where you are?",

      "sentences": "Hey, John. So, the wind has died down a bit. You still see it in my hair, but not as dramatic as it was just a couple of hours ago. So, you know, this could be helpful for firefighters who are up against this, you know, just massive, massive fire. At the moment, we know there are crews both on the ground and in the air. What we were told from firefighters is that the goal right now is to create that fire line to avoid it from spreading even further.Unfortunately, though, that wind earlier this morning, and in the overnight hours, was forecasted to be 60 to 70 miles an hour. And that was making it just very difficult for these firefighters. And difficult to keep the line. It's why you still have that 2 percent containment. We are waiting for an update from officials. But we saw the increase in the acreage, but we did not see any increase in containment. Again, still just at 2 percent. And it's part of the reason why you also had these evacuation, 1,200 people under evacuation orders, and more under evacuation warnings. Officials still telling people to be prepared, to have their belongings packed in case they have to leave at a moment's notice. We're likely going to continue to see more win today. And, obviously, it's going to get hotter throughout the day. There's very low humidity and so all of that together is just fueling those flames as they continue to move. Right now we were told they were moving south of where we are. So again, just officials telling people to be extremely careful because, unfortunately, you look behind me and you see just the damage of what a fire like this can do to the terrain. It just destroys everything in its path. And thankfully, you know, we have not seen too many structures destroyed with this fire. And so that's what they're trying to keep - the firefighters trying to prevent it from getting any worse, John.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. I mean it's one of many fires. We're still looking at 30 active fires across the U.S. The focus, however, still is right on that Post Fire. You can see right here, just for frame of reference for folks who are not familiar with this particular area, again, just to the north and west side of Los Angeles. And as she mentioned, only 2 percent containment.That concern is going forward. Look at the winds just over the weekend. This is why it was very difficult for them to contain that fire because a lot of these wind gusts in that 50 to 60 mile per hour range over the weekend were not really expecting much of an improvement in terms of the forecast. Most of these winds, again, 40, 50 miles per hour as we go throughout the day today. Then we do finally start to see things calm back down. Once we get to say Wednesday of the upcoming week, but that's two days from now. So, the concern is, how much more is this fire really going to spread in the next 24 to 48 hours before we finally start to see some relief in the form of those winds going back down. That's why you can see not only that orange area there in California, but also some other areas of the southwest, where high winds, those low humidities, and the very warm temperatures are going to be a concern, at least not only today, but also in the next 48 hours as well.",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, this is a significant new ad from the Biden campaign as it marks the first time that they're really using the former presidents' legal issues in their campaign advertisements. Now, this is all part of a new $50 million television and digital campaign push that the campaign is making just in the month of June. And it comes is Biden's team is really looking to sharpen their arguments in their attacks against Trump heading into that CNN debate in just ten days.Now this campaign ad really tries to frame the election as a choice between a convicted criminal who is only out for himself, as the narrator puts it in the ad, and President Biden and the work that he is doing for the American people. But it's also significant because for months the Biden campaign, the president, really refrained from using any of Trump's legal issues in their arguments against him. That all changed, though, in the days following his conviction in that New York City criminal hush money trial. The Biden campaign started painting Trump as a convicted felon. President Biden himself used that terminology in a fundraiser just a few days later. And now you have this full-throated attack from the Biden campaign against Trump when it relates to his criminal conviction. Now, I'll also note, over the weekend it was interesting, President Biden was out in Los Angeles for a fundraiser that included Obama and some Hollywood stars. And First Lady Jill Biden, in her remarks, actually touched on some of the themes in this ad. She said that Trump is focused on giving himself absolute power and is not want - does not want to be held accountable for his criminal actions. So, it kind of shows how the campaign is starting to use his criminal conviction in its arguments. Now, President Biden, in that fundraiser that brought in $30 million for Democrats - for his campaign, the largest Democratic fundraiser in history, the president and Obama also really sought to warn voters about what a second Trump term could hold. Biden really drilled in on the impact a Trump presidency could have on the Supreme Court, noting his prediction that there could be two Supreme Court appointments open up in the coming years. And so the president, in his remarks, also starkly criticized the court saying that it is more out of kilter today than it's ever been before. All of this sharpening of the attacks against Trump comes as Biden is preparing to face off against him for the first time since their 2020 debates in just 10 days. President Biden tomorrow will be headlining a fundraiser with Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. And then towards the end of the week, he is heading out to Camp David, where he is expected to really drill in on his debate preparations. The campaign is really hoping that they can paint Trump as this chaotic and divisive figure. And that is part of the push that they are making with this new ad campaign out today really in very start terms, frankly calling him a convicted criminal as they're trying to argue he is unfit to serve office.",

In Texas, a shooting during a Juneteenth celebration claimed two lives and injured at least 14 there. And authorities are currently trying to figure out what the motive was for a mass shooting that happened at a Splash Pad near Detroit that left at least nine people injured, including some young children.Joining me now is CNN's Rafael Romo. What do we know about all these different shootings all happening separately from one another, but, man, 14 mass shootings in one weekend. It is an awful number. RAFAELL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Sara, it's horrible. And let me tell you, there's been so many that it's been hard trying to keep track of all of them. But let me begin with the one you were talking about before, the one in Texas. According to police, it happened when a fight between two groups broke out at a Juneteenth festival in Round Rock, not quite 20 miles north of Austin. The shooting happened just before 11:00 Saturday night at Old Settlers Park at the event organized by the city. Round Rock Police Chief Allen Banks said that during the altercation, someone produced a gun and began to fire, adding that police and fire rescue crews who already were at the scene immediately responded and began to render aid to the victims. Fourteen people were injured, including six were transported to nearby hospitals. There were two children among them. According to Chief Banks, the two people who died were not part of the altercation. Apparently we don't have the audio from the chief, but he said that it just breaks your heart for a family coming out to enjoy their evening and now their life is forever changed. So, a lot of people very sad, very disappointed. And now, Sara, only hours earlier, on Saturday afternoon, there was another mass shooting in Rochester Hills, Michigan. It'll happen Saturday at a Splash Pad in the city, located less than 30 miles north of Detroit, as families were enjoying a pleasant afternoon. The suspect got out of his car, walked up to the Splash Pad and opened fire when he was about 20 feet away. This is how a witness described it. We don't have the audio either, but let me tell you, this new tragedy, Sara, has hit Michigan especially hard. The community is still reeling from two other mass shootings last year. In February, a gunman killed three Michigan State University students and left five others critically injured. And in 2021, a teenager killed four students at a high school in Oxford, just 15 miles north of Rochester Hills. According to the Gun Violence Archive, and we were talking about this at the beginning, there were at least 14 mass shootings this weekend in the United States that left nine people dead, and over 70 others wounded from Ohio to Massachusetts. Just horrible, Sara.",
