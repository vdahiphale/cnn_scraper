His supporters gathering outside the Huntsville building where Roberson is being held, praying for the news that would eventually come. Just over an hour before he was set to be executed, the Texas Supreme Court delayed it.Roberson was convicted for the 2002 death of his two-year-old daughter. His attorneys, though, say a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome more than 20 years ago was wrong, and also point to new evidence which shows his daughter died from accidental and natural causes. The Innocence Project, a national organization dedicated to exonerating those who've been wrongly convicted and wrongly incarcerated, taking up Roberson's case and joining his fight for clemency, and joining me now is the co-director of the Innocence Project, Barry Scheck, who is also, of course, a well-known DNA expert who worked on the O.J. Simpson murder trial, another high-profile case. Barry, it's really good to have you here this morning. This has been -- there is so much attention on this case, and it has really been a little bit of a whirlwind. When the news came down last night, were you expecting it? BARRY SCHECK, CO-DIRECTOR, INNOCENCE PROJECT AND DNA EXPERT:  I don't know. I don't know what to expect. I was actually hoping that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals would have stated and reconsidered the case, but they didn't. This is extraordinary. We have this committee, a jurisprudence committee of the Texas Legislature that's bipartisan. And they have gone into this case. They held a hearing on Wednesday for all the world to see, and you can go online and look at it now. It should be taught in every law school across the country and every legislative tutorial. They went into this case in extraordinary detail, really smart lawyers. They brought in experts. They brought in the district attorney who, to their consternation, was not really aware of a lot of the evidence. And they really demonstrated that Robert Roberson is an innocent man. It -- of course, the shaken baby diagnosis is unreliable science, as they used it in his case. And ironically, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals last Friday decided a case called Rourke, which is now the leading case in the country, saying that many of the lynch pins of the shaken baby diagnosis do not have an adequate scientific basis and, you know, shouldn't be used in the way they were in Robert's case. But more importantly, in a way, they also focused on how the baby Nikki really died, which is that she had pneumonia, right? Number one. Number two, they gave her drugs, Phenergan and codeine and -- that stopped her respiration. And number three, that this idea that there were multiple impacts here as opposed to one short fall are provably wrong with CT scans and an analysis of the medical records. And so, there's proof of actual innocence that they brought out. And then, they made this most amazing move, is that they went to the courts and they said, we want Robert to come testify here as a witness and you can't execute him. Otherwise, he can't be a witness. And the Supreme Court of Texas said that the judge who issued an injunction to stop that execution did not abuse discretion. And there has to -- there's -- we're in uncharted borders legally in Texas,",

They also believe that this is possibly the effect of an event involving substance abuse due to some of the things that they found in his room. And also, there was a finding that he appeared to potentially have been unconscious or semi- conscious at the time of the fall and they're saying that because of the way that his body was found, he didn't assume a position of someone who knew they were falling and went to protect themselves.So, there's just a little bit more that we know now, Erica.

In fact, so far, more than 8.8 million ballots have been cast nationwide. In the crucial State of Georgia, almost 900,000 people have voted after polls opened there on Tuesday. And in North Carolina, 353,000 people turning out to vote yesterday. That was the first day of its early in-person voting. And also, a little bit better than what they saw in terms of numbers for the first day of the 2020 election.The state, of course, is still recovering from the widespread devastation left by Hurricane Helene. Joining me now, Karen Brinson- Bell, who's the Executive Director of North Carolina's State Board of Elections. It's good to have you here. This is a pretty impressive turnout for day one. Were you expecting that it would best those numbers from previous years? KAREN BRINSON-BELL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NORTH CAROLINA STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS:  We were optimistic that it would. 2020 was a record for us on the first day of in-person early voting, and now, we've broken that record. There seems to be a real energy in North Carolina, not just because of the presidential race, but because in North Carolina, we will have a new governor, a new attorney general, a new lieutenant governor, new members of Congress. So, this is a really critical election in North Carolina.",

So, I know that there have been new locations, new hours approved by the Board of Elections for hurricane victors. Can you tell us a little bit more about those changes that needed to be made?BRINSON-BELL:  So, the state board and the legislature did give flexibility to these counties. But I think what is just so commendable is that in the 25 federally designated counties affected by Helene, we had planned for 80 early voting sites. And yesterday, all 100 counties open for early voting, and in those affected counties, we had 76 of the planned 80 sites open, and that is just remarkable.",
