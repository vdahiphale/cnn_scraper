I'm Paula Reid in Washington in this weekend for Fredricka Whitfield.This just in, President Biden has now signed the debt ceiling bill into law, keeping the U.S. out of a default on its loans. This suspends the debt limit through early 2025, taking the threat of a default off the table until after next year's presidential election.

This has been a threat looming over the White House for weeks and months, and led to some tough negotiations between White House negotiators and Republican negotiators. Now, we have been covering that minute by-minute, and last weekend, last Saturday is when President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had to reach that tentative agreement on the debt ceiling. And now, a week later, that is signed into law.Now, President Biden took a victory lap yesterday in an address to the nation, and he did so from the Oval Office, really signaling the gravity of the moment and what the president saw as an accomplishment. The White House had been fairly mum over the course of these negotiations, but over these remarks just yesterday, President Biden outlining the consequences had there been a default on the economy, also talking about and saying how they protected their own priorities and their legislative achievements, as well as Medicare and Social Security, but ultimately, also stressing bipartisanship. This was something that could only be passed with Republicans and Democrats. Take a listen to what President Biden said about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I know bipartisanship is hard and unity is hard, but we can never stop trying. Because in moments like this one, the ones we just faced, where the American economy and the world economy is at risk of collapsing, there's no other way, no matter how tough our politics gets, we need to see each other not as adversaries but as fellow Americans, treat each other with dignity and respect.

The rescue workers say that they've brought in a crane to pick up overturned train cars that they fear there will not be further survivors at this stage and that they also believe that there are more bodies caught underneath these enormous train cars that have been overturned and derailed. The Indian prime minister was supposed to be inaugurating today a new high-speed train, but instead, he has had to rush to the scene of this horrific disaster to share condolences and to meet with some of the survivors. He is calling for an investigation and is vowing that whoever is responsible will be punished for this. India has an enormous railroad system. It moves more than 13 million people around the country every single day. It also has a history of deadly accidents in the past, with large death tolls. But that said, the scale of the loss in this disaster is still staggering for this country. There were long lines of volunteers who were trying to donate blood to help some of the survivors. As for the cause of this horrific disaster, one railroad official here in India tells CNN that it could have been a switching error and that could have either been due to technical malfunction or to human error.

Zelenskyy made the comment in an interview with the \"Wall Street Journal.\" He didn't commit to an imminent start to the operation, but he added that Ukraine can't wait months to do it.We're also seeing an escalation of the feud between Russian-backed Wagner Mercenary Group and the head of the Russian military. The head of the Wagner Group is accusing the Russian military of laying mines as his fighters were getting ready to exit the town of Bakhmut, following the long and bloody battle there. And just a few minutes ago, he threatened to move his troops to Belgrade, Russia to protect that territory. CNN's Melissa Bell has the profile of a very controversial leader. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): For months now, Yevgeny Prigozhin has been leading the charge in Ukraine and stealing the limelight. YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, HEAD OF WAGNER PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANY (through translator): Guys, don't bully the Russian military. BELL (voiceover): The taunt typical as he announced the withdrawal of his Wagner mercenaries last week after claiming the first Russian advance in Ukraine in months. Power on the ground that has translated into far more open political confrontation with Moscow. Long known by his nickname as Putin's chef, the oligarch shared the Russian president's humble beginnings in the tougher neighborhoods of St. Petersburg. Reportedly a former convict, he used Putin's rise to build a vast catering empire. As Putin set his sights on Crimea and Eastern Ukraine in 2014, Prigozhin's forces were there, the Wagner Mercenary Group that he founded became known as Putin's private army, operating on his behalf but in the shadows across the Middle East and Africa for years. But it took the chaos of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine for Prigozhin to take center stage himself. Flexing his power and his voice, which he raised loudly again this week against Russia's top military brass, after drone attacks on Moscow brought the war far too close to home for comfort. PRIGOZHIN (through translator): You are the ministry of defense; you didn't do a damn thing to stamp this out. Why are you allowing these drones to fly to Moscow? BELL (voiceover): Because propaganda is arguably what Yevgeny Prigozhin does best. Setting up this notorious troll farm in St. Petersburg, which was blamed or pumping out disinformation around the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Prigozhin was sanctioned by the U.S. despite denying any involvement. Now, he is personally taking his propaganda machine on the road and across Russia, turning his attention to what he calls the enemy at home with increasingly obvious political ambitions of his own.",

GEN, MARK KIMMITT, U.S. ARMY (RET.) AND FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY TO STATE OF POLITICAL-MILITARY AFFAIRS: Well, I think you've got to go back to the fall of the Soviet Union, the time between Yeltsin and Putin. During that time, the country was the wild, wild west, and that was the rise of the oligarchs as they tried to privatize the entire industry's industrial base inside of Russia. Prigozhin was one of those that took advantage of this. Prigozhin is a former hot dog salesman from Leningrad, but he, like so many of the other oligarchs, made billions of dollars. And candidly, when Putin came to power, there's this reciprocal relationship between the oligarchs and Putin, and Prigozhin is one of them.",

Van der Sloot has been the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of an Alabama teenager by the name of Natalee Holloway. Holloway was last seen alive 18 years ago in Aruba. She was on vacation there and was last seen alive with van der Sloot and two other men. The three men were all arrested numerous times but then released due to a lack of evidence. Holloway's remains have not been found this this day. Back in 2012, an Alabama judge legally declared her dead. So, let's talk about the charges that he's facing here in the U.S., namely wire fraud and extortion. That is connected to an alleged plot to extort the Holloway family, namely there was a reward around that time for $250,000 for any information leading to the finding of Holloway. Van der Sloot said, hey, I know where her remains are at. A representative of the family actually went to Aruba, van der Sloot pointed to a home, said, she's in the foundations there. Took $25,000 in cash from them, but then called them up and said, hey, that information was not correct, it was false. So, there is the wire fraud right there. So far, nobody currently has been charged in the murder of Holloway. Van der Sloot has been in a Peruvian prison now serving out a prison sentence 28 years for the murder of a separate, totally separate murder of a Peruvian woman. So, what will happen here is that once his legal proceedings in the U.S. are completed, he must return to Peru to serve out the remainder of that sentence. Paula.",
