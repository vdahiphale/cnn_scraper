A somber day and a day of grief, sadness, a day of grieving, but also a day for many of outrage and anger that 97 hostages taken on October 7th are still in Gaza. Many of them believed to be dead, an incredible number, perhaps, believed to be dead. And there is outrage and there is grieving.That is what we're seeing here, but on a day that Israel may choose, John, to reframe, to reframe as a day where they strike back at Iran, they believe the head of the octopus that struck them when Hamas attacked Israel last October 7th. And that, of course, is the moment that we're in. You know, when you are in this country, you are seeing rockets coming in from Hamas and strikes today. The northern border strikes back and forth throughout the night here in Tel Aviv already today told to take shelter. It is a country on edge. It is a region on edge. And, of course, as you mentioned, it is a country at war, a war on many fronts and a war with Iran. You know, whatever you want to call this moment, you hit somebody with 200 missiles and you're going to strike back, that would be a war. Jim Sciutto is here with me now in Hostage Square and, you know, Jim, this morning, obviously, people told to take shelter here. There is this palpable -- it is not just a moment of a grief. It is a moment of a country that is now fully at war. And there is a lot of anger here. Where are those hostages?",

As we stand here, several of the people behind us that they are relatives of those still held there, for them deeply personal. But as you know, spending so much time here, it is quite a deeply personal issue for Israel as well.And not just the hostages still held there, but the continuing threat that they see from Hezbollah in the north, Gaza in the south, and, of course, Iran to the east. And that's why, you know, of the many disagreements we run into here over politics, et cetera, approach to the war, it's hard to find someone here who does not want to send some sort of message to Iran, right, about Israel's ability to defend itself.",

And there are discussions back and forth and there seems to be pressure applied from the U.S. about how far Israel goes. Some pressure don't go so far as to attack the nuclear sites, concerns in Washington about an expanding war.But that said, at the end of the day, Israelis are quite confident and I think Israeli leaders are quite steadfast that they will respond almost with or without U.S. support.

This war that is engulfing the region, engulfing the United States and the tens of thousands of people who have been killed, two-thirds of the building in Gaza destroyed, firebombs over Beirut, it is an incredibly perilous and fraught moment that we are in, even as we stand here.

This is the last thing anybody wants to see at this moment, considering the storm fatigue that we have from our previous major hurricane strike, not less than two weeks ago, that being, of course, Hurricane Helene. So, now we're facing a strengthening Hurricane Milton now as a major hurricane with winds sustained at 120 miles per hour. And notice clearing in the center, we call that a pinhole eye, and that means that this storm is continuing to organize strength and basically the bottom falling off within major Hurricane Helene.The reason for this updated information from the National Hurricane Center, because, as we speak, the hurricane hunters, their job to fly within the heart of the storm, I have found a central pressure of roughly 954 millibars, so, again, the lower that number, the stronger the storm. They're also finding winds coinciding with Category 3 strength. Now, we have, as of 5:00 A.M., an updated list of alerts. We have a hurricane watch in place where you see the shading of pink that includes Tampa Bay southward into Fort Myers and Naples. And I want you to hear just what the Tampa Bay mayor had to say about the oncoming hurricane. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR JANE CASTOR (D-TAMPA, FL):  Please heed the warnings. If you can go now, go. You cannot wait and see. You have been told what's going to happen. We're fortunate if it wobbles one way or the other and we don't take the direct impact. But let's plan on that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And this is really crucial information here. The initial storm surge forecast for Tampa Bay, 8 to 12 feet. That actually eclipses last week or two weeks ago, Hurricane Helene storm served values from a storm that was west of Tampa Bay, and that set record values for this area. They are still in cleanup mode. It's already raining there ahead of the storm. So, flash flooding is going to be a major concern as well with the storm.",

So, it's more of a delayed landfall. We believe that it will be sometime Wednesday evening into Thursday morning, particularly across the central West Coast of the Florida Peninsula.So, we really need to nail down the specifics of this. But from what we can tell this storm still has a little bit of ways to go before it reaches western coastline of Florida, and that delayed timing is so crucial for people who are still getting their last minute preparations in place ahead of the storm.",

She kicked it off by sitting down with the hugely popular Call Her Daddy podcast. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now for more on this. You know, Alex Cooper, the host of the podcast, she said kind of in the introduction that she was given 40 minutes with the vice president for this interview, which is a long time for anyone who has interviewed a president or a vice president.

That was already taped tomorrow. She will be with the view, the Howard Stern show and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Then later in the week, she has Univision Town Hall in Las Vegas. Tim Walls also going to be out there with Jimmy Kimmel Tonight. Now, she's trying to reach different audiences here, for example, the Howard Stern show, mostly a male audience. The goal from the campaign, they say, is to try to boost turnout, especially in the last few weeks of the election and as some states are already beginning to vote. But, certainly, what we are watching unfold here is a campaign that is trying to reach more voters where they may be, knowing that this race continues to be just so close. Kate?",
