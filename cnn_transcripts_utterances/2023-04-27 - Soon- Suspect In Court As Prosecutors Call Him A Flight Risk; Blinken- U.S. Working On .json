      "sentences": "Right now, the Air National Guardsman accused of leaking highly classified intelligence documents is facing a federal judge. Prosecutors are arguing that 21-year-old Jack Teixeira is still posing a grave threat to national security and should remain in custody ahead of his trial.In a late-night court filing, prosecutors allege that Teixeira may still have access to hundreds of classified documents. And that his online search history was \"what appears to be a deliberate effort to disseminate this country's secrets.\" They also claim that Teixeira is a major flight risk and an attractive candidate to foreign governments. Let's go to CNN's Jason Carroll who's outside the courthouse live in Worcester, Massachusetts. Jason, take us inside the courtroom. What's happening now? JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, that detention hearing, Boris, is well underway. First up on the stand was Jack Teixeira's father. As you know, he has been present during many of the court proceedings leading up to this. The judge at one point asked him if by chance he ends up ruling that Teixeira would be let out on bail in his custody, he said do you understand your responsibility? And he said I believe I do. The judge went on to say it was reported that after the proceeding, you called out to your son and you said I love you. The judge then said again, do you understand that if he broke conditions of his release that you would have the responsibility of turning him in? He said Yes, Your Honor. Boris, as you know, the defense has argued in part that the -- that when he shared this information on Discord, they're arguing that he didn't mean for it to go across the internet. It was just meant to be shared, this classified information, with just this group that he was talking to on Discord. And just a few moments ago, the judge said this. The judge said someone under the age of 30 has no idea that if they put something on the internet that would end up anywhere in this world, seriously? The defense said I don't know the exact circumstances. The judge followed up and said, look, the circumstances of this event are that he had no idea that it would go beyond this little circle of people on the server. That is like someone arguing I pulled the trigger but I had no intent to kill him. One of the more dramatic moments in court, as this detention hearing is still underway. The prosecution, of course, arguing that he is a flight risk and that he could be a risk to himself and others in the community. The defense -- the prosecution saying at one point, he's no longer a small child sitting at a big desk with big computers. He's also not the person he described himself to be in a letter to a police officer when he was seeking a firearm. When that -- in terms of what he was referring to was back in March of 2018 when he tried to get a permit for a firearm, but he was denied by police after police found out that he was suspended from high school due to some of the comments that he had made.

I wanted to ask you because we now know that the Government Accountability Office, they really put everyone on blast five years ago. And I'm reading from a 2018 press release, it says.\"GAO adds government-wide personnel security clearance process to high-risk list.\" And it explains in the first sentence of this press release, how that means it needs \"either broad-based transformation or specific reforms.\" Has Congress -- has anyone done either of those things, Congresswoman? REP. ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-VA): So, broad-based reforms, I think are certainly what should ultimately be the outcome after it's fully understood how the individual in this case was able to not just access information that he had absolutely no need to access, but that he was able to download it, that he was able to take that information with him and that he was able to subsequently make it available on the internet. And we are focused on fully building upon what should have been lessons learned from prior circumstances when there's been releases of classified information. And certainly, at this moment, everyone across Capitol Hill, but particularly members of the intelligence committee, are focused on understanding exactly how this happened, what went wrong, how this individual had a security clearance in the first place, and then how there were no red flags triggered every time he was accessing information that he should not have been accessing.",

And so, here, we're seeing you know, questions related to inconsistencies between areas via different intelligence agencies or inconsistencies in how someone is moving from a cleared position -- you know, receiving a clearance into a position where they're then utilizing or not utilizing that clearance. So really, across the board, there needs to be a full review of what's happening within the individual agencies to make sure that we are seeing you know, basically adherence to the highest level. We should see, you know, lessons learned and utilizing the strengths that some agencies are employing to avoid these sorts of leaks. But certainly, Congress in its oversight role must continue to ask really probing aggressive questions about how it is possible that this happened. And certainly, you know, just in a few years since we've seen prior such disclosures. KEILAR: And aside from questions and hearings, what kind of changes maybe?

No food, no water, no medicine, no police, and a ceasefire that's about to end this midnight.Governments are scrambling to evacuate civilians from Sudan, that includes Americans. Last hour, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the U.S. is working on a new system to get those U.S. nationals there back home. CNN's Kylie Atwood, she's at the State Department. Kylie, I mean, there's a math problem here, right, estimated 16,000 U.S. citizens in Sudan, many of them dual nationals. I mean, is the actual plan here to give all of them the option to come out of the country or a portion of them? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, listen. What the Secretary of State talked about was the need for a sustained process to be set up to help get those Americans out of the country who want to leave. You referenced 16,000, that is a number that the State Department has shared with Congress. We don't know how many of those Americans -- many of those Sudanese Americans are actually going to want to leave. But what the secretary said today was that he and his team are actively working to extend the ceasefire that was put into place earlier this week, which is actually going to end later today. Because he said, if they're able to do that, that at least reduces violence somewhat. He acknowledged that it has been imperfect. And then he talked about the need for there to be this sustained process to help those Americans get out of the country. Listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: What we need to do, and what we're working to establish is a sustained process for enabling people to leave assuming that the conditions that we see now are maintained. By which I mean, on the one hand, yes, ceasefire however imperfect, but also ongoing violence, confrontation between the two rival military groups. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
