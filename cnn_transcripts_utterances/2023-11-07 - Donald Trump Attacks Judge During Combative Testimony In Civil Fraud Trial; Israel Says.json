We'll begin with a New York courtroom and during almost four hours of testimony, Donald Trump was argumentative, and at times rambling, he insulted the judge, the state prosecutors. He repeated blatantly incorrect claims from the campaign trail calling the trial part of it political witch hunts. He also said it was election interference, none of it true.He also made history during the civil fraud case, the first former U.S. president to take the witness stand to explain his own actions. The trial is a civil case, which means Trump will not face jail time unlike his four criminal indictments. But this New York case strikes at the very heart of Trump's business empire, and it could end with a ban on ever doing business again in New York State. In a pre-trial ruling, Trump is found liable for fraud for inflating financial statements about the value of his properties in order to receive more favorable loans. The judge who has appeared visibly annoyed with Trump's bombastic performance at times, will ultimately decide the outcome. And Trump's legal team has threatened to file a motion for a mistrial. Yet outside the courtroom, Trump said his testimony went very well. CNN's Kara Scannell has a record. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARA SCANNELL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Donald Trump publicly blasting a New York judge and the State's Attorney General capping off a marathon day of testimony at the civil fraud trial centered around his sprawling global business empire. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: This is a case that should have never been brought into the case that should be dismissed immediately. The fraud was on behalf of the court. The court was the fraudster in this case, a terrible thing this happened here.",

Inside court, Judge Arthur Engoron repeatedly warning Trump not to give speeches in response to direct questions. And Trump attacking the judge saying I'm sure the judge will rule against me because he always rules against me. The judge replied, you can attack me you can do whatever you want, but answer the question.Soon after things started getting heated with a judge asking Trump's lawyer to control his client warning that this isn't a political rally. Mr. Kise, that was a simple yes or no question. We got another speech. I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can't, I will. I will excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can. Do you understand that? At one point during testimony, Trump leaned into the microphone saying this is a very unfair trial. Very, very, and I hope the public is watching. Trump testified he did look over the financial statements and acknowledge some property values on them were incorrect, agreeing that his triplex apartment at Trump Tower was overvalued one year, but others were undervalued he said including Mar-a-Lago. Still, Trump said the statements were not important and had worthless clauses warning bankers not to rely on them. He added it was the responsibility of internal and external accountants to put together the statements, but he did acknowledge that the banks reviewed them.

It was the accountants. It wasn't me.He said, in fact, to the New York Attorney General, you're wrong. I didn't overvalue. I undervalued because I am worth so much money. The Trump brand brings all of these properties up. So it was interesting, legally and politically, you see the kind of convergence of this argument of I am worth so much money.

Now, of course, there were seven counts in this complaint and the judge granted summary judgment, as you noted on one of them, finding that there was in fact fraud that Trump committed fraud, the Trump Organization, but there still are six other counts where the judge is looking at potential liability.And when you are extremely combative and non-responsive with the judge, who again is acting as a jury, that's not a great legal tactic. The fact that he was so aggressive and critical of the judge indicates to me that he largely thinks this is last at least on liability, likely on remedies. And so he is making his case to the voters to say see, I told you it was a witch hunt. I told you it was election interference. And the fact again, that he pulled no punches indicates to me that he thinks this is largely lost. Now, of course, the defense has not put on their case yet. They estimate that their case will last until mid-December. So we'll see what legally they will argue in terms of whether or not values are subjective.

And there's now the pressure on Israel for some kind of military pause especially with the death toll in Gaza, according to Palestinian officials, passing 10,000. So what is the outcome here for the Israelis? Will they give this -- what's the likelihood of this pause actually taking place? Netanyahu says it doesn't seem like it's on the cards.",

      "sentences": "Not as far as Netanyahu or the Israeli government is concerned, John. What Israel has said from the start is that there can be no ceasefire, at least not until all 250 or so hostages that Hamas abducted on October the 7th are returned unharmed to Israel.What Netanyahu did say in an interview with ABC news yesterday is that there can be, in his words, tactical little pauses, maybe an hour here, maybe a couple of hours there. Now these could be described as humanitarian pauses or tactical pauses -- whatever you want to call them -- they don't equate to a general ceasefire. That is something that Netanyahu repeated is not in the cards. The other interesting thing he said in this interview, and this is perhaps his first real comment on what happens after this war is over. It's that he said Israel will have overall security responsibility for Gaza for, in his words, an indefinite period. Now overall security responsibility doesn't necessarily mean boots on the ground, but Netanyahu, of course, is coming through criticism not just for the death, destruction, the displacement, despair that we are seeing inside the Gaza strip, but also for not really, certainly not articulating publicly and probably not really deciding privately what is going to happen the day after this war ends. Now clearly the most convenient solution for Israel, for the United States and for many in international community would be for the Palestinian Authority, which rules the -- or runs parts of the Israeli occupied West Bank, to take back control of Gaza, control that it lost in a violent struggle with Hamas in 2007. But for starters, Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, is in his 19th year of a four-year term. He lacks legitimacy there. And will clearly lose all sense of legitimacy if he were to go into the Gaza strip to take back control of that for the Palestinian Authority and be seen as some kind of puppet government of Israel. Unless, of course, by some miracle, there was some major, major concessions. Perhaps even an agreement for a Palestinian state. That seems unlikely to be in the cards. It's been talked about the United Nations maybe coming in or other Arab states with which Israel is allied coming in to help govern the enclave. But certainly, there are concerns as to what happens once this war ends, whether that is in a few days, weeks or months, this war will eventually end. But the other important thing to note of course, is that in previous major conflicts where there have been major questions about Israeli decision-making or major and/or major Israeli losses, the government of the day has been swiftly ejected. We saw it after the Yom Kippur War in 1973 with Golda Meier. We saw it after the first Lebanon War. We saw it after the second Lebanon war. So it may not actually be Netanyahu's decision to make, John, as to what happens the day after this war ends.",

      "sentences": "Yes. That war is going to be is going to be on the agenda but it's not going to feature as prominently as it did last time. But I think G7 foreign ministers certainly hope they are a more unified response to that invasion by Russia would serve as an inspiration or an example with what they could've done, of what they will be doing in terms of more firm and united approach to the current conflict in Gaza.Because, already, we see divisions emerging between the members with different concerns and different political loyalties and different economic priorities. The French, for example, voted for a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire late last month, even though the U.S. vetoed it and other G7 members abstained. And the host nation Japan, as you know, despite pressure from his closest ally, the U.S. for a more full pro-Israeli public stance has been adopting a more quote-unquote balanced approach since the very beginning because of its own diverse interests in the Middle East, especially is heavy reliance on oil imports from that region. And all the civilian casualties in Gaza, obviously, reinforcing that notion. So it's going to be very challenging for all the foreign ministers to agree on wording in terms of Israel's right to defend itself and also Gaza' civilian casualties, not to mention any concrete proposals to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. But I think they are also keenly aware of what they end up saying or not saying is being watched not just by partners and allies, but especially critics and detractors, including Russia bur also increasingly China. Both Beijing and Moscow blaming the U.S. and its western allies as the root cause of this Gaza conflict and portraying themselves as champions of the developing world and as peacemakers. So they're certainly using that war as further justification for their desire and willingness to reshape the U.S.-led world order. So I think the G7 foreign ministers understand that and the implications of the grouping's political relevance going forward, John.",
