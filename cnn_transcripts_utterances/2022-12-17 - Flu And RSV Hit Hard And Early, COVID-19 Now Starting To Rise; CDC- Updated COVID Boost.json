But so far, this season, only 40 percent of adults and 46 percent of children have received their flu vaccine.And as you said, we are in the middle of this triple threat with these two -- these three viruses: RSV, the flu, and COVID. And all of this as we are preparing to go into the full swing of the holiday season. Now, let's put up the numbers. Influenza in the U.S., as of a couple of days ago, 15 million cases, 150,000 hospitalizations, and 9,300 deaths. Now, things are showing a slight sign of improvement. But I do want to put all of this in some historical context, because the numbers that we are looking at have not been this high during the flu season in at least a decade. So, Fredie (PH), we're talking about what federal officials are asking and recommending that people do as they gear up to go into the holiday season. And it's what we have been talking about for so many months now. Vaccination, testing, and masking up when possible. Some cities around the country, especially where those COVID rates are starting to increase have issued guidance that people should begin to mask up when they are indoors. Not a full requirement yet, but just a recommendation. So, it is certainly possible to gather ahead of the holidays, but they are recommending that people test before that gathering and that people certainly get all of their vaccinations. Fred?",

You know, in the school district, it's about protecting public health, making sure our students and staff are in school regularly.

Heavy snow is threatening parts of the Northeast today as a powerful nor'easter moves across the region. The storm already dumped nearly two feet of snow in parts of New England, tearing down trees and power lines, and leaving 1000s without power. More than 5 million people are, in fact, under winter weather alerts today. Let's bring in CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. So, it sounds like it's going to get worse before it gets better. ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (on camera): Yes, I was going to say, at some point, you're going to have roughly 80 percent of the population of the lower 48 with temperatures at or below freezing over the next seven days. And for some of those folks that begins this weekend. Right now though, we're just kind of trying to wrap up some of the snow that just kind of seems to be lingering across areas of the Northeast, and the Great Lakes region. The heaviest right now was focused across portions of Maine. But you also have some of those heavier lake effect snow bans coming across, especially Ontario, as well as Lake Erie and Michigan. Overall, most of these areas likely to pick up an additional four to six inches of snowfall, that's going to be your most widespread common amount. But the highest is actually going to be right here across portions of upstate New York, areas of Pennsylvania, we're picking up an additional one foot of snow is not out of the question. And this is on top of what we've already seen. But we talked about that cold air. Again, the surge is really going to start in the north central portion of the country before spreading across really much of the eastern half of the U.S. at some point over the next week. Looking at the temperatures Take for example Fargo, this is the high temperature on Sunday, will tap out at four. Then, the high temperature on Tuesday only makes it to minus six. And then, you have to factor in the wind chills on top of that, likely going to be about the minus 25 to minus 30 range. And then again, it begins to spread. So, you're going to see Chicago's temperatures drop. Minneapolis temperatures drop, but even places farther east and farther south are going to get on in this mix. It's just going to take it several more days. So, take for example, Atlanta, still warm in the early portion of the week. 52 for the high on Thursday, but by the time we get to Friday, that temperature plummets down to 25, and even staying cold through the weekend. Washington, D.C., similar scenario. Those temperatures in the 40s for much of the week, dropping back, Fred, down to only 29 next Saturday.",

You know, obviously, for somebody like me, I have a platform here on CNN. And I can also post on other social media platforms. You know, I mentioned during the week that it could be concerning for independent or freelance journalists or journalists, who cover Musk and his other companies like Tesla and SpaceX. And what my colleague Oliver Darcy has reported this afternoon is that, that's appears to be kind of now what is happening. Another journalist, Linette Lopez, who has covered Musk for years, had her account suspended, and is not entirely clear why her account was banned. So, look, I think this could potentially have a chilling effect on how people report on Musk. But again, Twitter is a private company. You know, Musk can do whatever he wants. He can ban whoever he wants. But it is, of course, somewhat hypocritical of him to, you know, hold up this free speech, mantle while also shutting down journalists. Briefly, I would just mention, to be fair to Musk, you know, the idea of people being able to track your private jet, you know, could be concerning, and of course, could be a safety risk. But the kind of mental gymnastics that they're going through here to shut down reporters who are reporting about this, there's a lot there.

Those are a little bit challenging, because they may have First Amendment issues connected to them.But then there was this event where Trump tweeted after Mike Pence said he was not going to deny the certification.
