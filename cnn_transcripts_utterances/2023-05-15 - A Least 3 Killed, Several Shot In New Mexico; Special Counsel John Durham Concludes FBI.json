But this also became an officer-involved shooting.So what officials are saying is that there were two officers who were shot during this situation. One with a New Mexico state police and one with Farmington police. They were also taken to the hospital and we're told that they are in stable condition. There are very limited details here. But again, at least three people have been killed in this incident. Police officers are still investigating. They're trying to figure out exactly what happened, and we do know that the suspect was killed on the scene. We do not have the identity of this person. But there are no other threats at this time according to authorities. So, they do have the situation under control. But unfortunately, three people are dead and two injured, at least, that are police officers. Thankfully, we do know that they are in stable condition at the moment -- Brianna.",

Sara, the deadline was actually earlier this month for the D.A. to respond, extended it to today. I mean, the question is we can guess how Willis is going to respond to it.

If he's the one who makes the call on this.It'll be hard for me to imagine that he says, OK, let's throw out all of the evidence this grand jury has spent time collecting. It's possible he could listen to what Trump's attorneys want and say, let's have another judge take a look at this. But I think, you know, we pretty much know what to expect from the D.A.'s office today. A fulsome argument about why the evidence should not be thrown out. Why she should not be disqualified and frankly why it's too early. I mean, this case is not even in the indictment stage. So, it would be unusual to toss all of this evidence this special grand jury found before we even see indictments, Jim.",

Remember, this is the Trump-era probe that explored the origins of the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.We are joined now by CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez. Evan, when this was launched during the Trump administration, those officials vowed to investigate the investigators. What did they accomplish?

First, special counsel Durham concluding that the FBI should never have launched its investigation into connections between Donald Trump's campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. But simultaneously the special counsel did not recommend any new charges against any individuals or any changes to the way that the FBI handles politically charged investigations.So those two key takeaways, very important here and this does not -- this does not fall in line with the description from the former president that we heard at the time, of his expectations of the Durham probe. Right? He was saying that former President Obama was spying on his campaign. That this was a witch hunt, a deep state-coordinated effort to make up claims about his connections to Russia. This Durham report doesn't get anywhere near those allegations from the former president, right?",

So, this is the actual source material handed directly over to Congress.Quite a bit different from what we saw Attorney General William Barr do with the Mueller report a few years ago.

That was the origin of this. And at the time, having covered this, was there a great deal of excitement or interest on the right that there would be discoveries, as you say, on a mass conspiracy and that criminal charges were going to follow. That portion of it though, we should note, and he has found wrongdoing -- not wrongdoing or at least not meeting their high standards. That vision of it did not come to be.",

When they happen, people should be dealt with accordingly.And frankly, if John Durham had found that people violated the law or rules, he could have brought charges and recommended personnel changes based on folks that act in that manner.

And you can imagine he's going to be seizing on a lot of the details in this report that are favorable to former President Donald Trump. We have seen that, you know, time and time again.
