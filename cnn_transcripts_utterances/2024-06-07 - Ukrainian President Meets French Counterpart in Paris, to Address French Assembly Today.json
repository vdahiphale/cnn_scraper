Calls for an independent investigation in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike hits a U.N. school where displaced Palestinians were sheltering. And blast off for SpaceX's Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, completes a successful launch and re-entry. World leaders and World War II veterans are marking 80 years since D- Day, the Allied invasion of Normandy, France that led to the eventual downfall of Nazi Germany. (VIDEO PLAYING) But along with all the tributes and emotion came dire reminders that democracy is once again under attack, with direct parallels drawn between the battles of 1944 and Russia's current war on Ukraine. The US President declaring his ironclad commitment and warning that abandoning Ukraine will only embolden Russia. Ukraine's President was warmly welcomed by many attendees, including this World War II veteran. And in the hours ahead, Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet with Joe Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: America's unique ability to bring countries together is an undeniable source of our strength and our power. Isolationism was not the answer 80 years ago and is not the answer today. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It was a vertical cliff more than 100 feet high and U.S. Army Rangers had to storm it to take the big gun positions, 115 millimeter German gun positions on the top that were trained on the beaches where all the troops were landing.So President Biden will be there and his speech undoubtedly is going to talk about the values of democracy, the sacrifices of those veterans at Pont du Hoc and across all the beaches, but it will be very clearly to say that there is a threat and a challenge and it's Vladimir Putin and we need to stand together and it will likely be a message too towards his domestic rival, if you will, Donald Trump. He called him out without naming him in his speech yesterday saying isolationism doesn't work and that's what Europe worries about. It's the isolationist policies of the United States that President Trump appears to you know to want to want to grow at the disadvantage of NATO, even pulling out of NATO.

While it's clear Narendra Modi will serve a third consecutive term as prime minister, he's lost his aura of invincibility with a closer than expected vote.Modi's BJP party won far more seats in parliament than any other party that lost dozens of seats and no longer has an outright majority. Well, now the prime minister will have to rely on coalition partners who do not share his hardline Hindu nationalist agenda. Well joining me to talk more about this from Delhi is Karishma Mehrotra. She is the South Asia correspondent for the \"Washington Post\". Karishma, great to have you with us. Explain to us, why did the Dalits, low-caste voters, reject the BJP in this election? KARISHMA MEHROTRA, SOUTH ASIA EDITOR, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Yeah, thank you so much for having me. Yeah, so one of the most surprising aspects of this election is the way that the lowest caste voters voted the Dalits in one of the most important states in India, Uttar Pradesh. And keep in mind, these are some of the same voters in India's Hindi heartland that had propelled Modi to power over the past two terms. And one of the biggest reasons that Dalits seem to not vote for the BJP this time is because of fears that the BJP would change the constitution and remove the constitutional guarantees for affirmative action that are given to their caste. That's one of the main reasons. And it's an interesting reason because the constitution for many decades now has not played such a prominent role in elections in India, but this time it has. The second reason is along class lines, the fact that jobs, unemployment, inflation, pure economic reasons are sort of widening in India and broadening. And that is also another big reason that voters, and especially Dalit voters, did not vote for Modi this time and were unable to give Modi the governing majority that he's used to in this country.",

And in fact, many analysts say that that's why he doubled down on religious rhetoric in this election.We heard him make very polarizing statements this time, especially in the middle of the election, as things perhaps seemed to shift away from their direction. So, for example, he made the claim that it's not his party that wants to change the constitution, it's the opposition that wants to change the constitution and remove resources from the Hindus and give them to the Muslims. Now, he later said he wasn't referring to Muslims, but he clearly made a very polarizing turn. So, in fact, he probably noticed that this was happening and he doubled down on religious appeals. But unfortunately, I think that economic focus and the focus on caste is the thing that ended up being some of the biggest weaknesses for the BJP this time. [03:19:55] COREN: Karishma, I believe that in an interview on May 16th, Modi was asked a question about how inequality was reaching historic extremes. And he responded by saying, what should I do?

So, the way he might speak to a global audience or to President Joe Biden might be very different than how he speaks to TV anchor, how he speaks during rallies.But I think it's true that the extent to which unemployment and the widening economic gulf in this country has mattered to voters was a surprise, not just maybe to the BJP, but even to many journalists. I mean, everyone had sort of heard these grumblings, and we knew that the grumblings exist. But let's keep in mind that the confidence that the BJP has had and the way that the country has become used to Modi as a serial winner. I mean, he's never not won a governing majority in his time in his 23 political career. And his cocktail of Hindu nationalism, of development, of the global standing, it has worked when it's a national election. It has worked. And so, I think it was a shock to everyone that the economic matters, the class and caste matters in this country really sort of made a larger mark than we had thought. And again, he tried with more and more religious rhetoric, but it didn't end up working in the end.",

So it's not just about getting it into the air and then getting it down on the ground again safely. It's about how you use these air combat capabilities to the greatest effect as a military weapon system. And I think that the other challenge that the Ukrainians have been facing is a real caution or over-caution on the part of the Biden administration and on some Western European countries on supplying the sorts of military capabilities that Ukrainians need to actually have some chance of winning this war.

And I think that what needs to happen is for the Biden administration to allow Ukrainians to use the full range ATACMs, the 300 kilometer range ATACMs missiles, not just the 70 kilometer range Gimliz missiles. And secondly, allow the Ukrainians to use those weapons, not just in the Kharkiv area, but also in the Donbass area so that they can strike directly into Russia and deny the Russians the ability to mass forces, deny the Russians the ability to have a secure rear area where they can build logistics points to support their forces in combat and essentially really deny the Russians that advantage they've been exploiting for so long under these constraints.",

We're talking about way in the background, the DMZ, about four kilometers, two and a half miles away from where we're standing. Now, Farmer Kim has told us that during moments of heightened tension in the past, the South Korean army has kept him from entering about half of his property because it is so close to the DMZ in order to keep him and others safe.VALERIO (voice-over): The question now, how will North Korea respond, especially after a show of force by the United States, a B-1B bomber on Wednesday flying over the Korean peninsula and for the first time in seven years, engaging in land target practice with live munitions. We asked Kim if he wants to leave. His answer, I want to move to somewhere else, but I can't afford it. We're very upset that the balloons are making our daily lives inconvenient in our areas seen as a war zone. It's very unfortunate. There's nothing we can do. If I could, I would want to stop them, but it's difficult. So for Kim, there's no choice. Staying in his field, surrounded by waters from the north, longing for a time before new heights for tensions in the sky. Mike Valerio, CNN, Jeollanam-do, South Korea. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
