Other prime time speakers include former President Bill Clinton and the former House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi. And two vice presidential prospects who lost out to Governor Walz, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, they will also speak.

This person says that he's going to have fun. I can't stress this enough, which is interesting given that Kamala Harris and her campaign have very much tried to stress the joyfulness that they believe is possible even in the 2024 election. I'm also told though, by an aide to the former president, that if this speech is going to try to capture and join in that joyful energy, it is also going to be the former president's most critical public remarks about the former President Donald Trump. I'm told that when he says as we've reported based on the excerpts that 2024 represents a choice between we, the people, versus me, myself, and I, that latter message is going to be about Donald Trump. He's basically going to say that he sees Kamala Harris as having been somebody that for years worked to expand the definition of us, but that Donald Trump is somebody who at every turn has been singularly focused on himself.

I also think the Democratic Party is clearly changing. You saw Michelle Obama, I think, was kind of the embodiment of this, right? It was no longer when they go low, we go high.

      "sentences": "I was talking with a top convention organizer this morning, who said this crowd, these delegates are eating up inspiration. They want to be taken on a journey, they want to be entertained, they want to be fired up, and Bill Clinton is enough of a politician, is enough of a person who, you know, has a tactile sense of what people want, that he's going to give it to them.And you know, the idea that he's going to try to stay with this vibe, this joyful vibe, both in terms of the way it presents the future and what the Harris/Walz ticket can provide, and also the way they go after Donald Trump. You know, he wants to give them what they want, and I find it so interesting, because Joe Biden kept building up Donald Trump as a fearsome figure, a figure who might destroy our democracy. And what you've been hearing, and you certainly heard it from the Obamas last night, is to diminish Trump, to make him a small person, a tired person, an over the hill person. And my guess is that you're going to hear that the same from Bill Clinton tonight, to diminish him and make him not this big, larger than life figure --",

So I think that's part of it as well, but it really is a striking shift, and it's also a shift for, frankly, from what Hillary Clinton did in 2016, where a lot of her campaign, I mean, she has come in for some criticism, I think, for that slogan, I'm with her, right? Because it made it the election more about Clinton herself and less about the people that Clinton was fighting to serve, and you've seen Kamala Harris avoid that.",

Facts: Kamala and Tim, they fight for the people and they also listen, and when they say we need a cease-fire an and an end to the innocent lives in Gaza and to bring hostages home, they're listening, friends. They agree with us. There are people watching tonight and maybe even here tonight who aren't sure yet about Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. If you want to know where they stand on some of the most urgent issues facing our country in the world, let me assure you, Kamala and Tim hear you. They listen. They care. And everyone is included in their circle of compassion. They believe that everybody counts and everybody matters. Let's put a stop to the scam of Donald Trump once and for all.

These Democratic delegates, they are pumped, they are excited, and they think they can win the presidential election coming up in November. We're going to be hearing much more, some of the big speakers are coming back. We've got a lot of major speakers coming up, including the former president of the United States, Bill Clinton.
