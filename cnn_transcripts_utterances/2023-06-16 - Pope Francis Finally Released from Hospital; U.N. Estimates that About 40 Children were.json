He had a three -- underwent a three-hour surgery last Wednesday. Last Tuesday, surprise visit to this hospital behind me, the Gemelli Hospital here in Rome. Last Wednesday, we're told he underwent this three-hour surgery that went well. We said, but we hadn't heard it or seen anything. Then all of a sudden Thursday yesterday, we get pictures of him visiting the Pediatric Oncology Ward. We get pictures of him, you know, in fine form, told he's getting out of the hospital this morning. Now, we were told that would be sometime this morning. He's an early riser, didn't want to waste any time. He was out of here around 8 a.m. local time. And you know, the crowds had gathered. A lot of the people were here just because they were here for medical reasons, were here visiting patients and friends and family members, lots of doctors, nurses, so many people in the crowd. But there were also people who knew he was getting out today that came and just wanted to show their support. He's an incredibly inspirational man to so many people, Catholics and non-Catholics alike, and to see him recovered. Now, going back to the Vatican where we're expected he'll rest a little bit more before he has these grueling trips scheduled for August but he also has a couple of private meetings scheduled for next week.

The boat sank in very deep water and there's little hope of finding additional survivors. Many women and children were believed to be trapped below deck. The traumatized survivors are currently being cared for in a dockside warehouse and will eventually be transferred to a facility in Athens.

They've now been put on buses and they're being taken to Athens, where their applications will be processed.But also here in Kalamata, those charges brought against nine Egyptian men accused of having been part of the people smuggling operation that allowed all of those people, some 750 in all, we believe to have gotten onto that boat that set off from Tobruk just a few days ago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BELL (voice-over): It's the biggest rescue operation they have ever undertaken, say Greek authorities. But far too little, far too late, say several of the NGOs who patrol the Mediterranean Sea, now the deadliest migrant crossing in the world. The boat here, hours before it sank, the Greek Coast Guard says, refused help. Greek authorities say it took just 10 to 15 minutes for it to sink. Only 104 people survived. UNKNOWN (through translator): All women died, all children died, because women stay all in one room. So impossible they would survive, impossible, so difficult. All women and their children died.

And as I mentioned there in the report, what you're going to see here in Europe that has been searching ever since the migrant crisis in 2015 for some kind of compromise between countries like Greece and Italy that have borne the brunt of these arrivals ever since, that have wanted a redistribution either of the number of people arriving or of the cost of it.

The wind speeds are not so great. But the real threat from Biparjoy is when this moves on shore and into the very dry land that's there with very heavy rainfall. Some spots will pick up 250 to 500 millimeters of rainfall, that's anywhere between 8 and maybe even up to 16 inches of rain. There's the storm where it was, a meandering little storm, didn't wantto come on shore, finally did. The good news is because it took its sweet old time that this thing grabbed so much dry air from the deserts to the north that it lost a lot of intensity. A hurricane, cyclone, typhoon, they all want to be in warm water and they want to have humid air around them. Well, it didn't have the humid air, it was dry air that truly weakened the storm significantly. It is going to continue to move, it continue to weaken as it moves through, kind of the hilly areas here. And that's part of the problem. It's the hilly areas that will collect the rainfall in one or two spots and then all run downhill. So if you see this 250 to 500 millimeter rainfall totals here, here to some back over here, that's almost 12 inches of rainfall expected here in that white zone. That's where the freshwater -- the flash flood water will be collecting and also of course running off. That's the greatest risk right now. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Still, Ukrainian officials say they have been able to make some steady -- some steady progress rather in recent days since President Zelenskyy just about a week ago made that acknowledgement that this counteroffensive is underway.Ukrainian forces are focused on two particular directions towards the north, Bakhmut, of course, a city that's been a flashpoint for many months now. Ukrainian forces saying there, they've been able to push towards those Russian positions a few hundred meters and then south of Zaporizhzhia, where they are saying there is gradual but sure advancement of their troops. They say they've been able to take 100 square kilometers, that's about 39 square miles of liberated territory to the south of Zaporizhzhya. But as you mentioned, of course, Russia is not giving up easily. It has for months its troops been preparing for this counteroffensive. Satellite images will show you, and military analysts will tell you that Russian troops have been heavily fortifying their positions all along those very long front lines. And perhaps one of the most fortified areas is that area that is of most interest to Ukraine right now. And if you pull up a map to just look at those front lines, you can see that it is to the south of Zaporizhzhya. Of course, for Russia, this is critical. This is important because it is that area that connects that land bridge from Russian-occupied Crimea to the rest of those front lines. It is that vital supply route. It connects the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, to those Russian troops as well. They will not cede this territory easily. Again, satellite images show Russian troops have been putting in trenches, have been setting up anti-tank equipment, have been digging in mines. So yes, you are seeing a slow and gradual advance from Ukrainian forces, but that may very well be because they need to test those front lines, try to find weaknesses. Meanwhile, Russia's forces seem to be trying to pull or distract Ukrainian forces along other portions of that front line. They have been pushing back in Kharkiv and Donetsk, so engaging Ukrainian forces in other locations as well.

Significantly, this was the U.S.-South Korean joint military drills, the joint live fire drills, which had been billed as the largest ever. It was five separate days of these live fire drills. Today, this Thursday, was the end day, and it was more significant because President Yoon Suk-yeol of South Korea attended, and he said as commander-in-chief, he felt confident and satisfied with what he saw. So this appears to be what North Korea is reacting to at this point. Now, we went to cover one of those days earlier this month, and it was certainly larger than I have seen in many years. And it was also a more blatant message to North Korea. The scenario was that North Korea had staged what they called an illegal armed invasion, and the military drill that we've been saw was the U.S. and South Korean joint-reaction and counter to that invasion. So, certainly, the messaging couldn't have been clearer to Pyongyang and they did not appreciate it slamming the U.S. and South Korea for carrying out these drills. In fact, they have said this is the reason that they have carried out so many missile launches and weapons testing. Certainly we have seen a significant uptick in the past year and a half. And they also say that's the reason they carried out at the end of last month, an attempted satellite launch to put the military reconnaissance satellite into space. They didn't manage to do that, but they said they will try again as soon as possible. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Seoul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
