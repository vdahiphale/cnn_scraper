Welcome to THE GLOBAL BRIEF.Just ahead, millions of people in Ukraine are without power as Russia targets the country's energy network. CNN speaks to some of those injuring daily blackouts. Then, Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan speaks out after being shot in an attack that his party calls an assassination attempt. And he has one message. He will go back out on the streets again. And one week into the job, CEO of Twitter, Elon Musk, fires thousands of employees across the world via email. Well, there is an uneasy calm right now over the occupied Ukrainian city of Kherson. That's according to Russian appointed official. He says Russian forces, they are defending the city ahead of unexpected Ukrainian counteroffensive, which may be the most pivotal battle of the war so far. Ukrainian forces say they are making progress as they get closer, striking Russians supply lines and distribution centers. Meantime, Russia's president is telling his administration to evacuate civilians from Kherson, an act Ukraine calls a war crime. Here's what Mr. Putin says. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Now, of course, those who live in Kherson should be removed from zones of dangerous fighting, because the civilian population should not suffer from shelling, from any offensive, counteroffensive or other measures related to the military operations. Guys like you are doing everything to get people to the safe zone. Thank you very much. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It that are now being included for this forced mandatory civilian evacuation. Interestingly, some of those areas evacuated actually on the east side of that river, the other side from Kherson. And interestingly, around a very important dam that the Ukrainian forces have said. If they can get within shelling range of that than that can effectively bring an end to Russia's defense. Russia will know it is encircled and has to leave rapidly. Also, further north, along the Dnipro River, more civilians and forced from their homes. What we are going through social media is that groups like the Chechens are moving into those areas. So you have some dynamic military movements and these force movements out by civilians. But this evening, this afternoon in Kherson, the airport there on the northern side of the city was attacked. Now the Russian administrator of the city says that fighting is not going on but he believes Ukrainian troops are lined up in convoys ready to come. It is a confusing thing and we don't have accurate information. Ukraine's defense minister says, that they will take Kherson from the Russians forcibly. Not as a gift, and it will come at a cost. They said also the Russians are finding pressure now on their front lines because their trenches are the irrigation dishes in the area around this port city. And it has been raining. So those changes are filling with water making them unsafe and unusable. And then the dynamic and the forcefulness coming from President Putin about the evacuations signals that change is coming. And that is I think the picture in Kherson. It is cloudy, but change is coming.",
