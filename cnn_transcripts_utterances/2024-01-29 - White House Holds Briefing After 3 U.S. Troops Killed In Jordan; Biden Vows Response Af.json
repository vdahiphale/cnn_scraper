He says the volatile situation in the Middle East is fundamentally different now after a drone strike killed three American service members in Jordan.He confirmed that President Biden met twice with his national security team as they worked through different options to retaliate, though Kirby would not say explicitly which options are on the table, or even exactly who was behind the attack, though he did blame it on Iranian- backed militants. He did make clear that the United States does not want war with Iran, though he said he would not be telegraphing punches for President Biden. Any response, he said, will be cognizant of the fact that these Tehran-backed militias took American life. We want to go to CNN's Natasha Bertrand, who's live for us at the Pentagon as we continue to monitor these comments. Natasha, Kirby also expressed confidence that the Pentagon would be able to execute any kind of response. What are you hearing there?",

However, understandably and unsurprisingly, Kirby did not want to telegraph what the U.S. was preparing to do.He was pressed multiple times on whether the U.S. was prepared to strike inside Iran, which is what many Republican lawmakers have been calling for over the last day or so. And he, as well as Pentagon officials here in the building, they continue to say, look, we're not taking any options off the table here, but we will decide when and where to respond at the time and place of our choosing, something that they have said many times before and in previous strikes on U.S. -- on Iran-backed militias in the -- in Iraq and Syria. You know, the U.S. has degraded Iranian weapons capabilities, according to Kirby there. He stood by the U.S. assessment that those previous strikes on these Iran-backed militias have been effective here. But the question remains of what kind of response the U.S. now needs to engage in order to deter these groups from continuing to launch these drone attacks, which of course have continued even over the weekend. There were an additional six attacks, including the one that we saw on that base in Northeast Jordan that ultimately killed those three U.S. Army soldiers. So what is it going to take here to actually deter them for good in a way that really destroys their capabilities, deters them, degrades them in a way that they cannot repeat this kind of attack.

It was set up in a way so that it could support logistically the mission at other bases, such as the one in Syria, which is right across the border at Al-Tanf.

It's not a new phenomenon, as you heard John Kirby going through, even if this is the first fatal one that we have seen since October 7th.DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: That's right, Brianna. And what we heard from the administration for the past couple of weeks was that these mounting attacks were sooner or later going to result in a death. They were been lucky 160 times roughly and got very unlucky on Sunday. The question is, how has this changed the picture the way you heard from John Kirby there before during the White House briefing. And the answer is that it forces the president's hand to react much more strongly than he has when there were just some light injuries or no injuries at all. And now the question is, how does he do that? And his choices range from the unsatisfying, which is to say, hit the proxies again, although right now, there's still a little bit of doubt about which proxy have launched this attack and from where. And the other option is to go right after the source of their funds and their arms, and that's Iran. That's what you're hearing a lot from the Republicans.

And of course, at the height of the war, it was closer to 100,000.So, and some of those Americans are leaving. Others are there at the request of various countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, as you heard, Bahrain, where the Fifth Fleet is, and so forth. So there's mixed view about whether or not the United States should maintain a presence. The second, I think, and critical point, which Cedric was getting at here, is that these groups don't all have exactly the same set of interests. They all might want to see the United States out. They might want to see the United States humiliated. But each one of them has their own domestic politics, and Iran's politics are the most complicated of all. They're in a succession struggle now for their Supreme Leader, who's aging and not in good health. There's always a struggle between the Islamic Republican Guard and other elements in Iran. And I think President Biden's pretty hesitant right now to get into the midst of that, especially because we don't understand that dynamic terribly well, and we don't understand whether the Iranians actually ordered this attack.

And I just want to say my heart goes out to the injured service members and of course to the families of those who lost their lives. Traumatic brain injury, TBI, is the most common injury that affects our service men and women, and particularly those that are stationed overseas. It's the result of generally concussive forces to the head that occur in the setting of a blast. And it's an umbrella term. The symptoms can range from what we see with mild concussion, which might just be, you know, some headache and dizziness all the way to severe injury, paralysis, even death in some cases. The critical thing is that they don't -- some of these symptoms don't appear the moment the injury is sustained. And that's why this injury number is going to keep going up as people realize in the next few days, as our servicemen and women realize in the next few days that they're still having symptoms, nausea, headache, difficulty with vision or brain fog that aren't clearing up on their own.",

And I should point out, this can persist for weeks, it can persist for months. And of course there's psychological effects as well.

As of just seconds ago, he posted on social media saying that a border bill is not necessary. Right now, a key negotiator says that lawmakers are finishing up the text of the bill, and that it could be ready to hit the Senate floor in the coming days.Now, this proposed compromise would allow the president to shut down the border between ports of entry when unlawful crossings reach a certain point. President Biden is urging lawmakers to pass the deal, calling it the toughest set of immigration reforms yet. And the deal's lead Republican negotiator, Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma, calls it, quote, \"By far the most conservative border security bill in four decades.\" Let's discuss with Republican congressman from Texas, August Pfluger. Congressman, thank you so much for being with us. We should note he is a member of the House Homeland Security Committee. Obviously, this bill goes through a lot. It makes it much more difficult to qualify for asylum. It expedites deportations, increases the number of Border Patrol agents, and as I noted, it allows the president to shut down the border as a circuit breaker, a failsafe if there is a surge, which President Biden said he would do if it passes. What's your response to this bill? What are your specific reservations about it? REP. AUGUST PFLUGER (R-TX): Well, I haven't publicly said anything. By the way, thank you for having me. We haven't seen the bill text. I have a lot of respect for Senator James Lankford, a man of integrity and character, and somebody who understands the tragedy of this situation. But let's start with the facts here. I mean, for three years we have had a wide open border, and it's causing every community, including mine, and all 50 states just tragic results. 8 million people in, 300 people who matched the terror watch list, 50 this year who matched the terror watch list, 100,000 fentanyl deaths. So my question for the administration and for Secretary Mayorkas is why have you not done anything so far? In fact, since President Biden took office, not a single law has actually changed. The only thing that has changed is their implementation, their guidance to DHS, Border Patrol, ICE, and other agencies. So it's time for them to shut down the border. And we have asked them year after year since they took office to do just that. And it hasn't happened and we're really in a tragic situation right now.",
