More than 50 tornadoes have been reported in seven States, at least 12 of those tornadoes were reported in Arkansas. A State of Emergency is in place in the hardest hit areas including Wynne, the devastated Arkansas town that you're seeing right there. CNN's Derek Van Dam is with the latest from Arkansas.",

Look at the incredible damage in front of that building.Just in front of us here we have electrical poles light poles trees completely snapped off. Behind us, we've got the Wynne High School. I managed to capture a very powerful moment when a gentleman was walking through the parking lot with an American flag draped over his shoulders, and he told me that he had found it several hundred yards behind the structure, the high school and it had been blown off of the flag poles there. So he wanted to hoist it back up in a sign of unity, and a sign of determination that Wynne, Arkansas will rebuild, they will stand tall through this devastation. Look at this building behind me, a business. You can see the X's there, that is from the first responders going to door-to-door to confirm that there are no people trapped inside. And we've got the familiar sounds of a disaster zone. The sounds of chainsaws, the sounds of sirens coming from the ambulances that continue to race by. We have utility trucks that have been moving throughout this area. You can see the Bobcats here. There was larger construction vehicles pushing some of this debris out of the way. This is the scene in Wynne, Arkansas where the devastating tornado came through this area Friday evening terrifying residents. It was over before a few moments, but it left this amount of damage in its path. Jim, back to you.",

The morale of the people is positive that we're going to rebuild, we're going to come out stronger on the other side of this. We have a very well-staffed Command Center. We've had several emergency personnel and volunteers show up to our community and they've been working to get the areas, the roads passable, so that we can do the door-to-door search and check on all of our citizens.

We feel like we've canvassed the area of the storm two to three times in most areas. I feel confident that we can say that search and rescue is over. So we'll start regrouping tomorrow and start trying to get that community cleared up and can get volunteers in to help us start to do that. We do have a donation center set up at 187 Murray Avenue, and they have a Facebook page set up for Wynne Tornado Distribution Center, and we've been amazed at the outpouring of people who have sent donations today due to the power outages and things. We haven't got a bank account set up yet, but we'll be doing that first thing Monday morning and pushing that out through Facebook. We've had many requests to send in donations. We have a lot of families that are completely devastated, have no homes at all to go to, no belongings survived, so we will have to help these families, and we will need all the help that we can get.

One person was killed and 28 others were rushed to the hospital with injuries. Two hundred and sixty people were inside the venue when the roof came crashing down. Three days ahead of his expected surrender to authorities in New York City, advisers and allies of Donald Trump are warning that there is no way the former President can get a fair trial on criminal charges in Manhattan. At this point, we don't even know what the DA is charging Trump with, let alone if the case will ultimately go all the way through a trial process. But it is obvious, Trump supporters have concerns if things move forward and CNN's Kristen Holmes joins me now from outside Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago. Kristen, what about this idea of trying to, you know, request a change of venue? I suppose Trump's lawyers when they get into the Courtroom, they may try all sorts of things on behalf of their client, but what about that one?",

They were talking specifically about the makeup of a jury, talking about how the makeup of New York -- excuse me -- of Manhattan specifically, is almost all Democratic. It is obviously a very blue borough. Talking to advisers, they just don't believe it's possible that he would get a fair trial there. But as you know, we are miles away from that potential trial. We have to actually see those charges first. And I will note, you know, I've been talking to sources around Trump the last several days, and it appears that he is incredibly focused and calm. He has spent the last 24 hours on the phone talking to not just his allies on Capitol Hill, as we've previously reported, but allies across the country talking about how he believes this is unfair, and promoting his narrative that this is all a political hoax. And I've spoken to some of these people who have had conversations with the former President in the last 48 hours, who say that they were actually surprised with how calm he is when he is discussing that he really believes that he can beat these charges. And as you say, a lot of this is going to end up being in the hands of the lawyers as they try to figure out how exactly, they are going to proceed. But none of that can be done until they actually see this indictment, until they actually go through those public charges.",

We have seen that police presence increase and it will continue throughout the weekend just outside of the Court facilities behind me, which is what will house those highly watched proceedings come Tuesday when Donald Trump is expected to travel here in New York City and face those charges that we learned about on Thursday.This will present a major logistical and certainly security consideration. So let's get to those first, what we have seen, not only that increased police presence, we have also seen temporary floodlights that the NYPD has set up around the building you see behind me. Also, temporary cameras, and that also what's not easily seen, the behind-the-scenes Intelligence gathering that officials have been monitoring online, social media chatter, for example, to see any potential protests, though we should make very clear that NYPD has not identified any credible threats. We do know that in New York Governor, Kathy Hochul has reached out to city officials and said that there are plenty of State resources that are available, when and if those are in fact needed. But in terms of the logistics, and we heard about that just a little while ago, Jim, this is going to be what should be a fairly normal process for any defendant, but when that defendant is the former Commander-in-Chief, it certainly will be unprecedented. As our colleague, John Miller has reported, the booking process will likely be modified as former President Trump is expected to come here, will meet with officials, will officially face those charges, and so that is coming up on Tuesday, Jim.

We also are told that it is quite possible that he will do it in the full view of cameras, though, all of that is yet to be seen, but it will be a highly rehearsed and practiced and planned dance that we do expect come Tuesday whenever the former Commander-in-Chief travels here in New York City -- Jim.",

So the north part of Manhattan had 43 murders last year, about the same pace earlier this year. That North Manhattan region had 379 murders in 1990, almost 10 times as many. Now the south part of Manhattan had 35 murders last year, is doing better so far this year versus 124 murders in 1990, not even close to a record. Now, every kind of violent crime in Manhattan is way down from the record high in this kind of massive fashion. There was an uptick in many kinds of crime in Manhattan last year, 2022 compare to 2021, but many of these categories like shooting incidents have come back down significantly in the first part of this year. Now, Jim, some Republicans are making an even broader claim that New York is experiencing record crime.

Both of them have pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter. CNN has learn seven CDC investigators who were studying the health impacts of the East Palestine toxic train derailment, briefly fell ill themselves in early March. They were doing house to house surveys near the derailment site where hazardous chemicals were released into the air, water and soil. And CNN's Jason Carroll has the details. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, this latest information about the CDC investigators only came to light after a member of CNN's health team saw posts on social media and checked with a government source about what had happened. According to the CDC, seven government investigators did fall ill in early March. They were part of a 15-member team sent there to conduct what is called an assessment of chemical exposure or an ace investigation.They went door to door in the area near the derailment when apparently seven members of the team said they started feeling sick. Their symptoms included sore throats, headaches, coughing and nausea. These, of course, are some of the same symptoms that residents, first responders and rail workers had complained about. When the CDC - when CNN asked the CDC about the investigators, a spokesperson said the symptoms resolved for most team members later the same afternoon and everyone resumed work on the survey data collection within 24 hours. Impacted team members have not reported ongoing health effects. It's unclear what caused their symptoms. The other eight team members did not report any symptoms. The EPA has repeatedly said that the air and the water in East Palestine are safe. Government officials have also repeatedly said they want all aspects of their investigations to be transparent. So in the spirit of transparency, it's just not clear at this point why that information about the investigators would not - was not released to the public at the time, especially when you consider residents there had been complaining of the same symptoms.
