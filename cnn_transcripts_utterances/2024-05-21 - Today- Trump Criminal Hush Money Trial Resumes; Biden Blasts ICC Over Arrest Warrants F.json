This comes after an explosive Monday in court. Former Trump fixer, Michael Cohen, admitting to stealing thousands of dollars from the Trump Organization. Another hit to the credibility of the prosecution's key witness. Plus, a dramatic exchange between Judge Juan Merchan and a defense witness. Robert Costello acted as a legal adviser to Cohen after the FBI searched his home and office, Cohen's home and office. He complained, Costello complained when the judge sustained an objection to a question he was being asked. The judge warning, Costello, quote, when there's a witness on the stand, if you don't like my ruling, you don't say, \"Jeez\", okay? And then you don't say strike it, because I am the only one that can strike testimony in the courtroom. And then if you don't like my ruling, you don't give me side eye and you don't roll your eyes. After court ended for the day, Trump made his now standard complaints about the case and the judge and he added this.

I think that's -- part of the issue here is the optics, the way that they've been put into the same ruling, if you like.

But the ICC, of course, we should point out, isn't anywhere near actually issuing a warrant or indeed finding any of the people here actually guilty.

A bombshell revelation from Michael Cohen as he wraps nearly 17 hours of testimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial. Cohen admitting he stole tens of thousands of dollars from the Trump Organization. That led Trump attorney Todd Blanche to ask: So you stole from the Trump organization? Cohen responding: Yes, sir. On the redirect examination with the prosecution, Cohen explained he did so because his annual bonus had been slashed, saying quote, to have my bonus cut by two-thirds was very upsetting to say the least, I just felt it was almost like self-help. Trump's son, Eric, weighed in. He posted this in real time, quote, this just got interesting. Michael Cohen is now admitting to stealing money from our company. Let's bring in former January 6 investigative counsel Marcus Childress. Marcus, good morning. Quite a day in court yesterday. This admission from Michael Cohen, and I guess my first thought was, oh man, its getting himself in trouble by admitting this. It sounds like the statute of limitations means that that's no longer the case. But were you surprised that he was as clear as he was and saying I stole from the Trump Organization. And what impact do you think it has with the jury? MARCUS CHILDRESS, ATTORNEY, JENNER &amp; BLOCK LLP:  Not surprised at all, actually, because it came out on direct. This has already come out already. And if we saw one thing that was consists about Michael Cohen was that he was comfortable with his lies. He was comfortable with his past acts. He kind of owned it, which is actually was a wildcard going into this direct examination was whether Michael Cohen's going to keep his cool and own his past acts. And I think he completed his testimony without blowing up on the defense or trying to minimize his prior conduct. And I think that might give him, in a weird way, credibility with the jury? Well, we'll see.",

And then there's an approach that we saw from Blanche over the past couple of days where you're throwing out lots of theories and kind of drilling a witness on every lie, every ms de that they might have done because you don't know what's going to stick, right?And so what I took from the cross-examination is that they're looking for one jury that they can one juror like in hanging their hat on one of the pieces of cross to maybe hold out and get a hung jury whereas when you see the tighter crosses, you're looking for an acquittal because you know that your case is strong to maybe get an acquittal. And so that's the way I look at this longer, more meandering type cross style.",
