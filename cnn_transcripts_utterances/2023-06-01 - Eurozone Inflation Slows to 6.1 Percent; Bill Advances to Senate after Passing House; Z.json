EU inflation slows, but policymakers say the fight against rising prices is certainly not yet over. And fuel prices soar in Nigeria as the government abruptly ends subsidies. And are airplane seats too small? Two US senators think so, and they want to do something about it. Coming to you live from New York, it is Thursday, June 1st. I'm Zain Asher, in for my colleague, Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, inflation in Europe has slowed to its lowest level since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Prices in the Eurozone rose by 6.1 percent in May, that is down from seven percent the previous month. That is good news for the European Central Bank, which has raised interest rates nearly 400 basis points since last year. The ECB president, Christine Lagarde said Thursday, the bank still has ground to cover. Anna Stewart has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Prices are still rising in the Eurozone, but month-on-month, they are heading in the right direction. With the fall ininflation across a broad range of categories, food inflation dropped by one percentage point in May compared to April, although it remains high at 12.5 percent and at this early stage, it is unlikely households and consumers across the block are feeling much benefit from this improvement. While the glimmer of good news caused some economists to question whether the European Central Bank might ease up on its rate hikes, the general consensus is there will be a rate rise this month and another to come this year, not least after ECB president, Christine Lagarde spoke about the bank's determination to bring inflation down to two percent. In a speech in Hannover, Thursday, adding, we've made clear that we still have ground to cover to bring interest rates to sufficiently restricted levels. One of the headwinds for the ECB is wage growth in the Eurozone. Unsurprisingly, given just how costly life has become, thanks to inflation, workers have demanded higher wages. Wage growth in the Eurozone was 5.1 percent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2022, now, that is not enough to offset the cost of living, but it does contribute to inflation. So the ECB will no doubt be watching that indicator as well as CPI before considering a new phase for interest rates. Anna Stewart, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He joins us live now from Frankfurt. So just in terms of overall the picture here, 6.1 percent in terms of the headline number for inflation, that's certainly better than what it was.

So inflation has been down trending for a while. The Russian energy crisis or the Ukraine crisis, that impact is fading. Food inflation, you mentioned that was actually the big surprise this time around that it came down a bit more than we had expected. Goods, the supply chain disruptions of the pandemic, that's over and the Euro has recovered a little bit. So on that side, we're also expecting a downturn. The big unknown is when is services really going to -- services inflation really going to peak? It came down this month, but that was probably because of the statistical quirk around German train tickets, but if you account for that, it probably was still rising.

Butmore importantly, of course, the energy crisis last year, that is starting to fade. What is level of inflation, what we observe in services is partly just the echo effect of that, but partly also, the fact that wages are responding to the high inflation. As you mentioned in your opening piece, with a lag, eventually, that should fade, but it's already kind of baked in the cake that wage growth is going to stay above five percent all year and probably well into next year. The labor market is very resilient. That means workers feel comfortable demanding higher wages, companies aren't going to immediately fire them as long as the economy holds up and that is going to keep that process going for a while, and we also have to keep in mind that higher wages, strong jobs growth means people have more money in their pocket. And now that inflation is coming down, it actually buys them stuff, too, so real purchasing power is starting to recover and that should keep consumption going despite ECB rate hikes and that is making it difficult for the ECB to cool the economy.",

They have just been posting on their social media images of them driving around in armored personnel carriers and some skirmishing, but it is impossible to locate those images properly, because there is no signage or any kind of geographical locators. But what we do know is that the Russians have said that eight civilians have been injured. We've seen there has been a strike in the town of Belgorod City itself, eight civilians injured in the -- what are now effectively frontline towns close to the border and 200 families evacuated, a number of hundred women and children on top of those to a number of safer locations away from these border areas. And that means that the Ukrainians are having an effect, whatever the scale of these incursions, whatever the scale of the bombardment that is attributed to the Ukrainians in support of these incursions, they are clearly having an effect by the admission of the Russians, that they are having to move civilians out of the area, and this now has been going on for more than a week.",

So for example, the missiles that were fired this morning at three o'clock in the morning that killed three people, two women, and a nine-year-old girl, a mother and daughter were killed in that raid.

The bank isfacing lawsuits brought by a victim of Epstein and by the attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Jamie Dimon sat for an eight-hour long deposition last Friday. CNN obtained a redacted transcript in terms of what he said. Matt Egan is in New York for us. Jamie Dimon basically saying that, before Jeffrey Epstein's arrest, before his name was all over the newspapers, he had never even heard of him. Walk us through what came out of the deposition.",

      "sentences": "During that eight-hour deposition, Jamie Dimon, he denied ever having met with or spoken on the phone withJeffrey Epstein. Let me run you through the timeline. Epstein was a client from 1998 to 2013. During that time, Epstein was indicted on a prostitution charge in 2006 involving a minor. He pled guilty. Then, in 2019 he was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges. He died by suicide while detained. Jamie Dimon says he was not really aware of Epstein's criminal history and relationship with the bank until after the 2019 news broke. These lawsuits allege that people at Chase knew about the sex trafficking allegations against Epstein but still did business with him. In a statement to CNN, the spokesperson said that, \"Had the firm believed he was engaged in an ongoing sex trafficking of operation, Epstein would not have been retained as a client. In hindsight, we regret he was a client.\" Dimon did acknowledge that he is now aware that some JPMorgan employees knew Epstein was charged with sex crimes involving cash and that he was moving large amounts of cash in his accounts in 2007. We should note, JPMorgan has sued a former banker, known to be a friend of Epstein, alleging that he is to blame for the bank's 15-year relationship with Epstein. Still, he has denied all wrongdoing.",

Passengers had around 89 centimeters -- 35 inches -- of leg room. Now get this, it's under 79 centimeters. That's actually average. Some airlines actually have seats smaller than that in terms of leg room. Advocacy groups, flyers rights, say that some seats are as short as 71 centimeters. Since the '60s, we have actually gotten bigger. Two Democratic senators want the U.S. airline regulator, the FAA, to take a look at seat sizes again. They say it's becoming a safety issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): It is very much long overdue. The standard that the FAA is using was set in the 1960s. And the fact is that air travel has changed a lot since the '60s. There are a lot of folks on board, would carry on luggage, because we can't -- many people can't check their luggage anymore because there's additional fees. The FAA does not test -- do these tests where they include carry-on luggage. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
