Inflation remains way too high. If you look at the Feds preferred inflation metric, it shows that, yes, price gains have cooled off over the past nine months.

And that did not sit well with Wall Street.Markets were very little change before Powell started speaking, but by the end of the day, they closed down big. Now for Main Street, all of this, of course, means higher borrowing costs, mortgage rates, they're already creeping closer to 7 percent again.

They test substances to know what exactly they are seizing. It shows it here, it's a breakdown of what the chemical is and what makes it happen. He even has here listed the hazmat component to it. Crucial in understanding how fentanyl is made is knowing where the chemicals are sourced. A lot of them he says come from the port, which came in from Asia. High-ranking military officials have told us, most of them come from China.
