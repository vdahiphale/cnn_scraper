We caught them with 2,600 votes. No, we caught them cold -- 2,600 -- and every vote was written by the same person. Ha, ha -- I wonder how that happened. It must be a coincidence.

Can you talk to us a little bit about what you saw on the ground, what that crowd was like? And there was a lot of discussion about what might happen around outside it. Allentown a majority Latino city now. It just -- what did you see? SABRINA RODRIGUEZ, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, Kasie, it was -- it was sort of what we were expecting. We knew there would be some type of protest presence outside of it. Out of an abundance of caution the mayor of Allentown and the school district decided to cancel school. So there was some concerns about what exactly could transpire just given that in this majority Latino city where there are thousands of Puerto Ricans there could be some type of tension coming to head. It was a peaceful protest. I mean, there was dozens of protesters, mostly Puerto Rican, that were coming out and denouncing Donald Trump. There was a lot of signs and Puerto Rican flags. People yelling \"Donald Trump (INAUDIBLE).\" Signs that were saying the garbage will be taken out on November 5 and criticism of Trump and his supporters. But really -- I mean, what you saw as well was there were some Puerto Ricans from Allentown that were in the crowd. I talked to several who were offended by the joke. There was one man I met that was notable because he has a big Puerto Rican flag on his arm and talked about how much he loves his island. But at the end of the day he was focused on the issues that he thought that Donald Trump could address on the economy and on immigration. So we really saw the Trump campaign really lean into this situation and make all the opening speakers Latinos speaking -- covering their speeches in Spanish and talking about their support for Puerto Ricans and for Latinos that they see from Donald Trump.",

MAYOR EDDIE MORAN, (D) READING, PENNSYLVANIA (via Webex by Cisco): Certainly not. I mean, first of all, it was just a bunch of bull that he was saying that he has done so much for Puerto Rico. Yeah, he's thrown paper towels at Puerto Rico. He has allowed to -- a community to be demeaned. He has allowed a so-called comedian to hurl insults at us. You know, when he says that he don't know who he is, he don't know who put him there, well look, I've been to plenty of rallies and I'm always vested of what I'm about to say.
