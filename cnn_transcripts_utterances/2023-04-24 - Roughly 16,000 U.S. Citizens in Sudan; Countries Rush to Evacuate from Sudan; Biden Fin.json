On President Biden's order, and under the cover of darkness, U.S. special ops flew into the war-torn capital city. The troops were on the ground less than one hour before airlifting nearly 100 U.S. diplomats, staff and their family members out. At this hour, roughly 16,000 Americans remain in Sudan. Most of them hold dual citizenship.

One of the kind of - I would venture a very rare gathering of the elite troops from around the world from countries from South Korea and Japan, all the way to the United States of America, Europe, British SAS have been on the ground here. Part of the evacuation that they organized yesterday involved an 18 kilometer move by British troops guarding a group of 100 plus Britain's and others. When the British ran that - an evacuation by air out of an air base on the outskirts of Khartoum, a less problematic evacuation in some ways because they were able to land fixed wing aircraft, unlike the Americans who went in with helicopters. But in both cases, the level of fighting now makes it extremely difficult for people to get aircraft in. There are attempts ongoing. It's quite difficult, frankly, to keep track with how many people from different countries are being moved because there are so many different countries involved.The French and Germans have recently landed back in their home territories with people that they have evacuated. The Egyptians are moving people over land. Uganda has got 300 people on the move in a bus convoy heading to the Ethiopian border. All of this going on, of course, when the Sudanese themselves overwhelmingly are trapped. Alongside, of course, those estimated perhaps 16,000 Americans and international contributors to Sudan in particular, aid workers, scattered throughout the country. This -- the focus of the fighting is in Khartoum, but it is country- wide. And that is posing very serious problems. Now, there's a lot of effort going into looking at Port Sudan as a possible exit point for people who are being evacuated, but as we heard earlier on, the effort of getting there is going to be left largely to individuals. The Emirates have also been trying to organize convoys, but there's no armed escort of an international organization for an army effectively for civilians to get out to Port Sudan, and there is a catastrophic shortage of fuel, water, food and, of course, the vehicles are in short supply amidst all of this chaos.

They gained power during the bloody conflict in Darfur nearly two decades ago. Some 300,000 people were killed in that conflict. Nearly 2.5 million people were displaced in the violence. In 2019, they worked together to topple ousted Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. He was behind a campaign of ethnic cleansing in the country's Darfur region. And just two years ago they played a pivotal role in a military coup. That's where things began to get complicated. The coup ended with what was supposed to be a power sharing agreement, a deal between military and civilian groups. But tensions began to rise over who would be the subordinate in that new hierarchy. Sources tell CNN that these hostilities led to the fighting that you're seeing on the ground today. John.",

One of those key items is who exactly would be running the day-to-day operation. And Democratic sources have told us that the president is expected to name Julie Chavez Rodriguez as the campaign manager. Rodriguez is one of the most senior aides here at the White House, serving as the director of the White House's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. That means she coordinates and works with state and local officials in trying to implement the president's agenda. She's also -- had been promoted to a senior advisor just last summer and she's long been known in Democratic political operative circles and is also the granddaughter of the labor icon Cesar Chavez. Now, Rodriguez would be expected one named, and once this campaign rolls out, she'd expect to be working hand in hand with so many of those senior advisers here at the White House who have been sketching out what this campaign would look like.
