It's just another indictment, another reminder of his growing legal troubles that he is facing, and he is talking online about how they're benefiting him politically, but they are weighing on him, Anderson, and he had this dejected look on his face as he got out of the motorcade to go back to the airport, to go back to New Jersey.

This includes conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, which is a maximum of 20 years; obstruction of an official proceeding, maximum of 20 years; conspiracy against rights, meaning his ability or his attempt to take away the voting rights or the rights of individuals to have their votes counted, that's 10 years.

He has not been subjected to a mug shot in either this case or the case in southern Florida as far as we know. It's questionable as to whether or not he was fingerprinted today as part of his processing. There is an argument to be made that well, he is so well known that it is not necessary to have this identifying information, but released on your own recognizance when you have the ability to hop on your own 757 at any minute and go pretty much anywhere in the globe you want to go.

You don't have to commit to exactly what you're going to do, but if you were to put on a defense, how much time do you think it would be?

Those are essentially the allegations. But what was interesting, of course, in the case involving my former opponent was really the timing, because it reminds me a lot of Donald Trump. You know, you look at the timing of when these alleged acts occur, and then shortly thereafter, he makes an announcement he's running to be the Michigan attorney general.

And so, yes, I think it is possible. A lot will depend, of course, with respect to what Donald Trump's lawyers were able to do in terms of slowing down the process. But I think there will be every effort by this judge to make sure that that happens. I think that's important for the American people.",

And then at the end of the day, you know, how is Donald Trump going to respond to that? If he does, I'm assuming he won't take the stand. So it's really puzzling to me how that's going to play out with respect to the defense. Of course, the burden is on the prosecution. There's no question about that. But I think Jack Smith has done a pretty good job laying out the evidence here. And I think, as Attorney General Barr indicated, I think there is more that Jack Smith has that's going to be presented at trial. And the question is, how -- what is the defense going to be? Donald Trump, it seems to me, will be the most -- the best witness in his defense. But are you really going to put him on the stand? I wouldn't put him on the stand. So, you know, there's a lot of unanswered questions here, but I guess the short answer to your question is, I think, this is a strong case. And but it's not going to be a slam dunk by any stretch of the imagination. We've got a good story here. We've got a strong prosecutor, but President Trump's going to have good representation and see what happens.",

On the other hand, there is a sense of satisfaction, I think, among all the members, that the hard work we put in and that the evidence we uncovered really provided a roadmap for the Department of Justice to bring justice to this case, to charge the ex-president with the crimes that we said he committed.
