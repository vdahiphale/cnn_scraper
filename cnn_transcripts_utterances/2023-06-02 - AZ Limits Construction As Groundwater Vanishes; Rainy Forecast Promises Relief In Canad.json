Arizona officials say they will no longer grant construction permits for new developments within the Phoenix area.Phoenix has been booming and groundwater there is rapidly vanishing after years of overuse as well as drought, driven by climate change. The new restrictions are driven by a new state law designed to ensure an adequate water supply for the next century. CNN's Stephanie Elam joins us now. Stephanie, this is a big deal. We've heard for some time about the water shortage there but to stop all new construction. I wonder how folks and Phoenix businesses, residents, et cetera, are receiving this.",

It's a big of a playing card for much of the southwest as we deal with this human-induced climate change that we are living in.I know for much of the time that I've talked to you over the last few months, I was showing you the amounts of snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. But guess what? A lot of the water that Arizona uses, California, too, comes from the Colorado River. And they just negotiated a new deal to cut back on how much water they're going to be using. That's surface water, right? But you're looking at the groundwater, and that is what they are specifically targeting in the Phoenix metro area because of the fact there's just not enough groundwater. In fact, they say that 4 percent of groundwater demand will not be able to be met over the next 100 years. That's why they're making this decision. In fact, take a listen to Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs on this issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATIE HOBBS (D-AZ): That's why, as required by law, we will pause approvals of new assured water supply determinations that rely on pumping groundwater, ensuring that we don't add to any future deficit.

Obviously, the implications are huge but when you are growing in the desert, where there isn't enough water and in parts of the state where they can just use as much groundwater as they want, they have to start making decisions.

The owner of this surveillance camera shared this video with us.It shows what happens in the nine minutes or so leading up to this partial collapse. The video does cut off somewhat abruptly when the building starts to collapse. The owner of the video tells us that's because the power was knocked out when all of this happened. If you look at the video, you will notice there are five support braces leaning up against the building. The one closer to the camera, from your vantage point, probably at the bottom of your screen there, gradually bends, leading up to the collapse. We're not saying that's what caused the collapse, but over the course of these nine minutes, you can see it gradually bending. Now, two minutes before the collapse, a large chunk of bricks starts falling. You can see this on the video. And that's underneath what appears to be a second-floor window. A lower portion of the wall also crumbles. And soon after, you see the collapse. That support brace that was closest to the camera, right before the initial collapse, it starts bending at a much faster rate. As we've been telling you, three people who lived at this building are still missing. Crews are continuing their search. They have used canines, as well as infrared cameras, as well as what they call forensic drones. Members of the search-and-rescue team went back inside the building to see if they were able to find signs of human survivors. They were able to rescue some pets.

Forensic experts are now working to determine the exact number of victims, and also their identities. We are following a developing story out of India. Two passenger trains and a goods train collided in the eastern part of the country. Officials do not yet know the death toll here. They say 50, perhaps 50 people are dead. They call it a violent train accident. Rescuers are now on the scene, including more than 50 ambulances. Finally, Yellowstone National Park is asking visitors to drive carefully and follow safety regulations after several reports of wild animals being killed by cars and endangers in other ways by visitors. Just weeks ago, a newborn bison had to be euthanized after a tourist pulled the struggling calf from a river up onto a roadway. You see the picture there.

These were the most common form of breast cancer, which is known an HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer in the early stages of the disease.What they looked at is that they could prevent the cancer from recurring after patients have received initial treatment. They found that when they added this drug, known as Kisqali, to the existing treatment, typically hormone therapy, reduced the risk of the cancer recurrence by 25 percent. If you look at the data another way, when they went out to three years, the survival rate without the disease progressing was 90 percent with the drug compared to 87 percent without it. And when you think about the thousands of patients with breast cancer in the U.S., that is really quite significant. The catch here, Boris, might be the price of this drug. Novartis, the maker of it, says it can cost $6,000 to $15,000 a month per patient before insurance. So this can really start to add up in terms of costs.",

So this could dramatically improve quality of life. Also, we're showing you some statics, 600,000 cases of cervical cancer every year, 350,000 deaths.
