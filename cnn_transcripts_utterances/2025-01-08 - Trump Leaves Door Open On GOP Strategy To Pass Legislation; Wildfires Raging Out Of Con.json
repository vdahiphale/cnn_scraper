But if two is more certain it does go a little bit quicker because you can do the immigration stuff early, but it goes through the House first.

We know it because it's been proven in court over and over again.I have an incomplete list here. Rioter Mark Mazza brought two loaded handguns onto Capitol grounds. He pleaded guilty and he got five years in prison. Guy Reffitt was convicted for bringing a handgun to the Capitol and got more than seven years. Christopher Alberts also had a pistol on Capitol grounds. Found guilty and got seven years. And the list goes on. Mario Mares had a gun that day -- guilty. Roger Preacher had a gun that day -- guilty. Jerod Bargar had a gun that day -- guilty. And a man named John Banuelos has been charged for allegedly twice firing a pistol in the air -- so using a gun on Capitol grounds during the riot. He has pleaded not guilty. So we will likely never get a complete inventory of the guns carried by rioters that day because as we know most of them were able to leave before later being tracked down and arrested. But we know for a fact -- again, proven in court -- there were guns in that angry and violent crowd. BOLDUAN:  Another topic -- another major foreign policy issue that the president-elect will be facing and has talked a lot about is what to do about Ukraine and U.S. support for Ukraine. Will it sustain? Will it change? What will happen is a big question mark.

MAYOR PRO TEM (via Webex by Cisco):  It's as bad as we've ever seen with regard to fires certainly here in the city of Los Angeles but certainly in Southern California as well. Unfortunately global warming and lots of other factors have made it so that we have big fires every year. Having three big fires at once and a situation where we can't even use aircraft to dump water on the fires is unprecedented. Fourteen hundred firefighters out on the street and literally tens of thousands of other city workers, whether they're working on power poles, directing traffic, cleaning up debris off of roads so folks can come and go and evacuate where necessary.

HARRIS-DAWSON:  You know, there are -- look, it's been night so our ability to investigate is limited. But we have -- do not have a reported fatality. We have one serious injury of a firefighter that we know of. Again, obviously when morning comes we'll be able to look more, and we'll see more. But folks have done really well. The first responders have done really well protecting themselves and protecting people and property. They've done several rescues.

I was at the Pacific Palisades before nightfall. You couldn't -- visibility was less than 15 feet away and the wind was so strong that you couldn't fly aircraft, and it was difficult to even operate an automobile at a very slow speed. That's absolutely terrifying. This is not to mention the heat that you're experiencing and the intermittent blasts that you hear because one tank is exploding somewhere in a neighborhood that you can't necessarily see. Also, embers. Embers can fly up to a mile. They are incredibly buoyant. So you may be in an area that you think is not a fire area that may suddenly become a fire area because of the embers. So it is an absolutely unnerving and terrifying situation to be in. At the same time there are no better people in the world that work on these kinds of emergencies than the ones who are out on the streets tonight. I know you have Marybel in the field.

Given that the weather service has been warning of the extreme danger of what has now happened -- has been warning for days that this could be coming -- and in doing so, putting you in the position of -- I'm very thankful you're here -- a position of serving as acting mayor in this critical time as she traveled back. Should she have been in L.A.? Should the mayor have been there? HARRIS-DAWSON:  You know, absolutely not. I mean, I think the mayor would answer that question differently. Of course, she would want to -- want to be here. She was on a diplomatic mission and left and was already in the air by the time the reports came out and is getting back as fast as she can. That said, she's been in constant communication with me, in constant communication with the head of our fire department, police department, the county government, the state government, President Biden. Oddly enough President Biden actually is in Southern California. He had an event that had to be canceled because of the fires this weekend. And so she -- Mayor Bass is mayoring, as the young people say, in a big way. She is not physically here but her presence is deeply felt.

Is it going to allow the release of this report by the Justice Department? The plan though, Kate, was that this report was basically done, and it was -- it's held by the Justice Department. The attorney general could have released it as early as Friday. But what Judge Aileen Cannon said yesterday was stop everything. Let the appeals court figure this out. And then once they decide, three days later is when that report could be released. That means there could be further appeals. And, of course, you know there's only 12 days left in this administration until Joe -- until Donald Trump is the president -- someone who clearly doesn't want this report out there. So all of this is really coming down to the wire. Do we see this report from the Justice Department about those two criminal cases into Donald Trump? Two things to watch for though today is that there's going to be a filing from the Justice Department -- we know that -- by 10:00 a.m. We're watching not just for that filing to come in but how the Circuit Court of Appeals responds to the Justice Department. How quickly. If they want arguments. What they decide.

But something I heard from online safety experts yesterday that I think is relevant is, like, free expression for whom? Because maybe if you're somebody who wants to make these kinds of comments you feel freer to do that on Meta's platforms now.
