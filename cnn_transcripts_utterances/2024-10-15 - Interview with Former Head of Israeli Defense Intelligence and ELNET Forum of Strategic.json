Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The Biden administration has sent a formal letter to the Israeli government demanding that it improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within 30 days, or risk violating American laws over foreign military assistance. That diplomatic move comes, as the United Nations says, Israel is, quote, \"effectively sealing off the north of the enclave, leaving Palestinians with no access to food.\" The U.N. also is warning that Israel may be carrying out, quote, \"the large-scale force transfer of the civilian population.\" Meanwhile, Prime Minister Netanyahu says Israel will continue to hit Hezbollah targets across Lebanon, including the capital, Beirut. All this as the world waits for an expected response to Iran. According to a source familiar with those discussions, Israeli officials have told the U.S. that a counterstrike will target Iranian military rather than oil or nuclear sites. Now, for people in Gaza, Israel, and Lebanon, the ongoing, devastating human pain is hard to escape, as correspondent Jomana Karadsheh now reports on the terrible suffering of the Israeli hostages and their families, as well as the Palestinian children and civilians killed and gruesomely injured. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Trapped in the nightmare that is Gaza are the innocent who did not choose this war, and time is running out to save their lives. Oded Lifshitz turned 84 in Hamas captivity. The great grandfather was shot and injured on October 7th by militants who stormed his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, the site of one of the worst massacres of that day. He was separated from his wife of more than 60 years. 86-year-old Yocheved was also abducted, thrown onto the back of a motorbike in her nightgown before being released days later by Hamas. For more than a year, Sharone hasn't stopped fighting for the release of her father and the other hostages.",

And now, there is a dialogue with the Biden administration about all the three fronts. And the most important, once again, is Iran. Because the Biden administration wants very much that Israel will not attack the energy sector in Iran or the nuclear. So, Israel may react on a more limited target. Most military that attacked Israel. So, tit for tat. And the U.S. will support Israel in more defense against missiles. We just saw the THAAD, which is an army anti-ballistic missile system landing in Israel as we speak. More important is Lebanon. This terror organization basically attacked Israel for 11 months. 60,000 people left their homes, without any provocation.

So, do you agree with the Biden administration and with what apparently the Israeli government has told the administration that they won't attack the nuclear sites, particularly the one that's -- they probably couldn't get to anyway, in Fordo, and they won't attack the oil infrastructure, but they will go after the military targets, like the ballistic missiles or whatever, that attacked your own country?

So, if you want to make a different behavior of this evil regime, you should plan forward. It cannot be done in one attack. I think by now, before the election, it is making sense to scale down the attack, but it should be calibrated to a level that Iran will think twice about their retaliation, because then we are going to -- for a round after round, and it can come -- become a full-scale war.",

And many of your allies, including Ambassador Dennis Ross, including, obviously, your own former national security adviser, are questioning the strategy. Here's what Dennis Ross said recently. Israel has destroyed Hamas military and much of its arms infrastructure. Hezbollah has lost its leadership, command control, communications, and most of their missiles. But military achievements are not ends in themselves. They must produce political outcomes. Israel needs that now. And as I said, Eyal Hulata, your former national security adviser, tells The New York Times, the political echelon in Israel isn't doing enough work on how we can conclude this issue.

You know, I think the continual effects in the short-term are that we're going to get to the election without really any resolution of those cases.

But also, for what it means for executive power more generally, that we have the Supreme Court decision recognizing a pretty significant for of executive branch conduct that really can't be interfered with, investigated, looked into by anybody.

And so, the ghost guns issue, you know, here you have a context where everyone agrees that if you or I walked into a store, a licensed firearm seller, and bought the same product, that Congress would have the power to regulate it, not to ban it, that would violate the Second Amendment, but at least to impose some conditions on who can buy it on, as you say, serial numbers, on other registration requirements, background checks. And the question is whether that should also apply when you have companies that are selling kits, either for 3D printers or for, you know, other do it yourself, you know, we'll send you a bunch of pieces of plastic and you put it together. And, you know, where I was struck by, Hari, is I would have thought the answer there was obviously yes.

And, youknow, this is a challenge to a Tennessee law that basically bans, right, certain kinds of gender affirming medical procedures, especially for adolescents. And the question that the federal government, which is the adverse party has presented to the Supreme Court, is whether this kind of discrimination, which singles out transgender individuals in ways that it does not apply to cisgender or folks of other gender identity, whether that kind of discrimination actually is in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, the constitutional ideal that government has to have an especially good justification before it treats similarly situated people differently. And, you know, Hari, that's really a test for this court and whether it's going to treat transgender status discrimination the same way it has treated, not just race and sex discrimination, but as we saw a couple of years ago in the context of employment discrimination, even sexual orientation discrimination. I mean, that decision in a case called Bostock had both Justice Neil Gorsuch and Chief Justice John Roberts in the majority with the Democratic appointees. So, you know, is the court going to take the step from sexual orientation to transgender status? Is the court going to affirmatively not take that step, or are they going to find some narrower ground on which to not decide that question?

And so, we have, for the first time in American history, a court that doesn't have any liberal Republicans or conservative Democrats where any time the justices divide along their ideological lines, it at least looks like it's a partisan decision, like it's an exercise of partisan political power and not judicial principle. The best defense against that, the way for the court to try to persuade us that's not true is through its behavior, is through perhaps not deciding all of its big cases in a way that splits the court six to three along those predictable lines, is to perhaps embrace some of the more modest reforms that have been proposed by, you know, me and lots of other folks. But, Hari, is also just like to try to avoid sending the message that in every big case, the best predictor of the outcome is the partisan balance of the dispute. The more that the court can act in ways that makes it look like these are judges and not just politicians in robes, I think the more it might be able to arrest some of the really alarming erosion in public faith in the court that we've seen over the last couple of years.",

I mean, I think it's commonplace for the coursedefenders to blame the critics for just being unhappy about the results. But the reality is that the court depends upon public support. It depends upon that very faith that is eroding in order to hand down unpopular decisions. Hari, for no other reason than because the court can't enforce its decisions itself. And so, the more that there is public discord around the court, the more that public faith in the court is eroding, even if it's only from one particular block of the political spectrum, the harder it will be for the justices in the future cases where it really, really matters to push back against the political branches when they do aggressive, unlawful, unconstitutional things, you know, especially with the possibility that we'll be heading into a second term of a Former President Trump, I think that's a specter that we all, and especially the justices, should be pretty worried about.",

You know, I think those who thought that was a solution might have been somewhat getting ahead of the curve here. Hari, the real question is not what the rules are, but who is going to police them and who's going to enforce them. And, you know, I think what we've learned over the last couple of years is that we probably shouldn't and can't trust the justices to police themselves. Even Justice Elena Kagan has now said publicly, multiple times in the last couple of months, it shouldn't be up to us. Justice Kagan has proposed a committee of lower court judges who could oversee the court. Hari, I'm a little skeptical about that as a solution, but I don't think it would be that bizarre or constitutionally problematic to have Congress create an inspector general for the Article 3 courts, for the federal courts, not with the power to remove the justices, only Congress can do that, but at least with the power to look into these reports to actually investigate them, to publish anytime there's some concern that a justice has failed to comply with the disclosure requirements or the ethics rules or the recusal rules. And I have to think that, you know, that would not be perfect, but at least then we would not be depending upon the media, you know, as principled as it might be to do the work that the court and the court's institutions ought to be doing for us.",
