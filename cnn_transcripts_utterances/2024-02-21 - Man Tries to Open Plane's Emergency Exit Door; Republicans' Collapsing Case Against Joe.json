The GOP spent months touting his credibility, but he's just been charged with lying to the FBI. And he admitted that some of the supposed dirt he had on the Bidens was provided to him by Russian intelligence officers. Today, Republicans on the Oversight Committee are trying to get their probe back on track. They're pressing the FBI for an explanation and they're currently grilling the president's brother James Biden behind closed doors. Let's start with CNN's Marshall Cohen. Marshall, what do we know about this indicted informant?",

We're talking about Alexander Smirnov, the former informant who was charged last week with lying to the FBI about the Bidens, as you mentioned, falsely accusing the president and his son Hunter Biden of taking millions of dollars in bribes from Ukraine. Now, after Smirnov was arrested last week, he told authorities about his longstanding contacts with foreign operatives. According to court filings, he claimed that Russian officials tied to Russian intelligence agencies previously passed information to him about Hunter Biden, information that the DOJ says was false and information that has had a major impact on our politics. Congressional Republicans have peddled Smirnov's uncorroborated robbery allegations for the better part of the last year. Now, look, Boris, Smirnov is charged with lying to the FBI, so it's kind of hard to know exactly what to believe here. But in this filing, special counsel David Weiss and his team really sent up a flare, a warning about potential election interference. Let me read this for you. They wrote that -- quote -- \"Smirnov's efforts to spread misinformation about a candidate of one of the two major parties in the United States continues.\" Dot, dot, dot. They went on to say that he is actively peddling new lies that could impact U.S. elections after meeting with Russian intelligence officials in November, as recently as just a few months ago. Now, for his part, Smirnov has not yet entered a plea, but his attorney said that he is going to mount a rigorous defense to these felony charges -- Boris.",

Those now-discredited claims were memorialized in a document, an FBI document known as a 1023, something that Republicans fought for months to make public last year. And it really was at the heart of the reason why they opened an impeachment inquiry in the first place. But now they are trying to downplay the significance of that allegation.

I did the same thing in the foreign field where you're dealing with foreigners who are who are informants providing you with information. And it's always difficult to tell what exactly is going on. You have to be constantly testing. So the FBI is responsible for doing that. But in the Smirnov case, the fact that they have had him as a confidential informant for 10 years does speak to the fact that they kept going back to him, therefore believing, at least in some part, what he was saying, until I guess it came out recently that he was lying. This is very consistent with what the Russians are doing. That's the other thing. If the Russians are pushing a confidential informant on the FBI and they're controlling it in the background, it can be much harder for the FBI and other organizations to try to suss it out. So it's complicated, this human collection activity, and the FBI is sort of in a position right now where they have got to figure it out.",

Part of it is the information they're providing compared to other sources. Some of it is simply how they behave in operational testing of these sources to try to find out what exactly they're telling you and if it's actually true. So there are processes that are in place to do this. But, as has become clear, they're not always perfect and sometimes things slip through. That appears to be what happened this time.",

Like so much else that this majority has done in the House, there was no basis once the investigation became clear. CNN reports that there have been eight witnesses who have all uniformly said no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden. So this is the most outrageous example of what has been a series of failures. There should not have been an impeachment inquiry. That's the bipartisan consensus of experts that I joined. There was no predicate for the inquiry. And there's no basis for an impeachment.

That being said, while those charges are questionable, they were the subject of a plea deal, a no-jail plea, and now they have exploded into these two cases, they're questionable on other grounds. I don't think the Smirnov incident is going to undermine them. Although there are other legal problems with those charges, Smirnov's not a major part of that.",

I got that backwards.Unruly passengers were a really big problem back in 2021. It seems like we can't really escape it, though, and it continues to follow us into 2024. Passengers tell us that this man was seated in the emergency exit row and tried to open the emergency exit, even got the cover of the handle off. Passengers tackled him. Flight attendants restrained him with tape and those flexicuffs. So, American Airlines flight 1219 from Albuquerque to Chicago O'Hare diverted back to Albuquerque, because this only happened about 20 minutes into the flight. You can see in the video there, this man being led by police down the jetway emergency exit stairs, the gate there. Not clear if he's been arrested yet. We're still looking for charging documents. The FBI, though, does tell us it's investigating this, FAA also investigating. They say there have been about 254 cases of unruly passengers so far this year. Just want you to compare that to 2021, when there was the federal transportation mask mandate in place that drove a lot of these incidents, 5,973 incidents back in 2021. The rate is really key here, especially when you consider, back in 2021, there really weren't all that many flights flying still because of the downturn of the pandemic. The rate did go up a little bit last summer, but now it's down to a bit more of a normal level. So this is a bit of an anomaly, although we keep hearing about these incidents from time to time.",

That was a brand-new MAX 9, a 737. This is a 30-year-old 757. And you can see the damage there to the slat. That is something, a movable part on the front of the wing that essentially changes the curvature, the camber of the wing, to change how the wing flies at slow air speeds, like during takeoff and landing. Ultimately, this was uneventful. This flight diverted. It was going to Boston, got diverted to Denver, where there's a big United maintenance base. The plane hasn't flown since, 165 people on board all OK. But this is a pretty significant thing, considering -- as many planes are getting older and older these days. These 757s are actually pretty old now, above the average. The latest data says the average airplane in the U.S. used by a commercial airline is about 13 years old.

But, passengers, it's perfectly OK to band together and help the flight crew and literally save the flight in some cases from an unruly passenger. You know, and Pete also pointed out, if the plane is pressurized -- that's the key point. If the plane is pressurized, it's difficult, I would go so far to say impossible, to get an emergency door or emergency window exit open, because you have to have about 1,000 pounds per square foot of pressure. So, if you're -- if you have got six square feet, 6,000 pounds, 10 square feet, 10,000 pounds, human beings just don't have that much pressure. So if the plane is pressurized, you're not going to get it open. So Pete was exactly right.
