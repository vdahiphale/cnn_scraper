But will he really do it?Plus, Poland's President Duda speaks exclusively to CNN revealing what Biden's secret trip into Ukraine means for the war. And the foreperson of the Georgia grand jury investigating Trump's actions after the 2020 election is speaking out tonight. Who could be indicted, what was it like to be in that room, and what does it mean for Donald Trump? She's our guest, tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, preparing for more war. That is what NATO says Putin is doing tonight. But while Putin makes slight gains in Eastern Ukraine, his military is still suffering heavy losses. You can see -- we're going to show you in this new video into OUTFRONT, this is a night vision recording on an attack by Ukraine on Russian troops in Eastern Ukraine. According to Ukrainian forces, the Russian convoy unexpectedly moved in on the Ukrainian forces, and Ukraine responded. We're going to show you the aftermath from the air, complete destruction. The turret of a combat vehicle just torn off. Then, we'll show you from the ground, Russian fighting vehicles blown to pieces, really. This is only one part of the problem facing Putin's forces tonight. A growing divide also between Putin's official army and his private Wagner forces also impacting the fight. Today, the Wagner chief is accusing Russia's defense ministry of, quote, treason. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER CHIEF (through translator):  The chief of the general staff and the minister of defense are handing out commands right and left. That the Wagner PMC should not receive ammunition. They're also not helping with air transport. There is direct opposition. This can be equated to high treason. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Nor did it drive major edits or changes to the address he gave just a few hours later in Warsaw. Their view of President Biden's goal with the remarks today -- remarks that he had been planning and telling advisers he wanted to make for several months was to make a larger argument, paint a broader picture of the war that's ongoing, and the kind of stakes at hand for Western democracies, not just Russia, not just Ukraine.However, the president was explicit in his rebuke of president Putin mentioning his name ten separate times attempting to put to rest the very argument president Putin made for why Russia invaded in his remarks today but also over the course of the last 11 months. That was intentional and something White House officials made clear the president wanted to do in an explicit manner. But the broader goal of the speech laying out the dynamics here, underscored something that was very clear, and U.S. officials have seen in those hour and 45 minute remarks from Putin today, that there is no end game any time soon. There is no indication whatsoever that president Putin is going to decelerate an effort that has only been expanding over the course of the last several months. And that more than anything else has driven trying to underscore that for all of the progress, all of the ability to defend Ukraine and keep the coalition together over the course of the 11 months, there is a long and difficult path ahead, and this fight is about more than just Ukraine and Russia, something the president wanted to get across. It's worth noting our colleagues Oren Liebermann and Natasha Bertrand are reporting that Russia engaged in an intercontinental ballistic missile test yesterday while President Biden was in Kyiv, according to sources, that test, U.S. officials believe, failed. It was not considered an anomaly. Nor was it considered an escalation. Something that Russia has tested before in the past. But it was expected to have been mentioned in President Putin's remarks earlier today. Had it been successful, you'll notice it was absent from those remarks. They believe it failed, Kate.",

And they also share weapons designs and other weapons protocols, you know, with each other.So, if the Chinese do get involved in the Ukraine conflict, they say that they want to do it in a peacemaking type role, but they are so aligned with Russia at this particular point in time that they really can't be trusted as honest brokers. And that really makes it hard to get to the negotiating table and to find some kind of a solution to this. I think it's going to be very difficult to end this war, especially if there is interference from the Chinese, and both China and Russia want to upend the global world order as they see it, they don't want the United States to be the preeminent power.

CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR:  Well, it was incredible because the Polish people and the Polish president has been a really stalwart ally of the United States and of this effort of NATO to help defend Ukraine. And the set piece here in Poland earlier in Warsaw, the capital, was just tremendous, where the president came out, the speech he gave. And President Duda, the Polish president, he really told me that he thought President Biden had done something incredibly courageous, not just physically, not just morally either. But he brought the full weight of the free world to bear to Kyiv to show Putin that there was no backing down when it came to defending Ukraine's right to exist. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRES. ANDRZEJ DUDA, POLAND (through translator):  So, the very thing that the president travelled to Kyiv, that he was there, it sends an incredibly powerful signal, a political and strategic signal. It is a demonstration of strength of the United States indeed. It is like saying that the American leader, who is as a matter of fact a leader of the free world, is able to travel even when war is raging, even to a place where there is potential danger. He is not afraid because the United States is strong enough to protect him. That is number one. And, number two, he was there, and today, he is in Warsaw. He gives his speech to the whole world. And he sends a signal of the defense of the free world, the defense of NATO, of the defense of every inch of the territory as the president said today. So to us, to Poles, this American signal, this allied signal not only within NATO, but first of all, a signal sent by the greatest superpower in the world, a signal sent by our friend and ally today is so significant.

We know obviously the infamous tape involving Brad Raffensperger and his office, you know, where he is asking the former president is asking for 11,780 votes.
