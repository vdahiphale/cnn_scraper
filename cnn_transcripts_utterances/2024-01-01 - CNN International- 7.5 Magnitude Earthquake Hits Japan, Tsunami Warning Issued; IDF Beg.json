Certainly, terrifying for a lot of people. Japan's weather agency warns that aftershocks could continue for up to a week, for up to a week, potentially triggering building collapses and landslides as well. Officials say there are already reports of injuries. And some people who are trapped inside buildings simply at this point unable to escape the rubble. There are also reports of damaged buildings, power outages and road closures too. Officials are urging people who are in coastal areas to move to higher ground as soon as possible because there are still at this point tsunami warnings.I want to bring in Dr. Ellen Prager. She is the Chief Scientist at StormCenter Communications, a company based here in the U.S. Ellen, thank you so much for being with us. How long at this point till we get just a clearer picture of the extent of the damage right now in western Japan? DR. ELLEN PRAGER, CHIEF SCIENTIST, STORM CENTER COMMUNICATIONS: Well, I think you're already seeing some of the images come out, and we're starting to see records of water levels with regard to the potential tsunamis. The highest that they've shown is about 1.2 meters, or for those in the U.S., about 3.9 feet. That so far for gauges along the coast, that's what's been recorded. It looks like the most of the damage is going to be from building collapses.",

So, they might -- even though the current threat might be reduced, they might keep the warnings in effect for a while longer because of those aftershocks.

We were seeing people take cover, try to evacuate their homes, these buildings. And we're seeing also that 33,000 homes are without power at the moment. We also know from NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, that at least two people are experiencing cardiac arrest after that very powerful earthquake and tsunami.Now, we also know that hundreds of military personnel are being dispatched to the area in order to help people evacuate the area. Now, after the earthquake hit at 4:10 p.m. local time, people were told to just leave their belongings, evacuate immediately, and get to higher ground. Now, this earthquake really comes as a shock for many people in the country because this was in the middle of New Year's Day celebrations. This is a very big public holiday in Japan when families get together, friends get together, and just celebrate the turning of the year. But, of course, this devastating earthquake just interrupted those festivities. And also, this is really reminding people of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. This happened on the eastern side of Japan. But, it killed 22,000 people. And it was just a devastating moment in Japan's recent history. And again, Zain, just people are very concerned about the full scale of devastation that we could be seeing right now. ASHER: Yeah. I mean, it is -- as we point out, I mean, a lot of people in Japan have PTSD, given what happened in 2011. Just explain to us what the biggest threat at this point is.

Japan's Defense Ministry says it's dispatching about 1,000 Defense Force personnel, deploying them to help with the earthquake. More than a dozen aftershocks have been reported. Officials warn that this could continue for several days. Now, Israel is beginning to withdraw some of its troops right now from Gaza. A statement from the Israeli Military says the move should alleviate economic burdens and enable troops to gather strength for upcoming activities in the next year. The IDF has warned the war is expected to continue many months, at least throughout 2024. We've got Nada Bashir joining us live now in Lebanon.

All those aboard were killed, and a fourth boat ended up getting away. Maersk says the boats were trying to board one of its vessels before being fought off. Attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthis have spiked since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. I want to bring in Natasha Bertrand on this, joining us live now from Washington.

In northeastern Ukraine, local officials say people are trapped under rubble after a drone struck a residential building on Monday. It comes as the country's capital observes a day of mourning. The death toll across Ukraine from Friday's massive aerial assault by Russia rises to at least 53. Ukraine's Air Force Command says that Russia also launched a record 90 drone attacks on New Year's Eve as well. In their New Year speeches, the leaders of both countries certainly had very different messages for their nations. Here is our Clare Sebastian with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): One gave a detailed account of the war. The other never directly mentioned it. In very different ways, this was two leaders calling on their conflict-weary populations to stay the course. it VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (TRANSLATED): And just like that, December 31, today we say we do not know for certain what the New Year will bring us. But this year, we can add, whatever it brings, we will be stronger. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (TRANSLATED): We have proven more than once that we can solve the most difficult problems, and will never back down. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Vladimir Putin's speech was pared back less than half the length of the previous year, and this time, no assembled company of Military servicemen. Still, it was an opportunity to project strength and confidence as he positions himself for a fifth term as Russian President. PUTIN (TRANSLATED): We were proud of our common achievements, rejoiced at our successes, and we're firm in defending national interests, our freedom and security, our values, which have been and remain an unshakable support for us. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): And yet, Russia's security has been shaken. Increasingly brazen attacks on Russian territory have brought the war closer to home. The year closing with one of the deadliest attacks for Russian civilians yet in the border region of Belgorod. And Putin faced one of the most direct threats to his rule yet, Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin's aborted march on Moscow in June. A plane crashed two months later, closing that chapter for good. ZELENSKYY (TRANSLATED): We defeated the darkness. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Amidst a stepped up Russian aerial campaign and waning Western weapons supplies, President Zelenskyy stuck to his well-worn tactic of accentuating the positive, including Ukraine taking one small step closer to EU membership. ZELENSKYY (TRANSLATED): This process will definitely have a logical conclusion, full-fledged membership in strong Europe, a powerful one, from Lisbon to Luhansk. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): And yet, this past week has shown Ukraine enters 2024 increasingly vulnerable. That message even spelled out by Putin in his first appearance of the New Year, promising a group of wounded Russian soldiers, the strikes would intensify. Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.

And I'll get to the details on that. But, I think it's important that we pass along this information because this is the latest from the joint -- the Japanese Meteorological Agency, and they have now downgraded from what was a tsunami warning with wave heights up to three meters down to a tsunami advisory for the entire western coastline of Japan, stretching as far north as Hokkaido, right through Honshu, anywhere you see this shading of yellow, that is where we have the potential for one meter high tsunami waves still going forward.So, we're getting this sloshing effect. And we have already realized these one meter wave heights, and some of the video that we have coming into CNN shows just that. This is one coming out of Joetsu, Japan. Here is another, Suzu City on the Ishikawa Prefecture. And you can see the tsunami wave actually toppling over the harbor and the jetty there protecting the city. Now, I want to show you this because Suzu City, this is actually the Ishikawa Prefecture, right here. And we talked details, the actual powerful earthquake, the 7.5 was just off the coastline of these Ishikawa Prefecture. But, as we zoom in, Suzu City is actually on the adjacent side of where the earthquake actually occurred. And why this is important? Here is the harbor and the break wall I was showing you on the video a moment ago. What I'm trying to portray here is that this water has a sloshing effect. Think of it like a bathtub, for instance. You drop a stone into a full bathtub and the water ripples out in all directions, hits the edges of the bathtub and comes back towards the center, creating that kind of chaotic wave motion that you would see. Well, that's happening on a local scale in and around this particular prefecture, but also on a more regional scale, as that water sloshes back and forth as far as the Korean Peninsula and into Japan as well. So, the threat, even though it's localized into Japan, western side of Japan, there is still the potential there for tsunami waves further afield as well. So, we've had these tectonic plates shifting underneath the sea floor. And what that does is it displaces water. That subduction that occurs is actually moving at about the rate our fingernails grow in the course of a year, roughly 80 to 90 millimeters a year. But, that is enough to create the seismic activity. This time, it happened to be underwater. That displaced the water at the sea surface and that water traverses towards the populated areas of western Japan. And what does it do? Well, it simply has nowhere else to go but up, and it reaches that level and creates the tsunami wave. That, of course, can be so destructive. But, from all the videos that we're seeing and collecting here at CNN, it could have been a lot worse. We think and remember about what happened in 2011 where 20,000 plus people lost their lives because of a tsunami and an earthquake. So, yeah, this was very, very bad. And the threat still looms. But, I don't believe it is as severe as what we experienced over a decade ago, Zain.",

      "sentences": "Among the most polarizing new laws that take effect with the New Year are those related to gender affirming care for minors with several Republican-led states moving to enact restrictions. For example, in Idaho, physicians or practitioners who provide puberty blocking medication, gender affirming surgeries or other treatments to minors, could face a $5,000 fine and a felony charge. In Louisiana, it will become illegal for those under 18 to receive those treatments, and healthcare professionals can have their licenses revoked for two years or more if they provide those services.On the other hand, Maryland along with several other Democratic-led states passed protections for gender affirming care for all ages, and as of January 1, the state will require Medicaid to cover them. When it comes to abortion, the State of Washington is enacting a law with the goal of making the procedure more accessible by eliminating out- of-pocket costs including deductibles and co-pays. This is of course in response to near total bans in several Republican-led states that took effect in 2023. In California, law taking effect Monday protects local healthcare providers from out of state litigation over both abortion and gender affirming care to people from other states. When it comes to laws that are not as controversial, nearly half of all U.S. states will increase their minimum wage in 2024. Washington will continue to have the highest minimum wage of all states at $16.28 an hour, up from $15.74. Another new law for 2024 getting a lot of attention is California's ban on carrying concealed firearms in sensitive places. This is despite the federal judge's prior ruling that the law is \"repugnant to the Second Amendment\". Under the new law, people with permits would not be allowed to carry concealed firearms in places like schools, parks and hospitals, among others. A federal appeals court will allow the law to go into effect for now, while the court case continues. Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

She succeeded her father King Frederik IX back in 1972. She decided that now is the right time to pass this responsibility on to the next generation. Queen Margrethe's son, Crown Prince Frederik, will be proclaimed King, and his wife, Crown Princess Mary, will become Queen.CNN's Max Foster takes a closer look at the new line of succession. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A new year, a new era for Denmark and for one of the world's oldest monarchies. Queen Margrethe II will end her reign of more than half a century, a shocked decision delivered in a live address to the Danish people on New Year's Eve. MARGRETHE II, QUEEN OF DENMARK (TRANSLATED): I have decided that now is the right time. On the 14th of January 2024, 52 years after I succeeded my beloved father, I will step down as Queen of Denmark. FOSTER (voice-over): Denmark's ruler became Europe's longest reigning monarch after the death of Britain's Queen Elizabeth in 2022. Queen Margrethe put the decision down to her fragile health. Recent surgeries on her back have limited her royal duties. MARGRETHE II (TRANSLATED): The time takes its toll and the number of ailments increases. One cannot undertake as much as one managed in the past. FOSTER (voice-over): That sense of duty won the hearts of the Danish people and drew comparisons to Queen Elizabeth to who Margrethe looked to for some inspiration. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was quick to praise the only monarch that many Danes will ever have known. \"On behalf of the entire population, I'd like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Her Majesty the Queen for her lifelong dedication and tireless efforts for the Kingdom\", Frederiksen wrote in a statement. Like other constitutional monarchies, the Danish sovereign stays above politics, but feathers can be ruffled. In 2022, the Queen removed the titles of Prince and Princess from the children of her second son, Prince Joachim. It was an effort to reduce the royal establishment and allow her grandkids more privacy. But, Prince Joaquin went public with his four children's hurt feelings, and Queen Margrethe later apologized, but did not change her decision.",
