And 7.4 percent is the annual growth in prices for producer level prices and month to month up 0.3 percent. That second number there is hotter than many economists had hoped to see. When you look at a chart, you can see that peeking that we've been talking about for inflation. This is off of the 8 percent that you saw - last reading we had on this.
