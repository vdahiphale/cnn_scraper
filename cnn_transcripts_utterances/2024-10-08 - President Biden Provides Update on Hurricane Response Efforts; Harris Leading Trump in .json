Hurricane Milton is barreling toward the western shores of Florida. The National Hurricane Center just issued the latest advisory saying the storm remains a Category 4, but it could pick up speed and go back to Category 5. Meanwhile, Floridians heading out of state could be facing a number of obstacles. Some gas stations are running out of fuel. And officials say to expect hours' worth of traffic. And this morning, Tampa International Airport suspended all operations. We begin this hour's coverage with meteorologist Derek Van Dam. Derek, we just got an update on the storm. Tell us the latest.",

      "sentences": "All right, so Pamela, since 5We're at 150 miles per hour sustained with Hurricane Milton, which makes it a Category 4, a strong Category 4 too. But what's different about this is, we're noticing this kind of dreaded northeasterly turn towards the Western and central portions of the Florida peninsula. And then as we look at the official forecast track, right, this is important to note, we are seeing a hurricane warning extend from the Gulf Coast side of Florida all the way to the Atlantic side with tropical storm warnings extending as far south as Key West. Now let's look at this angle of approach, because this is important. If we compare it to what Helene did two weeks ago, that ran basically parallel with the coastline, bringing in the water along with it. But this is going to be more of a perpendicular trajectory towards Florida. So it's going to realize a lot of its storm potential and storm energy. So when we talk about the landfall, which we believe will take place late Wednesday into early Thursday morning, because it's becoming -- it's coming at the coast with this type of an angle, we do believe that with the expanding wind field that we could have impacts from storm surge well outside of the center, especially to the south of the center, where that eventually makes landfall. And then at some stage early Thursday morning, when this thing is traversing the central portions of Florida, we believe that there could be hurricane winds in excess of 80 miles per hour, for instance, from the west coast to the east coast. Look at this ballooning effect of the hurricane as we go forward in time. By the time it reaches Florida, it will have doubled its size, at least its wind radius size, from what it is right now, a very compact storm, or it was earlier this morning, but it continues to grow. So as it realizes this potential, this potential energy that it has stored up within it, it is going to push in the water from the coastline, and because we have the inland flood threat that is real -- that is going to be a real concern with the storm, both of those are going to work together to raise the water levels in some of the local river inlets, the harbors, the bays within, let's say, Tampa Bay, for instance, points southward. So we will realize that storm surge potential of 10 to 15 feet, right where that right front quadrant of the hurricane makes landfall, and that, of course, is still to be determined exactly where, but some of our latest computer models still honing in on Tampa Bay or slightly southward. And with this time that we live in right now, Pamela, we get this minute-by-minute update from the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane hunters flying directly into the eye of the storm. I will leave you with this. This is what it looks like on the plane, where they have experienced severe turbulence and hail. There they are with their onboard radar flying right into the eye of the storm.",

There's another sense, another feeling of urgency with Hurricane Milton that many haven't really felt before.It's worth mentioning that in the last 100 years there's been no major hurricane within 50 miles of Tampa. So we could be living in an unprecedented time here if everything is projected to happen as experts have said so far. And, Pamela, one other concern that officials are having and are still working to address is all the debris that's been left behind, not only here where we are on Davis Island, where there's piles of debris still in front of homes and apartment complexes, but other parts of the Tampa Bay area as well. And those agencies throughout the state are going to be working around the clock, we're told, up until it's no longer safe to do so to try and clean that up. And the biggest reason is to not allow it to become a danger, a dangerous projectile, when those strong winds come up, pick up the debris, and then either it becomes dangerous in the form of it flying everywhere or it can simply just impede the road and get in the way of first responders or even electric crews when it's safe for them to come out and start working to address power restoration.",

That means each candidate's number is moving just within the margin of error. So it's unclear how much real movement there is here from that tie to this slight lead in this poll. But what is clear is, this remains -- I mean, we put that into our average of poll of polls, Pamela, and the five most recent national polls show it's a two-point race. That is a dead heat, basically. And as you noted, it is important to pay attention to these battleground states. We do not elect our president by the national popular vote.",

We have seen, especially since the debate, a little bit more narrowing. Now, the economy is constantly something the voters say it is their most important issue in deciding who to support in this election. So it is mission-critical for her to try and narrow that gap. I don't know that she has to overcome him in that in order to win the election, but she wants that as narrow as possible. And so we have seen this little bit of movement again. I say it's little because it's all within margin-of-error stuff. So it's hard to understand how much of that is real and how much of that is noise.",

He's no fan of Donald Trump. But he asks tough questions. And he doesn't -- he gets interesting conversations going. So there's potential for her to make undesired news there, potentially. So we should look to see. But she's clearly trying to reach out.

And then I think it's about the opportunity for these candidates, even though they are not in the front-line responsibility positions, Trump or Harris, about sort of command-and-control.
