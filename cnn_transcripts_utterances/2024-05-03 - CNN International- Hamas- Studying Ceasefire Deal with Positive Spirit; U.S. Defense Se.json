In other words, what happened was it was the vulnerability, the attacks that had happened the night before against the protesters that at least the chancellor of UCLA said was the reason for the police coming in. Essentially, the whole system had broken down.Before that, there were incidents of violence and fears amongst the Jewish population there because of the protesters, but the protesters themselves, at least described by the chancellor, were peaceful. That's the challenge right now is everyone's looking at different images and saying, well, they weren't really peaceful or they were peaceful. The most important thing at the end of this is twofold. One is, are there outlets for students to protest? I think we've seen in a dozen instances now that when schools try to completely shut down a certain viewpoint, it only escalates the tensions. The second is if the police come in, they do so in a manner which gives students an ability to walk away. That's what happened at UCLA. About a couple hundred students understood what was going on and didn't want to get arrested or arrest them in a fashion that is nonviolent. And I think we are seeing that so far to a certain extent, although we've seen a couple images of police, I think, overuse of force, and those will be examined, I think, across the country.

SCANNELL (voice-over): Keith Davidson, back on the stand on day 10 of Trump's trial, cross-examined by Trump's attorney who attempted to discredit Davidson by painting him as a shady lawyer. Meanwhile, prosecutors tried to show how Davidson's arrangement with a tabloid and Trump's ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, to kill two bombshell stories about Trump's alleged affairs directly impacted the 2016 election. Trump denies both affairs. In his testimony, Davidson recalled texting National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard on election night in 2016 as results came in in favor of Trump. Davidson said he texts Howard, What have we done? Oh my God, Howard replied. Davidson testified: There was an understanding that our efforts may have in some way -- strike that -- our activities may have in some way assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. Prosecutors played an audio recording of Cohen saying Trump hates that they paid off adult film star Stormy Daniels. Cohen was heard saying: I can't even tell you how many times he said to me \"I hate the fact that we did it,\" and my comment to him was \"But Every person that you've spoken to tells you it was the right move.
