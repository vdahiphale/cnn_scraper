We've also seen Israel saying that it will be ramping up airstrikes on the Gaza Strip to minimize the danger to its troops. And on top of that, we now also learned that the IDF has been dropping flyers on a southern neighborhood of Gaza City, telling residents that if they do not evacuate, then they might be considered a partner to the terrorist organization. In other words, Hamas.So, Israel wants civilians to get out of the way. It seems to be very much prepared with hundreds of -- well, more than 350,000 reservists called up, hundreds of tanks and other military assets there in the south of Israel. And clearly, they can't be there forever. They can't be there indefinitely. Now, perhaps plans for a ground invasion were delayed a little bit by the presence of President Joe Biden. Israel clearly wasn't going to go in while Biden was in town. But now, he is out. And it does now seem that this ground invasion is due to happen any day now. Now, on top of that, of course, we've discussed already the best of times. It's an incredibly complicated operation for Israeli troops to go in on the ground, not just because of the potential for large numbers of civilian casualties, but for the potential for Hamas militants to emerge from their labyrinth of tunnels under the ground to take cover in some of the tower blocks, for example. There is always the prospect of booby traps, improvised explosive devices and the like, and danger not just to the lives of Israeli soldiers, but also the very real danger that there could be soldiers that could be kidnapped or taken hostage, to add to the more than 200 hostages that Hamas is already holding and other militant groups are holding right now, Michael.",

Israel says that it was carried out, this airstrike, to target, in its words a command center being run by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which Israel says were planning an imminent terrorist attack.[00:05:00] Now, they've carried out that airstrike. They say they discovered the presence of this command center during clashes when Israeli forces went in a few months ago. I've asked for more specifics on that. But, that was the target. And they say this command center was operating underneath the mosque, and therefore this airstrike was carried out. Now, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent, there is one death as a result of that airstrike and seven injuries. But, if -- and Israel for its part believes that the terrorists, in his words, were neutralized. That doesn't always mean that they were killed, but usually does.

The European Council President said the world was watching for them to make a good faith effort to help resolve the conflict.

Without basic services, this will be a humanitarian catastrophe. Already, seven hospitals and 21 primary healthcare facilities here are out of service, according to Palestinian officials, because of shortages. After intense diplomatic efforts, prayers of relief at the Rafah border crossing, as a trickle of aid was allowed in from Egypt. But, the 20 truck convoy is only a drop in the ocean of need here, equivalent to just three percent of what entered this enclave daily prior to the conflict. More than 200 additional trucks of assistance remains stalled on the Egyptian side, according to the UN, and every hour costs lives. And so far, no civilians can leave the enclave. 10- year-old Palestinian-American Aiden is among those trucks. AIDEN BSEISO, PALESTINIAN-AMERICAN: And we had no place to go. All the streets are bombed. They're literally gone. How are we supposed to go out? How? It's all closed. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): Even if people are allowed out, it will be a limited number, most likely, only those with foreign passports, stealing some two million others, half of them children, into this hellscape. But, some refuse to go even if they could, fearing Israel intends to bomb and besiege them out of their homes, never to return. Even as Mahmud (ph) buries his children, he says he will keep fighting just to exist here. We will still be patient. As long as we are alive on this earth, we will be patient. He says we will never leave this land. After the October 7 terror attacks when Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel in a brutal surprise incursion, Israel vowed to wipe out Hamas. But, with hundreds of airstrikes pounding the densely populated enclave a day, innocent blood is being spilled. Innocent children were struck down while they were sleeping. This woman shouts, what did they do? Did they carry weapons? These are innocent children who know nothing. Tell us when will this end? There are calls for a ceasefire to get civilians out of the war zone and allow more aid into Gaza. But, the pleas fall on deaf ears so far.

He wasn't able to go out until daybreak, because it was simply unsafe because of the ongoing airstrikes.He is in Khan Younis in the south of Gaza, which was -- where people in the north were told to flee.
