So based on probably witnesses, this is -- how they're able to determine, they had more than one shooter. You can also determine just looking at the shell casings. They might have multiple different calibers of shell casings on the ground. It would lead them to believe that it was more than one shooter. So this is at the very early stages.

They are not in custody. They don't know why it happened. And so people will wake up and they'll be very concerned about what's going on right now. So communication from the Birmingham Police Department is going to be essential to get as much information as they can out to the public. Get the public's help. Somebody knows what happened.

Just after midnight here local time, Hezbollah launched the first of three major volleys of medium range missiles in the direction of Israel. Instead, this is in response to the strikes on Lebanon since last Tuesday, the pager strikes, the walkie talkie strikes, and Friday's Israeli airstrike on southern Beirut. They have left almost 100 Lebanese dead and thousands wounded.Now, they said their target was the Ramat David Israeli Air Base, as well as the Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Facility in Haifa. However, it doesn't appear that the missiles reached quite that far, but -- and most of them were intercepted, but we are seeing that there were some direct hits. According to the Israeli medical services, as many as 10 people have been admitted to hospital as a result. Now, they are -- this is -- Hezbollah used what is -- are being called the Fadi-1 and the Fadi-2 medium range missiles. This is the first time they've used missiles like this before. And these are -- they've reached further into Israel than anything that has been fired since the beginning of hostilities in October. Now, as far as what's happening on the Lebanese side, the official news agency here is reporting that there have been at least 60 Israeli airstrikes on southern Lebanon. There have been more than 300 in the last 24 hours. Now, the U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon has put out a statement saying that warning that the region is on the brink of what she calls imminent catastrophe, stressing that there is no military solution to this situation that will make either side safe. Now, in the meantime, the U.S. government has advised, rather, the U.S. embassy here in Lebanon has advised all Americans currently in Lebanon to leave immediately while flights are still available, and others who might be planning to come here, not to come.

At this point Hezbollah's command is in disarray because of those pager and walkie talkie strikes that have been blamed on Israel because they took out so many of their top decision makers, but also because they made everyone in the rank and file afraid to use anything electronic. So that slows down communications. But this -- thus far, these strikes that Hezbollah has been launching into Israel have still been targeted at military targets or a -- that weapons manufacturing site that apparently was targeted, but not hit, they could choose to hit civilian areas, but they're not.

Doing a 2006 style invasion of southern Lebanon means committing a lot of troops on the ground. And of course, they would be going after a bunch of these hidden weapon sites.But I've had Israeli officials brief me on the fact that those weapon sites are deep inside villages and towns, populated areas. That is a labor-intensive exercise for troops that are already tired from 10 months on the ground in Gaza. And from Hezbollah's point of view, if they dial that lever up and strike populated areas in Israel, that's sort of -- that's the worst they can do. And that capability it's believed is being reserved for Iran's use. If Iran gets hit by a massive Israeli strike, then Iran, which supplied much of that weapons and those -- that technology to Hezbollah is supposed to be saying, OK, now you can really unleash everything. That's why I think, you know, it sounds strange for me to say that each side is holding their fire, but each side is for the most part trying to target military targets when it could be a lot worse.",

The first in Alabama, Birmingham, specifically, where police say at least four people are dead and dozens more injured after a mass shooting there overnight. Here's what we know so far. It all happened. Just after 11:00 last night in the Five Point South area, which is a popular entertainment area, and that's just about two miles away from Downtown Birmingham. Now, police believe multiple shooters opened fire on a group of people. No suspects have been taken into custody. Several law enforcement agencies are involved in the investigation, including the FBI. The other breaking news we're following this morning. Israel's air force is striking Hezbollah targets inside Lebanon so far. They say they've had 290 targets since Saturday. This comes after a barrage of more than 100 projectiles from Southern Lebanon into Northern Israel overnight. And we warn you, this next video may be disturbing to some. We want to show you the moment a projectile hit the town of Kiryat Bialik in Israel near Haifa, causing fires and leaving at least four people injured. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has delayed his trip to the U.N. General Assembly, which kicks off on Tuesday. He spoke ahead of a government meeting today saying Hezbollah was hit with a set of blows it did not imagine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  Over the past few days, we have struck Hezbollah with a series of blows it didn't imagine. If Hezbollah didn't get the message, I assure you, they will get the message. We are determined to return our citizens in the north to their homes safely. No country can tolerate incoming fire against its citizens, incoming fire against its citizens. And we too, the State of Israel, won't tolerate it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Clark State College closed its campuses and moved to virtual learning last week. Wittenberg University canceled in-person classes since Monday after receiving two e-mails last weekend, including one containing a bomb threat.

So, we take a look, this cold front is what's going to be really bringing in a lot of that cooler, more fall like temperatures, if you will.So, we've already started to see them across portions of the Midwest. Take a look at the 24-hour temperature difference. St. Louis yesterday topping out at 94 degrees, but they will only get to about 79 for today. Similar drop from Chicago all the way down through Oklahoma City. And then, as we start to spread a little bit further east and especially south, you too will start to see those temperatures coming down. It's just going to be a bit more delayed. Dallas still 94 today, but back down into the 70s by tomorrow. Little Rock, Nashville, all of them also going to see that similar drop. It's just going to be closer to the middle of the upcoming week before we start to see those temperatures drop back down. Another thing that the southeastern states are keeping an eye on is the tropics. We've got several systems out there, but this one right here, this is the one of most concern, now has a 70 percent chance of developing into a tropical system here in the next several days. And when it does, it's expected to make its way into the Gulf of Mexico. Now, one of the things is the models that are a little bit different on their timing and in terms of the potential strength, but both of them still have a potential system sliding into the Gulf of Mexico by the middle of this week, and then potentially making landfall towards the end of the week. Regardless of when or where this system makes a landfall, one of the concerns is all of the moisture that it's going to spread, particularly around areas of the gulf coast of Florida, especially around Alabama and Mississippi. So, all of those entities we'll have to keep a very close eye on this particular system. The other thing that bodes in the favor of any tropical system that does develop in the Gulf of Mexico is the incredibly warm temperatures in this area. Look at this. Lots of mids and even some upper 80s and a few spots, especially right near the area where it would develop say Monday or Tuesday of this week. The next name on the list, guys, is Helene.",
