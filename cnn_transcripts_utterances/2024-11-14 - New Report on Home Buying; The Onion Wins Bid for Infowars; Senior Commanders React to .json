And whether or not they're confirmed, you know, sometimes you confirm folks, sometimes you don't.But I think, more importantly, why he probably went with the former congressman, Sara, she's very anti-war. And Trump has been someone, even when he was president before, he's very skeptical of the United States getting sort of bogged down in these prolonged, protracted, expensive and lengthy conflicts across the globe. And so I think he's probably looking at her as more of someone who has a foreign policy perspective that's probably very similar to his in terms of how much engagement we should be in, in terms of some of these conflicts we're currently seeing. And so I think it's more about that and less about some of the concerns that some folks on the left may raise about her background. But again, she's gong to go through a background check.

Well, if you read the tea leaves carefully, they've hinted at that from Trump land. Second, it's already been done. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse released a six-year study of how the FBI followed up on tips of allegations against Brett Kavanagh when he was Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court. And you ought to read Senator Whitehouse's report. He says the tip line the FBI set up, all the tips, they didn't go to the FBI. Trump had them diverted them to the White House. So the White House was being tipped off to what the evidence was and who the accusers were. It's - so, this guy is going to politicize the FBI, he's going to take them out of the confirmation process. He's going to take the Senate out of the confirmation process.

Now that it's independent, it can make acquisitions like this and it can do whatever it wants to the site. It owns the IP.And you'll recall, when Alex Jones, today, talking to his listeners, was talking about what's going on, he said they've seized my equipment, they've seized parts of my studio.

That didn't happen.So, I think Alex Jones is out of options. All he can do is complain about it. He can try to create a rival site, especially now that he's back on X.

It goes to what their intentions are and what their qualifications are.And I spoke to senior military commanders, both current and former, who have served both Biden and Trump, so served under both administrations. And, yes, the most colorful, you mentioned, Kate, one describing it as an f-ing nightmare. Another one described these appointments to me, particularly with the DOD in mind, as ridiculous. But I want to highlight one that stood out to me because this is one that relates to all the appointments. And it's about loyalty. This from a recently retired four-star general who said, \"the common denominator with these appointments is clearly loyalty. And while some loyalty is essential, slavish fealty is dangerous. Looking at all the announcements today, we could end up with one mind controlling many hands and I've never believed that one mind, any mind does that as well as diversity of thought.\" And I think the other point I would highlight, Kate, is when you look at these appointments, right, it's not just personality issues. The folks involved have a fundamentally different view, many of them, of the very functioning of the agencies they've been selected to lead, and the intention to deliver on some of Trump's more extreme positions. Pete Hegseth at State, it's not only that he was a Fox News host, right? He oppose women in combat. He has identified one-third of senior military commanders as being somehow too woke for the DOD and deserving of removal. And is quite a public proponent of the America first agenda, which would upend U.S. relationships with its allies and adversaries, right? Tulsi Gabbard is someone who blamed Biden and NATO for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and has said that Bashir al-Assad, you know, the slaughter of many thousands of his own people in Syria, and an ally of Putin, is not the enemy of the U.S., right?
