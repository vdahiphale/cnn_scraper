It's the strongest storm the world has seen so far this year. Hurricane Milton has weakened slightly to a Category 4 strength, but the storm's explosion in size and intensity has been staggering, jumping from a category one all the way to category five in just 24 hours. By the time it makes landfall sometime Wednesday, it should weaken to a category three. But that's little comfort for a state still reeling from Hurricane Helene less than two weeks ago.Officials are warning Milton's impact will be catastrophic. They're urging everyone in the storm's path to leave as soon as they can. And many have taken that message to heart. Florida's highways have been packed since early Monday. The mayor of Tampa issued a stark warning to those daring to stay behind. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR JANE CASTOR (D), TAMPA, FLORIDA: Helene was a wakeup call. This is literally catastrophic. And I can say without any dramatization whatsoever. If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you're going to die. If this takes a jog to the south, that's going to save us from the storm surge, but it stays on the track that it's projected to be on right now. Or if it goes a bit north, would be even worse. So this is something that I have never seen in my life. And I can tell you that anyone who was born and raised in the Tampa Bay area has never seen anything like this before. People need to get out.

Want to check today's top stories for you.Israel claims it hit more than 120 Hezbollah targets in a one-hour barrage on Beirut and southern Lebanon. The militant group returned fire with nearly 200 projectiles fired into Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will continue to fight as long as its enemies threaten its existence. We are four weeks from election day in the U.S. with both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris vying for every last vote. Later today, the Vice President will do interviews with \"The View\", \"The Howard Stern Show\" and \"Late Night with Stephen Colbert\". The former President will take part in a virtual Make America Healthy Again town hall. Mass evacuations are underway along Florida's Gulf Coast with drivers packing the highways as they flee from Category 4 Hurricane Milton, which is due to make landfall late Wednesday. Tampa's mayor delivered a dire warning for those in the evacuation areas, quote, \"if you choose to stay, you're going to die.\" And CNN's Brian Todd filed this report before Milton had weakened slightly with more on the urgent preparations being made as the hurricane approaches. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In Pinellas Park, Florida, just across the bay from Tampa, residents use large pails to fill as many sandbags as they can. Hurricane Milton, which has already exploded into a Category 5 storm, could hit the Tampa Bay area directly. It would be the first major hurricane to strike within 50 miles of Tampa in more than 100 years. Some residents in at least six counties told to evacuate. In Hillsborough County, the evacuation order is mandatory in some places. That means authorities cannot force people from their homes. But --",

TODD (voice-over): And even as Florida braces for Hurricane Milton, we're getting daunting numbers on the property damage from Hurricane Helene. According to the data analytics firm CoreLogic, Helene caused up to $47.5 billion in losses for property owners, much of that flood damage to residents who don't have flood insurance.

And that's problematic, because when you have one side that won't back down, Mr. Netanyahu feels that he has to continue to defend his territorial sovereignty as well as the welfare of the Israeli people. So he's not going to back down. And even though there's a lot of people and all of us hoping for the return of the hostages, it takes a second seat to continuing to try and tamp down the actions of these terrorist organizations against the Israeli population.",

There's also been an attempt to tamp down the kind of terrorist action that's coming from Hezbollah inside of Lebanon with a government that doesn't much care for what they're doing against the state of Israel.But you've got to remember that both of those terrorist organizations, both Hamas and Hezbollah, have a charter that says their primary effort is to kill Jews and to destroy the state of Israel. So when you have that kind of an enemy within your territory and within range of firing rockets, as you stated earlier it's very difficult to find some kind of complex peace situation and live peacefully together. There's no government inside of the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Authority has not stepped up. Hamas has only continued to live by their charter in attacking Israel. So it's very difficult to say, hey, we've got to make some kind of deal with these people to help them stop. You know, this is a millennia-long war that has been going on between the Palestinians and the Jews, and it's going to be very difficult to tamp down the hatred that exists between these two people. And it's so very sad, because the people who are caught in the middle, as we've seen over the last year, have been the ones that have suffered the most by design of these terrorist organizations that are using this thing called a victim's doctrine.

      "sentences": "The U.S. Supreme Court was back on the bench on Monday for the first time since July 1st when it issued its opinion giving former President Donald Trump substantial immunity against prosecution. The justices have seen their public approval ratings drop because of that decision and others dating at least to 2022 when they reversed abortion rights in America.Now with the new session, the justices will hear disputes in upcoming weeks and months over the death penalty, gun control and transgender rights. On Monday, however, among its most eye-catching actions came in a Texas case that could have given the justices another abortion controversy. The justices left in place a lower court order that prevents the Biden administration from stripping federal funding from Texas hospitals that do not provide emergency care for abortions. A federal law requires hospitals to offer treatment when necessary to stabilize a patient's emergency medical condition, including if that means an abortion in the case of pregnancy complications. Some states that ban abortion have objected to the law saying the federal government should not be able to preempt their bans in emergency room situations, or as in the Texas case, Texas argued that the administration was going too far in its interpretation of the 1986 emergency treatment law. Last session, in a case from Idaho, the court dismissed an Idaho challenge to the administration. The court said more lower court fact- finding and litigation was needed. In the Texas case, though, the Biden administration said the justices should not hear the case because of some factual and legal issues. But the administration wanted the justices to throw out the lower court order that had sided with Texas. The justices declined to take the case, but they left that lower court appellate decision favoring Texas in place. So it's a win for Texas. The action, though, applies only to the Texas situation. The Biden administration's emergency room guidance would still allow abortions for pregnant women facing complications. The conflict between state bans and the Biden administration will continue to play out, but without a resolution by the Supreme Court in this election year. Joan Biskupic, CNN, Washington.
