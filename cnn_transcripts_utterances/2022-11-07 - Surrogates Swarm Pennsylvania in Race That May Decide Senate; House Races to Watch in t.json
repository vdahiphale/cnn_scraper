But if they're going to do so, they are going to probably have to win the four following races.And let's start off in Virginia, right, Virginia's second Congressional district. This is a race I'm definitely going to be watching. It has one of the earliest poll closings at 7:00 A.M. This is a district that flipped from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020. Elaine Luria won in a wave here just a few years ago. A second district in the northeast that I'll be watching is in Pennsylvania's seventh congressional district. Susan Wild won there again in 2018. This is among the swingiest of all the swing districts. It flipped from Trump 2016 to Biden 2020.

This gives us a pretty good understanding of which way the Midwest may be going, which, of course, tends to be region we look to in elections to understand which way the nation is going.And, finally, let's go down to Texas. We're going to go down to the Rio Grande Valley. Normally, we don't talk about the Rio Grande Valley, but here's what's going on there. We have seen massive movement from the Democrats to Republicans. So, that even though Biden won there in 2020, it was a dramatically improved performance for Donald Trump.

Good morning to both of you. Listen, I think it's very important to have someone like Kevin McCarthy on the air. But there are a couple of things that I want to talk to you guys about. He said tone down the rhetoric. And when he was saying -- good morning to both of you. When he said tone down the rhetoric, I was like, is he talking to Trump? Because he says the president should not call half of the country -- I'm paraphrasing here -- idiots because of a difference of opinion. I thought maybe he could have been talking about Trump. And then he talked about Clinton and Stacey Abrams not conceding. Hillary Clinton did concede. Stacey Abrams did not. And she said, concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper. As a woman of conscious and faith, I cannot concede. That's what she told her supporters in 2018. So, she didn't concede but she did not contest the election. So, there's a lesson there. But, also, I think he's right. One thing, he says, would you encourage your supporters or leadership to accept the results of the election? He said, well, I think they will. So, he didn't answer the question. And the last thing is, Ukraine. He thinks that the people should have more oversight. I think most Americans agree with that. So, that's a lot of stuff.

Remember when she won and he had that phone call with her and he said, well, I'm going to have to sit down with her and tell her not to call the speaker an expletive. And then a few months later, he came out in 2021 and said that her theories and comments on school shootings, on political violence, on anti-Semitic conspiracy theories don't represent the caucus.

It was interesting when he was asked, do you see opportunities for bipartisanship, he s said, absolutely. I welcome people to join us in eliminating the new 87,000 new IRS agents and I welcome people making America energy independence.
