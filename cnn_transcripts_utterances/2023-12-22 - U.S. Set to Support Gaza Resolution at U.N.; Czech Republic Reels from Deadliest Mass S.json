This hour a CNN analysis explores theimpact of Israeli bombs on Gaza in just the first month of the war, a scale that military experts say hasn't been seen since Vietnam. The normally quiet city of Prague wakes up in shock and horror after a deadly and rare shooting attack left 14 dead. New details and information from the police is just ahead. U.S. airlines are preparing to fly close to 3 million passengers a day over the long holiday weekend. But is the travel industry prepared? The entire population of Gaza is hungry and there's an increasing risk of famine. A new U.N. report on food security says that is a brutal reality in the besieged enclave 2.5 months into Israel's war with Hamas. It says virtually all households are skipping meals, sometimes for days at a time and adults are giving their children what little food they can get hold of. A CNN analysis shows the Israeli military has struck at least three locations this month, where it told people to seek shelter. And as the casualties mount Gaza's overwhelmed hospitals and malls can't keep up with the crash of victims. Nima Elbagir has more on that. And I have to warn you there are disturbing scenes in this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Air strike after air strike after air strike, in the daily bombardment Gazans rarely find a reprieve. When the smoke clears, it's back to the daily routine searching the rubble, hoping for miracles, hoping to find survivors, a journey that leads many to the overflowing morgues. At the European Hospital in Southern Gaza, there is no relief in identifying the dead. Roughly 20,000 people killed in Gaza after 11 weeks of Israeli bombardment according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah. A number CNN can't verify but U.N. officials say they found the ministry's figures from past complex to be accurate. A grim landmark with every lost life the pain is inconsolable. RIDAAN ABU MA'MAR, GAZA RESIDENT: There is nowhere safe in the whole of the Gaza Strip. My whole family has gone. We are only four people left out a family of eight. ELBAGIR (voice-over): In Southern Gaza the bombs don't stop nor does the flow of the injured to overwhelmed hospitals, disrupting the rare moments of respite where children can play.",

Most of the 2.2 million population is displaced and struggling to find food and clean water. The World Health Organization says there are no functioning hospitals left in Northern Gaza.

And this is a tragedy that began back on the morning of October 7th when Gadi Haggai and his wife Judy, were out taking their morning walk like they did every day in the vineyards and fields near their kibbutz near -- And they saw the rockets in the skies, and then came under attack from Hamas militants. Judy was apparently able to get a hold of somebody to let them know that her husband had been shot, that's when they lost contact. Presumably, that's when they were taken into Gaza. Now we don't know details surrounding the circumstances of their detainment. But previous detainees have described conditions of just total isolation being first of all separated from their loved ones. They didn't keep brothers and sisters or husbands and wives together, they were on their own. A total information blackout, sometimes sitting in these dark tunnels hungry, exhausted hearing every single airstrike wondering if people even remembered them amidst all the chaos happening around them. But of course, they were very much remembered Israel has been fighting to get these hostages back. But striking a deal with Hamas has proven incredibly difficult. One, just disagreements over how long the fighting should stop, which prisoners on the Palestinian side, meaning, you know, they're wanting high level militants essentially released in exchange for these women and elderly and critical care patients that Israel is trying to secure the release of several dozen of them remaining in Gaza, it is believed, Max. And so we know that Judy still remains in custody as her family will mourn the loss even if she might not be aware of it yet, of her husband, who was a musician, someone who played the flute. And loved living a quiet life, just a few miles from the Gaza border, or at least it was a quiet life until those horrific attacks on October 7th Max.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right, Max. And look, the U.N. vote has been delayed four times already to try toget to some kind of formulation that the U.S. would actually accept for this vote on what would basically be a pause in the hostilities to allow more humanitarian aid to get into Gaza. As well as some kind of monitoring mechanism that would allow it to flow in more quickly. An original text of this resolution called for the U.N. to establish its own mechanism using their own inspectors to inspect the aid that is going into Gaza. Because of course, a key concern among the Israelis has been the smuggling, potential smuggling of equipments and weaponry into Gaza that Hamas could then use. And so the resolution calls for an independent investigator that would allow the aid to be monitored flowing in and allow everything to kind of move more quickly so that Israel wouldn't be holding it up every time. The aid flowed in from Rafah into Gaza. But there were some key sticking points with exactly what that monitoring mechanism would look like. It was unclear whether the Israelis would be OK with the U.N. doing it, for example, which is what Egypt had proposed. And so, now it seems like in addition to that, in addition to some softening of that language around that monitoring mechanism, there's also a softening of the language around cessation of hostilities and what that actually would look like. Because if you'll recall, of course, the U.S. and Israel they do not support a ceasefire at this moment. And the original text of the language said that it called for an urgent cessation of hostilities. Well, now, we are told that language has been changed to a sustainable cessation of hostilities as this aid flows in. So a number of key tweaks here that would allow the U.S. to feel more comfortable supporting it. It does appear now like the U.S. is going to vote in favor of this resolution. What that would mean would be a couple of days, perhaps of a pause in the fighting and new monitoring mechanism to allow that aid to go in. But we'll have to see, of course, what the final text looks like, that allowed the U.S. to finally be able to support it, Max.",

And supporting this resolution, which they have not done previously is a way for them to say, look, we need a mechanism here that actually enforces the flow of aid into Gaza in a way that has been really hindered in recent weeks, because of all of the concerns that the Israelis had over the possibility that's again, some of that aid might include things that could go to Hamas. And so, the pause in hostilities that would allow that humanitarian assistance to go into the Gaza Strip, that is something that the U.S. has been extremely focused on. It's why they asked the Israelis to open another border crossing into Gaza so that they could allow more aid to go in, because we are seeing, of course, the huge humanitarian crisis that is unfolding there. But the key sticking point, of course, remains that the U.S. and Israel they are not at this point supporting a longer term ceasefire. And so this is kind of a middle ground that allows the U.S. to support something without going all the way and saying that Israel should completely stop its hostilities, Max.",

Security Council to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and to open up more entry points for aid to get inside the besieged enclave. Meanwhile, analysis by CNN and an AI Company suggests that in the first months of its war in Gaza, Israel drops hundreds of 2000 pound bombs. Those are four times heavier than the largest bombs the U.S. dropped in Iraq during the war against ISIS. Our analysis suggests that such massive bombs are capable of killing or wounding people more than 300 meters away. And don't forget the population of Gaza has packed together more tightly than almost anywhere else on the planet. Weapons and warfare experts blame the extensive use of heavy munitions for the soaring death toll. You can read more about this analysis on cnn.com where we break down what led us to these findings including satellite imagery and expert interviews. Now to the search for answers in Thursday's mass shooting at Charles University in Prague, Czech Police are still looking for a motive as to why the 24-year-old philosophy student opened fire, killing 14 fellow students and staff and ruining 25 others. The government's father was also found dead and authorities are now linking the shooter to a double murder in Prague last week. We now have video from police vests as they walk through the schools corridors. Authorities confirmed the killer later shot himself.

They simply don't happen on the same scale. And yet at their heart, of course, as ever, the same sense of shock, the senselessness of the killing. These are words that have come back over and over again, in the words of Czech police and Czech leaders. And as you say, those body cam images released just a short while ago, the press conference really give a better idea of the kind of chaos that you see. At these times the sort of things the first responders are faced with, including the images of the mostly students, a couple of staff members strewn on the ground, as they carried out the triage, trying to save who they could, failing to save in the end, 14 people. There are we now know 25 people who were injured. They are said to be in a stable condition by Czech authorities. But we've also been hearing from the police chief at their press conference, Max that it was the swift response of those first responders that prevented there being further bloodshed since when you looked at the young man's weaponry, his ammunitions. The ammunition he brought with him clearly this is a massacre that could have gone much further still. Chilling details as well of course about his linking according to the police, and after they raided his home, found evidence they say they're linking him to a double homicide last week. A man and his young child described as a baby by Czech officials were found in a forest in a suburb of Prague, and there had been no leads in that case until now, he's not being linked to that. And yet, here's a young man who had no criminal record, he had legal access to his guns. He had the permits, he needed to have them. And so even if the scale is different, the same questions posed themselves on both sides of the Atlantic how these kinds of events, tragedies can be prevented, when there was nothing to suggest to authorities that he was about to act, Max.",
