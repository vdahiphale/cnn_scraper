Good evening.Hours from now we'll get our first taste of how Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis plans to prosecute anti-racketeering case against former President Donald Trump. The Georgia election interference case will take center stage in a federal court hearing tomorrow. Co- defendant and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows will be arguing for the charges against him be moved to federal court and possibly dropped. Meadows claims he should have immunity since he was acting, he says, in his capacity as a federal employee under then-President Donald Trump. Fanni Willis is expected to lay out evidence and legal arguments for why Trump, Meadows and the other 17 defendants broke the law in her state. It could be a pivotal moment in determining the future of those proceedings in Atlanta. And joining me now is 2024 presidential candidate and former Republican congressman, Will Hurd. Congressman, great to see you. Thanks so much. Let's get right to what's happening with the Trump campaign. They claim that since he was booked and had his mug shot taken last week, that the campaign has raised $7.1 million since his arrest in his mug shot. Let me ask you, what do you think? Is he being strengthened in all of this? Are you concerned about that? WILL HURD (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, first off, he's going to need more than $7 million to stay out of prison. I've made it very clear that Donald Trump is running for office to stay out of prison. You know, $3 out of $4 that he raises is going to his legal defense funds and now that you have so many people in his orbit that don't have lawyers or don't have the money to pay for lawyers like Rudy Giuliani, you're going to potentially start seeing some of them flip like in that case for the classified documents. And so the people -- you know, Donald Trump has loyal followers. They're going to follow him no matter what, and regardless of what may or may not happen. But what I have to, you know, remind some of my friends, my Republican friends, is that, who's the independent or Democrat that voted for Joe Biden in 2020 who's now going to change his mind and vote for Donald Trump if we put Donald Trump as the GOP nominee, and that person doesn't exist. And so if the GOP cares about things like dealing with the border, if we care about dealing with all the legal issues around President Biden through his son, Hunter, then we've got to put somebody that can actually prosecute that case and who doesn't have, what, almost 100 indictment against him.",

And at the end of the day, this is about winning in November and the Republican Party has failed for 20 years to win the popular vote.We have a real opportunity in November, if we select and put forward the right candidate. And that is the part that is frustrating on that, and Donald Trump is not the model, is not the candidate, and he's already failed to do the things that we need to do in order to win the election. And there's some real challenges, there's some real opportunities to attack Joe Biden but we're not having that because we're embroiled in having to talk about all of Donald Trump's baggage. All of these things are self-inflicted wounds. If you want to talk about the politicalization of the DOJ, that's fine. I'm not going to defend DOJ. You know, this issue with Hunter Biden looked like a sweetheart deal, but Donald Trump cases, these are all things that were self-inflicted, guess what? There's no question that he had classified documents. He still hasn't explained why was he keeping them, why was he lying about having them. What did he do in order to protect these things? This case in Georgia, the way I explain it to people, imagine it was 100 years ago and you have six electors from Georgia on a horse and buggy going to Washington, D.C., and 600 six other people jump out of the bushes to take over. This is not about political speech, this is about people trying to overturn the election. Guess what? You lost.",

I've been in the race the least amount of time. A little bit over I think it's about 62 days. We're near and we're going to surpass that 50,000-donor threshold. We're tied in New Hampshire with Nikki Haley and Mike Pence, two people that have definitely more name ID and have both spent tens of millions of dollars. I've done it with a fraction of the cost. My supporters are excited. They are disappointed and pissed, to be honest, that some of these polls where we've registered in weren't counted by the RNC because they believe it had too many independents and Democrats. Newsflash, if Republicans are going to win, we've got to get independents and Democrats to vote for us. That's actually the real opportunity in a place like New Hampshire. And if the GOP is going to change this trend of losing, then we're going to need a candidate that can attract that. So we are driving on, we're doing our thing, we're taking our message, and people appreciate it.

I mean, I suppose it gives us something to hang our hat on that he is in fact dead. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Jim, there certainly is evidence that a plane crash with 10 people on board and allegedly Prigozhin was one of the members of the list of the people that were on board. If there were 10 people on board, as the Russians have also mentioned, you know, our focus has been on Prigozhin. Some have mentioned his deputy, Utkin, who was the deputy for operations of Wagner all over the world, but the other eight are also likely critical members of the chain of command, like a guy named Chekalov who we followed very closely in the military, who was responsible for the (INAUDIBLE) and logistics, quote-unquote, of the Wagner Group.

But, you know, that's going to be very difficult for a variety of reasons. While most Americans, and you've been very good about publicizing Prigozhin and Wagner for their actions in the Donbas and especially Bakhmut over the last year, the American military has been tracking them for their actions in Syria and several African nations as well, and they are only one of many private military contractors established by Putin.There are others like the Patriot Group which was a direct competitor with Wagner. It's likely to be better trained and better paid. And there's also the Redut and Fakel groups, both originally sponsored by Gazprom. So, you know, when you're talking about putting these PMCs under the control of the military or the Ministry of Defense in Russia, it's going to be tough because there are literally tens of thousands of these guys doing the Shoigu's and Putin's bidding all over the world.",

I mean, we talked about, you know, how Putin looked weak after what Prigozhin did, that raid on Moscow or trying to march on Moscow and it didn't work. He pulled back at the last send.

That's going to be very tough to do during wartime, especially at a time and right now there seem to be indicators that Ukrainians defensive is beginning to gain momentum in several areas.So what they're trying to do is take a look at Russia's actions around the globe.

You know, we've been asking him to sit down, and activists and organizers have been asking him to travel the state and sit down with people since he's gotten into office and he never does it.What I would tell him is, Governor, we need a special session on gun violence. We needed it, you know, when you first started and we need it now more than ever. The leading cause of death for children in this country is to be shot to death. That's unacceptable. Not only do we need a special session on gun violence but we also need the governor to stop embracing and being a champion for this far-right wing fascist movement that's growing in Florida and across the entire country because when he gives credence and when he embraces that movement, to help further his presidential primary run, he gives them the energy they need. And we live in a time right now where the ways our leaders conduct themselves and the message they give, it's more important now more than ever and we need true leadership in the state, one of the most diverse states in the entire country. I love this state. You know, I was actually just thinking about writing an op-ed, and I want to still do it but now it's even harder. I wanted to write an op-ed encouraging people to still come to the state because we can't be left alone here. We need help in this fight. And then yesterday, I get up and I look at my phone and I see that three people were hunted down because they were black. There's multiple truths to everything going on in the state but I want people to know that we're fighting.",

It's so un-American to take away that freedom that we have. Voting should be one of the easiest things to do in this country and that fight is still alive and still well. We should want more people to vote, not less, and again, it shows that the right-wing, they understand that their policy is not popular.",

And now they're going through a rulemaking process.What that letter did, and I signed it with Senator Elizabeth Warren, Representative Ayanna Pressley, Chuck Schumer, a bunch of us signed it, and says, number one, thank you, Mr. President, for your work on doing this through the Higher Education Act, but let's ensure that the bureaucracy of the rulemaking process doesn't inhibit us from giving -- from doing the student debt relief as soon as possible. We'd like to see this redone early next year. And let's be clear, this is a racial justice issue, this is an issue of our economy, this is to take the shackles off of not just young people but the over 40 million of folks who would be eligible under the program. And it's really important that we get this promise done for the American people, especially early next year. Folks are not in crushing student debt because they lived beyond their means. It's because they've been denied the means to live. And we as legislators have to use every tool in our toolbox to give the relief that they deserve.",

So FOX News publishes this false story and the Pentagon notifies FOX News that the story is inaccurate, but unlike most news organizations that would immediately move to correct the story, FOX News just tweaked the headline. Thery were notified again by the Pentagon that the story was still wrong and they just deleted the story.They didn't put a correction, they didn't offer a note to readers, they just straight up deleted the story. And no apology to the Gold Star family either. And so this issue went on until this week when Military.com, they obtained documents that show the Pentagon really going after FOX News in private e-mails saying that, you know, the story was incorrect. That drew attention to this and only then did FOX News delete the story and offer -- sorry, offer an apology to the family, the Gold Star family. The story still remains deleted, Jim. And I think we should note to viewers, that's very strange. Normally when a news organization gets something wrong they do correct it, they do offer a note that explains to readers what happened, what went wrong. FOX News just scrubbed the story, very unethical, and didn't notify anyone exactly what happened -- Jim.",

Other people wanted to see Mike Pence, maybe they wanted to see Ron DeSantis. There was some interest. I think what's interesting to note, too, Jim, is that it's very clear after watching the debate why the Republican Party wanted to partner with FOX News, whether it was the first question which was, about the \"Rich Men North of Richmond\" song, that has gone viral in right-wing media, or just watching the moderators so reluctant to tackle the issue of January 6th and the 2020 election, and the lies that Donald Trump has told.That's really a big issue obviously in the Republican Party. That's perhaps the main issue that Republicans have to tackle, but FOX News didn't ask a question about it for about an hour and they were very reluctant.
