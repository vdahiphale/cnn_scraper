A story from Scotland now, scientists believe the world`s carbon dioxide levels are at their highest level in more than 2 million years. These reports suggest removing CO2 from the atmosphere is a necessary part of keeping a healthy planet. Now, carbon capture and removal is still a relatively new and unproven field, but CNN`s Bill Weir traveled to Scotland to see if a startup there has one solution to remove carbon pollution already in the atmosphere. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Over millennia, volcanic rocks have formed some of Scotland`s most spectacular sites, but now they could also provide a solution to pull carbon out of the sky and lock it underground. JIM MANN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO UNDO: Rock weathering is a natural process, so CO2 in our atmosphere combines with water vapor in our atmosphere and they will react to form a weak carbonic acid, that reacts to certain types of rocks to remove CO2.",
