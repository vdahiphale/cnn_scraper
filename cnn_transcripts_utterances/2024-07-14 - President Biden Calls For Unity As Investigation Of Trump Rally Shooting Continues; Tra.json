We're following all of the latest developments in this truly historic moment in American history.Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington. This is a special edition of THE SITUATION ROOM. The FBI is now saying yesterday's attempt to shoot Donald Trump is being investigated not only as an attempted assassination but as a potential act of domestic terrorism. They say the shooter, Timothy Matthew Crooks, acted alone and had no known ideology. Meantime, the U.S. Secret Service says it is fully prepared to maintain security at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, and has no need to change its protocols in the wake of the attack. Just ahead of his planned Oval Office address, President Biden spoke of making a personal call to former president Trump and how critical unity is at this moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, what we know right now is that the FBI is saying that this gunman acted alone, and they are still working to gain access to the cell phone. But they do have some very limited insights into his communications and this includes phone call records as well as text messages, but that information thus far has not -- this is a quote, \"not revealed anything with regard to motive or the involvement or knowledge of anyone else.\" That's according to the FBI deputy director Paul Abate.And that's important, Wolf, because what we've learned additionally is that this firearm was purchased legally, that it was an AR-style 556 rifle, and that it belongs to his father. So the question here is how did the gunman gained access to that firearm. The FBI has repeatedly emphasized that this is early in the investigation. This is very much in the preliminary stages. Agents are working around the clock to try to figure out what happened and what the motivation was. And that includes trying to assess materials at Quantico. And Wolf, an example of that certainly as agents attempt robustly to try to get into that cell phone, they are also examining these rudimentary explosive materials that were at the gunman's residence. We also know that there was explosive material found in his car. So many questions about if he had any further plans or perhaps plans to utilize an explosive device that he later changed his mind and decided to use a firearm. These are all of the questions that the FBI is working through at this point. Further, Wolf, what we know is that this 20-year-old, Thomas Matthew Crooks, had no prior contact with the FBI and was not in any database as well. So this is the type of lone gunman law enforcement really worries about because they are flying so far under the radar.",

This happens frequently. We've covered other cases where the FBI was trying to get into a mass shooter's cell phone and they were able to do it. So certainly it's highly likely that we will learn more information as the FBI very likely successful in being able to get into that cell phone.And that is such a crucial piece of information, Wolf, because it allows them to understand several things. The motivation obviously chief among them, but also if there's anyone else who needs to be held accountable. [18:05:08] The other thing to consider, Wolf, is that this is very much an active investigation. Just because the gunman is dead does not mean that someone will not eventually be prosecuted.

It is a major decision, really his biggest decision as the presumptive nominee. Most Republicans were talking to expect it tomorrow. Technically on the schedule, there is a roll call vote for his name and the running mate stand to be placed into nomination.But don't forget, they control the rules here. So the timing could change, but most people here expect it on Monday. And as the former president makes his way to Milwaukee, Wolf, one thing that is really striking, it's different from of course the convention four years ago, which was really shrunken because of the pandemic, and certainly different than eight years ago when he arrived at the convention with a divided party. This is Donald Trump's Republican Party. There is more -- there is a bigger sense of unity here and certainly in the wake of the attempted assassination on Saturday. He is going to receive a hero's welcome here, but he is also really striking a tone of unity. So that is really something that we're all keeping our eye on here this week end. One example of that is his longest standing rival, Nikki Haley. She received an invitation, a late invitation to come speak at the convention on a Tuesday. I'm told she will be giving a speech about the need for Republicans to unify and the need for the country to unify. So of course we will see what Donald Trump does himself in terms of setting message and tone. But they really believed this is an opportunity to a set a wider example to the country of course right here in battleground Wisconsin.

I think that -- I know that humankind is far better than the way we are exhibiting ourselves today. As I said, we often have seen civility exist. And whenever there is a crisis in the nation and the world, a natural disaster, Americans are some of the first to come to the table to address those issues.We got to find out how do we turn to each other and stop turning on each other. Currently the climate is to turn on each other if we don't agree. Dad and mom showed us how to disagree without being disagreeable. That spirit must emerge once again.",

One, there's hostility, hatred, and then there's the other one of love and forgiveness and peace and justice. And the kid asked her grandmother, grandma, but what am I going to do, these wolves are fighting, who's going to win? And the grandmother simply says it's the wolf you feed.So when we feed the flames of justice and righteousness and peace, and truth, that is how we get to what my father called the beloved community and my mother.

Trump has a busy schedule, which will include announcing his vice presidential pick and that could happen as early as tomorrow. And just over an hour, meantime, President Biden will give a rare Oval Office address to the nation as he calls for unity following the attempted assassination of his political opponent, the former president Donald Trump.

These kinds of addresses are quite rare. The last time that the president spoke in this setting in primetime was back in October just days after Hamas' attack on Israel. And we got a preview of the tone that we expect to hear from President Biden when he spoke earlier in the Roosevelt Room. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This was clearly the president trying to temper some of the speculation, some of the misinformation that is already running ramping online and elsewhere.The president is also going to continue to be briefed on this ongoing federal investigation into what happened yesterday. The White House did say that tomorrow morning, the president will be back in the situation room, meeting with the heads of the various law enforcement agencies to get another update. The president made clear earlier that he expects this investigation to take place swiftly and that he basically needs to get an answer to the question of why there was such a serious security breach yesterday at this Donald Trump rally. As for the president's next couple of days, we know of course that the president's trip to Texas, that is going to be postponed. But we also know that he will continue on to travel to Las Vegas in the afternoon after sitting down with Lester Holt of NBC News. And just keep in mind just the extraordinary events of the last 24 hours or so, even just a day ago, this sit-down interview for the president was meant to and expected to focus on the real moment of political peril for the president, and of course instead this is the context in which this interview will be taking place -- Wolf.",
