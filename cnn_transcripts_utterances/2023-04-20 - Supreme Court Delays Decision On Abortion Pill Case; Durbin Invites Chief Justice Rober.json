Willing to put on the table or not willing to put on the table in response.And I think the difference, perhaps from some of the outside groups and where the White House is, is their counsel's office and what they feel like, not just in the near term, not just politically, what might feel good or might create some opening to help address some of these issues. But the precedent it would set long term going forward, I think, that's at the center of the White House refusal to go down that path. That being said, I think maybe unlike the post-Roe period of time where some of the folks in the outside felt like the administration wasn't prepared to respond substantively from a policy perspective in the limited ways that they could. This, I think, is a different game. To Joan's point, they will fight on the legal side. They want this case to go their way. They are working intensively behind the scenes to have some options, workarounds, maybe deferred prosecution types of issues to have on the table and ready to roll out if it doesn't go their way.",

You know, there are restrictions and regulations put in place, but clearly there's not enough oversight on it. And so when I talked to both Democrats and Republicans about this issue, almost every single Democrat I talked to said, yes, we need to adopt some type of ethics code. Some even called for him to step down formally, Clarence Thomas. But then a lot of Republicans just said, you know, they need to deal with this issue amongst themselves.

And I think the difficulty, particularly in the last three or four days, you expect when tragedies or horrors occur, that there's something clean.You can say, if we only did this, it would address this. If we did, x, y would no longer be plausible. And I think the difficulty here for all of the gun reforms that have been proposed, for all the things that have been laid out, the obviously, long standing battle between the two sides related to guns, this is a much deeper societal -- I don't even know the right word for it. Other than every time you see it, you think, how is it possible that we live in this space? And if there's no clean answer to it, where do you go from here? And I'm not smart enough to figure that out. I just know that you can't ignore what's happening right now. Yes, guns are an issue, but this is deeper than that. But there's not sort of, let's all get in a room and talk about it, leave our politics outside the room. Let's just come in and talk about it as parents or as members of community. Instead, this does tend to break down red state, blue state. Washington did pass some modest gun reforms last year. Just forget about it. Now that the House Republicans have the -- Republicans have the majority in the House, we're getting closer to 2024, Washington is most unlikely to do anything. If you look at the states, Michigan, the elections do matter if you support gun safety reforms. Michigan Democrats had a big year last year, and what have they done. Universal background checks have passed. They've also passed a new red flag bill. Washington State, democratic governor, democratic legislature has passed a ban on semiautomatic rifles. Florida is the flip side. A big Republican majority in the legislature, Republican governor permitless concealed carry law passed. Tennessee is kind of a little bit of both, if you will. They've passed a bill protecting gun companies from lawsuits. But they've also -- the governor is trying to get essentially a red flag law. They call it order protection law.

And so, a lot of people are looking towards the state and looking towards their governors to say, OK, we know Congress can't pass something on a federal level, but what can we do on the state level?

The question here, of course, is also timing. A senior U.S. official says this isn't imminent. The big question, is there a ceasefire that sustained that is long enough on the ground there between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces that would allow for those aircraft to get in, for those forces to get in, to secure the embassy, and to move on out?
