But let's begin with our senior international correspondent David McKenzie who is in Johannesburg.David let's focus on the question of expansion. Certain members, particularly China, have made it incredibly clear how they envisage these countries working together to break that Western hegemony. But what countries might be considering joining this bloc and what would be the stipulations of them doing so?",

      "sentences": "Well we're still trying to figure that out. What we do know is that multiple countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, DRC and others have formally applied to join the BRICS grouping.Earlier today you've had Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi of China and India respectively, and the red carpets coming to the main day of the BRICS Summit. This is a very high stakes summit. It's an odd collection of countries with the world's biggest autocracies in China, the world's biggest democracy in India. Russia and South Africa, of course, and Brazil rounding it out. They all have different views on what exactly BRICS should be. China, for its part, is very much focused on trying to expand BRICS. I think to expressly take on groups like the G7 and to increase its own power on the world stage both economically and politically. It gets more complicated though as you go through the other countries. In the statements from the first day of the summit, you certainly had China pushing expansion and Russia, and the President of Russia, Putin, from a virtual camera saying that he wanted the de- dollarization of the world. That is not really realistic in the short term. But you have countries like South Africa, India, Brazil, who are a bit more nuanced on their approach to this. They don't want to ostracize the European Union, the U.S. which are very important trade partners to them. And so, they're playing this kind of balancing act. But I think while BRICS itself was seen not as an oddity but sort of as a strange collection of countries for some years and not necessarily taken all that seriously on the world stage, I think that that has certainly changed. This time there really is a sense that the world is paying attention to the summit and also that there is a potential for real change when it comes to these global south countries and in their worlds to break Western hegemony and it could have real impact in the coming years on world affairs.",

      "sentences": "Yes, very mysterious, Max. Xi Jinping was a no-show at this key BRICS business forum in South Africa. The Chinese leader skipped out on his own scheduled speech despite the presence of his BRICS counterparts. The leaders of Brazil, India, South Africa all in attendance there.Now what we've also learned is that this is the first in-person summit of the BRICS grouping since the pandemic. This is only Xi's second international trip this year. It's also Xi's first trip to Africa and some five years. But be for the event on Tuesday, we did learn that Xi met with the South Africa President, Cyril Ramaphosa -- as you see there. He received an order of South Africa award from him and later in the evening he attended a dinner with BRICS leaders. So China observers are wondering why did Xi Jinping then skip out on his own address. We reached out to Bonnie Glaser. She is the managing director of the German Marshall Fund. And she told CNN this. We'll bring it up for you. She said, quote: It's extremely unusual for a Chinese leader to show up in a country hosting a multilateral meeting -- especially one that China is deeply invested in like BRICS -- and fail to show up at the opening event. And also heard from Brian Hart, who's a fellow at CSIS and he says this, quote: Xi's absence is highly unusual. Chinese leaders rarely go off script at high profile events like this. He added, Xi's disappearance is yet another reminder that Beijing can be a black box. Unquote. Both analysts point out, not that long ago, China replaced its foreign minister, Qin Gang after his mysterious one-month absence from public view, without providing any explanation. Now in South Africa Xi's prepared remarks were said delivered by the Chinese commerce minister. He delivered those remarks that commended the BRICS groups for -- you know, and called for development, prosperity for all. It also criticized the United States for hegemony and bullying acts and those remarks also insisted that the Chinese economy is resilient. Now we are also monitoring Chinese state media. No mention of Xi skipping his scheduled speech. Back to you.",

But as India reaches for the moon today, the scientists and the engineers at the Indian space agency known as the ISRO, will need nerves of steel.Let me start with images that we've just tweeted out about an hour ago. These are images from the mission center down south in India. These are the men who have been working day and night to get that spacecraft closest to the moon as of now and about three hours or more from now, that attempt will be made to soft land on the lunar surface. An attempt made by the Russian spacecraft on Sunday and it failed. It crash landed on the lunar surface. And that's what the scientists here in India are not hoping for. The people across India who are praying for the last two days for a soft landing on the lunar surface are not praying for, they want this to be a success. And that's essentially because in 2019 when the second moon craft was about to land on the lunar surface, it crash landed. Now according to the scientists at ISRO -- which is the equivalent to NASA -- they've said they've learned from those mistakes. They've learned lessons and they've made a spacecraft that could be a much better one to land on the moon's surface today. What does it mean for India? Like you said, if this is a successful soft landing which means a gentle and controlled landing, India would be the fourth nation across the world to achieve this feet. And not only that, India would also be the first country to soft land on the southern pole of the moon. This is a dark area. This is known as far removed area of the moon away from the equator of the moon and this is a space that is full of craters and rough surfaces because of which it has been very difficult for countries to soft land there. So today is a moment that millions of Indians will be watching very closely. There are watch parties that have been prepared across India for that one moment. Back to you.",

There were then multiple reports from the Russian blogosphere about sort of cleansing, purges potentially happening in the military. Reports that he might have been arrested. They had of the CIA, Bill Burns, said recently, I don't think that he enjoys a lot of freedom right now.

He looked sort of stilted and disheveled. And that was the last we've seen of him.
