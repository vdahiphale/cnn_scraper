And a historic strike for the first times ever the powerful United Auto Workers Union calling down tools at all Big Three U.S. Automakers at once, a live report from Michigan in just a moment's time. And quick final check of Wall Street's price action. U.S. stocks are on track for a slightly lower open on the last trading day of the week this time. Yet, of course, take a look at Europe that's in the green following a positive lead during the Asia session too where stocks closed for the most part higher helped along by better than expected Chinese retail sales data and industrial production numbers NIKKEI and the KOSPI, they're in South Korea, the outperformers. OK, let's begin now in Libya, or at least 5000 people have lost their lives in massive flooding. Those are the latest figures by Doctors without Borders, many more, of course, is still missing.

His absence came up during a briefing today at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during its regular briefing spokeswoman mounding was asked about this. And her response, simply, \"I'm not aware of the situation\". To give you a look at the calendar Li was last seen about two weeks ago here in Beijing at a conference dealing with peace and security issues. Before that he was on a road trip to both Russia and Belarus in which he met with his Russian counterpart on that visit. Some context though, the reason why we are paying attention it was in July, that we saw the sudden departure and disappearance of the Chinese Foreign Minister a much more high profile position. But his abrupt departure again is raising questions about President Xi Jinping, his leadership and the lack of transparency. Now, the Defense Secretary Job certainly is not as high profile as that of the Defense Minister. But if we look at this broader storyline about these disappearances, it certainly raises questions. And Julia, I should finally point out that his job posting, his biography, the information surrounding him. It is still very much on the Chinese government website. It has not been removed. What that tells us there's a number of ways to look at it, when the Foreign Minister was removed immediately. Some of that information was taken away, but for now, at least officially on that website, the Defense Minister is still listed as having that position, Julia.",

They're going plant by plant to try to keep the companies guessing, there is no timeline for this. We do not know if this is going to last days, weeks, months.

But I think one thing that's most important is job security. And you know we're an incredibly exciting time in this industry right now, as we make the transformation from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles. And General Motors is well poised, we have a pipeline coming. And so when we look at that, and we look at how this could, you know, delay that it's at a critical juncture. So we have a deal that I think is very, very important that proposal sits at the table. Our team is ready to be at the table.

They build these vehicles in order for these companies to be successful. Now we will see UAW President Shawn Fain at a rally at 5 pm here in Detroit with Bernie Sanders. We know that there are no negotiations happening today between the automakers and the union. Mary Barra is also told me that she spoke to the President Biden yesterday and has been keeping the administration up to date about what's been going on. We expect to hear from the President in a few hours just about how he is feeling and the administration is feeling about these breakdowns in negotiations. And the facts, that this is just a one of this strike, just three plants are being impacted.

No, we're not talking about movie magic.Colossus Biosciences is a genetic engineering firm working to resurrect the woolly mammoth, the Tasmanian Tiger and the dodo. The plan is de extinction or applying gene editing technology to rebuild the DNA of creatures that once walked the earth. But it's not just about bringing back the dodo scientists that the company also aiming to preserve and protect living animals as well. And the work is already having a positive impact on orphaned elephants in Botswana. Joining us now to discuss all of the details is Ben Lamm. He's the CEO of Colossal Biosciences. Ben, it is a huge honor to have you on the show. It's fascinating work that you're doing. You call yourselves the first de extinction firm, but actually, it is a lot bigger than that.

But when you get down to dwindling populations, you need to use genetic engineering, genetic sequencing to find lost diversity engineering back into those populations so that you can create thrive herds and populations that can sustain and not be bottlenecked. And go into genetic bottleneck that will ultimately, you know, actually destroy the herd kind of like what we saw it demand was the end of the most people think that man was just died off at the end of the last ice age, but they actually, genetic bottleneck led to a lot of inbreeding.

We can, not only, you know, build better genetically diverse herds through genetic engineering, but we can work to reintroduce them safer and better, and hopefully remove human elephant conflict.

But we're also using AI from, you know, studying all the different camera feeds we're taking from drones in the air to cameras in the field, to understand her dynamics, track specific elephants, tie that back to their genetics, so that we can look for what are the genotype to phenotype markers. And then, you know, that's just an immense amount of data that we can as humans process, unless we just have thousand humans watching these videos.
