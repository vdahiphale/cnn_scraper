Anyone who might have been on the fence on either Trump or Biden and might now be feeling more that they're leaning towards Harris. And I think that rally yesterday night really painted that clear because in a lot of ways, in the last couple of weeks, Republicans have been sort of tinkering with different ideas. You know, how do we really get the voters to recognize what Kamala Harris' brand is, right? And so, at first some Republicans had been trying to paint her as a DEI candidate. And many warned that that might not sit well with voters. And so, really right now the goal is to figure out what policies, what sort of attack lines will really resonate with voters.",

LAI: I think you have a good point in that he might not serve the same electoral advantage that, you know, say Josh Shapiro might bring to the ticket.

A new study says those two groups have a higher risk of developing more than a dozen types of cancers. You see them on your screen right now. Rates of 17 cancers in Millennials and Gen Xers have risen dramatically.That's according to a new study by researchers at the American Cancer Society. They also found younger generations are likelier to die from five of these cancers. All right. So, with me to talk about all of this is Dr. Jayne Morgan, a cardiologist and executive director of Health and Community Education at Piedmont Healthcare. Thank you so much for being with us.
