Exploding in popularity here in the U.S. with hit TV shows, fashion and beauty products, and a genre of music called K-pop. K-pop is performed in both Korean and English, and its stars are known as K-pop idols. Groups like BTS and Blackpink are now household names with top hits on international music charts. But the intense popularity of these K-pop idols also comes with intense pressure to succeed. Many start their careers as teenagers and have to navigate school and training inside of a strict work culture. Over the next hour, CNN's Kyung Lah takes us to Seoul as she follows a group of mostly teenage girls hoping to make the cut for a new group that will debut this April.
