Now, just as an example of how tenuous these talks can be, Hamas sources say stepped away or went dark from the negotiations at least once when Israel raided Al-Shifa Hospital. Another key issue that sources pointed to was how to implement the deal, including aid shipments. Now, U.S. officials have stressed that this is something they are working on minute by minute, hour by hour, over the course of multiple days. And the president, when asked about it on Sunday, said that he couldn't share anything as of yet, but what is clear is that all of this is going on behind the scenes intensively as they try to reach some resolution on the hostages who are still held by Hamas.

The Thanksgiving holiday here in the United States, of course, right around the corner. So, easier travel for thousands of people who are coming to our corner of the country for a warmer holiday with their friends and family. Also easier for the people who live in and around downtown L.A. who don't have the luxury of staying home and working through zoom. Finally, the structural tests off the concrete coming back much better than expected. All of those things discussed by not only the governor of California, but the vice president of the United States. Listen. KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT:  I was acutely aware of what closure of the 10 would mean for so many people, hardworking people, families, many people who, when it was shut down, they can't work from home, their work requires them to be present. GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA):  You can be assured of one thing, safety first, quality, foundational in this effort. It wasn't just speed that we were after. We wanted to make sure this thing was safe.",

And then down to the south, the main concern is actually going to be the potential for severe thunderstorms. The main threats there will be damaging winds, hail, and even some isolated tornadoes, especially places like Shreveport up to Memphis and all the way back down to New Orleans.The timeline there is really going to be the afternoon and continuing into Monday evening as that low pressure system continues to progress eastward. By Tuesday, now the big concern is going to be a lot of the folks traveling in the air. A lot of those connecting hubs like Chicago, Atlanta, Charlotte up through Washington, D.C and New York could all end up seeing some delays as we go through the day, Tuesday and even continuing into Tuesday night. And by Wednesday morning, we start to see more of the impacts across areas of the Northeast. So, for Monday specifically, we're looking at more of the delays early in the morning, still out west places like Denver, where you've got the rain snow mix, Las Vegas for high winds. By the time we get later into the day Monday, now, you're talking more of the Midwest and the southeast.

Some of the world's university scientists are embarking on an ambitious quest to find new water sources.In Abu Dhabi, researchers have discovered a hopeful solution amid the arid desert. They're turning to the resilient power of desert plants to combat the pressing issue of water scarcity. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELENI GIOKOS, CNN ANCHOR (voiceover):  Marieh Al-Handawi, a scientist from NYU Abu Dhabi, is going in search of new water sources. Gathering her research tools, she's heading into the desert. She is here to study a plant that thrives in this arid climate. MARIEH AL-HANDAWI, POST-DOCTORAL ASSOCIATE, NYU ABU DHABI:  I'm here to study these specific desert plants, or what we call them as halophytes. GIOKOS (voiceover):  Marieh is set to see how these plants have managed and adapted to survive in one of the world's harshest climates. To the naked eye, they don't look like much. But under a microscope camera, Marieh discovered a natural wonder. Entire branches covered in thousands of salt crystals. AL-HANDAWI:  These salt crystals are very hygroscopic, which means that they like to attract water from the air. And at very low humidity and condense that on the surface of the branch. And this is very important for the research that is being done in water -- to combat water scarcity. So, the idea is, we have this environmental friendly material that is excreted by these plants, these salt crystals that love water, and they can capture water from the air. GIOKOS (voiceover):  Marieh's findings have just been published in a scientific journal. She has further research to do but it's confident that after finding a desert plants that can harness water from the air, it will have positive implications for our water security. AL-HANDAWI:  Right now, we've discovered this natural system.",
