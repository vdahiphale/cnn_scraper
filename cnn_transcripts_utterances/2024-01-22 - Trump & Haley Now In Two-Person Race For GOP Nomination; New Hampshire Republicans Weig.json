And that railway transportation safety legislation co-sponsored in the Senate by Republican Senator Vance and Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, it's stalled. Why is it stalled? Who is behind stalling it? [16:30:06] PETE BUTTIGIEG, TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: Well, that's something that members of Congress need to answer. It's been almost a year, that clip that you just played of that resident speaking in the Senate about the need for this legislation. It was something like ten months ago and still there has been no action in Congress. It's striking to me that you have this bipartisan legislation that's just been sitting there waiting its turn. We've taken a lot steps as a department with the authorities we have under the current law, but we need Congress to do more and Congress could be doing more, right now. My question to anybody who is in a position to advance this, especially a number of House Republicans who have sought over the course of the last year to make a partisan issue out of the pain of what happened in East Palestine is what are you doing right now to make sure that we don't get to the one-year mark, which is just a few days away and still have no action.

Look, he pushed hard for this and the railroad industry lobby famously has had a lot of power. They helped in the last administration to weaken some railroad safety regulations. They've resisted some of the safety regulator patients that I and we at the Department of Transportation are continuing to advance.Now, in the Senate, at least there was that movement in committee. I think there's some question about whether to bring it to the floor, whether basically whether they're the 60 votes that you need in the Senate in order to get that done, as well as whether the House is ready. But this shouldn't be a bipartisan issue. I don't know why Republicans would be or should be any less likely to vote for this than Democrats. It's got bipartisan sponsorship. I think the vast majority of Americans believe in ought to be done. And part of how Congress and in this country need to do right by people in East Palestine, like the people who were interviewed there in addition to work that's being done to hold Norfolk Southern accountable for cleaning up the mess they made is to make sure that the next community doesn't go through that. Some of the provisions in this legislation include tougher penalties that could change the behavior of the railroad, accelerating the adoption of tank cars that would be stronger in many incidents and derailments that could lead to a hazardous materials release, making sure there are more requirements for letting emergency responders know when hazardous materials are coming through their community. We've already funded a lot of work to train first responders, but Congress could put way more teeth into those capabilities. It's long past time for there to be action.",

Glossip has rallied support from bipartisan state lawmakers, even Kim Kardashian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general admitted mistakes were made in his case and that he should not be executed.
