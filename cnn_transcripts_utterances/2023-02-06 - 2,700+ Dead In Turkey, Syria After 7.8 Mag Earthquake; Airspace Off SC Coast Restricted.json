Welcome to CNN NEWSROOM.Right now, there is a desperate search and rescue operation underway across Turkey and Syria after a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake ripped through the two countries before dawn, followed by a series of powerful aftershocks. The death toll now tops 2700 and will likely keep rising as crews dig through the rubble. More than 120 aftershocks hit after the earthquake, including one almost as powerful as the initial quake itself. Buildings crumble to the ground with people fear trapped inside. Others nearby have to run for their lives. Rescuers trying to reach those who are stuck under piles of concrete and debris. Like this little boy in northern Syria. You can just make him out in this video here buried under the wreckage. Thankfully, he was pulled to safety. Rescuers also pulling this little girl from the debris in another Syrian city. The U.S. and other countries are offering whatever help they can. And President Biden said he has directed his team to provide any and all assistance immediately. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh in Istanbul, Turkey. And, Jomana, search, and rescue teams are being deployed throughout that city. What is the latest? You have been reporting on this all day for us.",

You've got impacted areas in government- control parts of Syria as well as the very vulnerable areas in northwestern Syria that are under opposition control.These are parts of the country where you have more than 4 million people who have been displaced by war. People who had nothing, and now they are finding themselves in this situation and they just don't have the resources and the capabilities to deal with this disaster. We are getting information every few minutes this ductile that is continuing to rise. According to Turkish officials, more than 1600 people confirmed killed in Turkey, more than a thousand also confirmed killed in Syria as well. And you've got the search and rescue operations continuing with thousands of buildings destroyed, damaged, and many, many buildings just completely flattened across this earthquake zone. It's a very, very complex and really challenging rescue -- search and rescue operation, Bianna. They're facing many challenges right now. Those aftershocks that you mentioned, more than 100 aftershocks reported by Turkish officials, making it very, very difficult for the rescue crews to try and pull people from under the rubble. It is nighttime right now, also another challenge. And then you've got the weather conditions. There's a severe winter storm that is impacting that part of the country as well as many parts of Turkey as well. And also in Syria, temperatures expected to drop below freezing, and then you've got snow, making it very difficult for these crews to reach a lot of these areas. Again, we're talking about a massive area that is impacted and they are trying to reach as many of these areas as possible. And then reports of roads blocked in many areas. Absolutely, a devastating situation, Bianna, as well. You know, when you look at the millions of people who live in the earthquake zone both in Syria and Turkey. People will be outdoor in this kind of weather tonight as authorities are scrambling to set up shelters and awaiting the international response from countries in different organizations, including NATO and the EU that will be supporting Turkey through this disaster, Bianna.",

There's -- you know, the fault on which this happened is quite long, and it could be continued -- you know, continue to have another earthquake on the next section over. So, the aftershocks are already dying off. The first day has most of them, the second day will have half the number of the first one, the third day will actually have a third of the number. It's a one-over- time decay. So, it will be getting better but it is a big sequence and will be continuing to be part of the -- will have to be taken into account in the search and rescue.",

Clearly, they weren't up to standards now.I know an initial Turkish assessment showed that almost 3000 buildings had been destroyed across the affected areas. And that's what we know in just the last 24 hours. How much of the fault lies with the government itself in terms of seismologists giving warnings that this was to come and clearly a lot of these buildings were not up to standard?",

So, if these buildings were built before the current codes came into place, it just doesn't apply. The same thing is true everywhere else in the world, in California as well. We have buildings we know are going to collapse but that doesn't make them disappear.The question -- I mean, there's -- it could either be that it's too old the building that something in the modern code didn't take something into advance, in which case, we -- the engineers are going to be in there trying to understand that. We need to ignore it. There's also a possibility that the designs were not followed or the construction was substandard.

But if you're right on top of it is. And it looks like four and a half million people received shaking strong enough to build -- to -- you know, destroy an older building, which is called intensity seven. It's not magnitude but an intensity scale. And four and a half million people were subjected to it just in this one earthquake. So, yes, that's the sort of number.

Republicans have been slamming President Biden for not bringing the balloon down sooner, learned about it last Tuesday. Now, the balloon floated across the continental U.S. before fighter planes took it down over the water this weekend.CNN's Carlos Suarez is in South Carolina tracking the recovery effort, and CNN's Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon.

We are at a boat ramp about 21 miles from the main debris site out here in South Carolina where the Navy has pre- positioned some equipment as well as personnel. We were here last night when teams were coming back in after a good day's work out here.What's taking place up here about 21 miles north of the main site is they're essentially just having all of this staff and equipment ready to head out if it's necessary. We spotted a couple of members out here wearing the Navy's dive and salvage unit gear. Those are the folks that would be called out to take a look at exactly what kind of debris is at the bottom of the ocean out here, and just how they might be able to free it up. Now, just earlier this afternoon, we were told that it does seem that the Navy has been able to narrow the field down where this debris is sitting right now. It's about 10 to maybe 15 miles off the coast of South Carolina. And it seems that they've been able to take it from about seven miles in length to a little bit further down. We're told that right now, the Navy is using one of its ships to scan the bottom of the ocean to get a better sense of just how much equipment is out there. Now, yesterday at this very same location, this is where we were told that some debris was possibly found by the army. We did reach out to them for confirmation on that after getting a piece of video showing what appeared to be some sort of white material onboard the back of one of their boats.

That's -- if we doubt that, then of course, you can say they should have shot it down earlier.But my point is, I think it was an opportunity, once we conclude it. And again, they've got to prove this to the satisfaction of Congress, once they concluded it poses no intelligence threat that we couldn't stop or intercept or take advantage of, then I think it made sense to let it go out and then shoot it down so we could recover it.
