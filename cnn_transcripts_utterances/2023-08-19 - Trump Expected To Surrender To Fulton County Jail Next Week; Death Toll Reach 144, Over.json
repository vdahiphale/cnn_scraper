In fact, you can no longer just drive up to the jail where the former president is expected to turn himself in. Two deputies now sit at the end of the driveway limiting access. We've also learned the Secret Service as visited the Fulton County Jail, to work with Sheriff Department officials to get an evaluation of the current security situation and determine what needs to be done to protect the former president. Jail insiders believe the process for Donald Trump will clearly be shorter than what a normal person would go through in the process. And as of right now of checking the jail website, none of the names of the people indicted have been included and the names of people who have been booked. Obviously next week will be very busy.

While you could make that information available to the defense team, there's no reason to publish it generally, for all the public to look at. And I think they're an outlier here. And most places do not do that for the grand jury secrecy. Maybe the foreperson signs, but having everybody's name put out there as a matter of practice, doesn't seem to serve any good purpose.

During a pre-trial hearing where several decisions were made on several motions, the judge slated jury selection for one week before the trial is set to start in October, saying he expects to bring in potentially a thousand potential jurors at this point, and that may not even be enough.Now, one of the key issues discussed during that pre-trial hearing was Kohberger's alibi. His defense team has said he likes to take long drives in the middle of the night, and that's exactly what he was doing the night of the murders. Well, now the state is saying that the defense is taking too long to submit a witnesses list of list of people who may have seen him driving that night, and that there's not enough time for the state to prepare for cross-examination before the trial. The judge ruled that Bryan Kohberger has until the beginning of September to submit witnesses for an alibi if he has any. There were also some other procedural items that were brought up, the defense wants more information from prosecutors about how they came to the conclusion that Kohberger is the suspect in this case based on DNA. They brought in expert witnesses to explain why they should have more information, saying it's going to help the defense decide what experts to bring in for trial. A judge did not make a decision regarding that motion, but Victor, Amara, it does appear that this is moving very quickly towards a trial, which is set to start on October 2nd. and very important to remember, this is a death penalty case.
