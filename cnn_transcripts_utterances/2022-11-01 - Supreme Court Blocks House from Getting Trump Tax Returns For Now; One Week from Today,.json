At that point, the Democratic- led House was conducting several different efforts to try to get they are hands on some of the former president's financial records.In this specific case, though, the House Ways and Means Committee argued that it needed access to the former president's tax returns because it wanted to assess how the IRS audited presidential tax returns. The former president's attorneys argued that was just pretext to get their hands on the former president's financial documents. But lower courts have said that, in fact, the committee could obtain these documents until the Supreme Court intervened here and put a temporary pause on this. Now, Erica, if the Supreme Court affirms this lower court ruling, if this is allowed to stand, it is significant, because if the House Ways and Means Committee is allowed to obtain these tax returns from the former president, that really would represent a significant chipping away at some of the protections that are afforded to sitting presidents and it would signal a real boost to Congress' over site powers. So, we'll see what the Supreme Court does here. This is just temporary.",

Elie, when we look at this too, I think it might be helpful just to remind us all the reason that they said, as Paula laid out there, the House Ways and Means Committee said they want to look into how the IRS is going through the tax returns. If and when they actually do get those tax returns, they have to remain secret. That is part of the deal, correct?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Erica, that is absolutely right. So, first of all, the law here is clearly, in my view, on the House Ways and Means Committee's side. The law says that, if requested by the House Ways and Means Committee, the IRS shall furnish the tax returns over to the committee, shall furnish. All the judges who have looked at this so far, we had a trial court judge and three appellate court judges have said, shall furnish, means shall furnish.But if those tax returns do go over to the committee, it's really important to know, the law says the committee has to keep those tax returns confidential, and as Paula just said, the committee has said in court papers, our purpose here is not to investigate Donald Trump, not to try to expose his finances, but because we're considering legislation about potential audits of presidents and presidential candidates. So, even if they get those returns, if they're following the law at the committee, those won't leak out into the public.",

Certainly, if that is a Republican-controlled House, this subpoena will be gone. Even if it is a Democratic-controlled House, they will still have to renew this subpoena.Now, what the Supreme Court has done for now is temporarily paused the lower court's rulings, that the Ways and Means Committee gets the tax returns. The Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts have said, hold on, we're going to put this on temporary pause because we want to decide whether we should take up the case and make a decision on it ourselves. It looks to me like the chief justice, by setting the fairly quick, short turnarounds, understands that and understands that if he lets this drag out past January 3rd, 2023, it will be mooted. So, that's how I look at the decision today from Chief Justice Roberts in saying, hold on, don't turn the documents over just yet. We have to decide whether we want to wade into this.

Good to see you this morning. The president is set to talk about some things that are pretty important to him. He's on the trail this week. And as we're looking at what is coming, there is talk as we know, about Medicare, potential changes to Medicare, some of those changes from Rick Scott, who actually said over the weekend, he didn't foresee making those cuts, a lot of people in his party have pushed back against it. And yet, this is a real talking point right now. Is this just to scare voters?",

      "sentences": "No, absolutely not. It is good to be here.I think it's important to start by putting this in perspective. We are making some real progress on the economy right now. We saw the economy grow 2.6 percent last quarter, gas prices are coming down and the job market continues to be strong, but at same time, prices are the top issue on the minds of American families, it is the top issue for the president as well. And so what the president is trying to underscore is the choice that is clear is that his policies are focused on bringing down costs and bringing down the price for American families. Medicare is case in point. He fought for and secured reforms to prescription drugs so that Medicare, for the first time, could actually negotiate better prices for prescription drugs. Republicans in Congress have made clear that is a top priority for them to repeal that provision. That would that mean that Medicare would no longer have that ability and that prices for drugs will be higher. And beyond that, but what Senator Scott and others have made clear, is they would like to see a vote in Congress every five years to continue to sustain and continue to affirm social security and Medicare. That means that every five years, there would be debate about whether to change or alter or cut Medicare and social security. That's a big policy difference and it's one of several that affects this question of cost for the American people. HILL:  So, why not more of a focus on that earlier on in the campaign, even in just the last few weeks? Why is it now today becoming much more of a push when we only have one week to go and so many have voted early?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's a great question. And, again, I think we have to start with some context. This president has been focused on what he can do and the tools he can use to try to bring down the cost of gas at the pump and we've made significant progress. Since the beginning of the summer, where the average price of the pump was over $5, we're now down more than $1.25. And people are seeing the benefit of those lower gas prices at the pump today. And in no small part of that is because of the actions the president has taken, including using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.But part of the reason why gas prices haven't come down even further is because there is a historically high profit margin for every gallon of gases being sold. Wholesale prices have come down because oil prices have come down. But those prices at the pump haven't come down to where they would be if the profit margins were at historical level. So, what you heard the president say yesterday was clear. He is urging the industry to do what is right and bring those profit margins down, pass on more of that savings to consumers at the pump. If they do so, then they still will be making a significant profit. But they also will be providing more of that benefit to consumers particularly at a moment where we have a war in Europe that is driving prices up. And that is what he wants to see. And if the industry is not willing or able to take those steps, then he said he's going to work with Congress to look at what options he can pursue. But the president has been focused on that core issue for the last nine months, which is what we could do to try to actually make sure that American consumers are getting some relief. The good news is they are in a significant way but we need to make more progress on that front.",

And I think that really tells you where we are in our politics today, that you have these candidates knowing that the reaction of the audience there, with Kari Lake, is going to be that this is somehow funny and they get rewarded for that within the base. And you saw obviously Donald Trump also being asked about this attack and saying that it was terrible, but then immediately pivoting to the violence in San Francisco as though this was just some random act of crime, which, of course, we know from investigators that it was not.
