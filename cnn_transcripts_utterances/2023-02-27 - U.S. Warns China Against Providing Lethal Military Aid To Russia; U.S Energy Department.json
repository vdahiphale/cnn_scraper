I'll ask key White House National Security Official John Kirby whether Beijing is actively considering sending lethal aid to Putin's forces.Also tonight, a new assessment on the origins of the COVID pandemic is stirring up major controversy. We'll tell you why the U.S. Energy Department now believes the virus likely emerged from a Chinese lab. And breaking news, new legal filings in the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit against Fox News, the Fox chairman, Rupert Murdoch, admitting under oath that popular T.V hosts endorsed false claims about the 2020 presidential election. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world, I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin our coverage tonight with the war in Ukraine, the deepening alliance between Russia and China sending chills throughout the U.S. Intelligence Community. Our Senior National Security Correspondent Alex Marquardt has the latest from the war zone and CNN's Kylie Atwood is working her sources right here in Washington. First to you, Kylie, over at the State Department, how urgent is this push to deter China from sending lethal aid to Russia?",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NICHOLAS BURNS, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO CHINA:  We fear they may be contemplating providing lethal assistance to the Russian government for its unjust and brutal war in Ukraine, and that's a direct warning that our president, our secretary of state have made, that I have made, on their behalf to the government here.",

And in it, Rupert Murdoch, he acknowledges that some of his top hosts over at Fox News were peddling false election claims. This comes in a deposition that we're seeing as a result of this new legal filing. I want to read to you part of it, Wolf. In it, Rupert Murdoch was asked by Dominion, you were aware now that Fox did more than simply host these guests and give them a platform, correct? And Murdoch goes on and says, in fact, you are now aware that Fox endorsed at times this false notion of a stolen election. Murdoch says not Fox, not Fox, but maybe Lou Dobbs, maybe Maria Bartiromo as commentators. And then it goes on, and they mentioned Jeanine Pirro, a Fox News Host, he says I think she did as well, Lou Dobbs, oh, a lot, Fox Host Sean Hannity, a bit.And then it goes on to say, as well about Fox endorsing the narrative of a stolen election, correct? Rupert Murdoch answers, no, some of our commentators were endorsing it. And Dominion says, about their endorsements of a stolen election? Rupert Murdoch said, yes, they endorsed. This also comes as the deposition reveals again the disdain that Rupert Murdoch had for these election lies. He referred to them at one point as B.S. and damaging in an e-mail, and he's also said that he wishes the network did more to tamp down these conspiracy theories. Of course, hindsight, Wolf, is 20/20, and when you're being sued for $1.6 billion, that might result in you whishing it did things a different way.",

If the jury decides that this conduct was egregious enough and much that is in here continues to be shocking, that's bristling, almost 200 pages, every page has a Perry Mason moment, if the jury decides that it was bad enough conduct, they can double or triple that $1.6 billion or go even higher.

And he came out in support in providing evidence of the defense theory that was floated much earlier on in the trial, suggesting that there were two shooters. We know there were two weapons. Maggie murder was shot in a rifle. And Paul Murdaugh was shot with a shotgun.But he said this would have been so harmful to the person who killed Paul Murdaugh. It was such a violent shooting. His brain, as we know, was blown out of his head. So we know that, according to this witness, that there would have been blood on this person, possibly bone, brain matter. He said blood in their eyes even. So they wouldn't have been able to recover so quickly in order to then go on and kill Maggie Murdaugh. They do believe Paul Murdaugh was shot first. So, that was part of it as well. Also he said there were two guns, a shotgun and a rifle. That's a lot for one person to handle. Following him, John Marvin Murdaugh, who is one of the brothers of Alex Murdaugh, testified. He was the last witness of the day, the last defense witness. He told the jury that he made a promise to Paul Murdaugh that he would find out who killed him and his mother. He said he hasn't found that person yet. He also described in very emotionally what it was like to go to the scene, the feed room where Paul Murdaugh was killed. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN MARVIN MURDAUGH, ALEX MURDAUGH'S BROTHER:  I walked over to the feed room, and y'all have heard the descriptions, y'all saw it. I've never seen pictures and I've told him before coming to this court that I was not going to see pictures. But y'all can imagine what I experienced. It had not been cleaned up. I saw blood, I saw brains, I saw pieces of skull. And when I say brains, it could just be tissue. I don't know. It was terrible. And, for some reason, I thought it was something that I needed to do for Paul to clean it up. It felt like it was the right thing to do. I felt like I owed him. And I started cleaning. And I promise you no mother or father or aunt or uncle should ever have to see and do what I did that day. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Winds around 75, 80 miles an hour, perhaps higher in the heart of this storm. But that's what wind speeds were averaging at in many places as this storm line moved across Oklahoma ravaging the state over several hours Sunday night, the destruction is, in this particular area, in the isolated areas where tornados like this hit, very intense destruction, as we've seen. People described being inside their homes feeling everything just shaking violently as the tornado quickly ripped through here. Several homes shifted off of their foundation. But unbelievably, Wolf, only 12 people injured, none of them critically here in the area. And there were no fatalities associated with this storm system as it moved across the state on Sunday night. Really stunning, especially when you consider the wind speeds that we saw. When this storm originated in the Texas Panhandle, there was a small town in the panhandle there called Memphis, Texas, that recorded a wind gust of 114 miles per hour. That is the kind of wind speed in storms that we see covering hurricanes, not necessarily in a storm system cutting across the Central Plains of the United States. So some really dramatic moments in this storm as people were dealing with this Sunday night -- Wolf.",
