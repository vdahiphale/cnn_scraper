At the time, we recorded ourshow Hurricane Idalia was expected to intensify before hitting Florida`s Gulf Coast. The storm is predicted to hit the coast of Florida early Wednesday at Category 3 strength and will come with powerful winds and life-threatening storm surge. Idalia`s storm track is especially interesting because it`s the first major hurricane in at least 172 years to head toward Apalachee Bay in the Big Bend region of Florida. It`s a marshy coastal area, and though it`s not densely populated, it is home to all sorts of wildlife and nature areas. Another concerning aspect of this storm is that over the summer water temperatures around Southern Florida climbed to 100 degrees and temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico overall have hit record temperatures. Warm waters tend to act almost like fuel for hurricanes and Idalia could strengthen as it approaches. Preparations for the storm have been underway. People in at least 22 counties along the Gulf Coast were told to evacuate their homes, air and train travel have halted across the state. In 42 districts, schools have closed. And the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis, had declared a state of emergency in 67 counties when we recorded our show. The National Guard was also activated to assist with storm response. We`ll keep you updated over the next few days. Our Meteorologist Jennifer Gray has more on what you need to know about hurricanes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The state`s most frequently hit by a hurricane Florida, Louisiana and Texas. But as much as we know about hurricanes forecasting them is still a challenge. Just as we name each storm, each storm has its own personality, like Katrina in 2005, which intensified rapidly overnight going from a Category 3 to a Category 5, it became the fourth most intense hurricane on record as of that time. And the forecast track can change dramatically, like Erika and 2015, or a system that can be viewed as relatively weak like a tropical storm could end up like Tropical Storm Allison in 2001. The remnants of the storm stalled over Southeast Texas dumping 35 inches of rain over Houston in just five days. The storm became the first non- hurricane to have its name retired. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
