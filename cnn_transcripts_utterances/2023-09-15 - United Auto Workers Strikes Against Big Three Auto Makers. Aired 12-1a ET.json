Between the three, about 13,000 members. The question is, Laura, how much of a disruption is that going to cause to the auto manufacturing industry here in the United States? Because obviously, when cars can't be finished, if certain parts can't be made, it could shut the whole process down across the country. There's concern about that and about the economic impacts. But that's not what tonight is about, as you can hear -- you can hear the energy, people who are excited. And it seems like they are ready for this to potentially last a while. How long is a mystery.

Thank you for bringing that to our attention and reminding us, congresswoman. Also, though, among the UAW's demands is a 40 percent pay increase over a four-year period. It also includes the restoration of cost-of- living pay raises, a 32-hour work week with 40 hours of pay. Are these fair asks?",

Three plants, between the Big Three in three different states, are on strike. There's oftentimes no question from large automakers when they decide to permanently close plants. We've seen that happen in droves over the next 10, 15 years, dozens of plants shutting down. This has continued to happen in the industrial Midwest, while record profits are -- are received by the large companies. And I'm proud of Michigan manufacturers. I'm so caught up in the moment we're in. We were the ones who rose to the industrial call to action during the pandemic. We've continued to grow in industry, out of a managed bankruptcy, that I worked on in President Obama's administration. I saw the UAW make concessions alongside many stakeholders. And now, it's time to get their share. A strike is painful, but the outcome in the long-term benefits of this, not just for the workers but for our economy as a whole, are on the horizon.",

We're seeing some signs of progress, when we hear that the companies are willing to meet on increased wages. But the tier -- the tier system that the UAW is asking for, certainly COLA, bringing COLA back, which was -- got negotiated as off the table 14 years ago, we'd like to see that come back. And again, I'm not negotiating this deal, but I am standing by the UAW. And I think people should listen to Mr. Fain right now and what he's pushing for, see him with the UAW workers who are shaking his hand, who are appreciating someone who's of the UAW, working alongside his brothers and sisters and not just shaking hands with politicians or other VIPs.

TODD DUNN, PRESIDENT OF UAW LOCAL 862, LOUISVILLE, KY: You know, we really live and breathe over the last two years, trying to represent our membership, get them prepared, while simultaneously trying to be super transparent with the membership. We get all of the resolutions and take care of them, get them where it needs to be. And we're not -- we're not exhausted by any means. We're ready to go as far as it takes, to get an agreement. We're mindful of the process. We're mindful of the families that it's affecting. We know there's a lot of uncertainties out there. But right now, we are focusing, even with not being selected as a current target. We're focusing on trying to put together the best plan forward so we can continue to keep the perimeter on our members in our local. And I feel that we're there. We're just going to have to continue to push forward. COATES: And Todd, just so people can understand, because you heard from the UAW president, talking about the individual locations that are going to be striking. You are not at one of those facilities, but I do wonder, just to fully understand it, what does that mean for those -- those areas that have not been targeted specifically to strike?

We've got almost 9,000 UAW members working. Of course, the Kentucky truck plant represents almost 54,000 -- I'm sorry, 54 percent of all the North American profits, right, for Ford Motor Company. So that engine, Ford Motor Company, wants to keep turning as much as possible.

There's so much more that's happening. Gabe, you just had a chance to talk to Shawn Fain. He is the person that to speak to. He is demanding that they come to the table for the members.

The question has been this tactical strike, Laura, what will the impact be? How much of a hit will the auto industry take if, perhaps, they can't get certain parts, or they can't finish cars, if they can't get them off the line? It's a question of what will be the ripple effect through not just the auto industry but the greater economy? And yes, as we just heard from Shawn Fain, he's saying, Look, we're starting with three facilities, but it could grow from there. And that's got to be a scary thing to hear if you're the CEO of one of these three big automakers, who have said they can't afford to meet the demands that UAW has put forward, that the union has put forward, that 40 percent pay increase in the next few years, as well as retirement benefits, cost-of-living adjustments. They said they can't meet all of those demands. It will bankrupt them. But also, it's difficult imagine -- to imagine they could afford to allow a strike like this to linger.

Because look, there are two real constituencies at play here, and we can't overstate the significance of a historic strike like this, in a summer, by the way of strikes or potential strikes. If you are President Biden looking at this politically through that lens, you've called yourself the most pro-union president in the history of America. You promoted green policy energy.

These are young workers and older workers, people from all different races, people of different genders. And they're all standing up for what they believe is right, and that's a fair living wage. So, President Biden has to support the workers at this moment. Michigan is a battleground state, but so are so many other states that have strong union backgrounds, just like my home state of Ohio. And so, these workers are not asking for drastic changes. They're asking for things that the average American respects and supports. And so if President Biden stands with the workers, as he has so many other times, I think it will fare well for him politically in the long run, because nobody wants to the rich just to keep getting richer and the poor to keep on suffering.",

And then the Big Three say, well, you know, we'll go bankrupt. Well, we would say the math ain't math-ing here. Right? Because it seems like you continue to make more money, but the workers are not getting the fair -- their fair share. Now, the challenge that Joe Biden will have on this -- this campaign is to help connect the dots that this is not his fault. This is the CEOs fault, and I'm with you, the workers. Whether you're an auto worker, whether you're a caregiver, whether you're a grocery store worker, if you're in a union, I'm with you. And inflation is high. I'm working to keep it down, but I'm also working with and standing with you to make sure your wages go up. And that's a winning argument.",

But they had to come back to the taxpayers to make this right. So I think, really, it's in everybody's interest to resolve this situation as quickly as possible for the benefit of the broader American economy. I understand they want -- the workers want more money. Everybody wants more money. But, you know, we are dealing with a difficult economy, despite what many are saying about how rosy it is.

Let me begin with you here, Ron, because you have got now -- we're seeing history being made, the three auto worker makers, the strike of the UAW, a president who calls himself the most labor -- the pro-labor and pro-union president of all times.

Over $140 billion in investment from private companies in clean energy vehicles alone, just since he took office. But, Laura, most of that money is going into red states, whose political representatives oppose the programs that are -- that are generating the investment, and which are also right-to-work states where it is hard for unions to organize. That is the backdrop for this strike. The UAW's fear is that the auto industry is using one transition, a technological transition, from the internal combustion engine to the E.V., to mask a second transition, which is moving more of their production out of unionized facilities into either non-union joint venture projects in the North, or into the South. And they are worried that they -- the administration is inadvertently financing this transition, because there is an enormous amount of money going to the companies to finance the construction of these new E.V. plants. So I think getting this right is going to be critical not only for Biden but for, really, any future Democratic president, if they are going to sustain support for this long-term transition they want in our energy economy.",

This -- this tension between the transition to electric vehicles versus traditional automobiles, I think, is culturally significant, economically significant. And I agree with him on the backdrop.I also think that there's something to be said just about the current economic conditions in the country. I mean, we're living through massive inflation during Joe Biden. These workers know that. They're asking for big raises, over 40 percent, and they want to be paid five days a week for working four. [00:50:13] I think a lot of it has to do with, frankly, the inflationary pressures that are on top of the shoulders of average, everyday working people, which these UAW people are. So if you're looking for the political implications of it, obviously, the Republicans are pounding Joe Biden over inflation. And the inflation polling on this shows it's the single biggest drag on his economic approval, is the view that he just has caused, or at least not done enough to control inflation. So we'll see how long this strike goes on, but I largely agree with Ron. This is a fraught moment for Joe Biden. He's already pretty soft in terms of his own job approval. I think his campaign right now is suffering some internal strife from his own party. And you throw this on top of it, which could cause a further softening in the economy.

Well, a few weeks ago, the Energy Department put down $15 billion between the infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act, to encourage the companies not to open new plants that might be joint ventures and non-unionized or in right-to-work states, but to retool their existing unionized plants to build the -- you know, the key components of the E.V.s, particularly the batteries. So Shawn Fain's message to Biden, I think, has gotten through, that the administration needs to be aware of kind of the larger implications of what this E.V. transition might -- might mean.
