For weeks now, the Biden administration has been pressing the Israeli Prime Minister to strike a deal with Hamas for a ceasefire and release of hostages held in Gaza. Many Israelis have been making similar demands for months. But at the same time, pressure is growing on Benjamin Netanyahu from within his own far-right coalition to reject any deal and instead ramp up the military intensity and launch a major ground offensive on Rafah, the southern Gaza city home to almost one and a half million displaced Palestinians.And both publicly and privately, the White House has voiced its opposition to a wide-scale military incursion into Rafah. And on Monday, Netanyahu appeared to give in to demands from within his coalition, announcing a date has been set, but not the actual date, for a ground operation into Rafah. But according to the State Department, Israel has not provided the US with any details about the actual date or any credible plan for evacuating civilians away from the line of fire and to relative safety. As for ceasefire and hostage negotiations, a source says during weekend talks in Cairo, CIA Director Bill Burns presented a new proposal to try and bridge the gap. Here's Netanyahu's reaction to that news. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISREALI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Today, I received a detailed report on the talks in Cairo. We are constantly working to achieve our goals, primarily the release of all our hostages and achieving a complete victory over Hamas. This victory requires entry into Rafah and the elimination of the terrorist battalions there. It will happen. There is a date. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, this idea of supporting this kind of national abortion ban really opened the door for Democrats to attack him on an issue that has plagued Republicans. It also enabled Democrats to link him to some really unpopular abortion policies. It required Donald Trump to come out and kind of give a concrete stance on where he stood on abortion.

The 20- page document called, Dignitas Infinata, which means infinite dignity, lays out where the church stands on inherent and unalienable worth and rights afforded to every person. It reads, in part, any sex change intervention as a rule risk threatening the unique dignity the person has received from the moment of conception. CNN Vatican correspondent Christopher Lamb has more details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Gender theory, surrogacy, and gender-affirming health care are all violations of human dignity, according to a new Vatican document. The declaration, which was signed off and approved by Pope Francis, lists the gender theory alongside other violations of human dignity, such as abortion and euthanasia. The document also includes, however, social issues, such as the plight of migrants, the violence against women, and the death penalty, saying that these issues are also important and the Catholics should not simply focus on abortion and euthanasia.Whilst the document is critical of gender theory, it does include a strong condemnation of the criminalization of transgender sex. The document also includes a strong condemnation of the homosexuality in certain countries around the world, something that Pope Francis spoke about in 2023 ahead of a trip to Africa. Cardinal Fernandez presented the document, said he was shocked that some Catholics were supportive of these laws criminalizing homosexuality. The document appears to be a balancing of both Pope Francis's desire to maintain Catholic teaching and doctrine, but also his pastoral welcome to same-sex Catholics and LGBTQ+ believers. This document comes in the months after the Vatican issued a groundbreaking text offering blessings to same-sex couples, something that sent shockwaves through the church, and allowing for trans Catholics to act as godparents at baptisms. So, with this document, we see a reaffirmation of Catholic teaching and doctrine, but at the same time a desire to apply that in a pastoral and compassionate way. Christopher Lamb, CNN.

Did we mention there was a rare total solar eclipse across North America on Monday, plunging parts of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada into darkness in the middle of the day? Millions of people were treated to spectacular views as the moon blocked the sun. An estimated 32 million people were in the path of totality. But it wasn't just humans who were affected. Apparently, animals were seeing behaving in unusual ways, as well. Details from CNN's Ed Lavandera.
