There`s no denying it, the Nile isn`t just a river in Africa. It`s also the longest in the world at 4,160 miles flowing right into the Mediterranean sea. This flows right into our next story. The mighty Mississippi River is looking more like the minuscule Mississippi. In the Crescent City of new Orleans officials are saying that salt water from the Gulf of Mexico is threatening drinking water there. And in the surrounding region of Southern Louisiana. How did this water battle begin? Well where river and ocean meet the Mississippi is normally mighty enough to force the salt water to stay put out in the Gulf, but experts predict the Mississippi will reach historic lows over the next several weeks after this summer`s lower than average rainfall in the Midwest and a blistering heat wave. Well, the U.S. army Corps of Engineers are coming to help to battle the ocean water from creeping up the river. They`re building a levy and they`re barging in up to 36 million gallons of fresh water every day into area facilities to help supply people with drinking water. Now it is officially fall here in the United States, but we can already get an idea of what winter might look like. Let`s go now to our CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And consequently has a major influence on weather across the globe. So what should the U.S. expect this fall? Some forecasts indicate the possibility of abnormal dryness in the Northwest and Midwest and weather than normal conditions in the Southeast. Historically the wind shear produced by El Nino has meant fewer hurricanes for the Atlantic. Wind shear is the upper-level winds that tend to dissipate storm growth. However, warms fuel tropical storms. And this season ocean temperatures have hit record highs. Therefore, despite the Atlantic nearing the peak of hurricane season, hurricane activity is forecast to remain high until mid-October ending in late November. During a typical El Nino winter, the U.S. experiences a cooler than average south at a warmer than average north. It also has the most influence over precipitation in the us during the cool months often resulting in wetter than average conditions across the Southern tier from the Southwest to the Southeast.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEVON RODRIGUEZ, ARTIST (voice-over):  I grew up in New York and I`ve been taking the subway since I was a child. You could see anything and everything on the subway. You could have a homeless person next to a millionaire and you could have, you know, somebody with a fully tattooed face next to like a conservative guy. And to me, that`s beautiful. These are like the people that I love. These are the people that I grew up around. These are the people that run society. So this is what I wanted to present. (On camera):  Excuse me, sir.

It`s just like a -- it`s probably like a niche thing. So I was thinking, how could I mix that with something that most people would enjoy and make it digestible to people. So I`m mixing the drawing, but for them it`s more about the humanity of it and making somebody feel seen. The shock value of it and the wholesome quality of it.",

It might give them a different perspective. The whole show is called Underground, because I went around the world, traveling the underground worlds. And the second meaning is I feel like I`m an underground artist, because I never really had any work in any gallery or had a solo exhibition. Here from the Bronx that was on welfare and food stamps in this, you know, gate kept industry. I always felt like -- I always just felt like I -- I didn`t belong. I feel like I`ve been prepping for this moment since I was like 14, since I started painting for this show, I really had to show people, you know, what I`m capable of because people think that I`m just like this TikToker overnight success. But, you know, I feel like I have more depth than that. I really wanted to put all my effort so that people could see and hopefully they like it. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
