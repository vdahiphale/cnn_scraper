This is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Just ahead, breaking news out of Ukraine, officials say Russia has launched a massive strike on a military college. Plus, deadlock and doubling down, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu defends his strategy in Gaza despite days of protests, while Hamas makes new threats to harm the more than 100 hostages still held in Gaza. And then an attempted prison break in the Democratic Republic of Congo ends in horror. What are learning about, how the escape attempt unfolded, just ahead.We are getting early information about a Russian strike against a military college in central Ukraine. The country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy says at least 41 people have been killed. It is one of the biggest death tolls from a single attack of the war. This comes as the head of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog is on the ground in Ukraine, after officials warn the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is at, what they call, increased risk of danger. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is joining me now, live in Kyiv with more. Fred, what do we know about this attack?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Amara, as you mentioned, this is still obviously the very early stages and this information is really coming in fresh to us. We have gotten that information from Ukraine's president saying that 41 people, at least at this point in time have been confirmed to have been killed and about 180 have been injured in that attack. The details that we are getting so far, they are pretty scant, but we are getting some apparently, and this is according to the defense ministry of Ukraine. The Russians used two ballistic missiles to hit that military educational facility, apparently in this attack, the telecommunications institute of that facility was partially destroyed.Now, what the Ukrainians are saying is that the time between the air raid alerts that way and off and those missiles hitting was so short that many people were simply caught off guard as those missiles hit while they were trying to get to safety, trying to get to bomb shelters. We are getting some information also from the emergency services that are obviously working there on the ground now. They obviously say that they're -- people are sifting through the rubble, sifting through the debris, trying to get some people out, apparently there are still people who are trapped underneath the rubble. However, they say that because they were onsite so quickly, they managed to get 25 people out of the debris, some of them obviously stuck under larger pieces of debris. So, that operation is still very much ongoing. We've heard the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rip into the Russians for attacking this facility. The other thing that we also are looking at is what exactly the Russians are saying about this, Amara. And so far, there have been no comments from Russia's defense ministry or any other official channels. However, there is a very well-known Russian military blogger who did say that the Russian military fired ballistic missiles at this military installation. This is in the town of Poltava. Poltava, I would say, is about a four- hour, three-and-a-half to four-hour drive east of Kyiv. It's sort of locked between Kyiv and Kharkiv in pretty much in the center of the country and it is obviously a place that many people would go through when they go towards the eastern regions of the country of Ukraine as well. This, obviously, a big blow for the Ukrainians. That's something I think can already be said. And at the same time already, a lot of people here absolutely shocked at the fact that so many people were killed in this one attack, as you mentioned. Certainly one of the law largest attacks that we have seen here are one of the largest death tolls resulting from an attack that we've seen here in Ukraine in the past couple of months, Amara.",

      "sentences": "Well, over the past few days, we have seen hundreds of thousands of Israelis pour into the streets, not only of Tel Aviv, but in cities and towns across Israel, demanding that the Israeli prime minister prioritize a hostage deal and reach such a deal quickly, so that the remaining 101 hostages still in Gaza can come back, and so that most of them can come back alive rather than in body bags as we saw over this past weekend.But last night, we heard from the Israeli prime minister directly, and it appears that those cries, those chants, those protests from so many Israelis have fallen on deaf ears, as the Israeli prime minister acknowledged what -- the anger that he was hearing in the streets, acknowledged the grief of the families, but ultimately, doubled down on one of his key demands that has become a major sticking point in these negotiations, and that is Israeli control of the Gaza-Egypt border, that critical stretch of lands known as the Philadelphi Corridor. The Israeli prime minister going into detailed explanations of why he believes it is so critical for Israel's security that they maintain control of that corridor. But there is one major issue and that is the fact that the prime minister's security and defense establishment, his national security experts who are advising him, including the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, they believe privately at least, and some of them publicly, that Israel can return to that Philadelphi Corridor at a later date. And that right now, it is more important to reach a hostage such deal. And so, the Israeli prime minister doubling down on that notion, it leaves us at an impasse as Hamas continues to insist that Israeli troops do withdraw from that corridor during the first phase of an eventual ceasefire agreement. And so, even as there is an international effort to try and restart these hostage negotiations, the U.S. now expected since likely put a final proposal on the table to try and get these two sides to reach an agreement, it's very difficult to see where these talks can go from here as the Israeli prime minister digs in his heels, as Hamas shows no signs of budging from its demand that Israeli troops withdraw from that same area. And now, there is also heightened concern for the lives of the hostages after Hamas acknowledged that it executed those six hostages and warns that more hostages will return in coffins should Israel continue to try and free those hostages through military means rather than at the negotiating table.

They've seen a positive at turnout in the words of the U.N. Agency for Palestine Refugees. We've seen in videos of families lining up, waiting to have their children vaccinated. Just yesterday, we saw really workers visiting U.N. run schools, many of which have become shelters, of course, for civilians across the Gaza Strip who have been displaced, going classroom by classroom to vaccinate children under the age of ten.Of course, this is somewhat a sign of optimism there. They had projected around 150,000 immunizations to take place in the first two days of this vaccine rollout campaign. As you mentioned, they've reached at least 161,000 according to the World Health Organization, but they are aiming to vaccinate some 640,000 children over the course of this 12-day rollout program. That's over 90 percent of children under the age of ten in the Gaza Strip. And again, this is the first three days of what will be three phases. So currently, focusing on central Gaza, then moving on to southern Gaza, and then the third and final phase will focus or northern Gaza. So there is still a way to go and we've been hearing from officials from the World Health Organization warning that we still have to maintain a close eye on whether or not those pauses in fighting are actually maintained and respected. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. RIK PEEPERKORN, W.H.O. REPRESENTATIVE:  Until now, things are going well. Again, this is only the third day, so this area-specific humanitarian pauses, until now, they work.

But of course, it's important to note that there are logistical challenges ahead for relief workers on the ground. Not all of these medical points or vaccination points are actually located within humanitarian zones, so there are security concerns and that is why this pause in fighting, which will focus on these specific locations, is so crucial not only to ensure the safety and security of the family members who are, of course, queuing up, lining up to get their children vaccinated, but of course, for the relief workers on the ground who have to coordinate the logistics of not only getting to these locations, but also deploying and distributing these vaccines to those children in need.But again, it is a hugely important campaign, very urgent campaign according to U.N. officials.

So that gives you a sense of how close it is and why the -- now Harris campaign is pushing so hard to make sure that she can also pull in those labor groups.Now, she's also focusing on the economy to do just that. And that is something that we have seen her fine-tune her messaging on specifically focusing on affordability. And today, the campaign released yet another economy ad. This is one that's going to run between Labor Day through Election Day. It's also part of that broader strategy of ad-buy of $370 million, so they are being aggressive on the air waves just as much as they plan to be on the campaign trail. And Amara, it is also important to note that the economy, an issue that is top of mind for voters, is also one that she has lagged behind when compared to Former President Donald Trump. So that is where she is trying to get an edge in.

Now of course, this is a reproductive right where that's going to be primarily composed of surrogates, elected officials, and the campaign says celebrities. It's going to be at least 50 stops and it's going to run to Election Day. So clearly, they are trying to keep this issue front of mine. They know that it galvanized voters in 2022 and they want to try to replicate that now in 2024. And I should also mention this is an issue that the vice president was positioned to be the voice on at the start of the year when the then Biden campaign, she kicked off her own reproductive rights tour at the time, coining the term 'Trump abortion ban along the way.'So this is something that she herself has been a voice on and now.

That is those three Midwest states, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, as well as the Sun Belt states Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina. And for a time, there seemed to be a suggestion by the Trump campaign that the map for them could be expanding. We saw him hold rallies and suggest that Minnesota was in play. We saw him in Virginia, making a play for that state which hasn't been a battleground since the 2012 election.We've seen him attempt to turn the dial in New Hampshire. And for a while, his campaign was suggesting that we could be headed toward an electoral landslide. Obviously, so much has changed since the top of the Democratic ticket has switched from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris. And now, we are sort of seeing a retrenching in those more familiar battlegrounds and the Trump campaign over the next few days, really showing their cards here. He has a campaign rally -- or excuse me, at a town hall he is planning in Pennsylvania tomorrow. He is going to North Carolina to speak to police on Friday.

And so, yes, with Vice President Harris going to the steel city, to the home of the Pittsburgh Steelers to voice her opposition, yeah, this deal does look like it is very much in doubt.And look, it was controversial from the moment that Nippon Steel came out with this $14 billion takeover offer back in December. To try to address some of the these concerns, the company said that U.S. Steel would keep its iconic name, its headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh. But the deal has been delayed in terms of closing because it has to get sign off from regulators, not just the green light from the Justice Department, but also from CFIUS, that's the inter-agency panel that examines foreign investment in the United States. Now, as Vice President Harris acknowledged there, U.S. Steel is such an iconic company, right? I mean, when it was founded 123 years ago, it was the biggest company on the planet. It helped to make America into an economic superpower. Its steel went into roads and bridges and skyscrapers and appliances and cars, you name it. But, look, U.S. Steel, this company has been in decline, not for years, but really for decades. Consider that during World War II, it employed over 300,000 people. Now, less than 22,000. It has faced so much competition not just from overseas, but from U.S. rivals as well. So, production has fallen really sharply. And now, this deal faces a bipartisan backlash, right? Vice president Harris joins a long list of politicians opposing the deal, including her boss, President Biden, who came out back in March, in his own visit to Pittsburgh, against this deal. We've also heard from Rust Belt Democrats, including Sherrod Brown, John Fetterman, some Republicans including Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio, and the Republican ticket in Trump and Vance, they're all opposed.

Bush. And so, they feel like Biden is a key ally for them, especially in places like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, rust belt states especially since Biden is from Pennsylvania. Those are states that they are struggling with a bit more than places like the Sun Belt, so that's -- we are talking Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona. They seem to be slightly more ahead of Trump in those states.And so, they're having to focus on those north Midwestern states. And that's one reason they picked Tim Walz, who is the Governor of Minnesota because he is seen as someone who can reach out to those voters, for someone unlike Harris as much because she's from California.",

There's a new ABC News-Ipsos poll that is out and it showed -- it's another poll that shows that Kamala Harris didn't really get a convention bump, a post-convention bump. But this one does show that she has a narrow lead over Donald Trump, 50 percent to 46 percent Trump outside the margin of error. I guess, what is notable here is that there is a gender gap when you look at the polling, where Harris leads by 13 points with women whereas Trump, no surprise there, leads when it comes to men by five percentage points. But when we look at this gender gap for the women, I mean, this is not good news for Donald Trump, especially as Harris is embarking on her reproductive freedoms tour.",

And so, even though the supreme court ruling was a few years ago, Trump -- the Harris campaign is kind of pointing to Trump and saying, hey, he's all over the map on abortion rights. How can we trust him? He was the president who put three justices on the supreme court that took away that right.And then more recently, in the last ten days or so, he has talked about how he's going to be a great advocate for women and their reproductive rights. And so, I think that this is what happens at the end of an election cycle where candidates tack to the middle and appear more moderate. But I think that J.D. Vance, his running mate's comments decrying women who don't have kids, that's going to be hurtful for his campaign in the next few months.",
