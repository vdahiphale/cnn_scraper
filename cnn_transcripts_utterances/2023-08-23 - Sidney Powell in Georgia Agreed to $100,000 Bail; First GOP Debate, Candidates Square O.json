Let's say that we shifted the national vote back in 2020, let's say by .3 percentage points more Republican. What would we be looking at at the electoral college vote?We'd be looking at the Republican candidate getting 262. The Democratic candidate getting 266. And that would mean that Wisconsin, whoever won Wisconsin, would be the winner of the presidential election. And this idea of this tipping point state, that is Wisconsin being the ultimate arbiter of who wins the election held true in 2020 and it held true in 2016 as well. Wisconsin is a very important state for both the Republicans and the Democrats.",

So, I think from a big \"D,\" Democratic process, it's a mistake. And it's as with many things with Trump, sort of, flies in the face of certain American ideals.

They -- at the end of the day, didn't slash and burn each other as human beings.And we have devolved to this state wherein it's all about just turned down the other side. Our republic can't stand if that's simply the way in which we advance political ideas. So, I'm hopeful about Tim Scott. I think that his optimism has brought him thus far. I hope that the American public gets to see a bit of what we've seen in South Carolina over the years in term of his youthful optimism.
