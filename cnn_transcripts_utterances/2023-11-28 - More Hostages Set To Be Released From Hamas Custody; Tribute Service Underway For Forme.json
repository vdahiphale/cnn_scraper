I mean, he's president at the height of the feminist movement in the 1970s when feminism is arguing that you needed a two-income household, that both spouses should have a full professional life. And that is what they lived. He really brought the office of the First Lady to a new level, literally formalizing the office, granting its staff, et cetera, but also being an advisor to the president, traveling to Latin America during his presidency, and meeting with key officials, and much more. So, that partnership is both amazing in terms of a story of a marriage.
