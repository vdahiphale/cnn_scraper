      "sentences": "I'm Jessica Dean in New York. We have breaking news. We know now at least 47 people are dead after a South Korean airliner crashed as it was landing that plane carrying 175 passengers and 6 crew members. This happened just after 9 a.m. local time Sunday morning. That's now nearly three hours ago at the Muan Airport. That's a city in the country's southwest region.We're told that the rescues are ongoing. And miraculously, two people have been pulled from the wreckage. CNN correspondent Mike Valerio is joining us now from Seoul, South Korea. And Mike, we now know that the Acting President of South Korea has directed all available resources there to try to find any additional survivors. What more are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, for sure. And look, we're looking at these videos that are just astounding. The fact that there are any survivors is truly shocking. But going back to the fact that this is a Boeing plane, of course, Boeing has had a lot of trouble over the last couple of years. And so again, we don't know yet how this -- I mean, it's still -- they're still trying to hopefully pull out some survivors. We hope there are more survivors on the back end of that plane, but there will certainly be a massive investigation into exactly what went wrong here. And Mike, to your point, in these videos that are floating around, that we're still trying to validate and, you know, make sure are exactly right. It does appear, though, if those turn out to be true, that they're just -- that they're -- the landing, it's just skidding across the Runway there.",

      "sentences": "Right. And to that point, you know, our buddy, Jessica, and I, you know, meet Pete Muntean, our lead aviation correspondent, he's traveling at the moment. Got him on the phone and text before we came on the air. And he said, to your point, landing gear on a commercial airline that might not be deployed, that is extremely, exceedingly rare. That is something that might happen, you might see more commonly in civil aviation. But for a major commercial airliner to not have its landing gear down coming into an international airport, I mean, that is something that is heart stopping, I'll paraphrase the conversation that I had with Pete Muntean, and something that may be the nexus point of the investigation. So again, for viewers joining us, you know, in the middle of this conversation, it is a Boeing 737-800. So that could widen the international investigation into bringing people from the United States, bringing people from Washington state, Boeing headquarters in Chicago, and outside of Seattle here to this corner of the world, figure out what exactly happened to make sure that something like this does not repeat in another Boeing 737-800, God forbid.So still a lot of unanswered questions. But the name of the game here is just seeing if any more miracles can be pulled off if there can be a third, a fourth or another survivor pulled from this huge wreckage scene, Jessica.",
