Israel now warning it will strike anywhere Hamas is found as Hamas releases a new hostage video. And new video of House Speaker Mike Johnson making anti-gay comments just weeks before he was elected speaker. This as we are learning more about his wife's ultra conservative and anti-gay views. Let's go OUTFRONT. (MUSIC) And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. And we begin OUTFRONT on this Friday with breaking news. A judge seconds ago just ruling on whether former President Trump should be kicked off the ballot in the state of Colorado. Judge Sarah Wallace deciding that Trump is eligible to run for president even after his role in the January 6th insurrection. A group of voters had filed a lawsuit, and this was based specifically on the 14th Amendment. They argued that that amendment would bar Trump from federal office. A judge, though, ruling the other way, as I said, just seconds ago, a team of reporters standing by to go through the details on this breaking news as we get it. Lucy Kafanov is OUTFRONT in Denver. Evan Perez is in Washington. And, Evan, as I said seconds ago, I haven't had a chance to read 102 pages. I -- you have had a chance to see a little bit more of it than I have. But what -- what do we need to know?",

      "sentences": "The bottom line, Erin, is that the judge -- Judge Sarah Wallace is ordering Donald Trump's name will appear on the ballot in Colorado. This is a role and she just came down. And the bottom line for the judge is that the 14th Amendment, SectionThree of the 14th Amendment, which is what these voters were shaken to have unforced, they say, the judge saying, it's not clear that this applies to the president of the United States or to the-- that the president of that United States is covered by that section of the -- of the 14th Amendment. It's not clear that the framers, the writers of the -- of that section, of the Constitution, intended for that to apply to the president of the United States. And I read you just a part of what the 14th Amendment says. It says that anyone who previously taken an oath as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or is an executive or judicial officer of any state to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof is disqualified from holding office. And so, that's what these voters were seeking to have unforced, to have the former president struck from the ballot in Colorado. And the judge says, really, she can't enforce that because it's clear to her that if the framers of the Constitution had intended for that apply to the president of the United States, they would have made that much clearer. So in her view, it doesn't apply and therefore, the president -- the former president will appear on the Colorado ballot. Now, this is in line, we should say, with some other challenges that have come forward. Voters who have lost similar challenges in Minnesota, in Michigan, another sort of fringe candidate has brought a federal lawsuit in New Hampshire. All of these have been tossed aside, for exactly this reason. It's not clear that you can power the former president of the United States simply because of what happens on January 6th and the accusations of his involvement, and inspiring what happened on January 6th, Erin.",

JEN GRISWOLD (D), COLORADO SECRETARY OF STATE:  Well, I think the court could have rolled three different ways. And this is how the corporate. At the end of the day, there is big questions about how section three of the 14th Amendment works. And the court has determined that it does not apply to the presidency. There are some people out there, constitutional scholars, who of course would agree with her. There are those who would not occur with her. And either way, I think there is a high chance that this case is further appealed. So I think that the court has been very thoughtful, like you said, it's 102 pages.

The court holds in the absence of the president from that list of positions to which the Amendment applies, the 14th Amendment, combined with the fact that section 3 specifies the disqualifying oath to one of support for the Constitution. She points out, when your president, you are spurring an oath to preserve, protect, and defend.

But that being said, his base and Republican primary voters that want him on the ballot, legally, have that right to do so. Now, I spoke before this ruling came down with the color of the Republican Party chairman, Dave Williams, and he just reply back to me with his comments and response to this ruling. Dave Williams says: The court has wisely ruled in favor of President Trump. The fringe legal theory cannot be used to remove a qualified candidate from the ballot, let alone the front runner to the Republican Party. Said, radical left wing activists need to stop undermining free and fair elections and simply allow the voters to decide. Now, what this Colorado Republican chairman said is that it's always been unfair for a liberal judge from Denver to single-handedly stand in a way and remove someone from the palace. That's a threat to the front runner of the Democratic Party. And, look, I truly believe there should be consequences for Donald Trump's actions with what he did.

What you're looking at there was filmed just moments ago, after Israel's signaled an expanding war in Gaza. Now saying it will advance anywhere Hamas is found in the entire Gaza Strip, when conditions are right. Of course, they've been distributing leaflets in southern Gaza, now. Hamas tonight releasing video which appears to show another Israeli hostage held in Gaza. We are not going to release details of this one. It appeared in a Telegram channel belonging to Hamas's military wing. It's important to note that this video comes after Israel recovered the bodies of dead hostages, a 19-year-old IDF soldier and a 65-year- old grandmother in the past two days. Oren Liebermann is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The military operation at Gaza's largest hospital, ongoing at this hour after the Israeli military says they found an operational tunnel shaft in the Al-Shifa Hospital complex. CNN geolocated that shaft to this point, sharing the same campus as the imaging building and other hospital units. But CNN cannot verify Israel's claims. Hamas denies the accusation, and the IDF has not yet shown evidence of a large network of tunnels underneath Gaza's largest hospital.

The hours from now, who opposition parties will be announcing their candidates for president and vice president, posing a very surprising and credible challenge to the ruling party, which is intended to have a stronger stance against Beijing, saying you need to match Beijing with military power, whereas the other opposition parties say they want to work with Beijing.
