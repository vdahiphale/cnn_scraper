We're learning they wereretrieved from Gaza during an overnight military operation in Khan Yunis. That's according to the Israeli military. The deaths of all but one of the men whose pictures you see on your screen here had been announced in recent months. Following the news on Tuesday, families of the hostages called for urgency in finalizing a hostage release and ceasefire deal. All of this happening, of course, as U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken is wrapping up talks in Egypt about those ongoing negotiations. He'll then be heading to Doha, where he'll meet with the Qatari emir. Let's stay on this. Our Jerusalem correspondent, Jeremy Diamond, joining me now, as well as our chief U.S. security analyst, Jim Sciutto. Both are live in Tel Aviv. So Jeremy, first of all, just bring us up to speed on what we know about the recovery of the bodies, of these six hostages in that operation.",

Our understanding is that Israeli troops actually went into tunnels beneath the southern Gaza City of Khan Yunis. And that is where they found these six bodies. Five of these individuals who were taken hostage on October 7th, had already been declared dead by the Israeli government. But one of them, Avraham Munder (ph), had not yet been declared dead. And so today, his family finding out not only that his body had been retrieved but finding out that he was in fact deceased. So obviously a very difficult day for the families of these hostages. And we have a statement from the hostages and missing families forum, calling for the Israeli government to take a deal. Many others in Israeli politics, like Benny Gantz, a former member of the Israeli war cabinet, noting that this is an a reminder, he says of the hourglass that these hostage families have, talking about the fact that time is really running out for these hostages to be recovered. And for many of them to come out alive rather than dead from the Gaza Strip. The Israeli prime minister today telling the families of some of these hostages at a forum of families, who actually, many of them, oppose a ceasefire deal, telling them that he is not sure that there will be a ceasefire deal. And saying that Israel needs to quote, \"preserve our strategic security assets secured during the course of the war.\" We know that there are still many disagreements and a lot of uncertainty in particular -- or including, I should say, from the Israeli prime minister about whether or not a deal can actually be reached. But certainly today, a big reminder of why a deal is needed so badly.",

It was a lengthy recitation of his record in office. He talked a lot about Donald Trump and the threat he poses to democracy. That is the campaign he wanted to run. It's a campaign that a lot of Democrats didn't think was going to work.

She has a potential Sunbelt path to 270. These Democrats are  very energized because they believe she has the ball right now, she has momentum in this race. And that's a fact. Let's just go back and look at the COVID year. There were weird conventions but Joe Biden at his convention in 2020 was already on the verge of winning at 268 electoral votes in terms of solid Democratic and lean Democratic. He went on to win 305 electoral votes and sweeping. But I just I want to remind you, that first campaign against Donald Trump, when we were at the Democratic convention in 2016, Hillary Clinton was favored. Again, that's a modest amount, 236 to 191. But then the map just simply did not go her way. We had Pennsylvania, a tossup then. Donald Trump won Pennsylvania. We had Michigan leaning Democratic that, no, Donald Trump won it. Same with Wisconsin. Donald Trump won it. Donald Trump held Ohio, Donald Trump won North Carolina. Hillary Clinton did win Virginia but Donald Trump won Ohio. Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire but Donald Trump won Florida. He kept Georgia. And Donald -- and Hillary Clinton did end up winning Nevada in the end. But that's how it ended up. So Democrats came into that convention in 2016, full of confidence as well. Different story, third-party candidates, the Comey announcement late in the campaign, Democrats would take -- say caused that. But just a cautious note. Kamala Harris in is such a better position than Joe Biden was when he was the candidate in Milwaukee by leaps and bounds a better position.

They were supposed to have sold hundreds of these planes already, delivered hundreds of these planes. They haven't been able to. This is a very big thing for Boeing. As you know, Erica, they've had so many troubles lately. They had that door plug that blew out. They've had whistleblower complaints, they've had investigations.

We've heard that it doesn't matter that the top the ticket has changed now for people who are unhappy. That's not going to change how they feel. But I guess the question is there's no firm number on how many of those people may, in fact, either sit out the election -- unlikely they would vote for Donald Trump -- but likely sit out the election. I was struck by some of these numbers in a CBS/YouGov poll showing the most important issues. Economy right there at the top with 83 percent; 74 percent say democracy. The war in Gaza, just 37 percent said it is a major factor in their vote for president. And in that same poll, it found that among voters under 30, only 34 percent. So even less say it's a major factor. Is there a sense of how much this polling may figure into the Democrats' approach as they move toward November?",

      "sentences": "Well, the issue here is -- and you're right.This poll does suggest that it's not a huge concern for most Democratic voters. I think that's consistent with a lot of the polling we've seen. But the issue is that Michigan, for example, is a state that could be decided by 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 votes. So it doesn't take that many Democrats not to show up to vote for Harris for it to have a huge impact in what happens in November. I think one mitigating factor for her is it looks like the enthusiasm that she has been able to drum up in the Democratic coalition, which Biden wasn't unable to do, means she could potentially get far higher vote margins in the big cities, places like Detroit. She may be able to sort of lower Trump's margins in some of those rural areas, bring over some undecided voters. So it's very fluid. But Democrats can't really risk losing any votes. So I think you'll see them try to address this, at least thematically going forward, even if there is no substantial policy change from the Biden administration.",

Dive teams are goingto try to enter that wreckage again; it's some 50 meters underwater. Again, six people still unaccounted for; 15 were rescued from the vessel. One person has been confirmed dead. The yacht itself was hit by violent weather. It happened early Monday. Investigators say the storm broke its mast, the ship's mast, in half before the boat ultimately capsized. Joining me now is Sal Mercogliano. He is a maritime historian, former Merchant Mariner. And you know this well. It's good to have you with us. You know this type of boat very well in addition to the area where it's been and where it spends most of its time there in the Mediterranean.

And unless all the hatches had been secured and everything had been battened down, the vessel would have flooded. And based on that report, it indicates the vessel probably took on a lot of water very quickly and went down to the bottom. And that is nightmarish for the crew on board being asleep and then, all of a sudden, waking up to a ship and the room you're in being on its side and flooding with water, heading down to the bottom.",

The ship sailed out of Palermo the early -- beginning of the month. It spent basically a few weeks along the northern shore of Sicily before coming back in.

Important to note Swift has not endorsed either candidate. We do have some real images though of Taylor Swift to share with you before we go. The superstar invited some of the survivors of that deadly knife attack at a children's dance class. It was a course a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in England. She invited them to join her backstage and, in a video posted to TikTok, Hope and Autumn can be seen here posing.
