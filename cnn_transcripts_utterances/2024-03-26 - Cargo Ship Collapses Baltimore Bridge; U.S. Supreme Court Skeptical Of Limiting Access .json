      "sentences": "A good day to you, I'm Richard Quest in tonight for Isa Soares. A tragedy in Baltimore, a cargo ship hit a majorbridge causing it to collapse. Now, we're learning, the ship's crew had issued a May Day only before the impact. Details in a moment. Also, the majority of the U.S. Supreme Court appeared to be skeptical of a nationwide abortion pill ban. It was a high case stakes today. And two mansions that belong to Sean \"Diddy\" Combs homes were raided by federal agents. It's all related to an ongoing sex trafficking investigation, we'll have the details from Los Angeles. Baltimore's mayor is calling it an unthinkable tragedy because right now rescue workers are desperately searching for six people still unaccounted for, more than 12 hours after the collapse of a major bridge, after that bridge was struck by a cargo ship. Now, officials confirm there were construction workers on the bridge when the crash occurred, it sent people and vehicles into the frigid waters below, two people were rescued and you can see the lights of the ship go out just before the impact. If you look closely, that's tied to the bottom of that, and there you see the lights go out and the ship, of course, then seconds later hits the bridge. Maryland's governor says the ship's crew had notified port officials it had lost power in the seconds prior to the ship. If we show that again, you'll make it -- it will become a little clear, again, how that actually happened. The ship loses power, then 20 or 30 seconds later, it hits the bridge, the bridge then collapses. A short time ago, the President Biden spoke. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The governor, President Biden, have all said that, that action likely saved countless lives. But so, you know, the big question now though, is what happened to that construction crew? Did they not get that May Day call where officials not able to reach them in time? Still so many questions. Two members of that construction crew have been rescued, but they are still searching for six more, Richard. And so, that is all the activity that you see here right now, all the energy, all the effort is centered around focusing on in finding those six construction crew members who they believe are in the water, and you know, you just think about the difficulties facing these Coast Guards and recovery crews right now.

Inthe two years after the landmark ruling reversing Roe versus Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a blockbuster case that could limit access to the abortion drug Mifepristone. Central to the case is whether the FDA, that's the drug administration overstepped its authority by making it easier for women to get the drug, sort of two drugs in a regimen for medication abortion. Early last year, research shows it was using 62 percent of all terminations across the country. CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider is outside the courthouse in Washington.

You know, the basis of the doctors argument is that they might at some point have to treat a woman who comes to their emergency room with complications from this abortion pill, Mifepristone, and that they might have to treat her when they disagree with abortion. And the government and the drug manufacturer, they're arguing, you know, this type of hypothetical injury is just too far removed, too hypothetical to prove the basis of a lawsuit. Now, the lower courts disagreed. They let the lawsuit move forward, they've enrolled in favor of the doctors. They said that certain aspects of this drug should -- they shouldn't allow it, making it harder to obtain.

However, the state of Israel in accordance to U.S. sort of longstanding policy, that will remain, and that is what Secretary of Defense, for example, as early as December 2nd of last year has been saying publicly, I am worried that Israel is heading for a strategic failure if the number of civilian casualties continue to rise. He said that back in December, and he repeated it again today.

They don't have the infrastructure. But Shanahan is a woman of great personal wealth. She's formally married to the co-founder of Google, who is a billionaire. She is a Silicon Valley lawyer. And she has a tremendous amount of resources. She already donated upwards of $4 million to an associated Super PAC with Kennedy. And that was -- that allowed him -- allowed the Super PAC to be able to put on this splashy, large Super Bowl campaign ad. And so now, the big effort for this campaign is going to be getting on the ballot in states across the country. And no doubt, with her resources, they're going to be able to pretty credibly mount this effort, Richard.",
