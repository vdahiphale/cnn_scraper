Good evening, and welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. I am Erin Burnett. And tonight, it's Biden versus DeSantis. So, the President is heading to Florida, tomorrow.

There's two real primary reasons why this is one of the early post-State of the Union travel destinations, for the President, the message and the foil, to some degree, the foils.The message, you saw it, last night, live, and in-person, and the exchange that the President had back-and-forth with Republicans, off script, on the issues, of Medicare and Social Security. You talk to White House advisers. They make clear. There are no two issues that pop more in their polling than defending Medicare and Social Security. No state where that's more important, given the scale of the population that's over the age of 65, and no state with two politicians that represent the contrast that the Biden administration, the President personally wants to detail than Ron DeSantis, the governor, and Rick Scott, the senator, from Florida, who he was citing, last night, in that speech. As one White House official put it to me, \"We want this fight. We relish this fight.\" That fight is certainly going to be brought to the table, by the President, as you saw, in the State of the Union, as you saw, in Wisconsin. But keep something in mind here. Take a look at the travel, of the Vice President, and the President, in these first two days. And one state is not like the other. The President going to Wisconsin, then Florida, the Vice President going to Georgia, and then Minnesota, three of those four states are critical to any electoral path, for the President, in 2024. Florida is not one of them. And White House officials are candid when they say they're not expecting it to swing dramatically back toward Democrats, given the way it's gone over the course of the last couple of cycles. But they know that this is a perfect place, to lay out that message, on Social Security and Medicare, and to have foils. As one White House official put it to me, \"We like foils. There are no better foils in politics than Ron DeSantis, and Rick Scott.\" Again, when you talk to White House officials, they make clear Florida's not necessarily a political winner, for them. But on the message and on the actual politicians, they believe it is. That's why he's going down there.",

It was the day before the balloon crossed into Alaska. And the urgency, inside the Military, did not change until the spy balloon moved over Alaska, and headed on a path, clearly, towards the continental U.S. That is when fighter jets were scrambled. Now, all of this news, coming a day, after President Biden called out the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, during the State of the Union Address. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What more can you tell us about it? LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING (RET.), FORMER ARMY COMMANDING GENERAL, EUROPE AND SEVENTH ARMY, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, first, Erin, I'd go back to what you said, at the very beginning, about the military failing to flag the balloon, going over Alaska, as an urgent matter. I'm not sure I agree with that. The tipper that some of our reporters talked about, in a recent article, in DotCom (ph), talked about information that was provided to the Command, about this balloon, coming across the Aleutians, and going into Africa. Now, I hate to do this to you, Erin. But I'll give you a little hierarchy of military information and organizations.

And until something becomes important, you don't do anything about it. The Military has a phrase called O&amp;R, Observe and Report.

But I am hearing from some of my friends, in the Navy, and the Air Force, and they're talking about the kinds of things they're finding.
