In a late-night court filing, prosecutors alleged that Teixeira may still have access to hundreds of classified documents, and that he made searches online -- quote -- \"in what appears to be a deliberate effort to disseminate this country's secrets.\" They also claim Teixeira is a major flight risk and an attractive candidate to hostile foreign governments.

      "sentences": "Well, a couple of things.First of all, as you had pointed out there, they are very concerned about this recent development that was laid out in these court documents that he had viewed hundreds, not dozens, but hundreds of classified documents. And the real concern, Brianna, is that, if he gets out on bail, the thought is that he will be able to in some way access some of those documents. So, that's why prosecutors say -- one of many reasons why they say he needs to remain behind bars. They said the following -- quote -- \"The defendant knows where the information is. He knows how to access it. And, based on his specialized I.T. skills, he presumably knows how to disseminate that information without being noticed.\" Also in those court filings, the defense weighing in and saying that, look, that this was a young man who was taken into custody at his own without incident. They say that he is not a serious risk of flight or obstruction, and that, if the judge were to allow bail, perhaps he could set certain conditions, such as he should be released to his father, confined to his residence, under -- undergo location monitoring, and no contact with witnesses, and no access to the Internet. Again, the prosecution laying out a number of situations that they say should have been a red flag to not only the Air National Guard, but others, that they say that this young man was indeed troubled. Going back to high school, Brianna, they point out to one incident, where they say he was denied a gun I.D. card by police after police found out he was suspended from his high school after he made comments about guns and racial threats. And so then this is why I think there are so many questions as to not only, why was he a candidate for the Air National Guard? Why did he have access to these types of classified documents? These are just some of the things that are being argued outside the court. The judge has much to consider inside the courtroom -- Brianna.",

And I wonder, after years of leaks and breaches that we know about and some we don't know about, why there isn't better tracking of what exactly he accessed, what he may have printed out, what he searched.

Again, a subject for examination here is to, what extent did this National Guardian have mechanisms in place to monitor his electronic behavior? And it is admittedly kind of a mixed bag across the entirety of the intelligence community. I said that. What is at issue here, in my view, is a failure of personal trust. And we have had, unfortunately, a history of them in the past, Edward Snowden being a prime example 10 years ago.

And, to your point, some would like to see that, including the Federal Reserve, who would perhaps welcome some signs of cooling. So, to put this in more context, 1.1 at an annualized rate, Boris, you can see how that compares to what economists were expecting. They were expecting 2 percent. And you can see how the first quarter compares to the previous few quarters, a slowing. So, when you look under the hood of this report, and you will get a sense of where exactly we're seeing spending, it's the consumer. The U.S. consumer is just really powering through, spending on things like goods, services, durable goods, restaurants, bars. Net exports was also a positive contributor. Now, on the flip side, we saw a real drawdown on inventories. So that was a negative contributor to the downside. Also, businesses really pulled back their spending. And, Boris, when I talked to Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's, and said, look, how do you square this? Consumers are pulling back. Consumers, rather are spending, but businesses are pulling back. And this is what he told me. He said, so, usually, it's the consumer that pulls back and the businesses respond. This go-round, the thing that feels a little uncomfortable is, if we go into a recession, it will probably be businesses pulling back and forcing consumers to follow. So that is perhaps a potential but, at this point, that's not what we see, as consumers continue to spend.",

Excuse me. That is lower than economists were expecting. That is also lower than the prior week, but really in this range that we have been in 220,000 to 250,000 over the last few weeks. Boris, this would be the first report, the first sign of trouble in the labor market. This would be the first signs where you would see flashing signs of trouble perhaps. We're not seeing it yet. Unemployment remains very low. And perhaps that is the reason why consumers continue to spend, because they have the jobs to continue to spend. And we're seeing that in the GDP report.",

They're looking to attack her credibility, to suggest that she's politically motivated, and that she was doing this to boost sales of her book. So, what they have done, they have taken some of E. Jean Carroll's own words and said to her:  Didn't you tell people and say that you even thought your own story, your own allegations of this alleged rape in the Bergdorf Goodman department store was odd? And Carroll acknowledged that certain parts of the story are difficult to conceive of, yes. They also pointed to an e-mail exchange between her and one of her closest friends, one of the women that we expect to hear testify in this case to back up Carroll's allegations of rape, because Carroll said that she told her about this at the time back in 1996. So they pointed to an e-mail between the two women in which they talk about a potential scheme where we must do our patriotic duty. Now, Carroll testified she had no idea that -- what that was about and that she and Carol often send jokey e-mails and use the word scheming. And then they also pointed to her financial motivation, saying that, in the pitch, in this draft for her book proposal, in which she first detailed these allegations, that she focuses on Trump, and that it was a highlight of the proposal which Carroll had agreed to.
