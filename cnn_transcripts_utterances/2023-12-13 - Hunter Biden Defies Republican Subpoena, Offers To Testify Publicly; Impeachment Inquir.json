To be fair, they're already at a pretty high level. I was just sort of reading through the report here. It seems that we're seeing some differences in the statement that it's actually accompanied by. So, we'll look at this a bit closer. But just to put this in perspective, the Fed has raised rates 11 times since March of 2022.And so, every time they pause, there's a reason why. They're waiting to see how all of these rate hikes that you're seeing on your screen, sort of play out in the real economy, how they impact people like you and me and everyone watching at home. Does it start to impact unemployment? Does it start to impact consumer spending? Because we know that their rate, the federal funds rate, then impacts borrowing costs. It makes borrowing more expensive. So, I can tell you that, again, this is the third meeting in a row that the Federal Reserve has decided that the best course of action is to do nothing and to just wait and see how this all plays out in the economy. I can tell you that they have already indicated that 2024 is going to be, when we start to see rate cuts, the question is when in 2024. Traders have priced in about a 40 percent chance that perhaps at the March meeting we see our first rate cut. Some would say that they would like it sooner rather than later. But that's what we're waiting for and looking for in the press conference that starts in about 28 minutes at 2.30. Jay Powell is going to be asked a lot of questions about those rate cuts. But also, I should say, we're going to get the summary of economic projections. And that did come out. I'm going to take a little bit of a closer look at that. But that just gives us a sense of what the FOMC committee expects next year and the year beyond in terms of unemployment, in terms of GDP, in terms of inflation, in terms of interest rates. So, a lot to come here. But again, let's call it a trend. The Federal Reserve deciding for the third straight meeting that the best course of action is to pause.",

So, you know, bottom 20%, the middle 20%, the top 20% of people. And the good news is that wages have been rising for all income groups. And in fact, if you go back a year or two ago, when we were coming out of the pandemic, labor market was really tight, really significant shortages for lower skilled workers, low wage workers did better.So, it's that that's good news. But having said all of that, it's very clear that folks that are in the lower part of the income distribution, low wage Americans, you know, they're struggling. I mean, they're, they're struggling with the inflation, they couldn't save during the pandemic. They didn't have the resources, the inflation is really hurting them, they've turned to credit cards and consumer finance loans to help supplement their income. And now they're facing higher interest rates on that, on that debt.

What things were rendered? What were what assurances were promised? We know, based on the testimony of Devon Archer, that Biden was considered the brand. So, were they selling access?
