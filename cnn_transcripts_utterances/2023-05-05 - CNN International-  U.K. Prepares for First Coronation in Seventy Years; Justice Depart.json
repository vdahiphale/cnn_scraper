Preparations are well underway. The flowers for the service have arrived. Organizers say the king and queen requested only sustainable flowers be used. London's famous landmark Big Ben displayed images of the national plants of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as the words \"God save the king.\" Royal enthusiasts have set up camp, quite literally, along the procession route. Some have been there for days already. Joining me now is CNN's Anna Stewart who is at Westminster Abbey where all of the preparations are going down right now.

This time tomorrow we'll actually see the congregation start to arrive. The ceremony itself actually not that long, two hours or less. But an incredibly important one with so many moments in that. And I know you'll be taking our viewers through many of the sacred rituals, all of the regalia, the vestments. I'm sure you have all sorts of information, Bianca, on crowns and carriages good to go. Today though, I'm not sure about what it's like at Buckingham Palace, but it feels like the calm before the storm here. Not much going on today. The rehearsals are done. Of course, King Charles and Queen Camilla are expected to host heads of state and other dignitaries who are traveling here over the weekend. So, they are expected to be at Buckingham Palace today. So, we probably won't see them tomorrow morning. I'm sure they will get an early night.

It's the way things have been done. And that is very much what we want to hear, is this continuity and the stability that we have lived with for all our lives and many centuries before us.

The sound of air raid sirens and repeated explosions sent people running for shelter in Kyiv on Thursday evening. And then there was this frightening scene in the capital. That though was actually friendly fire, a malfunctioning Ukrainian drone shot down by Kyiv's air force. No casualties or injuries reported. Meanwhile, Moscow now says that the U.S. directed the drone attack on the Kremlin early Wednesday. Russia called it an assassination attempt against President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby dismissed the claim as ridiculous and lies. The head of the Wagner mercenary group is lashing out at top Russian officials and announcing his forces will leave Bakhmut on May 10th. Yevgeny Prigozhin posted an expletive filled video online of fighters killed in Ukraine. Blaming Russian military leaders for not providing them with enough ammunition. Prigozhin specifically addressed Russia's defense minister and the Armed Forces chief of staff. CNN's Nada Bashir joins me now in London. And Nada, what more can you tell us about this video? And what a departure it really marked having such a prominent individual criticizing members of the Russian government, obviously stopping short of criticizing people himself, but still.",

And in fact, U.S. intelligence officials do say that they believe this is posing a significant challenge to President Putin's plans to launch and mount another large-scale significant offensive in Ukraine.

      "sentences": "Yes, that's absolutely right. Case in point when we were coming out to the scene here this morning, we actually stopped to ask directions in a village quite near to where the shootings had taken place. And the man that we stopped told us that they helped that they happened in Belgrade. He just assumed that that was the shooting we were referring to because surely there couldn't have been two. But there was.This one resulted in eight people killed so far, 13 injured. Some of them in critical condition we know. And this sparked a manhunt across a very wide swathe of this country involving some 600 officers. And this is a very rural area. As you can see there are a lot of potential hiding places for a suspect. What makes it even scarier is that the shooting primarily we understand, took place at a soccer pitch area where there was a barbecue area, where young people would gather at night to socialize. And the suspect, a 21-year-old man, had a fully automatic weapon -- according to local media reports. And so, in this country fully automatic weapons are banned. There are illegal guns circulating still from the conflict in the 1990s, but you have to jump through a whole lot of hoops to get a gun license to even own a semiautomatic weapon. This has put this entire region on high alert. We were just in one of the villages where some of the shots were fired, and we met a man there who actually after getting the initial alert on his phone had gone outside to see what the heck was going on. And he was actually mistakenly arrested and held by police for about an hour and a half because they suspected that perhaps he could have the actual shooter. Turns out he was an ordinary person from the village with a wife and a very small child that he was merely trying to protect. After that, they did not sleep very much that night, they also did not leave their house until he actually flagged me down moments after I had gotten the news that an arrest had been made, to ask if it was safe to come out. That arrest was made in a larger city called Kovacevac (ph). It's in the central part of Serbia. It's about -- it's more than an hour south of where we are right now. So really nowhere close. And it just goes to show you how large of an area we were talking about. Even 20 miles north of here as we were coming in, we saw police on the side of the road lined up heavily armed police officers searching the area beside the highway. But it seem like a needle in the haystack. Clearly, they had more information than they made public and were able to make an arrest much to the relief of this country now experiencing the second mass shooting in just the last two days -- Bianca.",
