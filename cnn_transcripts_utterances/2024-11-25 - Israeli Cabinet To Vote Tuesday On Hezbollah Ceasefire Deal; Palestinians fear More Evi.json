You are watching ONE WORLD.After a conflict that escalated dramatically over the past two months, there are now fresh hopes for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. A source says that Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has approved the emerging deal in principle and that the Israeli cabinet is going to be voting on the agreement on Tuesday. This happening as the death toll climbs in Lebanon. Lebanese officials say that dozens were killed in Israeli strikes in Beirut and beyond over the weekend. Lebanon's health ministry says that Israeli strikes have killed more than 3,000 people since mid-September. The IDF says it struck a dozen Hezbollah command centers in Beirut Sunday night. Hezbollah fired some 250 projectiles from Lebanon on Sunday. Some were intercepted by Israel's air defenses. Let's bring in Nic Robertson joining us live now from Jerusalem. So, Nic, just talk us through what more we know about this potential ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, including the 60-day transition period. And also the fact that the Israeli military would be required to withdraw from Southern Lebanon. Take us through that.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And I think the indications are not just coming from here in Israel that this cabinetmeeting that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held last night with his members of cabinet and his senior security officials gave rise to this decision to have another cabinet meeting and to move in the direction with some reservations about the ceasefire. But also we've been hearing that from in the region as well, from outside of Israel, that they feel that a deal is getting close. There's been a significant uptick in the military escalation on both sides on Sunday, for example, 250 Hezbollah rockets and missiles fired into Israel. That's a huge number. And, again, on the Israeli side, a huge number of IDF strikes going into Lebanon at Hezbollah targets. That's symptomatic, if we compare it to back in 2006, when there was a similar ceasefire deal was struck back then between Hezbollah and the Israeli government. There was an uptick in violence and exchanges of fire just before the ceasefire. So, you know, some of the atmospherics around this look right. The prime minister is indicating the country is moving in that direction -- reservations. I think one of the principal reservations we have heard about is the fact that the Israelis want to be able to strike Hezbollah immediately if they violate the cease-fire during that 60-day period. The foreign minister today laid out equal terms. Hezbollah pulling back 30 miles north of the border, north of the Litani River. That's back to an old U.N.-agreed position that Hezbollah hadn't stuck to. They want as well -- the foreign minister was saying, for Hezbollah not to be allowed to rebuild and rearm itself going forward, that seems to be a big ask in a sovereign country. But that's one of the things he's saying. But I think perhaps the sharpest thorn in the side of the Israeli prime minister at the moment is his hard-right members of his cabinet, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister today, said he told the prime minister that absolutely not, that he should not stop fighting Hezbollah, that they were weakened and that this was the moment to crush them. And he said, you know, continue, continue. Those were his words, he said to the prime minister. So it seems to be where the direction he may vote in tomorrow. Obviously, the prime minister has time to discuss this with all the different parties in his coalition before then. But I don't -- it does appear that what we're hearing from the prime minister's office is that they feel reasonably confident that this will go through.",

Rabbi Zvi Kogan has -- had been filmed by a friend just days before his murder. He had been missing since Thursday. On Sunday, the UAE Interior Ministry said that his body had been recovered. They arrested three Uzbek nationals in connection with the murder. Israel's prime minister calls his death an anti-Semitic act of terror. Russian troops have a British man in custody. They say they captured him while he was fighting for Ukraine in Russia's Kursk Region. According to Russian state media, his name is James Scott Rhys Anderson. They add that the 22-year-old is actually a former British soldier. The British Foreign Office will only say that it is supporting the family of a British man following reports of his detention. Russia says that it will use every means at its disposal to protect itself. As comments from a senior diplomat come after Moscow fired a new non- nuclear ballistic missile at Ukraine's Dnipro Region last Thursday. President Vladimir -- President Vladimir Putin, rather, said in a televised speech that the strike was a response to Ukraine's use of American and British long-range weapons against targets inside Russia. CNN's senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen is joining us live now from Moscow. So, Fred, Putin has also launched one of the largest drone attacks as well since invading Ukraine. That, of course, combined with the hypersonic missile that we saw Russia launch just last week Thursday, really shows that Russia is indeed stepping up its game in the wake of the U.S. providing those ATACMS. Just take us through what sort of air defenses Ukraine has, especially when it comes to the drone -- the drone strikes.",

One of the things that we have seen, of course, over the past, I'd say about year and a half since the Russians have been conducting these massive strikes against Ukrainians' towns and cities and, of course, also against critical infrastructure as well, is that the West has provided a lot of air defense systems that are very capable. Now, these drone swarms that the Russians often use, and they really have increased that. You're absolutely right. Those are usually taken down by the Ukrainians by using means that are as inexpensive as possible because we have a lot of drones flying. They fly very low and slow, so it's quite easy to take them down, but not when they fly in these swarms. So the Ukrainians, as far as that is concerned, believe that they are in fairly decent shape, although we have seen more drone hits coming from the Russians over the past couple of weeks. As far as this new missile is concerned, though, Zain, the Ukrainians definitely, at this point in time, have very little that would be capable of taking that down. We saw some of that just now in the footage of those several warheads that impacted on the city of Dnipro last week. And the Russians are saying that they are willing to even up the ante even more. They threaten the United States. They've also threatened the Ukrainians by doing even more than they already have, as more and more Russians are also heading to the front to fight.

After the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to use longer distance U.S. and U.K.-supplied missiles to strike deep inside Russia, Putin hit back with a new intermediate range ballistic missile capable of delivering devastating nuclear warheads and he threatened to hit U.S. assets as well. We consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against the military objects of those countries that allow their weapons to be used against our objects, he said. Back at the event, for the soldier's mothers, a Russian parliamentarian backing Putin up. We are a strong country and we've been patient for a very long time, she said. But in the case of mass deaths of our people, if the collective West does not sober up, we should proceed to more decisive actions. We can no longer lose any of our men.

I mean, first of all, its leadership has been completely decimated. I do want to talk about Iran, because they are still vowing to retaliate against Israel. The fact that Hezbollah, obviously an Iran proxy, has now sort of, well, is likely to reach some kind of ceasefire deal with Israel. Does that affect how Iran retaliates against Israel anyway?

I just camefrom a conversation here in Washington that was focused on Iran. And everybody agrees that Iran is extremely vulnerable in terms of its lack of air defenses, given the last round of tit-for-tat in which Israel took down most of its air defenses. But also, I like to always make the point that the most formidable defense that the regime had against Israel is Hezbollah. Hezbollah was -- it still is its first line of defense. And that's also been significantly diminished and weakened. So one of the things to look out for is that although the ceasefire agreement stipulates that any weapon shipments, any attempt by Iran to replenish and rebuild Hezbollah is going to be meant with an Israeli strike and action. It'll be very interesting to see how Iran tries to go about doing that without this ceasefire falling apart.",

But at the same time, though, you know, any sort of attack against Israel is going to backfire. And any sort of attack against Israel isn't necessarily going to do Israel that much harm as well. So just give us your thoughts on what Iran risks here, by actually moving forward with some kind of retaliation.",

But at the same time, as I mentioned, it's vulnerable. And the -- and the risk here is that many right now in capitals of influence, but particularly in Washington, D.C. and in Israel, think that there is a window of an opportunity to act against Iran's nuclear program, a window before Iran rebuilds and reconstitutes its air defense systems and before it rebuilds and reconstitutes Hezbollah in Lebanon and that it's at the precipice of actually finalizing its nuclear program or weaponizing its nuclear program. So there is this argument being made in the halls of power that maybe in the coming days and months. There's an opportunity and a closing window to take advantage of. And if Iran launches any kind of response against Israel, it could very much be giving them that pretext, both Israel that pretext and the U.S. to launch an attack against its nuclear program.",

Now that we're likely going to -- and I know we're both cautiously optimistic, we're likely going to see a ceasefire deal between Hezbollah and Israel. During that sort of 60-day transition period, how likely is there, just in terms of there being any movement in terms of getting those Israelis back to their homes?

We also understand that Lebanon is a very fragile state. It hasn't had a president for over two years now. Needs -- it has a caretaker government. And this new reality of Hezbollah not being north of -- sorry, south of the Litani River, that all has to play domestically in Lebanon. And so I worry about Lebanon's domestic stability. The last time we had a major Hezbollah-Israel war in 2006, Hezbollah ultimately turned its weapons on the Lebanese and invaded West Beirut and attacked government offices as it tried to diminish Hezbollah's power. And so a lot of what's being requested of the Lebanese government right now might put it at odds with Hezbollah. And we're going to have to wait and see whether that's going to play out well for the Lebanese and how it's going to impact that ceasefire deal.",

How do they prepare for a potential massive change in policy when the new administration comes in? We've heard from the incoming president that he wants to see a resolution to the war between Russia and Ukraine. He has suggested he would not back them in the same way that we have seen the Biden administration backed Kyiv. So there has been a concerted push by the Biden administration to provide as much assistance, military assistance, financial assistance to Kyiv as possible before they leave office in a little under two months. And we expect this to be a big point of conversation among the foreign ministers there in Italy. We have heard from European leaders saying that Europe needs to now take up the mantle of supporting Ukraine as the U.S. could be taking a less leadership role in this conflict. And then, of course, the issues in the Middle East are what are front and center in today's meetings, the first ministerial session this morning focused on the Middle East and the Red Sea escalation broadly in that region. And later today, they will be joined by their Arab counterparts to talk about the ongoing wars in Gaza, the war between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah that there are efforts ongoing on this latter front to bring that to a close. But the war in Gaza, still there is no resolution there, even as the U.S. has been saying they are pushing for a deal, a ceasefire and to put forward what they call these day after plans for governance and security. But, of course, there is a lot of question about whether those can actually move forward while Biden is still in office. Zain.",

However, they're going to be in the courtroom, so to speak. And the whole focus here today is potential new evidence, part of a habeas corpus petition. Now, this was filed by the defense in 2023. The district attorney's office never took it up. It wasn't brought before a judge. But with George Gascon, who in days before the election, brought front and center the Menendez brothers possibly being released from prison. Now that was on an area of the rehabilitation in prison, but this goes along with that because the defense is saying that, first of all, there was a letter that was not allowed in the trials that Erik had written to his brother, his cousin, months before the murders, saying he was so afraid of his father and his father could enter his bedroom at night and what was he going to do? And he wanted to talk with his mother, but he knew his mother would tell his father. And they are saying that if a jury saw that letter, that they could have been found not guilty. And then also, since that letter, one of the former members of Menudo came forward saying that he, as a young boy, was sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez, who was a record executive at that time and did dealings with Menudo, the group. And so they are also alleging that. Now, with the habeas proceeding, their conviction could be vacated, and then a new trial would be ordered. Now, this is a status hearing today, so it's not a full-blown hearing on the merits of this habeas petition.
