Also coming up, Germany, still reeling from a deadly attack on Friday at a Christmas market that left five dead. President-Elect Trump rallies his base just weeks away from taking office, but pushes back on criticism about Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Jordan's Foreign Minister heads to Syria in just the latest series of diplomatic meetings between global leaders and the newly Syrian leadership. Well, at the stock market here in New York will open in around 30 minutes from now. Let's check in on those futures. As you can see, firmly in the red across the board for the DOW, S&amp;P as NASDAQ, as we head into a holiday shortened week, we'll check in on those numbers in around 30 minutes from now. First breaking news out of Washington. CNN has obtained a copy of a final draft of the bombshell U.S. Health Ethics Report on Former Representative Matt Gaetz. The Ethics Committee found evidence that Gaetz paid tens of thousands of dollars to women for sex or drugs on at least 20 occasions, and that he paid a 17-year-old girl for sex back in 2017. The panel says Gaetz broke Florida state laws, including statutory rape law. The Former Congressman has denied all allegations. CNN's Senior Crime and Justice Correspondent Katelyn Polantz joins us now from Washington for the details. Katelyn, good to see you. What more can you tell us about what's in the report?",

      "sentences": "Well, the House Ethics Committee did interviews with quite a few of these people,including with the girl or the woman who was underage at the time that she said that she was having sex with Matt Gaetz. And they're finding the top line here is that they found what they say is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges and obstruction of Congress. They also detail in this report, the situation with this 17-year-old girl, someone who says she had sex with Matt Gaetz, the Former Congressman while he was a member of Congress, twice at a party in July 2017 at the time, she was 17-years-old. In one of those encounters, other people were able to see, or at least they were in the presence of this happening. And that she also remembers receiving $400 in cash from Representative Gaetz that evening, which she understood to be payment for the sex. At the time she was a junior in high school. So that's all in the committee report. One of the things, though, is that the Justice Department looked at this, and they did not charge with Matt Gaetz with any crime that allowed the House Ethics Committee then to pick up its investigation. The 17-year-old did not tell Gaetz that she was under age at the time. He didn't ask her age, and he has also said on X he has responded to this and said, in my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated, even some I never dated, but who asked. I dated some of these women for years. I never had sexual contact with someone under 18. Any claim that I have would have been destroyed in court, which is why no such claim was ever made in court. However, Matt Gaetz, on his own, is taking this to court. Just this morning, just a few minutes ago, he filed a lawsuit against the House Committee, the House Ethics Committee, to try and block the release of this report. On paper, he's also claiming defamation and an invasion of privacy claim there in court. No judge has looked at it yet, but it is a situation that is expanding our understanding of Matt Gaetz from the time he was a Representative by the minute, and there is very likely more to come on this today.",
