(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Another victim buried, returned to the earth that killed when it shook. More than 2000 people have perished in the worst Moroccan earthquake in over 100 years. Most of the deaths were in villages in the Atlas Mountains, where homes cracked and crumbled late on Friday night. The pancaking of these buildings down a side street here in Malai Ibrahim killed 25 people, three or four are still missing, believed buried in the rubble. And this is a pattern that has been repeated throughout this province. And it looks very often like there's been some kind of air strike. The collapsing buildings here are actually leaving holes as if they've been hit by Russian bombs in Ukraine. But this has been an all too natural disaster. At least three elderly people have been entombed here in the remains of their hotel and a fourth guest is missing. After the quake, Sami called his parents for a day and a half. It rang out until the battery died. too.",

It seems Morocco is hesitant to open the gates wide to the entire world. So, we've seen, for instance, the United Arab Emirates has opened what they call an air bridge to send supplies and equipment. Spain also sending emergency search and rescue people, as well. So, it does appear that the Moroccans are trying to limit the international aid, so that also their authorities, their army, for instance, can go in and provide as much assistance as possible. We do understand that the Moroccan military, after two-and-a-half days, has finally reached one town that's in the epicenter of the -- where the earthquake took place. But the efforts are slow. Keep in mind, the first 72 hours after an earthquake are vital because after 72 hours, for instance, if you're stuck in the rubble and you have no access to water, chances are you will probably die. So, time is of the essence to get whoever it is, whether it's international assistance or Moroccan personnel. But to get to those towns and villages which have been too remote to access also as a result of roads that have been blocked as a result of this earthquake. Lynda.",

Fortunately, the temperatures, it's pretty warm in that part of Morocco at this time of year, and it will continue to be warm for the next at least 10 days. But going forward, keep in mind, many of these houses are simply destroyed beyond repair.

So, please stay tuned for that. Well, the Kremlin and North Korea have confirmed that Vladimir Putin has invited Kim Jong-un to Russia. North Korean media says the two leaders will hold talks and that meeting may soon take place in the coming hours. A South Korean official tells CNN that North Korean leader is on his way to Russia right now, likely in his heavily-armored luxury train. Neither country has confirmed the nature of those talks. But it is believed that the two leaders will discuss an arms deal. It could happen in Russia's far east.

So, there were a number of surprises here. The details have been leaked to a British newspaper. Even the name of this researcher published over the weekend into the beginning of this week, causing that researcher actually to release a statement saying any, you know, any idea that he was spying for Russia is patently untrue, that he in fact has been doing the opposite. He's been teaching people about how the Chinese -- Chinese Communist Party is dangerous. So, he's refuting that. The Chinese embassy here is calling it fabrication, calling it malicious. So, there's intense pushback on the nature of this, but it reaches high up within the Conservative Party to Conservative Party members of Parliament who hold important foreign policy briefs. Two MPs who have chaired the Foreign Affairs Committee, which is an important body withi, you know, within government in the U.K. So, the concerns about what they may have -- what these two men may have been doing are being deeply felt at the moment.

Their next game is going to be in just, what, 11 days' time on the 22nd of September. Remember, they had said that they wouldn't play for the national team whilst the leaders remained in place. So, Rubiales has now gone. Jorge Vilda, the coach who they already had issues with, was fired last week. But what about the Spanish Football Federation, who during the last three weeks had stood by Rubiales, who had released two statements on the subject threatening legal action against Jenny Hermoso for, quote, \"spreading lies\". So, is this going to be enough to tempt the players back to come back and represent the national team? And, of course, this coming just three weeks after the biggest triumph they possibly could have imagined winning the World Cup beating England in the final in Sydney, Australia. It is just an absolutely extraordinary story and again, we look at Rubiales and what he's saying about it. He's made numerous statements over the last few weeks. He, of course, spoke for half an hour on an occasion where many people thought he was going to quit and he didn't. And whilst he has apologized, many people would say that he lacks contrition and as you say he is vowing to clear his name. He's talking about excessive persecution and many falsehoods.

It was a conversation that he had with them, with his father, where they said to him, at this stage, it really is about preserving a bit of dignity and trying to avoid further damage and harm that's already been caused. And now it's about trying to really focus on the future. Of course, we were talking about that just a moment ago, the fact that he has a court case, a criminal court case now that he has to worry about. And so, his whole focus now is about trying to clear his name, about trying to restore his reputation, about trying to defend what he calls as his innocence. He says that he believes in the truth. He says he believes in faith. So, I think it was them who really, or they who really managed to get him to see the light, to see the writing on the wall, that there really was no other choice at this point in time. And I think the real tipping point was Jenny Hermoso filing that official complaint. And that had to happen in order for the investigation to continue in the criminal courts. And there could be very serious consequences and repercussions if in fact he is found guilty. So, the fact that he lost all of his allies, everyone turned their back on him. He really became an isolated man. He was all alone and there was unsurmountable pressure coming from Spanish society and abroad, as well. So, I think he finally realized, even though he wants to go gung-ha about this, he wants to fight into the bitter end, which has always been his consistent statement, really across the board for the last three weeks.

And there's also been quite a lot of criticism about that, as well. There's not a lot of people who really see this as the right appointment. On the one hand, it's brilliant that you have a woman who takes up the role that's never happened before in the 42 years of the women's national team history. There's only ever been three men in the post prior to this. But people who know her, even previous Spanish national team players such as Vero Boquete have been very vocal about this. And they've said, listen, she doesn't have a lot of experience. She's really not qualified for the role. And on top of that, it's just a continuation of what was already there. You pointed out she's the assistant of Jorge Vilda. Well, she's been in that role for the last five years since 2018. So in terms of philosophy, methodologies and so on. It really is just staying very much in the same vein as before. So, there really isn't too much change, which is what these women have been asking for. They weren't asking for a woman to take over necessarily. What they wanted was someone who was qualified for the job, who has the know- how, who has the knowledge to lead a team of this caliber, now currently the best team in the world after winning the World Cup. So, I imagine, it's probably a bit of an overwhelming situation for Montse Tomei, the new coach, and she's probably just kind of biding her time to see how this all goes down, to see what the reaction is, because the players themselves -- she was appointed a week ago, they still haven't said anything. So, we don't really know how they feel about this appointment. And we don't know if the removal of Jorge Vilda along with the resignation of Luis Rubiales, if that's going to be enough to sway them to come back and play now for Monts Tomei or if in fact they want to continue to dig their heels even further and demand more changes because quite frankly, it just might be now or never.",

At a stop in Vietnam, he met with the nation's prime minister and unveiled a strategic partnership. President Biden says his visit is not about containing China, but about having a stable base in the Indo-Pacific. A crucial 72-hour window is closing in Morocco where hopes of finding any more survivors are fading, nearly three full days after the country's worst earthquake in more than a century. Most of the nearly 2700 people who were killed in the quake were in the Al-Hayouz province just outside of Marrakesh, but the death toll is all but certain to rise. An untold number of people are still unaccounted for, and many remote mountain villages that were hardest hit remain inaccessible, some of them blocked by landslides. The scale and scope of the devastation is still coming into focus, partly in those isolated regions where responders are struggling to reach victims.

It's heartbreaking and -- but people are helping each other. They are gathering, they're creating their own makeshift shelters until we can get there with the proper tents and blankets and the tarpaulins that are needed. So, there is that community solidarity, but of course that just can carry you only so far. And this is why we are in a race against the clock. We feel the international teams have a lot of capacities. There are flights coming in now from all over the world and dispatching that as quickly as possible is of course the top priority. So, the logistics will be here a critical component. And this is what we are doing with the authorities. And a key component of this, of course, is psychological support. The trauma faced by the people can last a lifetime. And we've seen that in many disasters across the world. So, there is a psychosocial component by treating survivors, not as passive victims, but as active survivors, actually engaged in their own recovery, quick recovery, helping each other out. That really empowers people. So, this is also part of the philosophical approach of dealing with this. And all of this matters. And we are looking at a two-year program. We're not looking now at a few weeks or a few months. This is massive.",

Marrakesh is thegateway to the beautiful Atlas Mountains and it's now the tragedy of the Atlas Mountains, but they will recover. People's dignity matters in these responses, too. So, we're treating this critically, as that we don't want people to be begging for assistance. We are proactively trying to reach them and listen to them and dispatch the assistance as quickly as possible.",

On Sunday, Djokovic won the U.S. Open instraight sets over Daniel Medvedev, his 24th major title, passing Serena Williams as the player with the most major championships in the open era. After the match, Djokovic unveiled a special tribute T-shirt honoring his friendship with the late Kobe Bryant. His number was 24 for much of his career. Still to come. A moment that shook a nation. Twenty-two years later, America remembers the victims at the September 11 terrorist attacks. We'll have a live report from New York. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
