Kate Bolduan is out. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Happening now, a powerful and fast-moving nor'easter is hitting the East Coast threatening multiple cities with several inches of heavy snow and plenty of rain. Right now, more than 30 million people are under a winter storm warning and 20 million are under coastal flood warnings. New York could be one of the hardest hit cities. It already started. I saw it. Possibly getting up to eight inches of snow today, which is a lot for the city. The most it's seen in years. Already more than 1,000 flights have been canceled across the entire country and some cities have closed schools and declared a weather emergency. CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam joins us now from New York City. What are you doing? You're, oh, it has - it's been really weird because there was snow on the ground when you started this morning, which was beautiful. Now you're in Times Square, where it's like doing that weird freezing rain thing, right?",

Boy, it - yes, what a difference between this location and Central Park, where we were located about a half an hour ago where almost two inches of snow has accumulated. It's very heavy, wet snow.But you are watching this city transform into a real-life snow globe right before our very eyes. A much long-awaited transformation because it has been 744 days. We're going back to January 2022 since the last time this city was under a winter storm warning. And it is right now. And we anticipate that five to eight inches of snow potentially falling where I'm located. Let's just get a look around. There's the ball, 2024 clearly there. Temperatures around 32 degrees. They're big, fluffy snow -- snowflakes, but they're very heavy, very wet. And we were picking up some of the snowfall and kind of squeezing out the water there. So, this is very exhausting snow to try and shovel. There had been impressive snowfall totals just north and west of the -- of the city. Check out my graphics because you'll see just that. Central Park, we've had 1.2 officially, but some locations in Pennsylvania have already received over ten inches. So, how much snow do we still have to come? Well, you can see the back edge of this snow band. But one thing you need to notice is that this snow band is starting to pivot right over the tristate area. And this is significant because the National Weather Service just recently issuing a special weather bulletin calling for intense snow bands in the round the New York City metropolitan region. One to two inch snow per hour. And if we get that amount of snowfall officially in New York City, we could receive more snow in a day's period, or in one hour, more than what we have had in an entire day over the past couple of years.",

He essentially, in responding to this, says that the House will now work its will on these important matters. He argues that national security begins at our border, and he sort of is needling his colleagues, saying that they have been silent when it comes to the border.The issue with that argument, of course, and this is really underscoring the vast foreign policy differences among the Republican conference, is that there was a bipartisan border deal in the Senate with many of the policy provisions that the speaker champions that he could have taken up and could have advanced. But he rejected that after former President Trump indicated that he really wants this as a campaign issue. Some House Republicans say that bill did not go far enough. So, at this stage, what could happen is some House Republicans could band together with Democrats through a procedural mechanism to try to advance this bill in the House, but it's unclear at that stage if they want on an engage in sort of this lengthy and difficult process. And, John, if all that is not enough, House Republicans also pursuing an effort, again, to impeach the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas after a failed effort the last time. They didn't have the votes the last time and it suffered an embarrassing defeat on the House floor. They may be able to eke it out this time. What has struck me about this is the secretary seems totally unbothered by this effort. There's no reporting to suggest that him or anyone on his team, for instance, has tried to meet with House Republicans to try to dissuade them from this. He says that he's really focused on his expansive portfolio. But two articles of impeachment that the House Republicans could vote on today.

AZI PAYBARAH, NATIONAL REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Well, Democratic campaigns, for a long time, have encouraged voters to vote early and to also vote by mail. Republican campaigns have largely a skewed that -- that kind of strategy, except in this race, both campaigns have really encouraged their voters, their supporters, to either vote early or vote by mail. And some of those ballots have started to come in. They're roughly on par with the voter registration in the district. More ballots have come in from Democrats than Republicans. But again, those haven't been opened, they haven't been counted. And just like you saw in Athena's reporting, some people who were Suozzi supporters before have announced that they are voting for Mazi Pilip over the migrant crisis. So, ballots are coming in. Weather might encourage some people to stay home. But this is a district that likes to vote. They are sort of used to sort of inclement weather. A lot of voters out there have cars and are able to drive in. But this is not what the campaigns had expected one, two or even three weeks ago. BERMAN: No, you bring up a good point.

There's a resident there who points them to the direction of the apartment in question. Now, once they get there, they notice that there's a broken window. They're looking through this broken window and they see a woman allegedly walking towards them holding a gun. So, they say that they announced themselves. They say that they knocked on the door. You can see some of what happened there on the video. But ultimately what ended up happening is they ended up shooting this woman, Eboni Pouncy. She was struck several times. Also, at one point, Sara, another woman had come down the stairs and had said, don't shoot, don't shoot. So, she did not end up getting shot. Investigators later learned that Eboni Pouncy was living there with the other woman. The window was broken because apparently what happened was they locked themselves out. They broke the windows so they could get inside. Ben Crump has gotten involved. We all know Ben Crump. He's been involved in many cases like this. He's released a statement that says in part, \"this newly released bodycam footage, which has been edited, is evidenced of the unnecessary and excessive force used against her.
