      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London.Just ahead, Kim Jong-un arrives in Russia on board a heavily armored train ahead of an expected meeting with Vladimir Putin. Then, unprecedented flooding in Libya. It's feared 10,000 people are missing as entire villages were swept away after two dams collapsed. And devastation so bad that Morocco's military have only recently reached the epicenter of the deadly quake that happened on Friday. More on the rescues ongoing there. Kim Jong-un's heavily armored private train is in Russia. It's shrouded in mystery. These images from Russian state media show the train in Russia's far-east region. The North Korean leader made the rare trip outside his country for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin, which, according to the Kremlin, will focus on sensitive areas. However, there's no word exactly where and when those talks will take place. According to Russia's state military TV channel, Russia's defense minister will participate in those meetings. U.S. officials say the talks are expected to focus on the North providing weapons for Russia's use in Ukraine. CNN's Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour joins us now from New York. And those that information we're getting from Western officials does sound right when we also know that the Defense Minister is going to be there.",

And we also have reports that his senior defense official, the general is on board there as well.The question is, though, what does this all mean? Does it amount to more than a hill of beans? I spoke to a very senior U.S. official, of course, the ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, when news of this first started to break, and he said, like, the administration here in the United States is saying that, you know what, if Russia, if Vladimir Putin is depending on North Korea for weapons and ammunition to support its war in Ukraine, then that is a very sad state of affairs. Adding that if Russia, if Putin is depending on North Korea to prop up Putin's ideas of, quote, \"an imperialist resurrection of the Russian empire\", then that is a very, you know, weak state of affairs for Russia to be in. Calling North Korea a pariah, calling, you know, the fact that North Korea does not have the most modern weapons that it could deliver anyway. You know, just a sort of a more of a show rather than something that would be really, really effective on the battlefield in Ukraine, for instance. Not to mention, of course, that if that does happen, both sides would be violating sanctions. South Korea has called on North Korea -- well, mostly on Russia to respect its role as an international player, as a member of the, you know, the Security Council and to abide by international sanctions. Because not only is Russia under some sanctions, but certainly North Korea is under a whole load of sanctions for a long period of time. Max?",

The village of Imi N'Tala was among the hardest hit by the earthquake. The deadliest Morocco has suffered in decades. But three days on, rescue teams have only just arrived. The high mountainous range is simply too remote. The roads, up until now, still obstructed by debris from the quake.

The court's being asked to decide whether it, the Supreme Court, has the power to overturn government acts that are unreasonable. It's a central part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to overhaul the country's judicial system.Israelis have been protesting for months over the issue. Critics say Netanyahu is trying to steal power away from the courts. And that all this weekend -- and it all weakens really Israel's democracy. Our Jerusalem Correspondent Hadas Gold is tracking this story for us. Lots of small incremental developments in this story. What's today about, Hadas? HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Well, today is really historic day, Max. We are outside of the Israeli Supreme Court. We're inside as we speak. This hearing is underway, and it's historic in several ways. One of which is, this is the first time that all 15 judges of the Supreme Court are sitting together to hear this case. And they are hearing what would be an amendment to a basic law. Now, Israel doesn't have a constitution. The basic laws make up a quasi Constitution. The Supreme Court has never before nullified a basic law. And this is something that they are potentially debating now. And this law that was passed in July, it's about their own powers. It's the Israeli parliament taking away the Supreme Court's ability to nullify government actions that they deem to be unreasonable. This is something that the Supreme Court has done just in the past year. Interestingly, though, actually, is that the government is not being represented by their own attorney general. Now, the attorney general is not a political appointee, but she issued her own opinion on this case last week, saying that she believes that this law should be struck down. This law cannot stand. And so as a result, the government is being represented by private counsel. Now, what the private counsel has argued so far today is saying that the Supreme Court does not and should not have the power to strike down amendments to the basic law (ph). Strike down, essentially, amendments to this quasi Constitution and saying that that power should be held by the people. The people who democratically, they say, elected this government into action. Now the government are -- now the plaintiffs' argument, the plaintiffs who brought this case to try to nullify this law, they say that this harms the authority of the judicial branch. It harms the status of Israel as a democratic state, and they also are claiming some impropriety and how this was even passed. How it was pushed through Parliament. Now, obviously, it's always kind of hard to tell how judges will actually rule on something and how they feel about something, but we're getting some hints from the Supreme Court justices so far. They are questioning sort of like, OK. They've asked the government lawyers, if the power should all be with the people and they should be the only ones who can decide this, well, what happens if the government decides to only have elections every 10 years, every 20 years, who will be the check on that power? Who will be there to stop that? And here's one quote that I think has really stood out. This is from one of the justices. They said democracy dies in a series of small steps. Now, this hearing is supposed to only last through today, maybe tomorrow, but the deadline for a decision, that will come in January. And there's a big question here, whether the government will even abide by a Supreme Court ruling that strikes down this law. This is setting Israel up, potentially, for a huge judicial and constitutional crisis. Max?",

      "sentences": "Kim Jong-un's heavily armored train has crossed into Russia ahead of an expected summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. So what could Russia and North Korea offer each other? This is reportedly the first foreign trip for the North Korean leader since 2019. And since the coronavirus pandemic, when the country's borders were closed, Kim and Putin were leaders of two of the most isolated countries on the world stage, both under heavy international sanctions.Russia's in constant need of weapons to keep up its war on Ukraine and North Korea may be in search of technology to keep advancing its nuclear weapons program. It's also suffering from food and cash shortages. To discuss what each side could offer the other, let's bring in CNN's Paula Hancocks live from Seoul. I mean, these are the things we assume are the topic of discussion because they're the two things that they're useful to each other for. But what do we actually know about the debate they'll be having? PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Max, what we've been hearing is a lot from U.S. intelligence and then also backed up by South Korean intelligence reports. So what they believe that -- first of all, let's look at North Korea. What North Korea could get out of this deal is satellite technology. Now we know that North Korea has already tried over the past few months twice to put a military satellite into space and has failed twice. So certainly that is something that they would want to get their hands on. And also the nuclear submarine technology as well. Now we have seen North Korea just recently launching what it said was a nuclear submarine. So certainly that would be again something that they are looking to gain more technology from. Now, again, we're hearing from U.S. officials that Russia simply wants more ammunition. It wants more small arms. And we know that North Korea has the capability to produce on a mass when it comes to these kind of ammunition, and we also know that they have a fair stockpile that they're sitting on. And the key here when you look at what Russia can get from North Korea is that the two militaries and the two sets of weaponry are fairly similar. So if North Korea were to give Russia certain types of ammunition, they wouldn't need to be modified at all. They would be able to be used in Russian weapons immediately. So that is a very large benefit for Russia. So certainly this mutual dependence and mutual alliance could really be very mutually beneficial for both countries, militarily, of course, but also politically. As you mentioned, they are both isolated, they're both heavily sanctioned and they are both united by a common enemy at the moment, which is the United States. Max?",
