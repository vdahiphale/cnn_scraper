We begin this hour with the political chaos in France.President Emmanuel Macron is expected to address the nation today as he works to name a new Prime Minister. This comes as French media is reporting that Prime Minister Michel Barnier is expected to formally submit his resignation in the coming hours. Now, this will leave France without a stable government or a 2025 budget at the end of this year. Barnier's ouster came after left- and right-wing lawmakers united to support a no-confidence vote against him, mostly over his proposed annual budget for next year. Members of Parliament blame Macron for the political chaos, and calls are increasing for him to resign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATHILDE PANOT, MEMBER OF FRENCH PARLIAMENT (through translator): With the no-confidence motion in this government, it is Emmanuel Macron's entire politics that has been defeated. One which was defeated three times in the results of elections, one which persists in wanting to make the people and the public pay for policy made for the richest, one which must now stop. And to get out of the impasse in which the President has placed the country, there is only one solution. We must now ask Emmanuel Macron to leave. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

For French democracy and for French government to work properly, you need a stable, upright majority, which is not the case since the President has called a snap election this past summer. And the issue is that the French Constitution doesn't allow for a new election until next summer. So, whatever the situation arises from the President's choice, whoever is appointed as the next Prime Minister, the likelihood is that this person is going to have to limp up until next summer, potentially with a new election and potentially with a new outright majority.",

You have the far-left, which is dominating about one-third of the seats, you have the central bloc, and you have the far-right. And each of those is about one-third of Parliament. So as soon as you have two of the three blocs getting together to topple a potential government, there's no way for the government to be able to work and to be able to continue working. So we're going to remain in this unstable position, again, as long as we're not in a position to have a new election, which will not come before next summer. But the point you're making is a very important one. It's the first time in French political history that Marine Le Pen's party and the far-right is in a position to pull the shots. And by toppling this government, it is in effect become a party that is associated with governing, associated with whatever is going to come up in the next budget.

And obviously, the more the scale goes on, the higher the pressure is going to be on him to resign.

So there's no audio on it as he kind of comes into the building. The lawmakers had assembled in there, and 190 of them voted unanimously to overturn martial law there. And now the focus appears to be on what comes next with the main opposition party, the Democratic Party, calling for impeachment. And we've also just learned that they're filing charges, not only against President Yoon, but also against his defense minister, who has since resigned, the army chief of staff, the head of the police, as well as several other military commanders and a minister of safety, accusing them of carrying out insurrection to disrupt the constitutional order with what they did there. I'll add another fact, and by the way, the police commissioner has since said that he doesn't believe that what took place that night amounted to a crime, as he's being accused of that. This is the entry to the hall of the National Assembly there. And the opposition lawmakers are refusing to leave that chamber. They're staying there in shifts, even throughout the night, because they say that they are worried that President Yoon could try to declare martial law yet again. So they are literally performing a vigil in there to protect what they say are their constitutional rights, which is if you get enough lawmakers, a majority in there, they can vote to overturn a martial law decree.

One reason this situation has intensified is because he has effectively delegitimized the leader of the opposition party, Lee Jae- myung. Lee Jae-myung himself is a polarizing political figure, disliked by conservative opinion. You see him as, if you like, a progressive populist, anti-elitist. Not, if you like, one of them. And therefore there are great concerns about what might happen if President Yoon were impeached. This would then lead to, ultimately, a new presidential election. And there are serious questions about who might win a future presidential contest. What would that mean for the direction of South Korea's foreign policy? Lee Jae-myung, if he were a candidate, would potentially take the country in a very different direction, perhaps in ways that threaten the U.S.-ROK alliance. So for more sober-minded Koreans looking at this situation, they worry about the implications of yet another impeachment crisis, raising concerns about the stability of the political system altogether and what it might lead to in terms of future leadership of the country.",

They say that they gathered evidence over some nine months and they said they found numerous incidents where the Israeli military or government authorities had acted in a way that was against three out of the five acts that are banned under the U.N. Genocide Convention.They say that they found mass killing of Palestinian civilians, causing serious bodily or mental harm, and then also deliberately inflicting conditions of life on Palestinian civilians in Gaza that were calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part. And they say that this evidence was sufficient for them to believe that Israel's conduct in Gaza does amount to genocide. Now, it has been strongly denied and condemned by Israel itself. The IDF calls the claims entirely baseless, saying that it doesn't take into account the operational realities of the Israeli military in Gaza, pointing out that Hamas uses Israeli, excuse me, Palestinian civilians as human shields, that they are hiding within the civilian population and that the Israeli military does all it can to try and mitigate harm, it says, to civilians in Gaza. Now, Amnesty does acknowledge that Hamas does hide in densely populated and residential areas, but says that this does not absolve Israel of the responsibility to protect civilians. Now, it's just one of the latest accusations against Israel when it comes to its conduct in Gaza. We know that there is a case and accusations in the International Court of Justice in The Hague brought by South Africa of genocide. This has been strongly denied by Israel, saying that the accusations are grossly distorted. There's also a U.N. special committee just last month that said that they had a report and it said that Israel's conduct is consistent with the characteristics of genocide. Rosemary.",

He was rejected largely on the grounds of concern about having a defense secretary who has a history of problems with alcohol. Certainly, you know, it's a little different than having an interior secretary or a V.A. secretary. Someone in the nuclear line of command with a history of alcohol issues is something that I think people are rightly concerned about.",

It's like Paul Simon would have said, hello, chaos, my old friend.This is the way Donald Trump manages impulsively, makes decisions without full information. There's no way they knew all of this about Pete Hegseth, all that's come out from Jane Mayer. And certainly we know they didn't know about the rape allegation and the investigation. And this is kind of a preview of what a second term is going to be. I mean, the idea that it's going to be vastly more professional and calm and kind of considered and moving in a consistent direction. Look at the turnover in the even in the transition here with this DEA nominee pulling, you know, withdrawing. And Matt Gaetz having to withdraw. And now the odds, I think, better than not that Hegseth has to. And the possibility that Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr. will be voted down. All of this is telling you that we have sort of bought a ticket for the same ride we saw from 2017 to 2020 with a lot of daily chaos in the administration of the executive branch.",

It's a drastic change from the first attempt to return the 57-year-old to the U.S. on Saturday. When she caused this disturbance and was removed from the flight before takeoff. A second attempt to send her back on Tuesday ended when Delta refused to fly her. TSA now confirms Dali bypassed I.D. checks without a boarding pass during the busy pre-Thanksgiving travel rush and using a lane reserved for flight crews, then slipping into the regular screening lanes. The agency says while they did not check her documents, Dali and her bags were screened. A senior law enforcement official tells CNN Dali blended in with a large family boarding the Paris flight to get past the gate agents and onto the plane. She then hid in the lavatories in flight until she was discovered. Why Dali is trying to get to France remains a mystery. According to record, she lives in Philadelphia and petitioned for asylum in France years ago, but was denied.
