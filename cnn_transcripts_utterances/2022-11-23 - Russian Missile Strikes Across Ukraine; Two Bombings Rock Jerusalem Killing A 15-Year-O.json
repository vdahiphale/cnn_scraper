Tonight, a brutal day of Russians strikes causemisery in Ukraine as millions though in the country go without power for yet another day. I'll be speaking to W.H.O. who are on the ground in Dnipro about conditions there. Then devastation in Jerusalem as a teenager dies in what police call a combined terror attack. We're live there with the very latest for you. Plus, a shock victory for Japan at the World Cup as the team beat Germany 2-1. We'll be digging into all the action on and off the pitch from Doha. But first, Russian missiles rained down on multiple Ukrainian cities on Wednesday, and that included Kyiv. And it was one of the largest attacks yet. Ukraine's military calls it a large scale attack on crucial infrastructure facilities. The military says the Russian side launched as many as 70 missiles, and that the majority of them were shot down. But not all. Police say a residential building in the capital was hit, killing at least four people. Every region in the country is now seeing power outages because of these attacks, every region. It is forcing authorities to shut down nuclear plants and suspend the capital's water supply. There was also a Russian strike in the Zaporizhzhia region. Officials say a maternity hospital was hit and a newborn baby was killed. Our senior international correspondent Matthew Chance is in Odessa for us this evening. And Matthew, I mean, the picture I'm just painting -- I've just painted is pretty dire. It seems situation on the ground is getting colder, darker and more brutal. Just give us a sense of what you are seeing there.",

The whole city has been without power for some hours now, obviously people have generators, is why they're sort of ad hoc needs. But you know, the infrastructure is really creaking under this sort of blanket of Russian bombardment of missiles that have been taking place not just over the course of the day, but over the course of the past couple of weeks, really targeting the energy infrastructure and the water infrastructure of the Odessa region and of areas across the country. There have been power outages, power cuts as far away as Lviv in the far west of the country, as far as you can go essentially away from the war zone. This is a national crisis that Ukraine is facing as a direct result of these constant Russian missile attacks on energy infrastructure targets. Of course, some of the missile strikes other things as well, we saw that in Zaporizhzhia earlier today with a maternity ward being hit by a Russian rocket with devastating effects. There are -- you know, the doctor -- a young mother was pulled from the rubble, but a small baby, just two days old couldn't be saved. That's another tragedy in this ongoing conflict. And of course, those horrific scenes from around the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, as well, with a rocket striking a residential building there with dozens of people either injured or killed. So, that's, you know, an extraordinary -- another example of the human impact that these rocket attacks, these missile strikes are having on the people of Ukraine. Isa.",

But of course, that's not an option for millions of Ukrainians. And of course, there are a lot of efforts underway to try and, you know, first of all reconnect the electricity supply and repair the damage, bits of infrastructure that had been hit by missiles. The governments also announced the opening that they haven't all been opened yet, of centers where people can go in towns and cities, and you know, do -- you know, get some heating, you know, use phone lines or the internet and do some cooking or get some hot meals.

Fortunately, the basic safety and security systems were not affected. But there were a couple of hits that were of particular concern. For example, one very near the dry storage area where the spent fuel storied and another one impacting the roof of a hole where fresh fuel is stored. So quite dangerous situations there. But the plant in as much as one can use the word normal, is in normal operation within the current parameters, which is what we call in the jargon coal shut down.

We have been -- we are inspecting Iran.

So, this reduction on the inspection activity coupled with what you are just saying. Meaning that they are enriching more and more and more. Of course, it's a source of legitimate concern for us because we believe that, you know, as much as they can get into this enrichment activities, they must be aware of the fact that they are -- of course, there are consequences for that. There is a degree of uncertainty. And the IAEA has to have the full picture of what is happening in order to give some credible assurances that there is no deviation for non-peaceful uses.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (SIREN BLARING) HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Sirens ring out during rush hour after a double-bombing shook Jerusalem Wednesday morning. A 15-year-old student was killed and more than 14 injured, and what authorities are calling a suspected coordinated combined terror attack. The first explosion captured on CCTV footage widely shared on social media, rocking a bus station at one of the main entrances to the city. The blast so strong, debris and pockmarks reaching past three lanes of traffic. Authorities believe a bag or package was placed at the bus stop around 7:00 a.m. and was likely detonated remotely. The first blast killing the teenage boy, a Canadian-Israeli citizen who was a student at a Jewish religious school, and injuring at least 11 others. A second blast occurred not far from the first around half an hour later at the city's remote junction, lightly injuring three people.

For, example our teams were in Kherson today and yesterday. And there's literally almost nothing left. The fact that surgery could go on is because of all the (INAUDIBLE) of the generator but even in Dnipro, it was the same.

Our Eleni Giokoslooks at how they're using 3D printed corals to restore underwater worlds. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) ELENI GIOKOS, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For any successful start-up, there comes a time when it's necessary to expand to new markets. And choosing the right location can make or break a company. With more than 200 islands making up the city, Abu Dhabi was the perfect place for Vriko Yu and Deniz Tekerek to launch their regional headquarters for their start-up, Archireef. DENIZ TEKEREK, CO-FOUNDER, ARCHIREEF (voice-over):  As soon as we landed here, there was an incredible amount of support and one thing led to another, essentially. So we ended up seeing a very, very smooth operation from the side of people who were interested in us. And we were very quickly able to win over clients and win over investors as well. Since then, we decided to really establish some roots here.",

That is achieved by placing these 3D printed tiles on the sea floor. VRIKO YU, CO-FOUNDER, ARCHIREEF (voice-over):  So for coral to settle in a sea bed, they need to have a stable substrate. But they don't have roots by themselves. So what we are creating is basically renovating an inhospitable environment to a livable substrate for coral to regrow. GIOKOS (voice-over):  The reefs are manufactured and one of Abu Dhabi's industrial areas. This 3D printer, the first of its kind in the world, allows the team to print up to seven tiles a day using clay, a material Archireef says is not toxic to ocean life. Like most companies that move to Abu Dhabi, the founders see the city as the gateway to a wide region, a place where they can build and eventually expand from the UAE to the world -- Eleni Giokos, CNN.
