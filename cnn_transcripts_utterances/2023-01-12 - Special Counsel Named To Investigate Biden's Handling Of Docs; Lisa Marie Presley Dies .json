And why that matters is this. Part of the reason, I was told, there was so little information, there were such extensive limits, on what could be said, over the course of the days, leading up to this moment, was because White House officials were very concerned, about the possibility of having a Special Counsel appointed. They didn't think one was merited, and they certainly didn't want one to have to deal with. Now, they very clearly have one. They have made clear they will cooperate throughout. The cooperation was never in question. It was about how things were presented, and what they were willing to acknowledge publicly. Obviously, there has been some divergence, in those two issues. And that, at least according to our colleague, Evan Perez, played a role, in the decision, by the Attorney General, today, Anderson.",

Elie, I mean, just from a messaging standpoint, and just an accuracy standpoint, the White House could have come out, when President - the day, President Biden spoke. They could have acknowledged \"Oh, there were more documents found,\" being upfront about it. And they didn't. ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, AUTHOR, \"HATCHET MAN\": Yes. The White House messaging was a mess, and it's self-destructive. And the specific problem, they had, the biggest problem is this. Here's the timeline. In November, Joe Biden's lawyers went through and found classified documents, in his office. In December, they went and found classified documents, in his home. And, in January, three days ago, they came out and said, \"We found classified documents in the office,\" but they made no mention of the home, and that is utterly inexplicable. Now, of course, that's a PR problem. But more than that, when you're a prosecutor, and you're looking at a subject, of an investigation, like this, you start by giving them the benefit of the doubt. But when they start giving away their credibility, it is very difficult, for them, to win it back. And that's why Evan Perez's reporting makes a lot of sense to me that those inconsistent statements had a lot to do with the appointment of Special Counsel.",

But I want to underscore a really important point here, Anderson. The Justice Department did not need, legally, to appoint a Special Counsel here. This is for the appearance. Elie used the term, a moment ago, \"PR problem,\" and that's really what it is. This is not at the moment, a legal problem, for the White House. This is purely a function, of how well the White House has characterized the situation that they're in.

And sure, you investigate other people, around Joe Biden. But ultimately, I think, you have to make an effort, if you're DOJ, to speak with Joe Biden. Now, that could go the easy way. He could agree to it. That could go the really difficult way. There could be a subpoena, and perhaps a fight, in the courts, or we could see some sort of middle ground. Bill Clinton, for example, when Ken Starr wanted to talk to him, after a very difficult negotiation, they reached this sort of middle compromise, where Bill Clinton testified, on videotape.

So, what I think they would do, is build a case, around the former President, maybe up to and including him. And look, he has done himself no favors, by speaking out publicly, already, through the Truth Social (ph), if you want to call them that, the statements he's put online, and so on.

Just a few hours ago, Priscilla Presley, taking to Instagram, asking, for prayers, thanking everyone, for the outpouring of support, with tons of comments being flooded by fans, in just a matter of minutes, and celebrities. I was at the Golden Globes, earlier this week, in L.A. I saw Priscilla. I saw Lisa Marie. She definitely did not look like her usual glowing self. I didn't have a chance to speak to her, but I passed by her table. It was a really big night, because Austin Butler, who portrayed her father, in Baz Luhrmann's \"Elvis,\" he won a Golden Globe, and it was a very touching moment. I mean even the audiences, the viewers at home saw her, as she was staring at Austin, as he gave this moving speech, next to her mother. And we knew just how close Priscilla and Lisa Marie were. And it's been a really rough couple of years, Anderson, because Lisa Marie lost her son, to suicide, in 2020. And she opened up about that loss, in a very emotional essay, this past summer, about dealing with grief, and how hard it's been, for her, since the loss of her son, Benjamin. But our thoughts go out to Priscilla, the entire family, and to Lisa Marie's children, for what can be such an unimaginably difficult night, for them.",

RITCHIE TORRES (D-NY): Not done (ph) mentioned is the fact that George Santos defrauded the voters. He won under fundamentally false pretenses. He lied about every aspect of his life, his family heritage, his employment, his education, his business dealings, his philanthropic endeavors, his ties to historical events, like Pulse mass shooting, the Holocaust, 9/11. So he's, the breadth of his deception, is simply staggering. And for him to speak as if he won fairly is completely disingenuous, and dishonest. But he has no contrition or no shame. He not only lies, but he lies about his lies. He claims that he never lied about his work experience that he only embellished. He claims that he never said that he was Jewish, only that it was Jew-hyphenated-ish.
