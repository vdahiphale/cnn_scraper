We're going to show, this is moments ago as they opened the hatch. The commander, Jared Isaacman, heading outside? Why it is historic, he is not a professional astronaut the first civilian spacewalker In the history of space.Let's bring in CNN's Kristin Fisher for much more on this. Kristen, this is so cool. Talk to us about what history this is that's being made.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so we just saw the missions commander Jared Isaacman test out SpaceX's brand new Space suit in the vacuum of space for the very first time. And the reason this is so important is because up until this point, there has only been NASA astronauts or government astronauts, professional astronauts that have been able to do these incredibly risky but necessary maneuvers in space. You know, it's one thing to go to space. It is another thing to do a spacewalk. It is one of the most difficult things you can do.And so, yes, these are civilian astronauts, but this crew has been training for two and a half years for this moment. And so, in addition to Jared Isaacman, the crew's commander, going out, pretty soon, we're going to see the mission specialist, Sarah Gillis, step out into the vacuum of space. And the reason Sarah was selected for this specific mission was because she is SpaceX's lead astronaut trainer. And so anytime a NASA astronaut has gone up on a SpaceX Crew Dragon, same spacecraft as this one, Sarah Gillis has had a hand in overseeing their training, but she herself has never been to space. So, that's why she was selected for this mission. So, she has firsthand experience of what this is like when she goes back to Earth and starts training NASA government astronauts for this mission. But back to the private and civilian astronaut aspect of all this, you know, when SpaceX attempts to go to Mars, which is what all of this is building to, it's going to require spacesuits that are developed much faster and much cheaper than what NASA has been able to do. And so that's why these spacesuits are so important. So, there you have Sarah Gillis right there. She is the mission specialist. She's also the lead space operations engineer at SpaceX, the lead astronaut trainer. And she is the person who trained Jared Isaacman on Inspiration4 to go into orbit. So, Jared Isaacman, you may remember, he first flew to space three years ago on a SpaceX Crew Dragon. That time he just orbited the Earth. Now, he's really taking it up a notch by actually doing a spacewalk, guys.",

So, the spacewalk itself, very risky, but the other part of this mission that's really going to test SpaceX, the vehicle and the crew is when they close the hatch, right?So, we've spent all this time depressurizing the spacecraft so that it matches the pressure inside the spacecraft, match the pressure outside. But they've got to once the spacewalk is over, they have to close the hatch and re-pressurize the spacecraft. So, you know, what happens if they can't re-pressurize it? What happens if the hatch doesn't close properly? I had the chance to interview the crew, Jared Isaacman. Actually, let's go ahead and listen to this moment right here.",

And as I was saying, I had the chance to interview the crew before they launched. And Sarah Gillis and Commander Jared Isaacman, they described what they would be doing in space. They said, it looks like we're moving like caterpillars. And at one point, Jared said, yes, I feel like I'm a dancing caterpillar.It looks weird what they're doing. But what they're doing is they're working the suit through mobility checks. They're checking out all the joints, seeing how difficult it is to move this pressurized suit. And, you know, NASA astronauts often talk about getting hot spots on their suits because it takes effort to simply move your arm up or open your hand or close your hand. And if your suit's not fitting in the exact right way, it can cause blisters or hot spots. So, that's what she's doing right there. They warned us it may look a little bit funny but that's what they're doing. And so the goal is to take all this information back to the SpaceX engineers on the ground so they can make the adjustments necessary to make this a spacesuit that can someday walk on Mars.",

It's just awesome to be able to see this in real time.And I'm looking at -- I hope you can see it. If you guys can drop the banner, they might be able to see it, and, Miles, you can talk about this is what SpaceX has is like these indicators so you can see it all kind of happening live. And if you look at that also, well, they look like they're moving like caterpillars. They're moving at the speed of almost 26,000 kilometers per hour. A little Kate math on the Google, 25,000 kilometers per hour is 15,000-plus miles per hour.",

And, yes, their hair isn't even getting blown back. It's kind of amazing, right? It's -- yes, this is a risky mission by any crew. They went to the highest altitude, you know, the previous being, of course, the moon missions, but Gemini 11 as well had, as far as Earth orbiting missions, was the previous record. And part of that was to test what happens when you get into what are called the Van Allen belts, which are supercharged particles that are highly radioactive. And if you're going to go to Mars, you have to protect your crew against the exposure to radiation. And so this crew, they became guinea pigs by flying up there to see exactly what kind of radiation dosages they're going to get. So, there's a lot of risk involved in this mission.",

First, there was the Mercury program, in which NASA astronauts just flew in space. Then there was Gemini, where NASA astronauts first conducted a spacewalk. And then there was the Apollo program, when NASA astronauts first landed on the moon.What SpaceX is doing with the Polaris program, and which really started with Inspiration4 with Jared Isaacman at the center, the commander and the financier of these missions, Inspiration4 was kind of like Mercury, right? They just orbited the Earth. Now you have Polaris mission, Polaris Dawn, very similar to NASA's Gemini program, where the astronauts go out and do a spacewalk. But this is just the beginning of the Polaris program. This is the first of three missions that Jared Isaacman is partially funding alongside SpaceX to advance the company's endeavors in space exploration. And the next thing he wants to do, the third mission of the Polaris program, is he's going to be on the first crewed flight of SpaceX's Starship, the biggest, most powerful rocket that's ever flown, that is someday going to hopefully land humans on Mars, and before that, the NASA Artemis astronauts on the surface of the moon. So, it is similar to what NASA did all those years ago, but the difference is this is a private company doing it, and they're doing it so much faster.",

In fact, we had to at the very last minute, evacuated, abandoned our live shot location because water started over top of this berm that was protecting our area, and so we quickly evacuated. But getting back to a safe location even became a challenge and an adventure in itself because so many of the roads are closed within this very low-lying St. Mary's Parish were flooded. So, there were many homes that took on water, many roads that looked like rivers, and we experienced it firsthand our self. Now, this storm system is not done yet. So, we want to talk about what happened in Louisiana when we're talking about 0.38 inches of rain in such a short period, that eclipses their normal monthly average, and some locations got over nine inches. But here's the latest from the tropical storm. It's actually currently located near the border of Mississippi and Alabama, still churning in, a lot of moisture across the Deep South. So, the flood threat still remains for some locations, about 14 million Americans, Birmingham all the way to Tallahassee, New Orleans are still under a flood warning. It was a flashflood emergency yesterday as the bulk of the heavy rain came through, but that has since come to an end. Then on top of that, the tornado threat that is ongoing this morning. In fact, you can see some of these spin up little thunderstorms near Panama City. We want to keep a close eye on that because it doesn't take much for these tropical systems to interact with land and they spin up brief tornadoes that can cause damage and be quite disruptive as well. There was a lot of wind. We experienced it yesterday with wind gusts in excess of 90 miles per hour near the areas where we were located. So, that will take down trees, also cause more power outages. But, Sara, look at this. It was supposed to be a category 1 hurricane. In fact, it strengthened to a category 2 just before landfall, winds topping 100 miles per hour in Eugene Island.",
