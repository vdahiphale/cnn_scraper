I will tell you, just speaking to Democratic consultants, even Democrats who aren't necessarily close to the Harris campaign, they don't necessarily work well with them, they are telling me that they feel a bit boost of confidence going into Election Day, sand they point back to the vice president's address on the Ellipse right outside of the White House where she really tried to draw a contrast between her and Donald Trump. Now, at the same time, you know, you could play clips of Donald Trump right now, who was telling people, and he was saying this early in Reading, Pennsylvania, that he is so far ahead right now, they've never been this far ahead.

Admittedly, it's starkly different for many of the other polls, and -- well, I will tell my audience was based on 808 telephone interviews with people 18 or older. So, we have to take the sample size into an account. But the details on that mark showed an incredibly strong support level for Harris from women.

And maybe it's sort of the abortion issue that's been so divisive between the two parties in particular. But I was looking at some of the early polling as well, the early voting and data from data management firm Catalyst looked at it and said that actually the gender gap that we've seen in 2024 is actually narrowed from 2020.

Young women voted by 11points more than young men did, and that's according to a study from Tufts University. So, they have an 11-point advantage. Well, young women are more likely to vote Democratic than they are Republican, OK. That is -- that statistically historically what we've seen and what we know. To your point is, if we are seeing this increase in men being more registered and we're seeing this gender gap not only close amongst younger women, but amongst younger men, then that spells problems for Harris. But I will say this though, you have to wonder about the enthusiasm that Donald Trump has going into Election Day. It's very loud, it's very vocal, it's very big. But will those same voters, male voters, will they go to the polls in the same numbers as young women will, given the abortion issue? and I can tell you, I don't think they will. So, the question is, again, we don't know the answer probably for a couple of days, if not a couple of weeks after the election is, who was able to better work on their core group of supporters and get them out?

You know, both parties are expecting to have narrow majorities come January, and there's a handful of races that could control or could decide the control of Congress in these two Iowa races. These two congressional races have really been much of the focus because, as was mentioned earlier in this program, you know, both campaigns had all but written Iowa off. You know, neither Trump nor Vice President Harris has campaigned in Iowa since the presidential primaries ended. And neither campaign has established a ground presence in the state. They don't have paid campaign staff here, you know, we're not seeing the TV ads and the activity, obviously, that you're seeing in battleground states.

You know, just anecdotally, it seems like we are seeing more college students and young women getting involved in this election, voting and expressing concerns on that abortion issue largely because this is the first election since and Iowa law went into effect restriction -- restricting abortion, excuse me, as early as six weeks into pregnancy. Before then, legislation had been passed, but been tied up in the courts. And then, now, finally, it's been enacted and gone into effect. And so, you know, Iowa women, people in the state are actually starting to, you know, see, I guess, the results and the implications, the results of this legislation.

There'll be members of Congress that will say that. But as long as Harris concedes and says, actually, no, we're moving on and we are with -- we have to recognize that Trump is the president, that will do a lot of good to stabilize the environment. The very fact that every sinew of Trump's body seems to orient against that, and frankly, so too Elon Musk, the richest and most powerful individual in the country today, I think is a very big problem. And it's one of the reasons, frankly, that political stability will be much better off in the U.S. if it's not a close battle.

First of all, Julia, I do believe that policy is more different between Harris and Trump on Russia, Ukraine, then on China, where, I mean, frankly, Biden and Trump's policies have been very similar. There's a lot of bipartisan agreement on general orientation towards China. On the Middle East, where Trump is more pro-Netanyahu and pro-Israel than Harris would be, but Harris would also be strongly pro- Israel as a key ally. I don't think it would be radically different. Russia-Ukraine is very different. Here you would have Harris coordinating with the European allies, then working with Ukraine and trying to present a united front to Putin. Trump would not work with the Europeans, would unilaterally call Zelenskyy and Putin separately to freeze and end the war where it is. And the latter approach might succeed, but would deeply unnerve America's European allies. It would be seen by many of them as an existential crisis. So, that is a -- that's a radical difference between the two. And as you mentioned, North Korea. The North Koreans have sent troops, combat troops, to fight in Kursk over 8,000 now. Kursk is in Russia, and the NATO secretary general and the U.S. government has said this is a material escalation. But I will tell you that if those troops are sent to fight inside Ukraine, the United States is warning Russia that that could lead to NATO troops being sent into Ukraine, NATO combat troops. In other words, this is a very significant escalation. Putin has a very serious decision ahead of him. And if Trump wins, the potential that the Biden team in the last couple months of the administration will try very, very hard to shore that up and Putin will try to score points in advance of that phone call makes this the next few months on Russia-Ukraine are, in my view, incredibly dangerous if there is an uncertain transition.",

Certainly, Former President Trump has considered doing so in the past, and in 2018, he paused military exercises between South Korea and the United States. That pause happened when Trump was negotiating with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, over Kim's nuclear program. But under the Biden-Harris administration, those military exercises between South Korea and the United States have begun once again. In fact, the Biden-Harris White House takes credit for the formation of a new security partnership between Japan, the United States, and South Korea, forged in part to counter North Korean threats.

Trump is remembered for a series of pro-Israel moves when he was president, including moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights, and taking a tougher stance on Iran, while the Biden administration, including Vice President Harris, is seen by many here as having sought to restrain Israel's tough military response in a year since the October the 7th attacks.",
