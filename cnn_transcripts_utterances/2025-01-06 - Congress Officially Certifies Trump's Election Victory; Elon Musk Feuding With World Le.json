It might also come as news to Mike Pence who had to be evacuated from the Senate chamber along with members of his family a few short seconds ahead of rioters and was prevented by what Congressman Collins calls thousands of peaceful grandmothers from returning until after 3:00 the morning. That is when he finally managed to say these words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Today one of them, Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the so-called Proud Boys who is serving 22 years for a seditious conspiracy formally requested one. His lawyer called him, \"a young man with an inspiring future ahead of him.\" As for the president-elect, he posted this photo on social media today. That is the Ellipse four years ago and the crowd he summoned to Washington with the words \"will be wild.\" Of course, perhaps the biggest difference between then and now this time he won, just two weeks from tomorrow he will become president again. Here to talk about it, CNN political commentators David Axelrod, Alyssa Farah Griffin, Bakari Sellers, and David Urban.

The more he is talking about prosecuting people or whatever his rantings on X and Truth are, it is a distraction from what people wanted from him.

What move voters is what Alyssa talked about. The fact that you have to be talking about lowering grocery prices, you have to talk about the cost of living, you have to talk about the things that every average American is talking about at their kitchen table and we lost focus of that. January 6th is a day if I were to sit here and tell Alyssa or anyone else that I want to go out and injure 140 police officers, I want to make sure the president of the United States is down at the Mall threatening democracy and then if Kamala Harris does not certify the elections, I want her hung. That would actually chill the backbone of people that heard me say that. That is what we went through. That is a day in our history, but going forward, Democrats have to be about the party of tomorrow.

I think to the extent that there is a common ground that could be reached. I think, Speaker Johnson is going to work with Hakeem Jeffries to the extent possible. They are going to need Democratic votes in the House on certain measures to get bills passed. You're talking about whether there is going to be one or two big Reconciliation Bills. Democrats are going to be part of that, they are going to be part of it in the House, as well as the Senate.

And so, that's pretty close. If you look at the House, that is insanely close. How many votes, three? Four? That depends how many put into one of the Cabinet positions, there is a three-four vote difference. So it's not a mandate by any stretch. I do believe, Democrats are tired right now. We are weary right now. We just went through this battle and sometimes when you go through this battle and running a race when you don't win, particularly to someone like Donald Trump it takes the life out of you.

Initially the reports that he had driven to New Orleans essentially the evening before the attack seemed to make it seem like a -- you know, a matter of haste or an emotional response to something, but that is not the case here. This guy really planned this thing out with -- in a -- you know in a meticulous and highly organized way. And I should say he employed some techniques here that seem to go beyond his experience in the military.

Not all Canadians were very happy about the refugees. And then in 2017, his star really started to fade because of that. And then he pushed for these very restrictive measures during the pandemic.
