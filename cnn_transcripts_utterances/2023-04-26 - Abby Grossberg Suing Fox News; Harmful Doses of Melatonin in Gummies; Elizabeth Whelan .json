And then I think the biggest thing, too, was that she said that Tucker was hell bent on finding some sort of a link between what happened on January 6th and the FBI being involved, a conspiracy known as a false flag. And, you know, she had alleged he could potentially be trying to find this link ahead of the trial to sort of absolve Fox from any responsibility. So, those are the biggest takeaways to me.
