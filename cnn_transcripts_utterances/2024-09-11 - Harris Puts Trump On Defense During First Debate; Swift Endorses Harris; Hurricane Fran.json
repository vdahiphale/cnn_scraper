You know, one of the key problems Democrats have faced in this race is that Donald Trump's retrospective job approval rating has been increasing to a point where it has been higher in many polls and it was at any point during his presidency. Now why is that? It's because voters I think have been judging him mostly through the lens of what they didn't like about Biden, particularly inflation.What the debate did last night was remind voters everything else that comes with Donald Trump. And just one last point, Trump sounded like someone who is calling into a Fox News show. I mean, he has spent so much time speaking to his core audience, which is still a strength and, you know, he's going to turn out a lot of those people that he thought -- I think he had lost the ability to talk to a broader audience. Defending the January 6 rioters, saying that everybody wanted Roe v. Wade to be overturned, claiming again that he won the election and kind of the peak of this, insisting that in a very kind of racist argument that immigrants are eating people's cats and dogs. It was all -- he looked like someone who was coming out of a dark movie theater in des sunshine and kind of squinting because he has spent so much time talking to this narrow universe, he really had nothing to say to a broader audience. Now, real quick, I mean, the underlying realities are still there, 60 percent of Americans think they are not better off because of the policies of the Biden administration. When Trump was able to get to that, it's a reminder that those are going to be headwinds for Harris, but she couldn't have done any more than she did last night.",

The vice president went to a debate watch party. It's a pretty good sign of where they both though, the night ended up. And, you know, in terms of the message -- well, look, she was incredibly well-prepared. Make no mistake. You could see that from the start. But I think the most important part of it where she was on offense from the minute she -- not only the minute she started talking, but the minute she walked on stage, she walked across to former President Trump's podium and made him shake her hand. She was prepared. She was confident. She was on offense from the start.

And the other thing that kept sticking out to me too was that she clearly had studied how to use the split screen to her own advantage. And we've seen times when that can cause problems for candidates. I mean, when Barack Obama debated Mitt Romney, the first time, it was the way he look kind of agitated in the box next to Mitt Romney that made it seem as though he was struggling.

He is a deeply unserious candidate, who has serious consequences for the American public.Those facial expressions, that mastery of the split-screen, was all about showing the nation just how unserious, but how dangerous he is. And I have to say, she -- you know, I actually think that we're not giving her enough credit. She eviscerated him last night in ways that are going to are -- that I have not seen in, you know, 60-some-odd years of modern American presidential debates. One of the things that I think we are not used to is that were not used to seeing Donald Trump be beat so mercilessly on stage. We are used to kind of Donald Trump who can get under people's skin, who comes up with nicknames, who really just dominates in bullies, right? This is the through line for the Republican presidential primaries in 2016, and again in 2024. But what we saw with somebody like Kamala Harris is that she put him on the -- she put him on the defensive. She controlled the narrative from start to finish, and she did exactly what she was trying to do, which is she told the American people who she was, but she set the narrative about who Donald Trump was and just how dangerous he was for democracy.",

I'm not going to take away your guns. That's just something that is so far-fetched. And on this particular issue, she's very sound because I think it's not an issue that is polled that much anymore. You know, there's some elections where you have like second amendment or who's better on common sense gun reform or whatever that poll extremely high. I don't think it's one of those issues.
