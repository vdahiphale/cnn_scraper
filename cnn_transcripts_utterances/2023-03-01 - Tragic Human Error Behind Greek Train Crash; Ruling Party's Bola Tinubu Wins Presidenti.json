As you can see here, the Dow just down 68 points, almost a quarter of percent lower. Yields as well, US yields not doing particularly great, a higher four percent or so, the highest wise we've seen in fact, so far this year. We'll explain why. In terms of news we are keeping an eye on tragic human error. The Greek Prime Minister reveals the cause of last night's deadly train crash. We have the very latest. And the \"Godfather of Lagos\" is declared the winner of Nigeria's pivotal presidential elections. And still later, drug giant Eli Lilly cuts the price of life-saving insulin after huge pressure from the White House. The CEO speaks right here to CNN. Live from London. It is Wednesday, March 1st. I am Isa Soares, in for Richard Quest, and I, too mean business. Good evening, everyone. Tonight, the Greek Prime Minister says tragic human error caused last night's horrific head-on train crash. At least 38 people were killed when a freight train struck a passenger train near the City of Larissa. Nearby security cameras captured the moment the trains collided. You can see the explosion that lasts for several seconds there. The country's Transport Minister has resigned and the train station manager in Larissa has been arrested. The passenger train was carrying more than 350 people. One person on board described the crash as 10 nightmarish seconds followed, of course by panic, and then chaos. Nada Bashir has more for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice over):   The aftermath of a horrifying late night crash. Heaps of debris and carriages scattered across train tracks in Central Greece, after a passenger train carrying more than 350 people collided head-on with a freight train, killing dozens. KYRIAKOS MITSOTAKIS, GREEK PRIME MINISTER (through translator):   What we are experiencing today is very, very difficult as a country. We are talking about an unspeakable tragedy. Our thoughts today are first and foremost with the relatives of the victims. BASHIR (voice over):   The crash happened shortly before midnight, local time when the passenger train on its way from Athens to Thessaloniki, changed lanes and switched to a cargo track before colliding with the freight train. Firefighters worked through the night to find and identify victims. Rescued passengers described the ordeal as a nightmare. STERGIOS MINENIS, TRAIN COLLISION SURVIVOR (through translator):   We heard a big bang. It was 10 nightmarish seconds. We were turning over in the wagon and so we fell on our sides and until the commotion stopped. Then there was panic, cables everywhere. Fire -- the fire was immediate as we were turning over, we were being burned. BASHIR (voice over):   More than 70 people were injured and are now being treated in the hospital. Most of the passengers were young the head of the intensive care unit at a local hospital told state media. Meanwhile, rescue workers continue the desperate search for more survivors. MITSOTAKIS (through translator):   One thing I can guarantee, we will find out the cause of this tragedy and do everything in our power to make sure it never happens again. BASHIR (voice over):   Greece has declared a three-day mourning period. Flags flying at half-mast across the country to remember the crash victims. Authorities say the death toll is still expected to rise. Nada Bashir, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It has been flagged to authorities, it has been flagged over the past, according to my sources for the last 20 years that it desperately needed modernization. The issues date back I have from the year 2000, then, of course, the global financial crisis caused major issues in terms of investment. Part of it was privatized Hellenic train is actually Italian-owned now and we know that they were the ones that were managing the train systems themselves. We also heard from the Prime Minister, this was a grave human error. That's what it is pointing towards. We also understand that the state-owned enterprise's CEOs have also just tendered their resignation. And Isa, if you dig in further, it was lack of investments. Some people are questioning whether they were maintained well enough. But I think that, you know, as we're starting to figure out the investigation and the questions that are coming in, how is it possible that two trains are on the same track and a lot of the logistical issues that come with that, the train master has been taken into custody. He has been arrested. He has been charged with causing mass deaths. And then this train travels 15 kilometers at 166 kilometers per hour, and no one notices. There's no communication system that came into play, or a safety system that was activated for any type of warning that this collision was going to happen and that is what is shocking Greece right now. You've got young people that are victims of this, Isa. They were spending time over Carnival Weekend. It was Ash Monday. They were heading back to their universities to Thessaloniki.",

You know, experts are saying there was no real even GPS tracker on the systems and if there was, they obviously weren't in working order, and that's what is creating just this somber mood in Greece. This is national tragedy that's playing out. And I was just looking at what's happening around the hospital. The injured were so badly injured that there needs to be DNA testing for people to be identified -- people, loved ones are going to social media posting pictures and photographs of mostly students looking for their loved ones. People are still missing 350 passengers on board. We know that the death toll has now risen to 38. It is expected to rise even further. Some of the imagery that we've seen, those two first carriages call to light the fire so intense, very difficult to put out. And we heard from passengers that it felt absolutely horrifying to be in those carriages towards the end. And of course, those people were rescued, around 200, I hear have gone into safety and many people are still injured affected by shrapnel. So many questions are going to come up around this, Isa, and I think the investigation is going to be absolutely vital. And then importantly, the investment into fixing this problem.",

We saw a stinging statement from the Nigerian Civil Society Situation Room that called this not credible and this just keeps growing.

If it is not the fuel crisis, now there is a cash shortage. The naira shortage means that maybe the voters are depressed because some people just cannot travel to get to that where they're going. The Labour Party says it will be contesting this election in Court. But the Nigerian Supreme Court has never overturned an election, and it doesn't have the biggest confidence in the country. People don't think that it is independent enough to overturn an election. So we'll see where that heads.

The other part of the question is, how much are you enriching to? There is one press report that says 84 percent. Can you tell us? HOSSEIN AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator):  With regards to JCPOA, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been and is the most committed of all the parties involved in JCPOA negotiations. The party that left the JCPOA was Trump and the United States. The United States should not adopt deceptive behavior and instead, should return to JCPOA and adopt a constructive approach. Under the new government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, we have decided to continue dialogue in order to return to JCPOA. We have had the very long discussions in Vienna and the United States is accusing Iran. It is saying that the Iranians don't have the necessary resolve. They said, we were at a stage of reaching an accord but it is the Iranians who are too demanding. I will tell you explicitly, in the past few years, we saw that the U.S. officials were unable to make a decision because of their own internal problems and the pressures they're under. They are still unable to make a courageous decision to return to JCPOA. And of course, the Iranian parliament in the past few weeks, especially since the riots and the U.S. interventions and interventions by three European countries in the peaceful demonstrations in Iran, have been putting a lot of pressure on our government. I was in parliament last week and they said, \"Who do you want to make an agreement with? \"With the United States and three European countries that have been trying to change the system during the riots in the fall? \"Why are you negotiating with them? \"How can you trust them?\" Nevertheless, we are still on the path of dialogue. We have a roadmap with the IAEA.  And on two occasions, Mr. Aparo, Mr. Grossi's deputy, came to Iran in the past few weeks. And we had constructive and productive negotiations. And we have also invited Mr. Grossi to come and visit Iran soon. Therefore, our relationship with the IAEA is on its correct and natural path. And we have said this to the U.S. side through mediators that we are on the path to reach an accord. But if the Iranian parliament adopts a new law, then we will have to abide by the parliamentary act. So the window for an accord is still open. But this window will not remain open forever.

That's because of the growth and what we call high deductible plans or plans that people have to contribute out of pocket, early in the year, to the full cost of their medical care, including insulin. So in the case of Lilly insulin now, that they won't be subjected to those high deductible costs. They'll just pay $35.00 for about $1.20 a day when they go to the pharmacy counter.
