Among other incidents, the Israeli government initially claimed that it was armed Palestinian militants who killed the journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, which we know is not true. So why should the world trust you now?REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESMAN: Because of the importance of credibility. And in the past, we had our ourselves were fast to go to conclusions. This is why in this event, we took the time, took us more than five hours. We wanted to double check everything, make sure we're credible.

It said, while we continue to collect information, our current assessment based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday. And now this NSC statement, it did not say exactly who they do believe is responsible, but President Biden, he did say in remarks this morning that, quote, based on the information we have seen to date, it does appear the result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza.And look, officials told us separately here at CNN that it does appear to have come from a rocket launched by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. And so, the U.S. has been examining a lot of the intelligence that the Israelis have provided. That began really as soon as this attack happened. The Israelis started collecting information and they began sharing it with the U.S. intelligence community, which then took that and kind of examined it alongside U.S. intel community assets, which are also active, including overhead satellite imagery, blast analysis, looking at kind of the crater that Jeremy mentioned or the lack thereof, I should say, the radius of this explosion. And all of this, we are told, is pointing to the general conclusion that an Israeli airstrike was likely not the culprit of this. Now, the U.S. has also examined those intercepted conversations that the Israelis provided, allegedly between two Hamas militants discussing this errant rocket attack. But look, all of this is preliminary. The U.S. has emphasized and in our conversations with sources, they have emphasized that this is not a final assessment. And the NSC statement also made very clear that the U.S. is continuing to gather information about this. One thing that's very tough about this is that you can't have these kind of independent investigators on the ground there to actually examine this because of the situation in Gaza. So, the investigation remains ongoing. But the preliminary assessment is that it was not an Israeli airstrike, Anderson.",

They were throwing rocks and fireworks at the Lebanese security forces. They were responding with tear gas and water cannons. They did not, however, manage to break through the barrier that's always in place at the bottom of the hill to prevent exactly this sort of eventuality.And of course, the U.S. Embassy in Beirut is highly fortified, and employees of the embassy, or rather, American staff of the embassy, can't simply walk outside. They're under very strict restrictions when it comes to moving around Beirut. Now, the mounting tensions in Lebanon and across the region are starting to have an impact. The State Department has told families of embassy employees and non- emergency personnel that they can leave the country on a case-by-case basis. Saudi Arabia today advised all its nationals in Lebanon to leave the country immediately. France and the U.K. have told their nationals, don't come to Lebanon unless you absolutely have to, because, of course, the worry is not only of tensions in the street, but of course, the possibility of an outbreak of a war on the border between Israel and Lebanon.

And then Joe Biden wanted to go to Amman, Jordan, and meet with those three Arab leaders of Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians. And they didn't even want to meet him because of the horrible tragedy that happened at the Gaza hospital.Now, President Biden has announced that U.S. intelligence believes that, in fact, Israel was not responsible for all the deaths at that Gaza hospital explosion. But frankly, Arab countries, at least the Arab street, don't believe it. I've just been hearing so much anger still from Muslim and Arab countries. So, the U.S. has a real problem, but for now has clearly decided beyond Israel's side, but arrange those humanitarian corridors which can actually help people.

It's also, of course, important that he's already sent one aircraft carrier to the region and he's sending another aircraft carrier to the region. You know that new increased military presence by the U.S. is not for Gaza. It's really to send a warning to Iran and to send a warning to Hezbollah that if they attack and open up a northern front in Israel, that the U.S. might have to get involved. And that's one of the only ways I think the U.S. would get involved militarily in this situation is if Hezbollah attacks.And I think it would likely be appropriate for the U.S. to do airstrikes against Hezbollah. And I certainly think that's one of the things that is a consideration. Of course, there are behind the scenes talks between President Biden and Netanyahu about planning for every contingency, including that and including other actions by Iran, that Iran might take in order to inflame passions in the region. And I also mentioned simmering under all of this is the fact that Iran is still striving to get nuclear weapons. And one of the highest priorities for President Biden in the U.S. is to make sure Iran does not get those nuclear weapons.",

A lot of Israeli troops are killed. Usually, Israel is dependent on the Iron Dome to shoot down rockets from Gaza so there wouldn't have to be a ground invasion. This time, a ground invasion is absolutely planned. This time, Israel is determined to get rid of Hamas. Hamas, that means to overthrow, in effect, the government of Gaza City. And that's what the U.S. did after 9-11, went into Afghanistan in search of Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden, but also to topple the Taliban government, and the U.S. did that. And in Iraq, the U.S. invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein. So, Joe Biden looks back in history and says there were mistakes in all that. Don't let rage take over. But the rage is really strong right now in Israel, not just because of the killings, the massacres, the rapes, all the atrocities of October 7th, but now 199 hostages, Israelis being held in Gaza. Israel wants to rescue them. Maybe they should give some more time to let negotiations try to get some folks released, but I don't know if Israel will now allow for that and delay its ground invasion anymore.",
