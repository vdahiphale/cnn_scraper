It is a grave concern for our national security.It's sophisticated because the Chinese were able to figure out apparently some ways to exploit vulnerabilities in our telecom system. And then most of all, it's strategic, because China decided what they wanted to do most of this is we don't know this for sure, but this is what it appears like, they wanted to be able to find out which spies, which Chinese spies operating in the United States we might be tracking trying to use our own surveillance mechanisms on those flies here in the United States, and that's the information they were looking among other things. We don't know exactly the extent to which the Chinese are still in the system, and we're not sure exactly how they got in.

Everything that's needed to make anything, the entire supply chain, it's already here. And once things are made, China has the means to move merchandise quickly.

Methanol is -- can be found in alcohol when it's distilled, but the majority of cases you find here are industrial poisoning where it is at levels that you couldn't possibly get through distillation.Pretty much, it's an underground criminal-type thing when you get this number of cases in one particular area. It would have been done through coffee spirits swapped out that would have been sold extremely cheap, swapped out for a lot more expensive alcohol. It's a way just to lower costs of doing business. And, really, the tourist train is going to keep coming. So, a lot of merchants and that just don't really care about the net cost or the total devastation that's involved. This has been by far the biggest case I've ever come across. And the outcry, not only across Australia for Bianca and Holly, but also across the world for the other people that have passed away and are still very, very unwell. The media response has been amazing And now, of course, the awareness that people are talking about methanol, which, you know what, it's not a fun topic. So, this is amazing. And I want to thank you guys for inviting me on to have a chat about it.",

There is only like the family, you just cannot imagine -- you cannot begin to imagine the stress and the heartache they'd be going through. There is only one silver lining to this, and that is that we're all talking about it.You know, there will be more Holly and Biancas in years to come.
