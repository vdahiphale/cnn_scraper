I'm Isa Soares, and I'm coming to you from London.In just under 12 hours, and a day later than of course expected, Israel and Hamas are set to begin a four-day truce. The hard-fought agreement, the details of which were announced by Qatar in the last few hours, brings a brief respite, of course, after six weeks of deadly hostilities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTRY SPOKESMAN:  The beginning of the pause will be 7:00 a.m. Friday, the 24th of November, and it will last, of course, as agreed, for four days. And the first patch of civilians to be released from Gaza will be around 4:00 p.m. of the same day. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And then, and around 4Right now, convoys of humanitarian aid, as you can see there, are standing by at the Rafah Crossing into Gaza, ready to enter soon as the truce comes into effect. After weeks of delays, aid groups are again warning that the need is dire, which is something we've heard time and time again from NGOs on the ground. I want to bring in our team to get more on this agreement. I want to bring in Jeremy -- CNN Jeremy Diamond, he's in Sderot, Israel and Alex Marquardt in Washington, D.C. Jeremy, to you first. So, in roughly, what, 12 hours, less than 12 hours, the fighting is expected to pause and then we'll expected to see these 13 hostages to be released. Give us a sense of what the reaction has been to this in Israel. And I assume the families of those 13 have already been informed.",

The families of those who are not going to be a part of that initial 13 have also been notified, I'm told, and all of this is playing out, of course, against the backdrop of weeks of negotiations that have been absolutely nerve-racking for the families of those hostages, nearly 240 of whom are being held inside of Gaza and have been held inside of Gaza for some 46 days.I've spoken to several of those families and they've simply been waiting in anticipation to see if their family members will be part of that initial release of 50 hostages over the next four days. Tomorrow we expect to see the first 13 of those cross into Israel beginning at around 4:00 p.m. local time and they are expected to cross at perhaps three -- any of -- one of three different checkpoints crossings into Israel. And in the meantime, we also expect that ceasefire to kick in earlier in the morning, about 11 hours from now. But before that happens, what we are witnessing here in the Gaza Strip is a continuation of Israeli military activity. I've been hearing machine gun fire in the background. We've witnessed several large explosions. And the Israeli military has made very clear that they intend to continue operating, continue fighting in Gaza, up until they get the order to stop before that truce. Business as usual, in the words of one IDF spokesman. And earlier today, we saw that Israeli forces were carrying out large strikes, not only behind me in Northern Gaza, but also in Southern Gaza as well.",

Of course, international humanitarian organizations have said that this is still not enough, but it certainly will represent an uptick for the Palestinian people in, in Gaza. And what we also know is, of course, this will be the first time that, you know, civilians in Gaza can have some expectation of safety for the first time in 47 days. You know, they have been undergoing constant bombardment, even the areas that where they've been told to go further south have proven to not be very safe. They've come under bombardment there as well.

They say they were detained at a checkpoint in Central Gaza as they were making their way, evacuating from Al-Shifa, crossing over into Southern Gaza. Of course, they were detained at that checkpoint.As we understand it, the Israeli military says they are questioning Muhammad Abu Salmiya as to what he knew about a Hamas presence at the Al-Shifa Hospital. This is part of their ongoing investigation into their allegations of a Hamas command and control center being located beneath the Al-Shifa Hospital. But we have heard from the health ministry in Gaza saying they are now cutting ties in terms of their cooperation with the U.N. agency, the U.N. World Health Organization, who coordinated this convoy leaving Al-Shifa. As we know, there are still some patients inside Al-Shifa who desperately need to be evacuated but require specialist medical evacuation. And therefore, that could take some time. The health ministry in Gaza is now calling for the U.N. to issue a report, a clear explanation as to why this detention took place. They're also, of course, calling for the full release of medical officials from Al- Shifa.

[13:30:00] BECKY ANDERSON, CNN ANCHOR, CONNECT THE WORLD:  Yes. No, those are really important questions, on how this will be supervised, the Qataris announced today that they're setting up an operations room here in Qatar. They're not on the ground. They're here in Qatar, on the phones, keeping in constant contact with those on the ground. There'll be an ICRC, Red Crescent, Red Cross representative here in Qatar working with their colleagues on the ground. And so, it will be from Qatar, to a certain extent, that the sort of eyes on what is happening or the ears on what is happening to ensure that this all goes to plan. It is very fragile. They described to me this 45 days' worth of negotiation as intense, as extremely complicated, complex, made all the more difficult over that period by the escalation on the ground. You heard the IDF spokesperson there saying that they will honor the truce. The truce that, as you rightly point out, begins at 7:00 local time tomorrow. It will be hours after that, not until at least 4:00 in the afternoon, when the first hostages held by Hamas, 13 women and children will be released into the hands of the ICRC. And at the same time, as we understand it, prisoners -- Palestinian prisoners, women and teenagers, will be released in the same numbers as we understand it from Israeli prisons. It's really important that we try to get sort of a full picture of what the operational details of this humanitarian pause over four days will be understandably, perhaps the Qataris who have mediated this, were unwilling or unable to give us all of the granular detail. But I did press Majed Al-Ansari, the spokesperson who held the press conference today, about how this secession of violence would be described, as it were, or how it's described in the deal and what a breach would look like.

He reminded us that the last time we saw the release of, hostages, two sets of two hostages earlier on, during this conflict, there were actually surveillance drones, flying and it was, quite alarming, for those involved in the hostage release, because it could have been seen that was actually a hostile drone.

They see this as a sort of -- as a wider plan. This is the first step to what they hope will be a complete secession of hostilities, a ceasefire.But we know that the Israelis have been categoric about the fact that there will be no ceasefire until all hostages are released. And that means all hostages, including those soldiers and hostages of serving age, and they are very specifically not included in this first plan. The first plan is for these 50 civilian hostages, and specifically women and children. So, the Qataris -- the State of Qatar has been very explicit about what their wish is from the outset. They have said from the beginning that they want to see a ceasefire in this. And that is echoed around this region where I am of the Gulf, on the wider Middle East, and in fact, in many other places in the world. And so, yes, they've described this as only the beginning, this is the start of their work. But it is a huge diplomatic breakthrough, this truce, this four-day humanitarian pause, which of course also allows in, you know, a significant amount of aid and fuel for humanitarian purposes. And I think -- let's be frank, let's -- I think they need applauding to a degree for the work that is being achieved. It's a really -- it's the first significant diplomatic breakthrough in 45 odd days of this conflict. But it is fragile, it could slip at any stage.",

DANIEL LEVY, PRESIDENT, U.S.-MIDDLE EAST PROJECT AND FORMER ISRAELI NEGOTIATOR WITH THE PALESTINIANS:  You know, I think the importance is in the fact of the deal. We will pour over the details, but I think I would set those aside and say the importance is the proof of concept that the return of the Israelis being held in Gaza will be a negotiated return, that you can negotiate with Hamas, that you can have a cessation of hostilities for a period of time, and how do we build on that and make sure that this is locked in and we don't see a return to the kind of devastation and destruction of the last few weeks.

There are going to be a lot of tensions in these next days. Do both sides stick to it? Does Israel do something overnight, which puts this off track? Does a militant group not under the control of Hamas do something in the next four days? Is there an action in the West Bank? Because we can't forget 230 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since October 7th. Things are still escalating between Israel and Hezbollah. What is this drone flying agreement? So, lots of things that could cause this to unravel. But if it doesn't, if we can prove that this can be done, then it has to be the on ramp, the building block to ending this, because the military goal has not been achieved. It won't get the Israelis out. And we've had 14,500 Palestinian dead, including 6,000 children. We need to get onto a new page. This is the crack. This is the crack of an opening to that.",

In the end, one did, but one didn't. One opposed it. But there is this narrative in Israel that the release can't get in the way of the war, and that was precisely what the families had to push back against. And you had these amazing scenes in Israel of members of the families in screaming matches with right-wing coalition, members of the government saying, stop talking about killing Arabs and start talking about saving Jews. These were remarkable scenes. I think what happened is that the families over the course of these weeks understood that rather than focusing on mobilizing support overseas, they had to mobilize support in their own country. Israel wants to continue with this war, but I think what they're going to find is there is no military solution, not in the immediate term to Hamas and not in the bigger picture to Palestinian dispossession and to ending the overall state of war between Israelis and Palestinians, it needs to be politics.",

But once one sees these families being reunited, these people, we hope, coming out alive, what does that do to the dynamic of further pressure to see further deals? Because it's proof that you're not going to spring them militarily, you're going to get them through negotiations. And then, the crucial thing, if we can get to some kind of quiet, do you use that time to do politics, to address the fact that as long as Palestinians live under a system of occupation and structural violence there will not be security for Israelis or Palestinians, or do you waste that time?

So, well, as you said, the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, said only the engine is left of that vehicle. It was entirely incinerated. So, they've got a lot of kind of pieces to put together. The debris was shown over a large area. What we do know is that the FBI, along with its law enforcement partners concluded in a matter of hours, very stressful and confusing and frightening hours, that this incident that killed a man and his wife was not a nefarious act. It was, in fact, just a tragic accident. Listen to what an eyewitness, the governor and the FBI special agent in charge for the region had to say about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so, very important that this was taken very seriously and that so many agencies came out in support of this effort to resolve the issue.Of course, three -- all four bridge crossings were closed as a result of the incident. Now, three of them have been open. Still, the Rainbow Bridge behind me, you can see is still closed. Authorities, we saw earlier this morning, doing some more fact-finding. I can tell you that when it comes to this vehicle, at first there was confusion about which side of the border it came from, but it in fact came from this side, the U.S. side. Authorities believe this man and his wife had planned to go to a concert from the rock group, Kiss, in Canada, when that was canceled, they decided instead to go to a casino, the accident took place on the way back. The car -- the 2022 Bentley accelerating along the other -- the lane on the other side, hitting a curb and then hitting this barrier and ending up airborne, hitting a border patrol booth and injuring that border patrol agent. He suffered minor injuries and has been treated. So, a tragic accident, but two lives lost. No links to terrorism. And no explosives found in the vehicle. Isa. SOARES:  Athena Jones there for us in Buffalo. Thanks very much, Athena.
