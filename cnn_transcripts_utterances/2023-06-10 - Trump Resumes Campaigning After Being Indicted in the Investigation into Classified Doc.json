You see those photographs of those boxes of materials that are held in public spaces, the ballroom, in a bathroom. Ones that the indictment alleges were easily accessible.They said that more hundred -- more than 150 social events, including weddings, were held at Mar-a-Lago during this time period of really showing that the lack of security around these documents, some of them including ones that involve nuclear secrets. Now, of the obstruction part, that involves charges involving one of Trump's aide, Walt Nauta, he was also charged in this indictment. And they describe here this timeline of where Trump is subpoenaed by the Department of Justice for these documents in May of 2022. And his lawyer tells him that they are going to need to search these records. At that point, according to the indictment, Trump says to him, isn't it better if there are no documents found? Then, over the next two weeks Trump, according to the indictment, is working with Nauta to remove these documents. Nauta removes more than 64 documents over the next two weeks, bringing them to Trump's residence. And then when Trump's attorney went to look through these documents, he recovered 38 of them that he felt were responsive to the DOJ's subpoena. And according to the lawyers' notes when he was discussing this with Trump, Trump had said to him, if there's anything bad, pluck it out. Now, Trump is expected to appear here on Tuesday for his arraignment. He's shaken up his legal team, bringing in a new attorney to represent him in this case, and Trump has said he will plead not guilty to these charges. Victor, Amara.",

And if he does, of course, he will testify in exchange for what hopefully will be a more lenient sentence when he is sentenced. The problem is, he's hitched his wagon to the former president so far and he may be hoping that if Trump can get reelected, he, of course, would just have this case dismissed or maybe that another Republican president would pardon him.

I am here very nearby to where the former president is right now at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey where he'll be leaving soon for a pair of campaign stops in North Carolina and Georgia. It will be the first time that we have heard from Donald Trump ever since his indictment was unsealed Friday afternoon.Now, I spoke with one of his senior advisers yesterday. They told me they spent Friday working on his speeches, as well as that Donald Trump remains defiant right now. But that is the image that his team is trying to portray. And I do think that you should expect to see some of that bravado on the campaign trail this afternoon. But behind the scenes, I've been talking with a lot of people close with Donald Trump and those who are there at his golf club with him and they tell me that unlike Thursday night, when they had first learned of the federal charges, they were really focused on the political implications of this. They were emboldened by the show of support that they were getting from Republicans on Capitol Hill and other conservatives on the air waves. And they thought that this could offer him a political boost for his reelection campaign in the immediate term. But Friday afternoon, the mood had changed here in New Jersey. Some of his aides had grown more concerned, really focusing on what are the legal implications of this? And even though they think he still could benefit from this politically, they are worried about how this will play legally down the road. Now, I should add that even though we have heard from a lot of Republicans, people in leadership, like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, showing support for Donald Trump. After the charges were unsealed Friday afternoon, a lot of these members were more noticeably quiet. The same goes for some of his presidential rivals. We heard from Governor Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, they put out statements of support, not really for Donald Trump, but railing against the Justice Department. And so, I think we're going to continue to see how this plays out, both for Donald Trump and his campaign, but also how the Republican Party itself is reacting to this. Victor, Amara, back to you.",

And they cannot afford, if they do want to somehow defeat Trump and become the nominee, they can't afford to alienate the huge chunk of the Republican Party base that continues to be enthralled by Donald Trump, who will defend him through and through, through these charges.So, that's why you hear, you know, as we mentioned earlier, candidates like Nikki Haley, and Ron DeSantis really go after, for example, the, \"Weaponization of federal -- weaponization of the federal government\" and really criticizing the Justice Department. Because they feel that without, you know, maybe overtly, you know, defending Donald Trump, that's this anti, sort of, anti-DOJ sentiment they feel they can grab on. I do think it's interesting that it's really the two former federal prosecutors in the field, that's Asa Hutchinson and Chris Christie, who have been pretty vocal just about Trump in the beginning but also about these charges. As you mentioned, the former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has said, he should drop out of the race. You know, Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, after reading the indictments, just underscored how serious these charges are. And kept saying over and over, is this the kind of commander in chief you want, really, being so careless and reckless with the nation's most sensitive secrets?

And there's reason to believe that he's going to get a boost from his loyal supporters which, obviously, great for primaries. But looking ahead to the general, do you think Republicans will see him as unelectable given his -- the legal problems that David just laid out? KIM: I mean, a lot of Republicans feel that that is the reason why President Trump cannot be the general election nominee because you have -- I mean, you -- no one is changing their minds in this -- about Donald Trump in this country. And as particularly as a contrast to President Biden, they just feel like President Trump comes as (ph) so many political liabilities and that he cannot be put back in the Oval Office should he be the Republican nominee. Now, that it is not the calculus that other, you know -- that's, sort of -- that Donald Trump is looking at right now. Right now, he is looking at trying to galvanize his voters. He will certainly -- almost certainly do that in the short term. But I do wonder what the impact is going to be after voters and the public, and particularly Republican officials, especially those who have been quiet so far, really absorb the severity of these accusations. Obviously, Donald Trump, like everyone else, has a presumption of innocence. But if you look through the indictment, as we all have, these are pretty serious charges against a former president of the United States who wants to occupy that office again. And I'm really interested in seeing, especially the Republican candidates and the Republican officials who were so eager to defend him starting Thursday night, after they've had the chance to, kind of, think about the facts and absorb the details of the indictment, if they changed their tune at all. If they -- if not overtly criticizing him. If they toned down their vocal defense of Donald Trump in the immediate aftermath. You know, having covered Republicans on Capitol Hill, their interactions with Trump for the last several years, I'm a little skeptical of that happening. But it will have to wait and see.

So, Les, we spoke with you a couple of weeks ago and I was struck by your optimism because you said they could potentially survive. We're talking about a 13-year-old, a nine-year- old, a four-year-old, and a one-year-old. How do you think they survived for 40 days in the Amazon jungle? LES \"SURVIVORMAN\" STROUD, SURVIVAL EXPERT, FILMMAKER: Yes, absolutely. It's going to come down to the nature of their indigenous upbringing in that environment. If you think about it, you know how to survive where you were raised. I know how to survive where I was raised. They know how to survive where they were raised. So, I think some of the details that will emerge over time in the future will be, for me, the biggest question will be what did they find to eat? So, we think of things like, well did they pick off trees? You know, that we think, in terms of a cliche that way with the jungle and hanging bananas or something like that. But that probably won't be the case. It will more likely be that because they've grown up in the jungle, they're very familiar with eating grubs and bugs. Sounds gross to us, I know, but I've been in several of these places where that's just the normal way. So, the -- this miracle hinges upon the fact that it's been in their inherent indigenous upbringing to know what to do when simply walking around the jungle, never mind trying to survive in it.",

So, in I like to address that water concern right away that way. Don't think, in terms of the cliche, of being lost in the wilderness, there's no water. It's the jungle. There's usually lots of water. And they also, again, due to upbringing will know where to find it.On the predator side of the question, jaguars and pumas. So, the wildcats that are there. I've been chased out of the jungle myself by a jaguar. This is a very big cat, upwards of 200, 250 pounds. And it will stalk humans. I've known situations where many indigenous people have had to come in quickly from their hunting trip or fishing trip, get back into the village where they're safe because of jaguar. So, that would -- those would be the biggest predators. I wouldn't go too heavily on the poisonous side of things. Once again, like finding food and water, their own upbringing would have led them to know how to sleep in a place that has biting, stinging, you know, even to the point of lethal insects. So, primarily, the short answer, would have been dealing with the jaguar. Why weren't they attacked? Because once again, their upbringing would have taught them how to evade and remain hidden and get -- and hide from something like a jaguar.",
