      "sentences": "Brianna, the war very much back on, as it has been since the truce expired at 7Both Israel and Hamas have said they were ready to resume fighting. And, frankly, they have very much shown it, Israel unleashing powerful strikes across Southern Gaza, including Khan Yunis, the major city in Southern Gaza, as well as near Rafah, the major border crossing, where humanitarian aid is no longer flowing in as of this morning, according to an eyewitness we're in touch with there on the ground. That's despite Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying that the humanitarian aid needs to continue to alleviate and help the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. Meanwhile, Blinken also said that Israel needs to take steps to reduce the number of civilian casualties. So far, as a result of Israeli strikes, health authorities in Gaza say more than 100 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more injured. Take a look here. I just heard from my cameraman off to my left here that there are interceptors being launched as we speak here. Oh, and I can see two Iron Dome interceptors launched from our position here towards rockets incoming from Gaza. That's the second set of launches we have seen this evening, others just happening about an hour-and-a-half ago. Hopefully, we can pull up this picture for you in a moment here, and you will see those interceptions. A couple of launches earlier today. We saw about 10 of those, if not more, intercepting rockets fired from Gaza, so Hamas showing its ability to still wage war now that the truce has ended. Meanwhile, hospital authorities -- or health officials, I should say, in Gaza saying the biggest facility there is at 200 percent capacity. So you get a sense of the difficulties in trying to manage the number who have been injured and killed as a result of the fighting there. Meanwhile, negotiations continuing to try to bring about a truce again, as we keep an eye on the sky here, negotiations continuing, Israel indirectly in touch with Hamas through the U.S., Egypt and Qatar. There has been at least some optimism expressed from a senior State Department official that it's possible to get back to a truce, despite the fighting we're seeing on the ground right now. Oh, and, there, I just heard the interceptions coming from my left there, the loud bang in the air of Iron Dome picking off incoming rockets. A couple of more bangs from the interceptions there. The challenge, of course, is, Israel demands 10 women and children released for another pause in fighting. Hamas insists they don't have that ability, since they don't have that many women and children at this point. They say they want to talk to Israel about expanding it to include elderly women -- I'm sorry -- elderly men, as well as men and women who are younger, and maybe soldiers. Israel refused those negotiations, according to Hamas. So that's where we stand here, as we see, on this first night with the truce ending, the war very much continuing. We will keep an eye on the sky and, of course, we will keep an eye on what's happening in Gaza.",

Hamas learned the lesson from that, and they have put them all together. I think the truth is more difficult than that. I think that there are many more of the hostages that have died under the hands of Hamas. In Gaza, I would presume that this is the reason why they cannot provide more names. But, hopefully, I'm wrong and, hopefully, there are more names such as that. And if this was the case, we could continue, because the government of Israel has made it clear that they will continue this setting of 10 a day. There have been about 80 already, more than I expected, I have to say. I thought that Hamas would play the bargaining chips more tightly. But I'm very happy that all of those have been released. Now, for the future, Hamas at the moment insists that, for the release of men, elderly men or younger men, they want many more prisoners to be released, and he wants terrorists to be released, terrorists who murdered Israelis. The government of Israel cannot agree to that, of course, at this point. So the fighting resumes.",

We have been under this -- evidently under this assumption for years and years before that. It is true that, during that time, the assumption was by the IDF that the Hamas was not capable of doing so. But, also, we were in the process of negotiating a deal to release the four hostages from 2014, Hadar Goldin, Oron Shaul, Avera Mengistu, Hisham al-Sayed. And during that time of negotiations, I think the situation was a bit different at the time. I'm sure that Hamas continued the preparations. It is indeed a disastrous failure of all of our establishment to pick those signals in time and to present them in a way that the government could make the decisions. It is also a failure of the government that did not follow up on these issues and make sure that there was readiness throughout this time, the way that a government should do, the way that myself, as national security adviser, has done on other issues during this time.

I have no doubt in my mind that the heads of the security establishment that have already said that they feel complete responsibility will be accountable for that.

We're looking at Rafah, of course, in this and also Khan Yunis. Both are in Southern Gaza, which is where Israel had told Palestinians to evacuate down from the north to when the conflict began. You had the Israeli military dropping these leaflets. Here's one from Khan Yunis designating it a fighting zone now, warning people to evacuate further south to the Rafah area. What does Israel's focus here on Southern Gaza signal to you, and what are the complications that this brings about? BRIG. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, it's certainly an expansion of the fight. The pause is the result of the hostage release. We totally understand that. I think we should all expect that there will be, on the part of Hamas, a desire to have some additional pauses. This is an opportunity for them to resupply, refit, improve their positions. What this means is that the fighting is going to continue. Gaza City now is a location where the IDF has established a footprint, is doing some now in-depth, I would say, pursuits of leadership, both military and political leadership of Hamas in the Gaza City area, and they will expand their operations further south. Operations on the ground will usually -- and we're seeing it play out today -- will be preceded by an effort from the air to strike command- and-control activities. And then the notion of precision strikes comes into effect, not only from the air, but also on the ground. As they go after individual leadership, that becomes rather surgical in nature. But you have got to set the conditions for that. And that's what Israel's doing right now with these airstrikes.",

And he called Israel's military -- quote -- \"one of the most sophisticated militaries in the world,\" point being that they need to be doing better, is what he was getting at there. The U.S. has been urging Israel to be more precise in its targeting, as you were mentioning. You can see here in this drone video that we're looking at, this is from Khan Yunis this week, just blocks and blocks of buildings that have been turned into rubble. Obviously, a lot of this is residential buildings, people in these buildings. What would more precise targeting look like? What would that require?",

I mean, that's the level of precision. Once it gets inside, it starts to explode, and you see the kind of damage that you're seeing right there.I mean, barrage bombing would have zero infrastructure at all. So this is a distinction with a difference. And what the Israelis obviously are trying to do is to presage these attacks with notices, as you have described, Brianna, which is, get out of town, move to these locations. We are going to telegraph, we're going to broadcast what we're trying to achieve, and then we're going to go after these targets. Increased precision really gets to the notion of collateral damage minimization. You want to try to eliminate, as best you can, civilians that are caught in the middle of this, that innocents will, in fact, die. Innocents are not being targeted, but that's a result of strikes where the Hamas wrap themselves in Palestinians. So you're going to end up with stuff like this. So precision is a matter of degree. Some places, it looks very, very surgical, and other places, the images that you're portraying right now demonstrate what someone could say is precise targeting, it's not as precise as somebody else's definition.",

He was the top fake elector in Georgia, and he's accused of organizing, essentially, all these fake electors to sign those certificates and sending them to Congress. And Shafer's attorney is essentially arguing that there were no fake electors, because they weren't fake. They were contingent electors, and that really they were just on standby, because Donald Trump was still trying to fight this out in court. Now, if that sounds familiar, it's because it is. We have heard this before from the same attorney, who argued this same point in federal appeals court when she was trying to get Shafer's case moved to federal court unsuccessfully. Now, the judge, the federal judge, was not having this argument, and it will be interesting to see if the Georgia judge maybe is a little bit more receptive to it.

Now, they're not saying that he's liable. What this means is that Capitol Hill police officers, lawmakers, others who have sued Trump related to January 6, they can have their day in court, because Trump and his lawyers had previously argued he couldn't even be sued, that he enjoyed immunity, protection that all federal officials enjoy when they are conducting their official duties. He argued that, look, I was president. I was acting in my official capacity, so I can't be sued. But, here, the Court of Appeals found that, no, in fact, you were at a pro-Trump rally and acting as what they described as an office-seeker, not an officeholder. So, here, they're drawing a line between your official conduct as the president or someone who is campaigning. And they said -- quote -- in the opinion -- I'm going to quote here. They said: \"When he acts in an unofficial, private capacity, he is subject to civil suits, just like any other private citizen.\" Now, Trump has reacted through his spokesman, Steven Cheung, saying -- quote -- \"The facts fully show that, on January 6, President Trump was acting on behalf of the American people carrying out his duties as president.\" Now, the big question here is, what does this mean in a criminal context? Because we know that he is likely going to try a similar argument, while this was about civil suits, in the criminal context. And he goes to trial here in Washington, D.C., in March related to election subversion and January 6. We don't really have any definitive answer on immunity in the criminal context.
