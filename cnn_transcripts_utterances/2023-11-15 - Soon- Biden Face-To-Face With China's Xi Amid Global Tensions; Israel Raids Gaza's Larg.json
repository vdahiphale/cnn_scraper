U.S. relations have been on a downward spiral amid global turbulence, with simultaneous wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.And we have CNN anchor and chief national security analyst Jim Sciutto here to explain this to us a little further. Pretty amazing that they were actually meeting at all, considering the U.S. shot down that Chinese spy balloon just ten months ago, and things haven't been going all that well.",

You have China somewhat on Russia's side in Ukraine, not quite arming then, but at least, supporting them in that war diplomatically and in terms of rhetoric, certainly on Taiwan, right? The U.S. greatly fears that China may choose to invade Taiwan. China will say Taiwan is really should be part of us.And on economic issues as well because when you look at the Biden policy, it's to deny key technology to China. The U.S. views that as dual use technology to China, it's technology necessary to build their economy -- by the way, as their economy is suffering right now. So, when you look at these issues, you have the ones like the spy balloon, there was a moment in time, in the past, China has since heartily suspended the program. But then you have other issues that are far more lasting. They're far more lasting now.",

That's a problem for me. That's something they're not going to solve today.But other ones, South China Sea, China says this is ours, the U.S. does not take a position on it, but notes there's half a dozen countries there. And to demonstrate, we fly our planes and sail ships through there, creates a lot of close encountries. Taiwan, the U.S. has made very clear, you cannot invade Taiwan. We would consider that an international incident. By the way, you have a president in office now who said more than once, if you do, the U.S. is going to come to Taiwan's defense. That would be more between the U.S. and China. That's a big deal. On Iran and Russia, China has relationships with both these countries militarily and economically. China is buying a lot of Russian oil right now, a lot of Iranian oil. Of course, from that U.S. perspective, that money is helping fuel Russia's war in Ukraine, Iran, backs Hamas, it's helping fuel the war in Israel right now. And then we have an election coming up. People remember Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. They forget that China interfered as well, they interfered again in 2020 and the U.S. does not want to blow up again and has issued a lot of warnings to that effect. To date, it's been largely misinformation and disinformation. Of course, the concern is, would any country take a step to try to change the results? Or attempt to change the results?",

Here is an opportunity to put out what they claim was the concrete the evidence that Hamas is using this as terror infrastructure. It has been one of the fundamental points that the IDF has made, that the Al Shifa Hospital has been a fundamental part of Hamas's terror infrastructure that was backed up by the U.S., saying that they also have their own independent information that Hamas -- that Al-Shifa Hospital, the largest in Gaza, has been used by Hamas.But we've had IDF spokespeople on throughout the day, and we have pressed them on what is this infrastructure, what is it that Hamas was doing, or what is the evidence you have? Here's an earlier answer from Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht, who is the chief international spokesperson. He told our colleagues: We understand that there's a substantial Hamas infrastructure in the area, in the vicinity of the hospital, potentially under the hospital, and it's something we're working on. It will take us time. Potentially is a keyword there because it has been a key claim, a key statement from the IDF that they have been under the hospital itself. In fact, the IDF put out a video several days or maybe a couple of weeks ago with a digital illustration showing tunnel shafts right below the hospital. That's what they need to substantiate here. That is what they have to show clearly and incontrovertibly in the evidence because we have seen denials and questions not only from many of the international organizations that work with the hospital, but from the hospital itself. So, the IDF has the obligation to prove that they have evidence that shows that Hamas was using the hospital and underneath the hospital itself. That's what we expect to hear in several minutes from the spokesperson.",
