He is on the patio of his Mar-a-Lago club. He went up to have dinner. And while he was eating dinner, this song that he recorded with the January 6th choir, that men who are incarcerated for their alleged actions on January 6th, he recorded the pledge of allegiance for that, came on. He stood up and as did all of the club members and listen to the entire song. Now, I am told that he is deejaying up on the patio. He is with his biggest admirers. And that's what you really take away from that video there. Every single person was standing up when he stood up. And the other takeaway there is that these are core beliefs. They're not just core beliefs of the former president but also of his base. He is playing that song that he recorded with this January 6th choir in a private setting where there are no cameras. This is not just for a show.

They were trying to get people to flip on the former president. That is something that we know that the special counsel, Jack Smith, has been putting in aggressive amount of pressure on certain witnesses. And it's clear now that the former president knows about that and that there is a level of concern there. But it was interesting to see how much more time he spent on what he called the documents hoax than on any other investigation.

You've got activity at the end where they basically take it right out of the Mueller report to show that there was a major effort to try and keep Michael Cohen in the camp and to keep tabs on him to make sure that he wouldn't cooperate.The entire case is really almost like a book end to the other two investigations, one going on in Atlanta and the other by Jack Smith with respect to the insurrection and the attempt to undermine the election. What you really have in this case is Donald Trump trying to cheat his way into the election by fraudulently failing omit from the public very important facts about his life that would bear directly on his chances for election in 2016 after the Access Hollywood tape came out, when the Republicans were actually thinking of dumping him from the ticket. And so, there you have him paying off individual who is a doorman at a building, who presumably had information about some child he had out of wedlock. You have another instance with a woman who is a playboy playmate, Karen McDougal, that he -- they were paying $150,000, too. And then of course, there was Stormy Daniels who they paid at 132.

Number one, let's think about this, hush money is used so that people in power can continue to abuse their power. We have many instances of that.But secondly, this was about, as you said, subverting democracy. The American people had a right to know the details, make their own decision, and he decided that we didn't need -- the voters didn't need to know that. And so, you know, weak or strong case, I think it's -- we're going to have to continue to (INAUDIBLE) between the political -- political story versus the legal.

They knew he was the kind of guy that would have an affair, frankly. And we've seen other politicians do this, too.And so, for me, it seems this legal case faces two uphill battles. One is that it's not clear whether the payout was a federal crime and that's -- we see this equivocation from the Biden's Justice Department. And then there's this second hurdle of, can you actually use a federal crime to upgrade that state misdemeanor to a felony? And that has never been done before. Right? And so, right now, it seems that odds are against Alvin Bragg. He has a lot to prove. He has everything to prove right here. And Trump's legal team is probably feeling somewhat confident. CAMEROTA:  Mosheh, here is what the statement of facts, why Alvin Bragg was able to connect it at least in his argument to the campaign finance laws. And he says, the defendant directed lawyer A, Michael Cohen, to delay making a payment to woman 2, Stormy Daniels, as long as possible. He instructed, basically Michael Cohen, that if they could delay the payment until after the election, they could avoid paying altogether, because at that point, it would not matter if the story became public.",

Number two, the Federal Election Commission didn't pursue this.Incidentally, there was one fine paid related to, uh, misallocation or are not correctly allocating your expenses in 2016. Hillary Clinton paid a fine to the FEC in 2016 for what they paid to Steele -- for the Steele dossier, right? The opposition research against Trump. What did they file that in as the Clinton campaign? As legal expense. They paid a fine for that. So, I think there are ways to look at the data. I mean, I've been talking to voters today, Democrats, independents and Republicans, people who have voted for Trump, people who never voted for Trump, and a lot of people are asking, like, uh, this feels like a stretch. I don't know that this changes my opinion on him and, um, and they're just generally confused.

You're going to get some boring accountant up on the witness stand who is going to take the jury right from the false documents, right straight through the tax returns, false returns that were filed in New York State. That's a felony. That's simple. There's nothing strange or novel about that at all. There are also New York State election law violations that they're going to be able to tie it to.

Okay, so here's what the judge said in the courtroom today. Let me read it to everybody. He said, please refrain from making comments or engaging in conduct that has the potential to incite violence, create civil unrest or jeopardize the safety or well- being of any individuals. Please do not engage in words or conduct which jeopardizes the rule of law, particularly as it applies to these proceedings in this court. Four hours later, Nick, Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago went after -- insulted the judge, called him names, went after his wife and his daughter, talked about where his daughter has worked.

He looked -- it looked as if he had finally understood the nature of what he was facing.And then in the evening, the show, where President Trump spoke as if this is one long narrative of victimhood. He went back to 2016. He took us through every -- every station of the cross until now. And he spoke with venom about those moments that we as a nation are still coming to grips with. I mean, he talked about having been stolen, having the election stolen from him. It's like January 6th never happened. We were trying to process to this day. The violence that occurred on Capitol Hill and the speech tonight, it was magical thinking it never happened. So, the two indictments, to a certain degree, both Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon showed some contrition. To some degree, both Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon understood the pain that they had taken this country through. And to some extent, both the independent counsel and the special prosecutor of the day, the name changed. Ah, reflected on that, and it shaped their decision about whether to indict or not. In the case of the special prosecutor, the pardon came first. But I think the evidence is reasonably clear. Nick may have some other thoughts on this, too, that Leon Jaworski, who was the special prosecutor in the Nixon case, actually didn't want to indict Nixon because he didn't think Nixon would get a fair trial. So, think about the contrition and to some extent the willingness to admit error of Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon and contrast it with tonight. One of the things that we are facing today isn't on chasing demagogue. And our country is not good at dealing with demagogues. There wasn't a lot of courage shown in the McCarthy period. There wasn't a lot of courage shown in the George Wallace period. We are not good at processing demagogues. Now, smarter people than me will tell you why. I don't know why, but we're bad at it. And tonight, we heard a demagogue who was pretending that he had committed no errors. And at the very least, say what you will about what happened today in New York, but a group of grand jurors felt strong enough to say that the former commander-in-chief should at least go to trial on the basis of alleged crimes. That commander-in-chief showed no contrition, no respect for the institutions of the criminal law, and once again, I think -- I think dared us all.
