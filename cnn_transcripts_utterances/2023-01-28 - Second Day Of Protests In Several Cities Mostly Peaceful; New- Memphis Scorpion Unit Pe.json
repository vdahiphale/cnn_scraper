And had it not been for the doctor calling RowVaughn Wells, his mother at four o'clock in the morning, they never would have knew that he was in respiratory distress and that his lungs were collapsing. And I mean, there needs to be accountability from top to bottom and we have to hold them accountable because that's the only way we can honor the legacy of Tyre Nichols, and like we tell President Biden, we need to marshal the United States Senate and have them have hearings to try to get the George Floyd Justice for Policing Act passed and then work on the House, because if not, if we don't have Federal law, Pamela, we're going to be talking about this over and over again, because it was the culture that was just as guilty for killing Tyre Nichols as those officers.",

The best example I can think of is the Baltimore Gun Crimes Task Force, another unit that had kind of really legendary leadership and kind of toxic culture issue.

Ron DeSantis, coming in well-ahead of Trump among Republicans in New Hampshire, leading the former president by a full 12 points. There are similar numbers there in South Carolinas. I mean, with numbers like that, Scott, is Trump losing his title as the party's 2024 front runner?",

Money, organization, a cadre of people who are fully dependent upon him for their livelihoods, I mean, he still is a quite a formidable candidate, so I guess, nominally, he's the front runner.And plus, there are no other candidates, technically, at the moment. But you can't look at this polling, if you're Ron DeSantis and not be fully intrigued by where you stand. You've done nothing, you've not filed a committee, all you've done is run for election and trumps your Democratic opponent. And yet you are right here in the driver's seat of the candidates who want to take on and maybe take out Donald Trump. So I expect him to run and I think he's going to be quite popular. I've seen a lot of polling, Pamela, from around the country in different states, private polling, I got to tell you, Trump's still popular, DeSantis is just as popular, but he doesn't have nearly the amount of detractors inside the party that Trump does.",

I mean, even just anecdotally, in our home state of Kentucky when I was talking to folks there recently, there was a theme of folks who used to support Trump saying, I'd like to see Ron DeSantis get in this race. I'd like to see him run. But at the same time, you've got to look at the reality here, right, and what Trump did the last time and what he is capable of doing again.Matthew Continetti has an interesting piece in the Free Beacon where he warns that the U.S. political class is behaving alarmingly similar to how they did in the run up to 2016, writing: \"Once again, Trump's opponents think he will just disappear. No Republican wants to attack him directly. But the only way to thwart him, Trump, is to make voters choose someone else.\" I mean, at what point do these challengers start challenging him? Even Ron DeSantis has been - hasn't really been doing that - doing the kind of direct engagement you might expect?",

Everybody else is in the low single digits, even former Vice President Pence, who's well known is a single digit candidate right now.So I'm not sure it's as much Trump keeping them out as it is DeSantis, because of how popular (inaudible) nationally with Republicans. But I agree with Matthew, at some point somebody is going to have to take him on and somebody's going to have to make Republicans choose. And I will say I think broadly across the American electorate in both parties, there is a demand for new candidates, new blood new generation of leadership, and the party that chooses new is going to have a huge advantage if the other party chooses, oh, and if I were Ron DeSantis, that's something I'd be making the case for. Democrats are going Biden, let's pick somebody new and ride this thing and win it and put together a coalition that can carry the national popular vote.",

Saturday morning, police say a 13-year-old Palestinian boy shot and injured two men just outside the Old City before being shot and injured himself. And then the previous evening at a synagogue in northeast Jerusalem after Shabbat services, authorities say a 21-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem began shooting worshippers as they left killing seven, including 14-year-old Asher Natan and injuring three more before fleeing by car. Minutes later, he was shot and killed by police. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

An unusual daylight raid by the Israeli military on Thursday in the occupied West Bank, targeting members of the Islamic Jihad the Israeli military said who are planning they say an imminent attack.

In the past few days, a major test for the recently installed government under Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu under pressure from his right wing cabinet to respond with force.

(END VIDEOTAPE) GOLD (on camera): One of the major issues that Secretary of State Antony Blinken will likely be talking about with his Israeli Palestinian counterparts will be that security coordination that the Palestinian Authority announced they were severing on Thursday with the Israelis after that Israeli military raid in Jenin. This security coordination does govern some civilian matters like permits, but also really importantly, it involves intelligence sharing, sensibly to help both sides fight terrorism and violence. Now, it's not the first time the Palestinian Authority has cut off the security coordination, they did so in 2020 for about six months. But experts do really believe that the security coordination is really vital for this region, and that they fear what could happen if it's not restored soon, Pam.",
