Meanwhile, the spin cycle is going on. Here's how New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, one of Haley's biggest supporters, tried to play -- tried to downplay Trump's big win in Iowa last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU, (R) NEW HAMPSHIRE): He's effectively the incumbent, if you think of it that way. So the incumbent president barely could get 50 percent of his own base voters? I don't know. I don't think that's -- I think that's a huge opportunity for America saying, let's move forward with something new. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now we've talked a lot about the fact that Nikki Haley keeps saying that this is a two person race despite the fact that she came in third in Iowa. But when it comes to New Hampshire, Donald Trump's team does see this as a two person race. And just to be clear, that is not the entire primary. But this state in particular, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis does not have a ground game here. But Trump's advisors have been watching closely as Nikki Haley's poll numbers have risen.This is a completely different electorate here. And they are aware of that. So expect new attacks on the former South Carolina governor and expect him to really take aim at her just like we have seen the campaign and the super PAC do. I spoke to a senior advisor today. And they're looking at this in two parts, one, securing Republican and conservative leaning independents, they are doing that by taking on Nikki Haley on immigration, which they believe is a key issue for Republicans in this state. Now, they are also hitting her on Social Security and Medicare. That is their way of taking her on with independence, moderates and even left leaning Independents. They believe this is two parts. What they know is going to happen here in New Hampshire is that some of these left leaning Independents and moderates are going to come out to vote just to vote against Donald Trump. Their goal here is to make that as small as possible and to chip away at those Independents so that there are more Republicans who support the former president coming out next Tuesday.",

From a fiscal standpoint is a much more salient issue in New Hampshire, and that's where Nikki Haley, she may not have the momentum she wanted to have to go barreling into New Hampshire, but she's still, you know, done a lot of the groundwork, got a lot of fans there, Independents as well as Republicans.
