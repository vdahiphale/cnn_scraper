CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, John. Well, with the last - your last question, first of the potential intelligence value is absolutely would be profound, though you can bet that the Russians are actively trying to go in and recover the drone, the MQ-9 and see if they can - if they do fit - see if they could reverse engineer it kind of like what we did with the balloon, the Chinese balloon. This is the kind of thing that they would want to do. So as far as the intelligence aspect of this is concerned, this was - this drone was most likely on a collection mission for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, as we call it and what its capabilities are. It's pretty significant. It's able to collect signals intelligence, if it's configured for that. It can do imagery. It can do some other intelligence collection efforts. So the loss of any one of these can really serve to make it much harder for us to pick up intelligence in areas that would otherwise be denied to us.",

I was aboard a U.S. Navy plane, reconnaissance plane just about three weeks ago in a very different theater.This is the South China Sea, but witnessed firsthand a Chinese war playing conducting an intercept of a U.S. Navy, a piloted plane that I was aboard where the Chinese jet flew along the wing of the U.S. plane, the Navy plane for about an hour. There were communications between the Chinese Air Force and the U.S. Navy plane to make sure that no accident could take place. And this is a routine thing that takes place in there in the South China Sea heavily contested waters. The Black Sea also is an area where prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there had been incidents where Russian jets had buzzed us destroyers, for example, that were conducting maneuvers in the Black Sea. But this is different, of course. The description, the accusations, the Pentagon saying that these jets were actually in physical contact with a drone, with an unmanned aerial vehicle, a very different story, a hostile act, quite frankly, which is what the U.S. has called it. There were hopes in this incredibly tense area, Bianna and John of perhaps something moving forward. The Russians had just agreed with the United Nations to continue this Black Sea initiative, allowing grain to be exported from Ukraine to international markets, despite the fact that Russian and Ukrainian troops are killing each other on frontlines about 20 - 30 miles from where I'm standing right now. But this new development is going to ratchet up tensions, certainly over the Black Sea, and in Ukraine and between Moscow and Washington.",

Our colleague, Paula Reid, just confirmed that the Justice Department is looking into potential criminal violations here and that's on top of the Wall Street Journal reporting that the SEC is looking into potential civil violations. So what are authorities looking at?Well, two things: One, the actual collapse of Silicon Valley Bank; two, stock sales that were made by Silicon Valley officers in the days before this collapse. Now, we should caution that this stage - these investigations are in preliminary stage. We don't know yet if there's going to be any sort of findings of wrongdoing, any charges here. But clearly, there is an effort across the government to try to understand how this happened. I mean, Silicon Valley Bank was not a household name just a week ago, but now it's going down in history as the second biggest bank failure ever. And a lot of people just want to understand how did this happen, including how did regulators miss what in hindsight were some pretty big red flags.

Moody's is warning that more banks are going to come under pressure, especially those that share two characteristics with Silicon Valley Bank.One, having a lot of uninsured deposits, because the last few days has reminded us how the uninsured deposits can go away when people are nervous. They're also looking at what banks are sitting on a lot of long-term treasury bonds that have gone down in value as the Federal Reserve has lifted interest rates because that is another concern here. They're also warning that they could downgrade six U.S. banks, including First Republic Bank, Western Alliance and Comerica. I think the good news here, though, is that the regional banking sector has stopped going straight down, which is what it was doing the last few days. It's actually rebounding. We've seen big share price rebounds for First Republic and other major banks. And importantly in - and you can see in the screen, most of those regional banks are still up on the day, although --",

We saw a little dip in Wall Street with respect to midsize banks, now they're recovering slowly. Their confidence level is being restored and that is the only meaningful systemic risk to our economy is that people lose confidence in our banking system. If that happens, we're in trouble.
