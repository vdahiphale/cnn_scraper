I'm not sure what then qualifies for somebody to be called bigoted, but we'll wait and see I guess on that from Vice President Mike Pence. We've got more to come on this. Plus, the white shooter who killed 10 people in a supermarket in a mostly black neighborhood in Buffalo, pleading guilty today. But the family that some of the men and women who were killed say that they think he was treated differently than say a black shooter would've been. We got a lot to talk about tonight. Joining me now is CNN political analyst, Ashley Allison, also Kevin Madden, former top aide to Mitt Romney presidential campaign, and CNN political analyst Alex Burns is here as well. Good to see you all here tonight. Look, there's been a bit of a pass that was given over the weekend. It was Thanksgiving, right? And we're not going to hear from any members of Congress. They're probably doing whatever we do when we're grateful at home and eating turkey. But now on Monday, today we are hearing things finally. We're hearing some condemnations, but I want to just sort of orient the discussion for a moment because not everyone might know who Mr. Fuentes is and what he stands for. You hear the name and wonder now, what could he possibly have said? We play for you a little bit of clips he has, a little bit of a mashup of the kind of comments that this person who now had access to a former president of the United States was saying.

That advances, this conversation further. And, you know, I don't think Pence is eager for sort of a long drawn-out fight with Donald Trump, but it does mean that, you know, it's not necessarily quite so easy to just sort of, you know, say your piece and move on and hope that the media cycle moves on, soon enough too.

But I also think what you heard was the racial implication that they felt like this was system was unjust. That they felt like if this was a black shooter, that he might not even had the chance to plead guilty because he might have been dead if they might have had more transparency. It sounds like they're just learning things today and they need that transparency for closure. To Norm's point, I do think that there are some measures we can take around assault weapons, but there also are some things on monitoring without invading privacy about chat rooms that people were in on social media platforms where he was clearly espousing some of this hate and his intent, and that should be addressed as well.",

Actually, attorney General Merrick Garland talked about not being a supportive death penalty in spite of his Oklahoma City bombing passed as well and prosecuting that case.

So, very motivated voters here. That's according to Georgia election official Gabe Sterling.Back with me now, Ashley Allison, Kevin Madden, Alex Burns returns as well.

We did some research on that, and people are about twice as likely to have asthma exacerbations or a problem with their COPD when the volcanoes go off.Also, there's a thing called pele's glass or pele's hair, which is shards of volcanic ash and the carbon forms into like a glass like fiber, and people can breathe that in.
