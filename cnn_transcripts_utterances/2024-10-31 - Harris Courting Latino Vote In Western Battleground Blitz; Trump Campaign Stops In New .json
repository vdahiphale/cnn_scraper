Kamala Harris is closing out her campaign with stops in every swing state, as the clock ticks down to Tuesday's Election Day. Today, she's out west, courting the crucial Latino vote, Harris expected to land in Phoenix, Arizona, anytime now, after a rally there, she's going to head over to Nevada, ending the day in Las Vegas alongside, well, Jennifer Lopez. Harris has been picking up support from Latin superstars. This after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York called Puerto Rico, quote, a floating island of garbage. Harris has also seizing on comments made by Trump himself that he would protect women, whether they, quote, like it or not. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It actually is I think very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their right, and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies. And this is just the latest on a series of reveals by the former president of how he thinks about women. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Right now, though, it seems with these two latest chip trips, given there's no clear leader in either Arizona and Nevada, that the focus is on Latino voters. And while she has a clear advantage among them in Arizona and Nevada, she and Trump had running tied. They're very unusual for a Republican to be tied to the Democrat among Latinos. So how specifically is she trying to appeal to those voters today?",

Yes, she's in support of border enforcement, but she also views this issue through a compassionate lens, being the daughter of an immigrant parents, so that, no doubt, is going to be part of the message here today in Phoenix, but she's also making the case to Latino voters talking about reproductive rights, talking about what he storing what was lost. And then also she talks about the opportunity economy, doing all that she can to bring down the cost of living. She's even doing that adds to targeting Latinos, featuring Latino families around the kitchen table. And so, that really is a nod to the culture here that is so grounded and really rooted in the family. And, of course, she's trying to have a little fun as well. A popular Mexican ban will perform at this rally later on in Vegas. The vice president will be joined by Jennifer Lopez and that really leaning on celebrity is aimed to drive turnout people excited about the election, and to get to the polls -- Jim.",

When asked why specifically Grand Rapids, a senior adviser said superstition. On Election Day, he is planning to vote in Florida and host tele-rallies from his Mar-a-Lago home.

This is a state that he lost by 100,000 votes four years ago. He has only been here twice before in 2019 and 2016, both of those events were actually marked by violence and he still actually owes the city of Albuquerque $200,000 for the security measures in 2019.But there are two very good reasons for Trump to stop here. The main one right now is trying to undo some of that fallout in the damage from that controversial -- the controversial remarks made in the Madison Square Garden rally, where could media he and referred to Puerto Ricans, the island of Puerto Rico as a floating island of garbage.

A judge yesterday ordered him to show up, which is kind of remarkable move considering he is the richest man in the world. But in order to get out of that late last night, Jim, Elon Musk's lawyers filed a motion moving it into federal court, which basically put today's hearing on ice.

For their part, Musk's team said that this whole lawsuit was a big publicity stunt, conjured up by the district attorney here in Philly, who is a progressive Democrat, Larry Krasner. So, no decisions today on whether or not this is legal, this entire battle will move on to federal court. Now, we're all waiting to see what a federal judge is going to do. This judge has not said anything yet in terms of the schedule, whether he's going to take this up tomorrow or Monday, but as you mentioned, every day matters, election day is Tuesday and without a court order to shut this thing down, Elon Musk's giveaway is continuing every day as he tries to get Donald Trump back in the White House, Jim.",

That is North Korean troops on the ground fighting on behalf of Russia and the U.S. has made clear for several days, if not weeks. Now, what that means is that North Korean troops may be the target of Ukrainian strikes, including with U.S. weaponry. That's just a fact of the war they are entering here. And then, of course, you're right to point out, Jim, that there is this ballistic missile launch. It flew for nearly 90 minutes it is the longest North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile flight. Frankly, they shot it up, so it goes very high instead of out where it would cover great distances, including the distances necessary to reach the U.S. or other countries. But the U.S. is clearly watching this very closely. And we have a better clarity on what it means. First, according to South Korea, may be a new type of missile they're testing one, they tested or at least experimented with about a year ago, the last time we saw a North Korean ICBM launch. And where's that help coming from? Well, South Korea says it is very likely now to come from Russia as the sort of quid pro quo that Russia gives back to Ukraine for the help of thousands of North Korean troops now, preparing trying to fight on their behalf. Of course, one of the other key questions here is, what is Chinas role that was a question that South Korea was asked a short time ago in a press conference. And basically according to South Korea, China is watching and waiting to see how this North Korean deployment goes for North Korea, for Russia, they're waiting on the sidelines. Of course, Jim, the U.S. and South Korea would like to see China playing a more constructive role in trying to make sure this war in Ukraine doesn't spread to suddenly involve the Far East as well.",

Because I remember working in the beginning the 1990s and through the 2000 and we've always looked at each and every launch establishing somehow that North Korea can put up a payload how far it would deliver, how it would perform. Not always certain, but they, they could hold us at risk for a number of years now.And yet is a look at this. It's another lofted trajectory, which means it hasn't fully tested all the stresses that are re-entry vehicle, for example, would go through upon re-entry? It certainly is longer than the last one that was launched. So they will claim to have made some success in bringing more of particularly North America in the range. But I think the missile analysts will need some time to think about this and see, has this now definitively proven a capability, are we arguing a moot point?",

But it certainly was taken into consideration the upcoming election and the fact that it would prove to both candidates are making progress is mirth.

We've also got the impact of Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton that impacted North Carolina and Florida during the reference period. So the experts tension from average economist is that we lose around 100,000 jobs net, which could put us in the range of around 120,000 jobs added next, in the past month, Jim. The danger that we're five days out from a presidential election these numbers are leapt on particularly by the Trump campaign to suggest one if they're week that actually this is a dramatic deterioration. The jobs market, it's not true. And the other thing of course is if its stronger than expected, that the data is fixed, that's not true either. So we're going to have to watch this data very closely.
