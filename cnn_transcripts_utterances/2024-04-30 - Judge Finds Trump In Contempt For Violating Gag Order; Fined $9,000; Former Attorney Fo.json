Thanks for joining our special primetime coverage of the Trump hush money criminal trial.Day nine saw something remarkable: A former president held in contempt of court and threatened with jail time. And the lawyer who represented two of the women who alleged affairs with Trump testifying about the deals he made to buy their silence. The contempt ruling made history and made the man you see there a convicted criminal. Judge Juan Merchan finding he violated the gag order he's under nine times. Quoting from his ruling, \"This Court rejects Defendant's arguments and finds that the People have established the elements of criminal contempt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Criminal contempt, no sitting or former president has ever been found guilty of any crime before big or small until today. THE SOURCE's Kaitlan Collins was in the courtroom. In a moment, we'll talk with her about what she saw.

Some of his political advisors and other attorneys had been in there, but you hadn't seen that level of support. And clearly he was trying to change that kind of narrative that had emerged last week, that he was largely alone in the room. And Eric Trump was seated next to Susie Wiles.

Now, if it's a really dangerous, scary, violent guy, then I don't want him looking in the jury box if he's my cooperating witness, because you don't want them freaked out.

I was transferred to Michael Cohen. I introduced myself. And before I could barely get my name out, I was just met with like a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\" Steinglass, the prosecutor asks, \"What was the gist of what he was accusing you of?\" Davidson says, \"I don't think he was accusing us of anything. He was just screaming.\" And Jeffrey, I know you've reported on Kaitlan, I know you probably had a relation with Michael Cohen way back when.

The first criminally charged U.S. president, now, also the first to be held in criminal contempt for multiple violations of the gag order. Nine to be exact out of 10 online posts in question.Judge Juan Merchan making that ruling this morning after taking a week to mull it over. Trump's punishment for attacking expected trial witnesses and others. 1,000 for each violation, the maximum, that's $9,000 in total. For now, there's another hearing scheduled Thursday for four more additional alleged violations. Meantime, the former president has responded online posting, \"This judge has taken away my constitutional right to free speech. I'm the only presidential candidate in history to be gagged.\" He's only right on the ladder, but that's a result of his own actions. And if he keeps breaking the judge's rules, it could get worse. Quoting the judge now, \"Defendant is hereby warned that the court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders and that if necessary, it will impose their incarceratory punishment.\" I want to go to Miguel Marquez. It looks like the police may be moving in at Columbia. Let's go back. Miguel, what are you seeing? (OFF-MIC)",

Police have been making several announcements for them to disperse, to leave, and so far they have not moved in to make any arrests. What's significant here, Anderson, is if you look at the shot that we have up here now, those are the search teams. They were some of the first officers to respond here. I would expect them to be some of the first officers inside the encampment. They are lining up. They were here earlier lining up. They left to go deal with something else and they have since come back. They have been discussing the strategy, the planning here.
