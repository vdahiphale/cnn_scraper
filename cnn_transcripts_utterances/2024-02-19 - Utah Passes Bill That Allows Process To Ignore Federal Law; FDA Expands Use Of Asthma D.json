      "sentences": "Utah Governor Spencer Cox just signed into law a bill making it legal for the state to potentially sidestep federal law.It's called the Utah Constitutional Sovereignty Act. It creates a process where state lawmakers can overrule or otherwise ignore federal rules and decisions. And it's the latest move by some Republican-led states to stand up to what they see as federal overreach. Let's discuss with Michael Gerhardt. He's a law professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He's also the author of the recently released book, \"The Law of Presidential Impeachment.\" Michael, good afternoon and thank you for being with us. In your eyes, do you see this sovereignty act as being constitutional?",

      "sentences": "Well, you don't need a law in order for state officials to challenge a federal law in court that the state officials think is unconstitutional.So the question becomes, what difference does this state law make? It's largely, I think, performative. It's meant to sort of signal somehow, by its evening title, that the state of Utah is, it's constituted somehow sovereign. Well, it's only sovereign as long as it's consistent with the U.S. Constitution. And there's no way to get around that fact. That fact is the basis for all constitutional law.",

And the federal Constitution overrides any state law to the contrary. That's exactly what the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution says. So for example, I would presume people in Utah, the very people that put this together, care about original meaning. And original meaning of the federal Constitution is states lose when they conflict with the federal government's laws. It's just that straightforward, just that simple. Again, we fought a Civil War to settle that proposition. I think the state of Utah and others just want to refight that already lost battle.",

It could be bankruptcy law. It could be a federal regulation of interstate commerce that state officials don't like. But the fact that state officials do not like a federal law is not a basis on which they can legitimately disobey it. Again, their job is to follow the law. And that includes the U.S. Constitution.

Instead, FDA official, Dr. Kelly Stone describes it like this: Quote, \"While it will not eliminate food allergies or allow patients to consume food allergens freely, it's repeated use will help reduce the health impact if accidental exposure occurs.\" So that means, Brianna, this is really to reduce your body's risk of having a severe reaction.",

That crew was transported safely to a port that was nearby, according to a statement from U.S. Central Command. Now, according to officials that we've spoke to, this was not just a U.K.-registered ship. It was Belize flagged and Lebanese operated. So the crew of the ship was not even associated with the West, with the U.S. and with the Israelis, which is what the Houthis have been saying, is the reason for them attacking these vessels in the Red Sea. Further underscoring the U.S.'s point here. But these attacks have been extremely indiscriminate. But look, the U.S. is also hitting back at the Houthis. Just a few days ago, they launched several strikes on Houthi infrastructure, Houthi weaponry inside Yemen, saying they were preparing to launch strikes against Red Sea shipping. As well as preparing to launch a new capability, an undersea drone that U.S. officials have been particularly concerned about just because they are very easily hidden. And so the U.S. was able to take that out. But it just underscores here that the Houthis clearly have not been deterred by the many strikes that the U.S. and the U.K. have carried out on Houthi territory inside Yemen over the last several months. And we are learning, as you mentioned, that the U.S. is investigating whether or not the Houthis were able to shoot down an M.Q.-9 drone that was flying over Yemen, or if it's simply crash. That is currently under investigation. However, we should note, it would not be the first time that the Houthis have been able to successfully shoot down an American drone -- Brianna?",
