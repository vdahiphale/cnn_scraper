That means despite Republicans best efforts, they won't be able to restrict abortion access before fetal viability, which is around five to six months of pregnancy. More now on that historic abortion vote in Ohio, CNN's Kyung Lah reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Abortion rights will be enshrined in Ohio State Constitution that as a result here in Ohio. According to CNN projections, it is the first Republican state to take such a move. And this was a hard battle fought on both sides of what's known as Issue 1, the effort to enshrine those rights in the state constitution. When CNN called the results of this election projecting the results, I want you to take a listen to this room. It is a watch party of those who supported Issue 1. You can hear the cheering for yourself. Others, I actually saw a woman burst into tears. It was jubilation as those results were read. Now the supporters of Issue 1 say that they won by trying to keep this as nonpartisan an issue as possible, urging voters that this was about keeping government out of their lives. The group that was against Issue 1 said in a statement, it is heartbroken, but it will regroup and aim to 2024 in battleground States. And in regard to those battleground states, it's sending shockwaves through states like Arizona, where abortion rights advocates there are also trying to get such a measure on that 2024 ballot. A Republican from Arizona, a consultant tells me tonight that his party should be, quote, scared. Kyung Lah, CNN. Columbus, Ohio. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Biden's approval rating wasn't very high. It was pretty similar to what it is today -- as you already mentioned. It's under 40 percent.There was also pretty bad picture in terms of the way people felt about the economy. Only 19 percent of Americans today feel that the economy is moving in the right direction, that the economy is doing well, and that's pretty similar to the results in the 22 midterms as well. But in the end, Democrats performed much better than expected because of the issue of reproductive rights and how important that issue is to Democratic voters and independent voters as well, and that really brought out the democratic base. And so, as we're seeing Biden's having these horrible week in terms of polling in these swing states that he was able to win like Nevada losing to Trump in the polls by 11 points now. And he had won that state. The state of Georgia by 6 points, Michigan and Arizona, he's down by 5 points, in Pennsylvania by 4 points. These are battleground States and in the head-to-head it doesn't look good, but things could change, of course, in a year. I mean, you have to also think about what is Biden's campaign going to be about. If he's going to be able to be effective, he's going to have to focus on the issues that bring Democrats together. The Democrats really care about. And of course, as you mentioned, because he's doing so poorly amongst young voters and Latino voters, he's going to have to target the issues that they care about as well. Because for the most part, Biden has really neglected that base and we've seen him focus quite a bit more on what white older voters want and that essentially is what his base is.",
