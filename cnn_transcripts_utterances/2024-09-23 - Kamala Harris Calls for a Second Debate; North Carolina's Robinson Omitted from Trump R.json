But there does seem to be clear movement after five post-debate polls were added to the CNN average, three of them have Harris leading outside the margin of error.This shift in national polling comes as North Carolina seems to be coming more online into play as a scandal continues to surround the Republican nominee for governor, Mark Robinson. On several -- on Sunday, several of Mark Robinson's top aides, including his campaign and deputy campaign managers resigned after that bombshell CNN report exposed Robinson's history of dozens of disturbing comments, including calling himself, quote, \"a black Nazi\" on a porn site more than a decade ago. Some Harris allies believe that adding North Carolina to a column could secure -- would secure her path to victory. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA):  I'm not sure the impact that it will have at the top line, but it would be wonderful and almost ball game if Harris wins North Carolina, but she's made North Carolina competitive already. And then after Robinson now, it's -- we're in the best possible situation to win. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, it's clearly something that the Trump campaign is nervous about. You noticed on Saturday when Donald Trump was in North Carolina, he did not mention Mark Robinson.You know, this is somebody at the -- who -- he'd had on stage before, he has praised him before. He's endorsed and they've endorsed each other. So, it's a clear sign of some distancing and some concern there. You know, the Republicans are right that this is a state where they've elected Democratic governors before, but Donald Trump has won the state. It's not necessarily what we call a reverse coattails, but it could, you know, the comments that Mark Robinson has made, some notoriety out there and then offensive comments long before this latest CNN report. But they could be motivating enough that they could turn out people who might have decided to stay home, and that would be the concern. And the difference this time is that Donald Trump had been linked to this man. He'd endorsed him, but he'd also endorsed him again after a record of some of these comments that we're seeing as very offensive, some things on abortion and race even before this blockbuster report.",

That's the first time we've seen that. Previously, the attacks have been on military positions, but now clearly, they are targeting areas where there are civilians. So, we're starting to look at the potential of civilian casualties here if Israel goes ahead with these strikes and the civilians don't evacuate. So, it does take a completely different twists, this tension, this escalation between Hezbollah and Israel. So, I think it takes a very different tone.

So, Benjamin Netanyahu is talking about his determination to allow Israelis who have had to move away from northern Israel to move back into those areas.He needs to make it safe. So, that's why he's carrying out this mission against Hezbollah because as you know, ever since the war with Hamas began, there have been constant tensions across the border between Israel and Hezbollah. And he wants to end that effectively, but he feels he has the resources, but there are two separate conflicts essentially. But inextricably linked because Iran backs Hezbollah and Iran also backs Hamas.",

A judge in Kentucky who was killed in his own chambers is now being laid to rest. Over the weekend, funeral services were held for Kevin Mullins in Letcher County, Kentucky. Police say he was gunned down by the county sheriff after an argument. Sheriff Shawn Stines will be arraigned on murder charges this week. The House Speaker Mike Johnson is unveiling a short-term spending bill and hopes of avoiding a government shutdown. The plan is to fund the government until December 20th, including spending $230 million on Secret Service funding. The bill comes after Johnson failed to pass a six-month Republican plan that included targeting non-citizen voting. That was a move backed by former President Trump.

And now we've learned some new information through the course of the weekend, National Hurricane Center tagging this cluster of thunderstorms over the central and western Caribbean with an invest.Which means this is an organized area of showers and storms that they're going to be monitoring the next couple of days for the potential of development. And you could infer a lot from this particular hashed area that's got a 90 percent chance of development over the next 70 days. Look where it heads between the Yucatan Peninsula and Cuba, all the way into the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico. So, all of our computer models honing in on a potential Florida strike later this week come Thursday into Friday. So, this is the area we're monitoring now, but there has been a trend to shift that track a little further east overnight. Of course, all the details need to come together. But one thing is for sure, there's a lot of warm water ahead of the storm system, so, it is likely that it will develop into a tropical depression or a tropical storm in the coming days. Where it goes from there, still unclear, but we do anticipate at least a hurricane striking the U.S. coastline by the end of this week. Here's a look at the difference between the models, you can see the timeframe there as well, Thursday at noon --yes, the American model still a little bit stronger than the European at the moment, but often we play a little bit of catch-up once we get the information coming into the weather models. Helene is our next-named storm, and that is the storm system that we'll be monitoring for this entire week. Kasie, back to you.",
