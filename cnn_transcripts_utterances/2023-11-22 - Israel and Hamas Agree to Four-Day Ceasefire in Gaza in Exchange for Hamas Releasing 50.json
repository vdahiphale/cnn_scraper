Of course, none of this seems to be really concrete, but what we are hearing from Israeli officials is that 3And what I'm hearing from an Israeli official is there is essentially a window from 10:00 a.m. local to about 4:00 p.m. local, and that is that window of when the facilitation of the release of those hostages is expected to happen. Now, I think there are still major questions about where they are going to be coming through out of Gaza, which crossing they'll be going into to get into Israel. We do know that is where they are expected to end up. We still don't know a lot of what the logistics are going to look like here. Right now, it's about 10 hostages per day, we believe. That's over this next four to five days in the pause in fighting that is slated to happen. One thing that I have just learned is that there is essentially an option for this to go on as long as 10 days potentially, where we have heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu saying that for every additional 10 hostages that are released outside of that initial 50 that were agreed to between Israel and Hamas, that would warrant another day and a pause in fighting. There is a lot of skepticism here among the Israeli officials here and government that it could actually go on for 10 days. I think there is questions about even the condition of all the hostages that Hamas is holding. Some are being held by outside groups. And so it remains to be seen just how long this goes on. But that is an option that's on the table. And so I think really tomorrow we will get a sense of what this looks like and how these hostages are actually being facilitated as their release is happening. But it is slated to start, and of course, that is welcome news for a lot of these family members that have been on edge for several weeks now as we are now seeing what is the biggest diplomatic breakthrough since October 7th.",
