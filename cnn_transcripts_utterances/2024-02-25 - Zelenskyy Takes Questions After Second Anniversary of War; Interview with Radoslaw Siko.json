      "sentences": "Ukraine losing this war maybe you get one ever seems enough to keep you in the fight and not to win. Is it time to make a deal with Vladimir Putin? And how concerned are you about the elections in the United States in November?ZELENSKYY (through translator): Can we talk to a deaf person? Can we talk to a person who kills his opponents? Do you have translation? You don't. You're good? But I don't hear. I think you are interested in not only in the question. I always take, I will wait. OK. You have translation. Thank you so much. (Through translator): That's why the question on the deferral and diplomatic format, we'll all suggest a format on which he will agree that he lost this war and that was a mistake. A big mistake, which for him was a small mistake but for us it's a huge tragedy in the democratic world. It's a huge tragedy. That's why we should achieve justice in this question. If Ukraine will lose this war, I'm convinced no. The worst date was the 24th of February two years ago. We don't alternative not to win. We don't -- we cannot lose. What does it mean? If we lose, we're not -- we wouldn't exist. We don't accept this finale to fight for our life. If Ukraine will lose and it would be very difficult for us if there'll be a big amount of victory, depends on you, on our partners, on the Western world. If we'll be strong enough with the weapons, we won't lose this war. We will win this war. That's why all the steps backwards by Putin, they'll be happening by Putin. And obviously they will influence his society and that's when he'll be talking about his internal security. And if we look at his ate messages or Putin's messages, he's working with facts and numbers. And we're talking about plans for year 2030. That's somewhat he's going to do. He will see himself as a leader of Russia up until 2030, but we want to finish dealing with him quite earlier than that.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, important to point out, Fareed, listening to President Zelenskyy there, we've got the first initial idea or the germ seeds potentially of some sort of diplomacy potentially, or even a peace plan. Now, the details are limited at this stage, but Zelenskyy spoke of a potential summit in Switzerland in the spring and I think conceived the idea of a unilateral path towards a peaceful settlement with Russia, one I think that he seemed to outline Ukraine and their partners would propose.And then of course he said, look, it maybe that Russia entirely rejects that document. And while I think it's important to point out that Moscow and Kyiv are very far apart in terms of what they conceive their end goals in this to be. I think it's fair to say using the stage on this extraordinary platform he has on the first day of the third year of the war to propose the possibility of a diplomatic process, even if it is one that's entirely unilateral, that's essentially Ukraine saying to Moscow, this is a proposal you could take if you wanted to stop this war. I think that is a significant moment and it's one I think he's clear to point out if I heard him correctly during that speech that doesn't mean Ukraine stops the fight, doesn't mean necessarily that they're willing to accept a terminology or a formula from Russia. But we are now potentially looking at a moment where we'll see the battlefield progress not particularly great for Ukraine at the moment, multiple fronts here, multiple areas along the front where they're feeling pressure. But then possibly if this Swiss summit continues in the spring, I think listening to Zelenskyy, it was unclear if they thought Russia necessarily would be in attendance or they might be invited or that's something clearly to still be worked out. But it's interesting to hear Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been speaking for a while about a quite Maximalist position. Essentially clearing Russia out of all of Ukraine as its 91 borders stood. Now talking about the possibility of presenting a way out of this conflict. Now, early stages, lots of details to be hammered out, but that was the first question that he got and to me, I felt that was a departure from what we've heard in the past from Ukrainian officials. So interesting that he chooses this moment to put that forward and it comes, Fareed, at a time as you've just alluded to in your question, forgive me for not answering you directly, of great trouble for Ukraine on the frontlines. That $60 billion from the U.S. is utterly urgent. It's, you know, since the December holdup, we've really felt morale begin to erode a little on multiple fronts. Ukrainians don't simply have the choice to give up and stop the fight because of the goals that Russia has set of essentially what they called de-Nazifying, de-militarizing the country. That means for many Ukrainians here a life of frankly fear, if not actual potential violence towards them. And so it's a dire situation for them in terms of the aid. Before this speech, we heard multiple Ukrainian officials take the stage and outline detailed problems they were facing in terms of components getting through to Russia for their weapons, in terms of slowness of delivery. A lot moving here today, but interesting that the first real time we hear from Zelenskyy on this day, where many eyes towards him after a long succession of European and Western leaders yesterday in Kyiv, talking about the continued support for Ukraine. But the notion, the sort of glimmer here, the possibility that some sort of diplomacy might happen in the months ahead, even if it seems it's entirely natural and something that Russia can either take or leave -- Fareed.",

You know, the peace summit was already planned and Ukraine has previously made diplomatic proposals which are essentially that Russia leave all of Ukraine. Highly unlikely Russia will accept those proposals. So I think you put it exactly right. It is a glimmer. Probably no more than that.Thank you, Nick Paton Walsh.

As David to Russia's Goliath, it's stopped the invaders from taking Kyiv in the early days and has kept about 80 percent of its territory. But today, as I mentioned, the tide appears to be in Moscow's favor as its heavily armed troops make gains on the battlefield and U.S. aid for Kyiv dries up.One country that has stayed fiercely loyal to Ukraine is neighboring Poland, a country that sits on NATO's eastern flank, hard up against Russian territory.

And this is what President Biden calls the sacred pledge.And what we have said to these comments is that an alliance is not a contract with a neighborhood security company. You pay and therefore, you protect me. The Article Five of the Washington treaty, which established NATO, has only been invoked once so far, after 9/11 in defense of the United States. And after the appeal from the United States, we sent troops to Afghanistan. Poland sent a brigade to Ghazni, a tough province. Before that, we sent a brigade to Iraq where we were responsible for protecting 5 million Iraqis. When that mission was accomplished, we did not send an invoice to Washington.
