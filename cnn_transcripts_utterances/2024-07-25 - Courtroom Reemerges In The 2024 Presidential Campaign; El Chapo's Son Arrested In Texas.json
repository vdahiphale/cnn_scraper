      "sentences": "Well, the courtroom reemerges in the 2024 campaign, tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"All right, look, there is no doubt that Vice President Kamala Harris has some real momentum right now. I mean, her party, it is energized. The polls are tightening. The money, it is flowing. And President Barack Obama's endorsement is coming any day now, they say. But then comes the hard part, sustaining the momentum and not doing what Mike Tyson once said is the worst thing that you could do, peak too early. Her political haters are trying their hardest to get her to take some kind of dangling bait. They're peppering her with nicknames, and they're insulting her professional journey. They're demeaning her as a woman and a candidate. Meanwhile, Harris has shown us the last couple of days that she is refining her message to the American people and the electorate. We saw some of that in the new ad that she rolled out today with a Beyonce soundtrack, \"Fighting for Freedom,\" saving democracy, not going back. But there's one unique to her. And it really -- I mean, it's a made for Hollywood message. The prosecutor taking on a convicted felon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: As attorney general of California, I took on the big Wall Street banks and held them accountable for fraud. (APPLAUSE) Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud on 34 counts. So, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) COATES: But, you know, there's a catch here, because you might remember that her experience as a D.A., some say, cost her in the democratic primary in 2020, when critics hit her hard as being too hard on crime. Well, now Republicans want to take a page out of that very book or maybe at least try to. Tim Alberta reports that Trump allies told him, they plan to -- quote -- \"assault her left flank with accusations of Harris over-incarcerating young men of color when she was California's attorney general.\" At the same time, they want to hit her from the right as being too liberal. One example you're going to hear Republicans bring up dates back to 2004, when she was a San Francisco D.A. That year, she didn't pursue the death penalty for a suspect who was charged and later convicted of killing a cop. Now, I personally have seen this movie before. Have you not? It was called \"Bush versus Dukakis,\" and the trailer was actually a Willie Horton ad. So, the question for everyone is, which is it? Is she too soft on crime or is she too hard on crime? What is the strategy here, and what will be the winning strategy? Now, in Trump's speak, it all morphs into, well, this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The economy and being tough on crime are security, right? And if we look at the history, a lot of our women governors, they were AGs.I think actually what was going on in 2019 was something very different. I think she understood, as a Black woman, talking about being a prosecutor or the top cop was going to hit people's ears differently than it would if you're white or Black or brown. And I think she had a team around her who didn't fully understand that, who I think at times thought, oh, well, this is great. This is a great issue for her to seem like she's tough on crime and it's going to -- quote, unquote -- \"play against type.\" And I think in her gut, she knew that it was going to -- that it was going to play a little differently for different audiences.

I think there's all this talk of all this Harris momentum. Maybe there's a slight bit of momentum, but I would argue it's actually a little bit smaller than folks think.So, pre-Biden dropping out, look, Trump was up by two over Harris. We look at the polls now this week, what do we see? We see Trump is up by one over Harris. The massive change is actually the change of candidates because prior to Biden dropping out, he trailed by six points among these -- in these exact same polls that we look at here, where Harris was only trailing by two points. So, the movement is actually from Biden to Harris, not actually Harris herself necessarily moving. More than that, there's a bit of a warning side in the polling data for Democrats. All this talk of Harris coming in and the Harris momentum, perhaps ignores a little bit that Trump has a little bit of momentum of his own. So, look at this, a favorable view of Trump. These are all polls taken at the Republican National Convention. ABC News/Ipsos, 40%. That's the highest ever favorable rating Trump had in that poll. How about Quinnipiac? Forty-six percent. That's the highest for this pollster. How about the New York Times, the highest in this particular poll? So, the fact is, yes, Harris has come in perhaps with a bit of momentum, but Trump is doing polling the best he ever has in the minds of the American public, at least according to these three pollsters.",

And I think we can get a pretty good view of this by looking at how far the polls are at this point compared to the final margin. On average, since '72, they're off about six points. But they can shift even more than that.Go back to 1988. Remember, Michael Dukakis was taking on George H.W. Bush. The polls then were taken just after the Democratic National Convention. And what did we see? We saw Dukakis had a huge lead. Of course, what ended up happening was George H.W. Bush won that race relatively easily. So, the polls actually shifted 26 points from now to the final result. The fact is, with all the stuff that is going on, everything that has happened over the last month or so, I wouldn't be surprised if we get a larger shift than normal. But even if we get an average shift, six points, that could change the entire ballgame and make one candidate a winner and the other one a loser.

These are conducted immediately after the convention. The average since 2000 for a V.P. nominee is a net favorable rating, that's favorable minus unfavorable, of plus 19 points. The lowest ever going all the way back since 1980 is J.D. Vance with a minus five-point net favorability rating. Laura, he is the first V.P. nominee coming out of his party's or her party's convention to have a net negative favorability rating that is an unfavorable, bigger than their favorable rating ever. The fact is J.D. Vance at this particular point looks like a mistake for Donald Trump. We'll see if things change going down the way. But the fact is that people are voting on their V.P.'s, which they usually don't, but if they did this time around, J.D. Vance might cause Donald Trump instead to be a winner, to be a loser.",

But tonight, the Missouri Supreme Court has stepped in to keep an exonerated man in prison, just as he was about to walk free.Christopher Dunn was convicted of first-degree murder for the shooting of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers in 1990. The 1991 conviction was largely based on testimony of two boys who identified Dunn as the shooter. But in 2018, they recanted, saying their testimony had been coerced. After reviewing Dunn's case, the St. Louis Circuit attorney filed a motion earlier this year to vacate the guilty verdict. And on Monday, a judge concluded that -- quote -- \"in light of new evidence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find Dunn guilty of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.\" He overturned Dunn's conviction and ordered his immediate release. But Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is fighting that order. He issued an appeal and told the Department of Corrections to keep Dunn in jail until the appeal ends. Now, the judge has pushed back. And last night, just as the prison was processing the release paperwork for Dunn, the state Supreme Court issued a stay that put his freedom on hold. His wife, Kira Dunn, was actually on her way to pick him up when she learned that her husband would not be coming home.

It's a law that was passed in 2021. It has been used to free two other individuals since then, Kevin Strickland and Lamar Johnson. And this is now the third time that that has happened. It's the first time the attorney general has contended they have the right to appeal. The circuit court disagreed. So, what actually happened on Monday, when that order came down from the judge overturning his conviction and requesting his immediate release, that order should have been followed. But the attorney general directed the prison not to follow it. And we had emergency proceedings yesterday where that judge then said, you have to follow this order. If the warden doesn't follow this order, he will be held in contempt. And he was directed to release him by 6:00 when that special appeal was made to the Missouri Supreme Court. The Missouri Supreme Court's stay is now looking at the question of, does the attorney general actually have the right to appeal? We will have additional briefing going into tomorrow and Monday.
