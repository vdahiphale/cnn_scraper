So you have this what seems to be a persistent interest in these political locations and the presence of high -- high-profile protectees. But not one that aligns with one political ideology or the other. Which gets you away from this idea that this was an act of political influence, influence and more, one of an aspirational mass shooter.",

And that can be exhibited in different ways. And this is one of the reasons why we've told people to look out for those folks in your community who may be like exceedingly angry, major changes of mood, and engaging what they call leakage, which is like actually talking about acts of violence before you do them. So the research on depressive disorder and depressive crisis treatment could be exactly that.

So you can follow that sports analogy there to get a sense that he believes that these two sides are, indeed, very close. Now, we know that over the course of the last two weeks, Israel and Hamas basically have a framework agreement to try and build a final deal out of that framework agreement. We've seen officials shuttling between Doha, Qatar, and Cairo, Egypt, but, so far, very little indication of exactly how close these two sides are. And even with these statements by the secretary of state -- and we should note that American officials have been far more optimistic about the status of these talks than other parties that are involved. But even with this statement by the secretary of state, we don't know exactly how close they are because even he knows that -- he doesn't want to be naive about this, that those last 10 yards are often the toughest to overcome. We also know that the Israeli prime minister privately has been pulling back on some major Israeli concessions, notably of, for example, he -- he's been pulling back on the notion of a few different things in these negotiations that Israel had previously conceded. And so now the question is, is the Israeli prime minister actually committed to this deal when he is heading to Washington this weekend, will be there next week? And certainly this will be an opportunity for Secretary Blinken and President Biden to try and convince him to stick with this proposal and to try and get this ball across the goal line -- Brianna?",

And then two others we're gravely injured. When Americans say, this is -- this is not who we are as a nation, they may need to re-examine that when you look back at our history. Political assassination attempts have been part of American politics for about as long as the country has existed. Four U.S. presidents have been killed as they we're doing the job of president. And many more dealt with countless attacks. And some of them we're almost killed in assassination attempts. We took a look inward at our country and at ourselves and examined the history and motivations behind those it's political attacks. We delved into questions being asked by many Americans who have themselves experienced violence, is America a violent nation? I had heartfelt conversations with the -- John F. Kennedy's family, with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s family, with President Ronald Reagan's family. His daughter talked a lot about how she got through it, as did the Kennedys and the Kings.
