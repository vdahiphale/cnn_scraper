Look, anybody who's been an attorney or federal prosecutor has had something blow up with the defense, where you thought you had an agreement going into court, everybody was fine, you shook hands on it, and then you get in there and you sort of misunderstood each other. So that's not that alarming.Now, step back. Why do you have a special counsel in the first place? And what the law says is that, number one, when somebody has a conflict like, you know, one of the attorneys owns stock or something and the people being investigated, that's not the case here so -- or extraordinary circumstances exist. That's what the law says. And I think it was a recognition or a finding by Weiss, perhaps others, that the case was now so extraordinary on account of who the person being investigated is and some of the mishegas around it that it was wise to take out of the chain command of the Justice Department. It didn't have to happen, but it did.",

They've had years to investigate this case. And Elliot's absolutely right, things go wrong in the courtroom, it shouldn't have gone wrong in this case. I mean, the defense had an interest in keeping it a little bit ambiguous. Is anything else happening because they want their deal? Prosecution had no interest in keeping ambiguous. They should have made this very clear, at least for themselves, what the plan was.Garland again looks like he is just buffeted by political wins. He's so worried about looking political. If Weiss says now make me special counsel, he says, yes, yes, I'll do that. He should have had better control over this to begin with because when Weiss was not a special counsel, he was in a chain of command at Justice. Now he's making him a special counsel. He could have just said no. And this obviously implies, maybe doesn't mean to imply it, that the conflict that's coming up now is maybe it extends to the President because the President's son, there is no conflict. Relatives of presidents have been looked before. You don't need a special counsel or independent counsel. So again, I lay this at Garland's feet. It wasn't well managed and his reaction now makes things even worse.",

But what we have heard repeatedly from this White House when the Justice Department has taken actions, including actions involving the President's son, is that they work independently and that there is often not a notification ahead of time to the White House in terms of what they are going to do. And that is what happened today, according to a Justice Department official who told our colleagues.Now, I will also note that as these legal proceedings have played out, the White House Secretary has repeatedly said that this is a matter for Hunter Biden's attorneys, often saying that the President supports his son and loves his son, but directing all matters to them in the Justice Department. And I just want to read to you something that she said in late July as all of this with the plea deal was unfolding. Karine Jean-Pierre said at the time, quote, \"Hunter Biden is a private citizen and this was a personal matter for him. As we have said, the President, the First Lady, they love their son and they support him as he continues to rebuild his life\". And I repeat that statement to you because that is likely what we would hear from the White House as they have faced questions about Hunter Biden and these legal proceedings. Again, they were not notified ahead of time of this action by the Justice Department. We have asked them for comment. They have not replied yet. But again, this is a White House that is facing increasing pressure when it comes to the President's son, Hunter Biden. Republicans have slammed the President over all of these legal proceedings and also so much has flirted with a potential impeachment inquiry. Now, when that has come up, the White House stance has been that it is baseless that the focus should be in Congress on the American people. But all of this to say that that criticism is ramping up, this will likely fuel Republicans and what they have to say about Hunter Biden and these ongoing legal proceedings.",

Because now that you do have a special counsel, which a lot of Republicans were calling for, A and B, I can't remember if it was Paula or one of our other reporters -- maybe you guys were making this point -- that while the special counsel is doing his work, he can't -- he's unlikely to talk to Congress and it's unlikely for them to get the information that they're working. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Right. And that's what's so interesting, is that prior to this announcement, the Justice Department was saying that Weiss was prepared to testify to Congress as early as September, as soon as they came back from their August recess. That the Justice Department said that they wanted to do that specifically because of the assertions that Republican lawmakers were making about his authority to conduct his wide investigation into Hunter Biden, and that he wanted to directly address that as soon as he could, assuming that they had a deal that would have gone forward with Hunter Biden's lawyers. That fell apart, but we were still expecting him to potentially testify to Congress when they came back. Now, as you said, Dana, that's probably not going to happen for quite some time as he has these new authorities.",

Is this more of a formality? Is this just something that will enable him to write a final report and keep this away from Congress?There's some chatter, I think, on the right already about are they trying to keep this out of the, you know, the House Oversight Committee and keep this, you know, if not exactly a DOJ with an independent special counsel? Still not with House Republicans running the show here. But remains to be seen how long this goes and whether it is wrapped up in a couple of months or, you know, if this expands and metastasizes into something that we're dealing with into next year. I know the White House is not going to talk about it. They're going to continue to refer people to Hunter's attorney. They're going to refer people to the Justice Department now to the Special Counsel's office. And Joe Biden is going to continue talking about Bidenomics, right? So to the extent that this dominates coverage and that Republicans get riled up and that they want to focus on this and keep making allegations that at this point have not been substantiated with evidence, the White House, maybe it's all they can do, but they say, OK, that's fine. We're going to talk about pocketbook issues that affect real Americans and I think that's where they're going.",

      "sentences": "Well, we are still awaiting any official reaction, Dana, up here on Capitol Hill. It's recessed. Lawmakers are away from Washington right now. But one thing is clear, the timeline that Republicans have laid out over the last several months for a potential impeachment inquiry has only intensified and those calls are really likely to continue now even after this news.As your panel is pointing out, this doesn't really quell the suspicions of Republicans likely. In fact, it may just intensify some of them. There is an open question of how this affects potential testimony of David Weiss on Capitol Hill. The expectation was he could come as soon as September. They were trying to work out a potential date for him to testify. Now there's a question of if you are a special counsel, would you testify before lawmakers on Capitol Hill? The likely answer would be no. So that will only intensify Republicans who say they're trying to get answers and they aren't getting them. We should also just add some of the context of this. Back in the earlier parts of the summer, you had whistleblowers who were alleging that during an October 2022 meeting, David Weiss had told people in the room that he had tried to become a special counsel and that he was denied that distinction. Now, he later pushed back on those allegations saying they were not true, writing in a letter to Lindsey Graham back in July that he had never asked to be appointed a special counsel. But that is one of the questions that Republicans are going to have. Why is this coming now? And I just want to note that I think that's important context as we talk about how Republicans on the Hill are going to be thinking and responding to this given the fact that impeachment inquiry is really looming large right now.",

So far, the Biden White House, the President himself has leaned on the fact that his son was an addict and did some things that he shouldn't have done or didn't do things that he should have done, like pay his taxes and did some things that he shouldn't have done when it came to some of his business practices.They're very careful on that. But I presume that we are going to hear more about those alleged problems with business practices as the special counsel's report comes out. And maybe, I mean there could be a situation where they just get all the evidence they have out there and let people decide if there isn't going to be any prosecution on any of it.",

But before they can ever get to that, they really have to get over this hump, which is more like a mountain like Mount Everest now, of what are they doing with Hunter Biden's plea deal.If they gave the defense counsel a deadline to respond to it, defense counsel sounds like they are begging to go forward with the plea. And yet now Weiss has been appointed as a special counsel, which maybe signals they're expanding it, maybe he's just wanting to be able to write a report. It's a very mixed message that's being sent to Biden's attorneys as to what comes next and they have to resolve that first. They can say plea deals off the table. We're going back to the drawing board. We're still looking at things, but they have to make a decision about that.",
