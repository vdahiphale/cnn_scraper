So it's likely that we'll see maybe a trial with Donald Trump and some of those other 19 co-defendants sometime in 2024. But it won't be anytime soon. But we do know one thing that because this case won't be removed now to federal court, we'll be seeing those proceedings play out on camera. You know, there's no recording allowed in federal court. But as we've seen in state court, those proceedings will be broadcast. So we will be seeing presumably a trial of the former president on our TV screens.",

Plus, he likely would have had to testify, to even have a chance to prevail and that carries significant risks for him in terms of his -- first of all, in him not being a credible witness, but also his statements being potentially used against him in the case in Georgia if it proceeded, and also in the federal case involving January 6th.",

I do take them at their word that they liked the state judge. This is a young judge, Judge McAfee. We've seen him in action on TV cameras. He is 34 years old, but he's been very calm, in control. He's been giving rulings that I think both sides, like they laid it out a little thick with their emotion, you know, Your Honorable Court, we have full faith in you. But I do think that's one motivating factor. I think the other one is, they're in a good position tactically in Georgia, in the state court, because they're going to get to sit back and watch the Chesebro and Powell trial. And their trial is way down the line, they're going to get to see the entire DA's case laid out and that's a good position. If they move into federal court, they might compromise that, they might be forced to trial much quicker. So I understand the reasoning.",

So really, Trump is going to get quite a comprehensive preview of the case against him. And I also just want to add, he can raise the same defense that ultimately he wanted to raise in federal court of immunity under the Supremacy Clause, he can raise that in state court as well.

This ordinarily would barely merit a mention, yet it's news tonight because unlike his predecessors, General Milley's retirement will include security precautions because his former boss, the 45th president of the United States accused him of treason, and said \"In times gone by, the punishment would have been death.\" That social media message ended with a thinly veiled threat, \"To be continued.\" So to be clear, the former president is referring to a highly decorated 44-year combat veteran who now has to spend his retirement looking over his shoulder. Today in Arizona, in a speech honoring another decorated hero, the late Republican Senator John McCain, President Biden directly addressed that online threat and others like it. He made it a centerpiece of his case against the Trump wing of the Republican Party and those who are silent in the face of what he says is a larger threat to democracy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think you look at the place and the people that were there. He was there not to just -- to give a good speech about democracy, which I think it was, but he was there to open up a McCain library in honor of John McCain.Cindy McCain, his beloved wife, spoke at the opening of it. And when she did, she talked about how grateful she was for Joe Biden's friendship. She talked about how they could work together to preserve the flame of democracy. He -- President Biden acknowledged many Republicans that were there in the audience. That is what it takes to uphold democracy. Republicans have to be part of the equation. And so, I thought that was just a really beautiful moment. And we could use a lot more of that, especially in Arizona, which was such a hotbed of dangerous election conspiracies in the aftermath of the 2020 election. It blew back on a lot of election officials there, just like it did in Georgia, which, you know, Geoff Duncan can certainly speak to.

Certainly, there's an endless list of issues on the Republican side. But now you've got a Democratic president with with absolutely terrible polling numbers that probably record breaking low. You've got growing concerns around family corruption. You've got inflation that is unexplainable. You've got a southern border that he's totally given up on. And you've got an 80-year-old that just isn't aging very well, to put it mildly. And so all of that put together just feels like if America had a chance to hit the reset button, Democrats and Republicans, they would do it in a heartbeat.

We hold him accountable for the fact that he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. That was his fault. He campaigned terribly. He ran on the wrong message, and he was self centered throughout the entire time. We have to hold him accountable for all the things he didn't do right, and we've got to turn the page.

It's happening even as Mexico has pledged to help combat the recent surge with more deportations. Actions that appeared to have slowed the migrant flow at the U.S. border but not stopped it despite the danger.CNN's David Culver has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They stick together throughout. No one left behind from falls to steep climbs. (on-camera): A lot of young children, so some of them are just basically being carried up. (voice-over): To dead ends. (on-camera): They started to go the wrong way for the moment, and now they're backtracking a little bit. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Setback after setback. CULVER (on-camera): He's saying that they paid. We're promised another pickup on the other side. But it seems like that driver just took off with their money. (voice-over): This is just part of a day's journey for these migrants. A day that started not here in southern Mexico, but across the Suchiate River in Guatemala. With passports stamped, we take the official land crossing. Stepping into a vibrant Tecun Uman. In the shade of the town square, we meet two families from Venezuela, traveling as one. (on-camera): They're saying they're ready to cross. (voice-over): They welcome us to join. (Speaking Foreign Language) (on-camera): Seven years old. (voice-over): A 15-minute stroll to the river after 18 grueling days on the road. Jamila Rodriguez (ph) tells me it's been costly. (on-camera): She says, like, going through the jungle is like dealing with the mafia. She says, you have to pay in order to leave, and they had to pay 250 a person. (voice-over): As they arrive at the river, another expense, the crossing. Meanwhile, we go back to the Mexico side, using the official entry, and hop onto a raft. (on-camera): We're waiting for the two families that we met to make their way across and they're about to board a raft and meet us in the middle as they cross illegally to Mexico. (voice-over): Their raft drifts over the border and we meet again in Mexico. (on-camera): He's saying they're headed to the land of opportunity. (voice-over): Migrant children scramble to help tug them to shore. They step off into Ciudad Hidalgo, a small border town. It allows for just a moment of joy, if only for the kids. Their goal tonight, Tapachula, to get Mexican transit documents. They learn it's not as close as they'd hoped. 20 miles, normally an hour's drive. But, there's a catch.

Every crevice of the van filled. Then, they're off. On the road for only about 10 minutes, we watch as they pull over just before the first checkpoint. Everyone out. They walk the direction they think they're supposed to head. (on-camera): You can tell they're basically just trying to figure out their way as they go. They have no real guide. They were told some general instructions. And now they're just trying to figure it out. (voice-over): Weaving through brush and high grass. Up and down hills. They skirt around the first migration checkpoint. But on the other side, the same driver who they paid to wait for them has taken off. (voice-over): So they're trying to figure out if they can get another van when they keep walking. Looks like for now they're just going to keep walking. (voice-over): A few minutes pass, another van pulls up. Fifteen minutes later, another stop. Another checkpoint walk around. 30 minutes after that, yet another. This one takes them on a bridge directly over the migration checkpoint. Back on the van they go. Before sunset, they make it to Tapachula. Relieved? Sure. Also overwhelmed, thinking about the unknowns ahead. But determined to keep moving north. Smiling and waving. We'll see you later, they tell us. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
