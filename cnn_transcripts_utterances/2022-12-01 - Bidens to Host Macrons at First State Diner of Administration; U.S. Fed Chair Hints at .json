So, now the question is what will the House Ways and Means Committee do with these returns? Will the public ever get a glimpse of them? The immediate answer to that question is, really, no. The public won't get immediate access to these returns but they could potentially become public down the road.Of course, members of Congress have been fighting to get Trump's returns for years because they say they need to know if and how to reform the presidential audit program. And really, they want to use Trump as a baseline to determine what kind of financial conflicts of interest might have been in play for Trump and maybe even future presidents. On Thursday the committee's actually going to get a legal briefing about how to proceed getting access to and using Trump's tax returns. Of course, Democrats only have a few more weeks left in power before Republicans take over so they are scrambling to tie up their loose ends on their investigations including this one. If the tax returns are ultimately released to the public, that of course could impact Trump's run for president in 2024. He has repeatedly refused to release his own taxes as a candidate. But of course, a \"New York Times\" investigation back in 2020 had found that Trump paid no federal income taxes at all beginning in the year 2000 because he reported losing significantly more than he made. So, the public could potentially get more details if those tax returns now that Congress has access to it are eventually released a little bit wider. Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington.

People watching on really did feel this is quite a turnaround from this Argentina side showing some of the signs that took them through to that 36th game unbeaten run in the lead in for this tournament. Perhaps we should be talking about them as potential title winners once again. They beat Poland 2-nil. You have to feel Poland will be thinking lady luck shining down on them. And perhaps they should be sending some flowers, some thanks to Saudi Arabia. Because they also make it through despite that defeat, thanks to Saudi's late, late goal against Mexico. Which means that Poland goes through on goal difference. Saudi Arabia and their fantastic support is heading home with the Mexicans. But it condemns Mexico to an embarrassment really from a national perspective. They've become the first Mexican side to miss out on a place to end the round of 16 since 1978 and football is a brutal game. Their coach Tata Martino has already lost his job. There are, though, as you mentioned some fantastic games in prospect today. The second rank side in the world Belgium talk of unrest in the campus. They know they need to win their match against Croatia to have any chance of going through. 2010 champion Spain, they take on Germany's conquerors. Japan knowing, they just need a point to book their place into the round of 16. And what a match we have in prospect for Germany. Four-time winners on the brink of what would be another really embarrassing Greek stage exit for them. They have to beat 2014 quarterfinalist Costa Rica if they want to keep their hopes of continuing in this tournament alive. There's some fighting talk from Costa Rica and their coach Luis Fernando Suarez. He said his side relishing the prospects of upsetting the odds. But Hansi Flick, the Germany coach for his part, say his team are going to set out to kill this one off early. And that means Stephanie Frappart, the referee, will need to be on her toes. History set to be made there. She will become the first female referee to lead a match at a men's World Cup. She's used to leading the way. She was the first female referee in the league and the first female referee in the UEFA Champions League.
