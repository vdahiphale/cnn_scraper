The judge concluded that Donald Trump engaged in the January 6 insurrection and that he incited violence that day. That is a stunning finding.But Judge Sarah Wallace in Denver said that the 14th Amendment's ban on insurrectionists holding office does not apply to the presidency. The provision mentions senators, representatives and other office holders, but it doesn't say anything about the president. And based on that, which some people have called the technicality, the judge said that Trump must remain on Colorado's Republican primary ballot. That means this is another victory for Trump. He has already beaten back similar constitutional challenges in Minnesota, Michigan and New Hampshire. The liberal watchdog group that filed the lawsuit in Colorado has said that they are going to appeal the decision. Most experts believe that this will reach the Supreme Court in some fashion one way or another. But look, this 102-page ruling offered a searing condemnation of Trump's conduct after the 2020 election. The judge said that Trump, quote, actively primed the anger of his extremist supporters and that he, quote, acted with a specific intent to incite political violence and direct it at the Capitol. Now, Trump's lawyer in the case, Scott Gessler, took issue with those findings, but he did praise the ultimate decision to keep Trump on the ballot.

Now we've spoken off, or we started speaking about the actual law, this was really a bifurcated decision in the 102 pages.What do I mean by that? I mean that there were critical rulings based upon the facts. The judge concluded that there was an insurrection here. The judge credited the January 6 report suggesting and saying that this was a president who engaged in an insurrection against the United States. He didn't condemn the protesters at all and the rioters. He didn't tell him to go home. It took him 3 hours to do so. He didn't provide law enforcement reinforcements to assist in any regard. The speech that he engaged in was not protected political speech because it incited imminent lawless action. Wow. She said a lot as it relates to the facts. Pivoting, right, hammer to your core question, which is the law, should we not believe our lying eyes as it relates to the section you just put up? 14th Amendment, Section 3. Here was her issue. Her issue was that it talks about senators, it talks about Congress, it talks about electors of the president. It says any office, but it doesn't say the president. And so the judge was very constrained with respect to making that decision. And so she says, right, let's leave it up to higher courts to assess whether the legislative intent and history in making this amendment, crafting it, developing it, applies to the president. I'm not going to do so. But in every other regard, Amara, it was a sweeping and condemning indictment with respect to his conduct. She just held short of saying that section applied, let other courts do it, and that's sure to be what's going to happen.",

It is expected to reach this whole issue of the 14th Amendment is expected to reach the Supreme Court of the United States.But the fact that you have this precedent, and then you've also had judges or similar lawsuits in Minnesota and New Hampshire that were dismissed on procedural grounds. A judge in Michigan ruled that this was a political question, not one for the court to decide.

If you look at the issues, for example, in Minnesota, what the judge said is not made a ruling on the merits, as this judge really did, but said, listen, the Republican primary in Minnesota, it's an internal process. This is not the general election. It's not ripe yet for my determination, said the judge in Minnesota.Similarly, if you pivot to Michigan, what did the judge say there? No ruling on the merits. The judge at this point said, hey, we're going to pause because this is a political question. Congress decides this. I'm a judge. I shouldn't decide this. So the issues in Colorado, Amara, really was the first time a judge made a factual determination on the merits of the president's conduct, but stopped short because of what you showed at the outset of this segment. 14th Amendment, Section 3 doesn't say president. I can't decide that. Let an appellate court decide. So, yes, I mean, you can look at it as an uphill battle because it'll go through the appellate court. But no matter what we were talking about Amara this morning, whether it was the other way, the judge ruled that President Trump's off the ballot, it's going to go to the higher court anyway.

Now, past efforts to expel George Santos have failed. It is a high bar. It requires a two-thirds majority for passage. But having the weight of the House Ethics Committee and the weight of this damning report behind it is significant. And already we have seen a number of Republicans, new Republicans come out and say they will now support expulsion after previously voting against it. And meanwhile, the new speaker, Mike Johnson, is essentially giving members a green light to vote their conscience. I want to read you part of the statement that came from his spokesman, Raj Shah. He said the speaker has reviewed the report and its very troubling findings as members from both parties, members of the Ethics Committee and Representative Santos return to Congress after the Thanksgiving break, Speaker Johnson encourages all involved to consider the best interests of the institution as this matter is addressed further. So, we'll see what Santos decides to do. At this moment, he says he will not run for reelection in 2024. He is claiming that he will stick around and serve out his term as long as he is allowed. But some Republicans are at least hoping that he resigns before they have to expel him. Santos, for his part, has been defiant, says that he is innocent, deserves his day in court, and has also announced that he will hold a press conference on the Capitol steps on November 30. But we'll see if that winds up being his last press conference here on Capitol Hill. Victor and Amara. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATORknow that it's going to be any different as far as the actual outcome. There might be a few members who had said, oh, well, we need to give him due process and let's wait for the ethics committee report. Okay. Now they have the report. Now they might feel more likely to try and vote for his expulsion. But the reality is George Santos, by saying he's not going to run for reelection, pretty much took away a lot of that argument. If you just wait, he's going to go away, is what he said. The reality also is that he's facing very serious criminal charges. And if that federal prosecution goes forward and he is convicted, he may in fact, just resign. I mean, at that point, there's really not much point in hanging around.

I mean, this is core to who he is, not just because he's the commander in chief right now, but because he used to chair the Foreign Relations Committee. He's got longstanding relationships. This is what he believes. This is why he went into public service. He has a vision of the world and America's place in it. And that does not include backing away from allies like Israel. And that's just not going to change. So, you know, what you see is what you get. What you got is Joe Biden supporting Israel. What can change in the next six months, for example, is that if the IDF, if Israel get to some kind of stable place in Gaza where there's a rebuilding process, where Hamas has been destroyed, where it starts to settle down a little bit, then Biden in hindsight might be seen as having done the right and proper and wise thing.

They know that interspersed among the civilian population, even in the south, there are going to be Hamas fighters, and that is going to cause them quite a bit of difficulty just from a military operational perspective. So the Israelis have that challenge. But on the other hand, the Israelis have a duty to make sure that they minimize casualties among the civilian population, and that's something that I'm not sure that the way they're going about this will ensure that kind of safety for this -- I think safety is kind of, you know, it's been left in the rearview mirror at this point.",
