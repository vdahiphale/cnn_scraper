      "sentences": "Thanks so much, Michael. Great to see you.Good evening, everyone. I'm Alisyn Camerota. Welcome to CNN Tonight. President Biden facing two big issues tonight, the first developments in the long-running criminal investigation into his son. CNN has exclusive reporting that Hunter Biden's attorneys, who you can see here, met with Justice Department officials today. Sources say prosecutors are still weighing whether to bring several tax charges and a false statement charge related to a gun purchase against the president's son. And then there is the other big issue hovering over Joe Biden, and that's his age. He will be 86 at the end of a second term. We'll tell you what he's saying about that today that's different than what he has said before. Plus, the case about Richard Glossip on death row in Oklahoma. It continues to worry officials who believe he was wrongly convicted. This man has been given three last meals before being granted reprieves. Now, he's scheduled to be executed again. Will the Supreme Court step in? And sales of Bud Light have dropped considerably since Kid Rock and others went ballistic on the beer, literally. We'll talk about an effort to expand their customer base backfired in a big way. But we start at the White House where, tonight, they are rolling out the red carpet for a state dinner with South Korea's president. You can see Angelina Jolie arriving with her son, Maddox, here. This is a glitzy backdrop for some of the problematic issues the president is facing as he launches his re-election bid. Of course, there is the continuing investigation into his son, Hunter, and the lingering questions about the president's age. He addressed that one today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  With regard to age, I can't even say, I guess, how old I am, I can't even say the number. It doesn't register with me. But the only thing I can say is that one of the things that people are going to find out, they're going to see a race and they're going to judge whether or not I have it or don't have it.

Okay. But before we get to Joe Biden's age, since that's not going anywhere, let's start with the one that I find more intriguing, and that's this investigation, this ongoing investigation, Elie, into Hunter Biden. It's been going on five years. And can you just remind us about this because this isn't about the laptop.",
