The only thing at the moment that limits him potentially would be matters of health. But this means he prosecutes the war. He seems to have recovered any political position at home. He controls the narrative. The sanctions aren't biting. So, Vladimir Putin is probably feeling pretty good. He's got a little bit of wind at his back, even on the battlefield against Ukraine. He sees what's happening in the United States, the falling off of support. I think he's very interested in what happens here in November. The one thing, though, that I take some positive feeling from, Christiane, is what you were talking about in that story, some of the resistance. Civil society continues to live. There's a lot of courageous people who are still willing to act. What that suggests to me, it may not affect Putin. It may even influence his successor. But somewhere down the road, the idea that Russia is permanently this way, I don't think so. I think that this shows to me the potential for political evolution in Russia. And that to mean is the message to the West, is don't give up on Russia, don't think of it as permanently Putin's Russia but rather this is a long swing of the cycle. And at some point, I the chance of reintegrating Russia should not be dismissed.",

He's in power for life. And we know what's happening on the battlefield.

But I haven't given up that a possibility -- a possibility that a piece of that, a large piece that could be approved, maybe as some sort of a compromise. And that's what we have to hope for, that the United States opens up the spigot enough so Ukraine can hold its own, not recover territory, but avoid losing territory over the next six to eight months. And then, after November, we will see what the political constellation is in the U.S., in the White House, in the Senate, in the House of Representatives, and I can see outcomes that are very good for Ukraine, a Joe Biden president, a Republican Senate, a Democratic House of Representatives. And I can see outcomes that are very bad for Ukraine. So, I think we're just going to have to see what the American voters. Ironically enough, these voters are not going be voting on the basis of Ukraine, Christiane, but, however it is, they vote, whatever motivates them to vote the border or other issues, this will have enormous consequences for Ukraine, for security and stability in Europe, and potentially even global stability, because people like China, Iran, and others are going to be looking at what this says about the United States.",

And the idea that it may be resurfacing now predominantly on the right has got to be disquieting for any American friend. By definition, America's friends and allies put their eggs, whatever metaphor you want, in our security basket. And if we show that we are no longer reliable, we are no longer someone they can safely depend on, they've only got three choices. They either have to appease or assuage a powerful neighbor, they can try to become more self-reliant if they have the wherewithal and the means, or they can look for new security partners if they can find them. But none of these is a recipe for a more stable world. None of these is a recipe for a more democratic or peaceful world.

But what we're seeing is that U.S. -- America's reputation is taking a major hit because of what is going on. I also worry here domestically that Israel's policy, in many ways, is alienating a large swath of Americans, particularly younger Americans. And I worry about the long-term implications of that. But I think, right now, for the Biden administration, they have got to make some very tough decisions about whether to take the rhetorical and policy differences with Israel and whether to give them real substance, whether we begin to hold back on certain weapons or condition their availability on how they're used, whether the United States lays out a political track that the Israelis have refused to lay out, whether we take those ideas and circulate them at the U.N. Security Council and to basically produce a new resolution that would build upon Resolution 242, which came after the 1967 war, whether we maybe convene some type of a political conference like the United States did in 1991 after the Gulf War. So, I think the administration is reaching a point where the fact that it - - and Israel are not on the same page, that President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu clearly disagree, whether we leave it at that or begin to advance it.",

And it looks like Prime Minister Netanyahu is definitely doubling down. He's just not listening, it seems, to the worries of the U.S. administration. Let's just say about Rafah and not incurring into Rafah, it's not happened, but they appear to be saying that it will. Also, you know, 31,000 people plus dead, civilians and -- mostly civilians, according to the figures, starvation, as I quoted the United Nations, the brink of famine.

Here are alternative policies that I believe would be better for you and would enjoy much greater support in the United States, in the Arab world, and the world at large. And it would be in Israel's long-term interest to follow them. And we'll have your back every inch of the way if you introduce a credible political track for Palestinians, if you open up more land routes for aid and so forth.

Thumbing his nose at the law, Trump is also seeking to delay his own judicial reckoning, which now appears to be paying off. It's unclear exactly when any of the major trials against him will even start, but he is spending a huge amount of time in court amid some setbacks. His lawyers, for instance, claim that he is right now unable to raise $464 million in the civil fraud ruling against him. My next guest's new book is a guide to Trump's legal challenges.

So there, Donald Trump is doing something that is quite typical of defendants, although to be fair, it is very atypical to somebody facing this many criminal cases. I think what is surprising to me is that the final sort of check and balance in the United States, which is the judiciary, because we have three branches of government, we have Congress, we have the executive branch and we have courts, is that the courts I think heretofore have done a good job, but we're seeing the erosion of the court system under constant attack. And so, the two main federal cases, the one in Florida for the retention of classified documents and the biggest one, January 6th so-called insurrection case in Washington, in D.C., those cases are very much on hold, and that is because of the actions of either Supreme Court of United States that has stayed the D.C. case or the judge in Florida who seems to be in no hurry at all to have a case go to trial. And so, that, I think, is a real issue in terms of how the United State deals with this problem that other countries have faced, which is how do you hold political leaders and former political leaders to account when they have engaged in alleged criminal conduct?",

And I think probably the most notable for your viewers is the Appellate Court saying that Donald Trump, because he is a former president, is not entitled to extra sympathy, to extra benefits. He should be treated no better and no worse than anyone else. And the courts that reversed the Florida judge are very conservative appellate judges. And that's a good sign that -- you know, regardless of sort of who appointed them, those judges were willing to follow the law.

And by the way, the outcome could be that he is acquitted, that the government does not prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. But the outcomes could also be the facts in law are quite disadvantageous to Donald Trump in terms of his election, because it will show what he did on January 6th and leading up to January 6th. So, I think the fact that we are left without that forum, that -- which is how things are supposed to be decided when there's a dispute in this country, with all of the protections afforded to a defendant, that had -- the case has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the highest standard that we have in the law and it has to be found by a jury of 12 people unanimously is -- it's not just a shame but it means that what the electorate is left with is untested adjectives and adverbs and a sort of court of public opinion but it is not actually subject to the rules of evidence and testing that you get in a court of law.",

In other words, it really is two separate things that are going on. And you might say, you know, she should not have had a relationship and it leads to these kinds of conversations, it has nothing to do with the evidence and what happened. So, it is, to say the least, unfortunate, because the Georgia case is a state version of the Washington, D.C., federal case that we were just talking about.

Now, you have written about the idea of Trump, you know, trying to delegitimize the DOJ, using things that he said about what he might do in a second term if he got it. \"The Washington Post\" says in private, Trump has told advisers and friends in recent months that he wants the Justice Department to investigate one-time officials and allies who have become critical of his time in office.

That obviously is critical to being a nation of laws and not of men and women. It's something that, when you see it overseas and you try and figure out the difference between Russia and Ukraine, and you compare it to countries that have stood up to -- and held the rule of law, such as England or Argentina, and held people to account, that is a critical difference. So, I think that when Donald Trump says that that is what he would do, he's really talking about reinstating something that he has done. Obviously, we still have the court system. We still have a jury system. We still have, so far, we have constitutional protections so that even if a president were to go down that road, there would be additional hurdles that would not be solely within the province of the executive branch and the president of the United States.",

So, globally, you're completely right. There's an endless list of countries that have done this and brought righteous cases against political leaders. Indeed, to not do it, we argue, is a form of becoming a so-called banana republic where you become a Russia or Ukraine under President Yanukovych. And so, there is a way to do this where you uphold the rule of law. There also is a way to look at prior cases in the Department of Justice, prior federal cases, and say, you know what, other people who have been alleged to have done far less have been prosecuted so that this is not unusual. And sort of finally what I would say to people is the prosecutors here, whether federal or state, are seeking to have their day in court. That means that they are simultaneously saying that they're, of course, going to give Donald Trump his day in court. In other words, no one's trying to deny his ability to defend himself, but in a court of law. So, if you think these are trumped up charges, no pun intended, there is a forum for that to be tested. And many, many defendants go through that process. Some are acquitted, some are convicted, and that is what is being done here.

There's a person from every borough in New York City whose story I tell, and then also the story of an MTA worker and an activist who got involved in the Black Lives Matter protests. And I guess the through line is each of them felt the sense of being on their own with too many problems to solve and not enough help from the core institutions that they were looking for. And they recognized that there was some government assistance available. A lot of them used it, but they felt overwhelmed and they felt like they had to solve their own problems. And I actually think now we are still suffering from this kind of long COVID as a social disease where people feel like something's off and they're disappointed about the way in which they're being treated by the institutions that matter, whether that's the government or the private sector.",

      "sentences": "Well, for Nuala, the story was her community wasn't being taken care of. She lives in Jackson Heights, Queens, which is one of the mostdiverse neighborhoods on earth. There's something like 160 languages spoken in Jackson Heights. A lot of immigrants, crowded conditions, density. People live and work in the cash economy. And a lot of people didn't know that they were eligible for benefits or weren't eligible for state benefits. Nuala knew very early in the pandemic that people were going to be in trouble. And she put up a sign saying, you know, if you need help, call me. And she used her real phone number. Within a couple of days, hundreds of people were calling her. She was overwhelmed. So, she put up another sign that said, if you can give help, call me. And then dozens and eventually hundreds of people did. So, she set up in her basement of her personal home, what she called the COVID Care Neighborhood Network. And it's one of these amazing examples of a mutual aid network where Americans got together, our participatory association, you know, voluntaristic side is as strong as our individualistic one, and they helped each other. And they provided -- they got food donations, they got diaper donations, they got cleaning supplies. They just kind of expanded out and out until they really had this amazing operation going. And it evolved over the course of the pandemic. 34th Avenue, they turned into an open street so people could have better access to the outdoors in this crowded place. And you know, a few weeks ago I checked in with her and it turns out that same basement that was a mutual aid network in COVID is now called the Jackson Heights Immigration Center. And Nuala and the same group of people helping each other out in COVID are working to get thousands of asylum seekers better integrated into New York City, get their paperwork filed so that they can become citizens or get Social Security cards. She really built a kind of invisible civic infrastructure. And at first blush, I think Nuala feels really different from Danny Presti. They clearly acted in very different ways but both of them shared the sense that no one here is really taking care of me and my community's problems and they took things into their own hands. And one in a way of protesting and the other in a way of banding people together to help each other out.",

      "sentences": "Many viewers will remember that in 2020, there was a lot of tough times, but there are also these moments where you could see thepossibility of progress and change. Maybe we'd be better when we got through this. One example I like to give here is remember essential workers, when everything had fallen apart, when the economy was collapsing and millions of people couldn't go to work and lost their jobs, the government said, some people are so important to the economy and society that we're going to call them essential workers, right? And by the way, those were not the bankers and the lawyers, even the NBA players, right? We canceled the NBA season. They were the doctors and the nurses for sure, but also for the most part, working class people, right? Clerks, people working in meat packing industries, poultry plants, people working in infrastructure, our public transit drivers, delivery people, custodians. And in the U.S., you could imagine that calling them essential workers would mean we're honoring them. We are going to compensate them well. We are going to make sure that they have PPE like masks or, you know, we're going to make sure they have great access to the best health care. But, of course, in the U.S., what really happened is that to be called essential was to be deemed expendable. And so, all of these workers, they had far more exposure to COVID. Those who worked in crowded places then came home to crowded residential environments passed the disease on to people they lived with and loved. And so, they had much higher rates of death and disease. And these people are disproportionately black. They're disproportionately Latino. And when I say we walk to the edge of a moral precipice, it's because you could imagine that once this country said, these workers, these laborers are essential, that we would then follow up on the moral commitment that comes with that to really make sure that they are OK. And instead, we did the opposite. When things come down, we walked away and pretended like that never even happened.",

It's like we were so traumatized by what weexperienced in 2020 that we tried to kind of box it up, tuck it under the bed or throw it into the closet and act like that didn't happen. And the reality, as you say, is COVID is still out there. It's still a very dangerous condition, especially if you're older, especially if you have an underlying medical condition. And we haven't beaten it yet. But what's more -- and I think what's also important is to think about the social part of long COVID, right? The fact that what we experienced in 2020 has thrown us off. So, I'm the parent of teenagers. And, you know, truancy remains higher than it's ever been in the United States. Rates are off the charts. Kids aren't going to school. People aren't going into the offices. Downtowns are still pretty empty. We still treat each other with a level of skepticism and disdain that I think is unwarranted. You know, for me, the image that comes to mind that I write about in the book are those viral videos we saw of Americans fighting in the aisles of Walmarts and on airplanes over whether we were wearing a mask.

It shapes our sense that people we disagree with are now our enemies, not just people we have a political difference with. And I don't know how a healthy society can continue if we can't resolve those things. And so, my book is really an invitation for us to take a second look and think about the collective social experience of this important year, a year that we'll be talking about for the rest of our lives, even if it's hard to talk about now, and we're not hearing much about it in this election.",

We have a Republicanmedication that you take if you have COVID, a Democratic medication to take from COVID. We have politicized the realm of public health in a way that is clearly dangerous for all Americans. And, you know, there is a little bit of a track record on this in this country. At the end of the great influenza pandemic of 1918 to 1920, there was a rush from the U.S. to kind of forget about this experience. One of the great books of history about this time is called \"America's Forgotten Pandemic.\" Fortunately, at that time, the public health leaders of the country banded together and were able to develop better policies. And by the way, many of the countries that did the best in COVID in 2020 were countries that had learned powerful lessons from SARS in 2003. So, Australia, New Zealand, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan. The scare of SARS got them thinking about the use of masks and how to produce them, how to distribute them, the power of tracking and tracing, the importance of closing borders and having temporary shutdowns. Those are places that had so much more success managing COVID than the United States did. My concern, and I think the concern of every person who cares about public health in America, is that this ideologically driven campaign to discredit all public health at the end of COVID could make this country fair -- far worse when the next virus hits.",

And here again, we have one of those moments, a flash point where it looked for some time like the United States and other societies might really do something different on racial justice. Like there might be a reckoning about our legacy of racial inequality. And there was a lot of energy to push for that reckoning but then the backlash hit hard, right? And the same governors who were trying to make sure that their states could let it rip and they got rid of the public health mandates, they also, in many cases, started to attack, you know, DEI programs and to block the conversation about racial inequality, right? We saw in Florida, Governor DeSantis take black studies, African-American studies out of the A.P. offerings for the school system, try to take books out of the library if they dealt with racial inequality. And so, here was a moment where it looked like there was going to be a tremendous opening in advance on racial justice and the backlash had shut it down in part of the country.
