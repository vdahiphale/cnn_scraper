They say, in a contract valued at over $1 billion, we have achieved a deal of extraordinary scope that includes compensation that will protect members from the threat of A.I., and for the first time establishes a streaming participation bonus. Streaming was also a big issue as the actors went into these negotiations. And it is not just a union saying that they got some big wins. Ted Sarandos, the Netflix chief, when they presented this deal to the actors' union over the weekend, he said, we didn't just come toward you, we came all the way to you.

JAMES SPIDER MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, there is not a tactical military term of pause. You are either on the offensive or you are transitioning to the defensive. So, you transitioning between the two types of capabilities. There are other type of military operations, but there isn't a pause. And so a pause connotes that the Israeli forces now in Gaza, which are on the offensive, that are going after the Hamas strongholds, getting into the tunnels and neutralizing the tunnels, trying to find the hostages, going after Hamas leadership, what that means, they have to transition to the defensive. When you transition, you become exposed. You've got to dig in. You've got to assume defensive positions. Your fire coordination looks different. That puts your forces at risk, and the Israelis know that clearly. That's why they have stated all along a pause is not an option for them going forward. That puts them in enhanced risk and they lose the momentum that they have achieved so far.
