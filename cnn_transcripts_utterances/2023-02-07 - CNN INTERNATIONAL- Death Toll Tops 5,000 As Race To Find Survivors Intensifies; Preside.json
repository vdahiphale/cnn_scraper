Unthinkable tragedy continues to unfold across parts of Turkey and Syria after a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit both nations in the early hours of Monday morning.The death toll is steadily rising while the 5,000 people are dead. Thousands more are hurt and violent aftershocks continue to rock that region. Through freezing cold temperatures, searchers are making miraculous rescues pulling victims from beneath the rubble. Others are digging without equipment in agonizing attempts to save loved ones they can hear but can't reach. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): They are alive but nobody comes. We've heard them, they're calling out asking for help. They asked to be rescued. We cannot rescue them.

Flash nights fires reveal an unwavering operation, rescues with only their bare hands, listening for faint voices of survivors trapped under their homes. The magnitude 7.8 earthquake killed and injured thousands in Turkey and Syria and left thousands more homeless sifting through the dust for what's left of their lives. NESET GULER, KAHRAMANMARAS RESIDENT (through translation): We barely escaped from inside the house. We have four children and we left the house with them at the last moment. I guess there were several people trapped inside. It was a huge disaster. Our situation is very bad here. We are waiting without water or food. We are in a miserable state. WALSH ((voice-over): The clock is another enemy here along with the bitter cold. Aid is pouring in from all over the world. Rescue dogs to sniff for signs of life and trickling into Syria ravaged by a decade of civil war. The first rays of dawn sunlight bring warmth and reveal the true scale of a devastating earthquake.

Today, many Ukrainians believe they're fighting off another attempt, a genocide carried out by Russia. CNN's Sam Kiley met one great grandmother who has lived through it all, and is now helping her beloved country fight back. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At 102, Liubov's survival is extraordinary, not least because she's endured three famines over her century and all of them blamed on the Kremlin. LIUBOV YAROSH, HOLODOMOR SURVIVOR (through translation): We ate, Linden, Linden leaves and nettles. We used to grind these wild plants into flour, bake with it and eat it. KYLIE (voice-over): At 13, she saw her older brother and sister perish in Ukraine's worst mass starvation, the Holodomor. YAROSH (through translation): My legs were swollen. My arms were swollen. I was so sick. I thought I was going to die. KYLIE (voice-over): In the early 1930s, on Joseph Stalin's orders, Ukraine's farmers were stripped of every grain they produced to feed Moscow's industrialization. YAROSH (through translation): Tiny children were dying of hunger. They were taken to a truck, they dug a big hole and threw them all in. KYLIE (voice-over): Ukraine is now 11 months into the latest Russian invasion. Three of her grandchildren are soldiers fighting Russian troops because Russia's president doesn't believe that Ukraine exists. It should be noted that Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood, Putin claimed. Russia's assault on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, failed last year. Many Ukrainians believe they're fighting off another attempt at genocide. MYKHAILO KOSTIV, HEAD OF INFORMATION, HOLODOMOR-GENOCIDE MUSEUM (through translation): The leaders and organizers of the genocide sit in the same offices in the same place. At the center of these events is Moscow and the object of destruction is Ukraine as a nation. KYLIE (voice-over): Ukraine's government says thousands of citizens have been forced into Russian territory and 14,000 children are missing. (on-camera): How many millions of people died in the many famines brought upon by Russia in this country over the last century is a matter of debate among historians. And human rights, lawyers will debate whether or not what is happening today can be defined as a genocide. But there's no question that over the last hundred years the relationship between Moscow and Ukraine has been bleak. YAROSH (through translation): We need to exterminate them so that not a single one is left. Only then can there be any peace. KYLIE (voice-over): To help the war effort, she ties Burlap into netting to make sniper camouflage. But it may be her laughter that has kept her going so many years. Sam Kiley, CNN, Chortkiv.
