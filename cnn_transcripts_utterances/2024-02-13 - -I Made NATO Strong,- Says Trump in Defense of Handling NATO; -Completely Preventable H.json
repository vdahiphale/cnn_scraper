      "sentences": "Well, when investigators spoke with reporters yesterday, it was a -- you know, much more details were offered at exactly what the motive might have been behind of all this, but it was a complex picture.Investigators said that there is a long-documented history of mental health that the police department had documented. There was also the detail of the Palestine sticker that was on the AR-15 rifle that was used in the shooting. And there was also talk of a dispute between Genesse Moreno and her former husband's family that involved possibly Jewish family members. But as you mentioned this -- received a Facebook post from the former mother-in-law of Genesse Moreno who described this as a completely preventable horror. But in her view, she says that this has much more to do with the failure of being able -- for Genesse Moreno to be able to get help for mental health issues. In this Facebook post, John, she says that Moreno suffered from a form of schizophrenia that made her violent, that they tried multiple times to reach out to Child Protective Services to get the child removed from her and also to get mental health help for her as well, but none of those calls were answered. Child Protective Services here in Texas says that they are investigating but cannot comment because of privacy matters. But this is more of what the mother-in-law had to say who spoke with CNN affiliate KHOU last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WALLI CARRANZA, SHOOTER'S MOTHER-IN-LAW:  She threatened her husband's life. She threatened mine. She threatened to kill her own son. And we still couldn't get intervention. Asked for help from CPS or Child Protective Services, family services. We've asked for help from police and received it many times. But she was still allowed to own guns. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It is down to 3.1 percent in January, that's a six-percentage point or two- thirds decline off its peak.Now, that's occurred while labor markets have remained very tight, very strong, and that is a recipe for rising inflation adjusted paychecks. Wages are beating prices at a nice clip, 1.6 percent over the past year, that's real buying power for middle wage workers. And again, that's the combination of easing price pressures amidst a strong job market.",

I do want to talk about the good signs that we're seeing here and why it doesn't seem to be translating as much. Job market robust, you just mentioned. We saw huge job, increases. Consumers are spending again. No matter what they may think, they are spending money, that's what the numbers show, inflation is coming down.But the public is still not shifting their sentiment. They still feel like things are too high. And of course, President Biden is trying to get a bump from this. If the economy is good, he looks good. Why do you think the message has not quite trickled down to the consumer?",

In the past few months, we've seen what some of these survey takers -- not us, this is their word, have called a surge in consumer confidence. So, the University of Michigan survey, which is a survey for the whole country. They take it at the university there, is up about 30 percent in two months.And our theory of the case, Sara, has long been that if we can maintain the tight job mark, we're easing off on prices so that real that is inflation adjusted incomes can grow, increasing people's buying power while doing everything we can to actually lower the cost of food, of eggs, of milk, of airfares, of used cars, appliances. Things that, you know, really matter to everyday folks for families like the one the president grew up in, it should start showing up in consumer confidence, and in fact it has. Now, a couple of months is not a deep or long trend yet. But moving in the right direction and very much related to the gains that you and I have been discussing.",

      "sentences": "It is interesting. This shift that we might see is that the CDC this spring possibly could make the isolation recommendations, more so around your symptoms, than giving a blanket number of days in which you have to stay home.So, the current guidelines are that if you test positive for COVID-19, you should stay home for at least five days. Isolate for five days if you continue to have symptoms, you should continue to isolate. But what we're hearing is that possibly this spring, there could be new recommendations that if you test positive for COVID-19, you can stop your isolation if you no longer have a fever for at least 24 hours without medication, and if your symptoms are generally mild or they're improving. So, we could see this possible shift in guidance. It's similar to, on the state level, we've seen similar relaxation of guidelines in California and Oregon. And we do know that if you have other respiratory illnesses like flu or RSV, the recommendations are generally around if you have fever and what your symptoms are. So, as we continue to live with this virus, John, we could see a similar evolution and how we approach isolation guidelines and treatment approaches with COVID-19.",
