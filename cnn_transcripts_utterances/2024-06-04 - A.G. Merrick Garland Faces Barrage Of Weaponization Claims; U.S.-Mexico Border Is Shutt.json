Plus, a mysterious bribe in a federal fraud trial that sounds like it's straight out of Hollywood. A $120,000 in cash left at a juror's home with a message: Acquit and get even more. The story tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" It has been nearly a week now since a jury of 12 convicted Trump of 34 accounts of falsified business records. And from the looks of it, Donald Trump's so-called revenge tour, well, it's well underway. His Republican allies on the Hill are saying that they are going to stall business in the Senate, they're going to launch new investigations into the legal cases surrounding Trump, and even consider cutting funding to states like New York. Now, it's all talk for now, but the power of the purse, we all know, in Congress is very real. Today, Republicans took their anger out on this man, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, who, for several hours, probably the longest hours he has spent in a long time, refuted their claims that the DOJ is being weaponized against Trump. Their most popular conspiracy theory? Well, the baseless accusation that the DOJ sent and directed one of its top deputies, a man by the name of Matthew Colangelo, to join the Manhattan D.A.'s office in their case against Donald Trump.

You have politicians on the dais sitting there making, you know, political points of their questions, and you have the witness who's able to publicly rebut those. And I thought the attorney general did a good job by highlighting illustrative, like, points of what the DOJ is doing to try to protect the institution. We heard Attorney General Garland talk about the institution a lot today. He highlighted the prosecution, for example, of the individual who detonated a bomb outside the Alabama attorney general's office. He highlighted prosecuting people who were threatening Michigan election workers. So, he is showing that this is not political. It's about protecting democracy here. And I thought by raising those -- those clear examples of what the Department of Justice was doing to protect the institution and democracy was maybe not effective for the members themselves, but there's a bigger audience at play as we talk about the political spectacle and who you're trying to address by making these points.",

Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett of Texas is here live next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [23:16:09] COATES: Well, in a few minutes from now, sweeping new restrictions are going to take effect at the southern border. President Biden is using the same type of executive authority as former President Trump to clamp down on illegal crossings. And depending on who you ask, really, it's either too extreme, not enough, overtly political or the only thing that can be done given the circumstances. Now, here is what it does do. Requests for asylum get shut down once the average daily number of illegal border crossings hits 2,500. It's above that right now, meaning that this triggers at midnight. Now, when the average number falls below 1,500, you lift the restrictions. Now, there are exceptions, including unaccompanied minors, victims of trafficking, people in medical distress or are facing threats to their life. And there is one thing for sure. It's a pretty big shift for President Biden. Remember, part of his 2020 campaign was attacking Trump for some of the very same measures that he is now going to be employing. But the border is a very clear political flashpoint at any point, let alone a few months before the general election and in an election year. And their efforts to pass legislation to fix it, we know, have failed. Biden is laying the blame for that failure on the Republican doorstep, who they believe bowed to Trump. Now, well, Trump is claiming tonight that all of this, it's a political move. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP (voice-over): This is a public relations executive order and it's meaningless. Meaningless.

You might be surprised by your own answer.Now, a jury is set to begin deliberations on Monday in a high-profile federal fraud trial that connected to allegations of $250 million in stolen federal child nutrition program funds when a jury was dismissed and a juror was dismissed and replaced with an alternate. The question is, why? Because of a bribery attempt. Now, that juror, known as juror number 52, told the FBI that a woman rang their doorbell the night before. Juror number 52 was not home at the time, but a relative answered the door. And that's when the woman handed over a gift bag with a curly ribbon, images of flowers and butterflies, and told the relative it was a -- quote -- \"present for juror number 52.\" And that's not all. They said there'd be more if juror number 52 voted to acquit. Now, what was that present? It was $100 bills, $50 bills, and $20 bills, $120,000 total in cash. The woman knew the juror's name, obviously knew where they live, they were at the house, even though the FBI says the general public shouldn't actually have had that information. You know who did have the information? Counsel for the government, counsel for the defense, and the seven defendants who are on trial. Now, after learning of these allegations, the judge in the case ordered all seven defendants to be held without bond, and then they sequestered the remaining jurors. So, I ask you again, movie or reality? Now, if you thought reality, you would be right, because this happened to a real juror sitting on a real jury deciding a real case in Minneapolis where seven defendants are on trial connected to the nonprofit \"Feeding Our Future.\" That was allegedly used to skim that, what, quarter of a billion dollars I told you about? CNN legal commentator Tim Parlatore is back with me now. This reads like a movie for so many reasons, and they're reporting that a second juror now has been dismissed, according to CNN Affiliate Care in Minnesota, that they are learning about the bribe. So, what happens now in a case like this? If you're the prosecution, you don't want to retry this case. If you're the defense, what's your deal?",

But Judicial Watch wants to end the program, saying -- quote -- \"Remedying societal discrimination is not a compelling governmental interest.\" Basically, it's not Evanston's job to fix America's past. But communities across the country are stepping in to fulfill one of America's broken promises, compensation for centuries of unpaid labor by people against their will, of course, while under the ownership of others. And just this evening, the L.A. Daily News reported that the L.A. County voted to explore reparations efforts. Joining me now, Robin Rue Simmons, executive director of FirstRepair, a nonprofit supporting reparations policy.

We've seen reparations for other groups. And one thing that we know historically is that in 1860, Black people's physical bodies was worth $3 billion. In that time, that was more than railroads and also factories put together.When we look at Evanston, it's actually a consummate example where you have an incident. Redlining Chicago and the suburb are one of the classic examples where we see this around the country. And the targeted program is to specifically deal with housing. That is actually what we want.

He certainly was somebody who was well-known, and yet it was denied. He talked about bigotry being real even to this day. And there will be those who will say anecdotes are not proof of anything. It's difficult to prove discrimination more broadly.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. But look, the research is very, very clear, particularly in housing in the state of Maryland. I'm on a state of Maryland task force dealing with appraisals, dealing with home values. We know across the country that if you live in neighborhoods that are predominantly Black, holding all else equal, that that equals about $50,000 less per home. That is real money that actually contributes to the wealth gap between Blacks and whites, which is oftentimes 10 to 1.That also contributes to what happens in the labor market, what happens in commercial real estate. There is sociological research actually documenting what happens when people enter the labor market, when it comes to whether or not a person is graduated from an Ivy League school or not, whether or not a person has a criminal record. And here goes a key statistic for people when it comes to work and as it relates to housing and what's happening in communities. Research documents that Black people without a criminal record are less likely to get hired for a job than white people with a criminal record. That is racism. That is systemic racism. It happens in housing. When all of a sudden you put up pictures of Black people in your home, all of a sudden, you're going to get less value for your home. That's why they tell Black homeowners to remove their pictures. Everybody knows that.",

Remove black dolls, remove pictures of your family when they have the walkthroughs, any evidence that there might be a person of color living there. That's a very real thing. People probably are thinking, is that true? Yes.Let me go back to our other guest who is here as well. I want to understand in terms of, Robin, where things stand here, because this is not just reparations. Conservatives have been targeting DEI programs across the country with several states who are trying to address issues, pass legislation in a variety of ways that go to a central theme that the reparations program was looking at. When you see the attack that's happening there, do you see parallels to what's happening right now in Evanston?",

So, this is in the same vein.I also want to note that Evanston is looking to address its harm in the community. We know that we can't address the institution of slavery, but what we can do and what we're responsible to do and have made a commitment to do is address Evanston's harm. That specifically has been in the housing space, as was mentioned. And so, this does not come as a surprise, and it is an attack on the entire movement. We are looking to fight this. We will fight it. Other communities will fight it as well.",
