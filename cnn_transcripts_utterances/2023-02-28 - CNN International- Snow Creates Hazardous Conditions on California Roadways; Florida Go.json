Now, Max, we haven't seen the evidence that he has seen to lead him to write this. There's a lot of unverified social media videos that show some results trickled out, scribbled out. But, you know, INEC is not listening to theses. INEC Chairman Mahmood Yakubu is saying take your queries, take your complaints to court.
