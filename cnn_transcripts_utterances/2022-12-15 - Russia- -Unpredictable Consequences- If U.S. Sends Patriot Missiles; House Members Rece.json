      "sentences": "Jake, even before an official White House announcement about Patriot missile defense systems, the Kremlin and the Russian Embassy in D.C. very quick to respond, the embassy saying that this could lead to unpredictable consequences here Ukraine. The Kremlin saying that these would be a legitimate target for them if they could actually find them and hit them.The constant Russian bombardment on Ukraine civilian infrastructure is the latest reason for Ukrainian officials to really intensify their calls for Patriot missile defense, which would truly be a game changer, potentially could stop many of these Russian attacks, particularly from bombers that carry missiles that Ukraine currently doesn't have the capacity to shoot down. There were actually air raid sirens going off in Kyiv the other day, not because there were incoming missiles but just because Russian bombers were spotted near Ukraine that potentially carried the kind of missiles that Ukraine currently cannot defend against, the Patriot would change that. But getting there, getting to that next stage of the conflict where patriots would be deployed, which is what the Ukrainian defense minister told me he was confident would happen when I interviewed him last weekend will require months of training because these are highly complex systems that require a large number of people when you're talking about battalion of Patriot missile defense batteries, even though as few as three people can actually operate each individual truck. You know, when you see it fire, it requires a tremendous amount of work, which is why when these defense systems have been deployed for U.S. allies, often it's American personnel who are operating them. That is simply not possible here in Ukraine, the Ukrainians are going to have to learn how to use this system autonomously. There is intensified fighting on the frontlines in the east, in Donetsk with Ukrainian forces pummeling Russian held Donetsk, the worst attack the Russians claim since 2014. Although CNN can't independently verify a lot of the videos and the claims that are coming out of Donetsk, but certainly the Russians are claiming that civilian targets are being hit there. Civilian targets are certainly being hit down in southern Ukraine in Kherson where wave after wave of Russian shelling has destroyed much of an administrative building as well as killing people and causing basically that entire city to be cut off from the power grid entirely. It is just evidence that even though the winter -- the dead of winter is here, essentially even though the official start of winter is still days away, here in Ukraine, they're already dealing with really horrific conditions for soldiers on the front lines and for the millions of people around this country who are forced to live for hours or even days on end in the dark end of cold, Jake.",

That's the goal here, combined arms maneuver, and making sure more of Ukraine's military is able to carry out these larger maneuvers.The Pentagon pointed out this is the sort of work they did with the Ukrainians before the invasion ever since the 2014 invasion of Crimea.

If you remember, when the war kicked off, they wanted Stinger missiles because they were so concerned about Russian fighter jets and bombers in the skies. We got them those and they were essential in the early part of the conflict. But then they wanted advanced artillery systems to start taking territory back from the Russians. Now they need Patriot missile defense to protect against this onslaught against their energy infrastructure.But I suspect in the future, they're going to need more offensive systems. They may be requesting things like tanks and armored personnel carriers to go against the west -- the Russian defense is in the eastern part of the country. The Russians are digging in right now. And Ukraine needs to take that territory back.

That's just such a nonthreat.And I think one of the lessons that we all have to learn here is that Putin is a dangerous person, he's a dangerous, autocratic leader, but he's a lot of bluster. He's a lot of bluster, and he will back down. Remember his terrible threats if more countries joined NATO, two countries did and nothing happened. His terrible threats if America provided any support to Ukraine whatsoever. Instead, he's now losing this war. So, we've got to not be cowed by Putin. That was a clear message that I took home from the American ambassador in Ukraine who spent over a decade dealing with Putin in that part of the world. She said, let's not be afraid of this guy.

Therefore, it can't be appendicitis. That's not enough. And we know from Dr. Mahajan's research, anywhere from five to, I think, 14 or 15 percent of the time, appendicitis does not present in this standard way. So that I think Alice's main message is doctors, parents, kids know that appendicitis does not always present in a standard way. And doctors update your standard of care.

Apple and Google historically kicked them out of the app store for that. They didn't do that here. So, then I wrote a letter to DOJ, as you mentioned, because Apple and Google are facing a lot of antitrust scrutiny.
