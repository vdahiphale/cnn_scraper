And today, Trump is in Georgia, where he is set to speak on the economy. Any minute now, Harris will be heading to Arizona later this week, where a source tells us she is planning to visit the U.S.-Mexico border.

Look, I want to point out what I think is very interesting little nugget that I've seen not just in CNN's polling, but in other polling as well. You look among likely voters, again, no clear leader, Harris up by a point, but again, no clear leader. Among registered voters, it's a tie. And this is something that we've been seeing in a lot of the polling this year. That is when you sort of go down, limit yourself to those who are most likely to turn out and vote, or probabilistically, the people who are most likely to turn out and vote, or wait a little bit more. You see that Harris does a little bit better. That might forecast that maybe the Democrats might have a turnout advantage come November.That's not the only thing that sort of snuck out or struck out to me about this particular poll, stuck out. What we see here, take a look at this trend line. This is the type of trend line I think Democrats love to see, all right. This is the Trump versus the Democrat. This is among registered voters. This is the margin. You go back to June, when it was Joe Biden is the presumptive Democrat nominee. Donald Trump had a six point advantage. You go to July, when we're versus Harris, it's a three point advantage for Donald Trump. And today we stand at a tie. So the bottom line is this, yes, we have a razor tight matchup going on at this particular point, but the momentum over the last few months has certainly be heading in the Democrats direction.",

But you can see they sort of, you know, go all the way from plus six for Harris in the \"ABC News\" poll, plus five in \"NBC,\" plus four in \"CBS,\" two in \"Fox.\" We're right down here plus one, \"The New York Times\" had a tie. But the bottom line here is, Brianna, you see a lot more blue on your screen. You only see a little bit of red right here with Donald Trump in a tie.But the bottom line is, it does seem, at least when you average the national polls, it is a small advantage for Kamala Harris, something that certainly welcome given where the national polls were just a few months ago.",

But when it comes to the economy, as you noted, one probably the most important issue for voters, but also one of the key issues for the Trump campaign, they believe if he can double down on this messaging, and actually stick to the messaging talking about the economy, it could help propel him to the White House in November.Now, one of the things you can see, I'm not sure if you can see it on the sign behind me, this is 15 percent corporate taxes. One of the things Donald Trump has promised is that, if he is reelected, he would lower corporate taxes to 15 percent just for companies who produce only in the United States, very different from what we have seen on the Harris side, which says they will actually raise corporate taxes. Again, all of this is what Donald Trump is planning to say. He also is going to, or at least planning to talk about outsourcing jobs, bringing outsourced jobs back into America, bringing other companies back into America. And will we see whether or not he can focus on that. Now I do want to quickly talk about Georgia, because it's the first time he's been in this state since early August, and a lot has changed since then. One of the things you'll remember is that during a rally in Atlanta just a few weeks ago, he was bashing Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, a popular Republican in the state, much to the chagrin of not only campaign advisers, but also allies and Republicans as a whole, who believed they needed Kemp's help to win this state. Since then, Trump has really capitulated to the Georgia Governor and enlisted his help in the state. It is a critical battleground state, and one that Republicans were far more sure of when Biden was at the top of the ticket. So we'll see if any of his messaging is specifically centered around, as you said, this critical battleground state. Jim?",

He is one of the staunchest supporters of -- of the filibuster in the Senate. He -- Manchin argues that it is essential to forcing bipartisan consensus and compromise in the Senate. He's in the minority of Democrats in particular, who are pushing to gut this altogether, because it would lower the threshold for advancing legislation from 60 votes to 51 if Kamala Harris had her way. But just moments ago, Manchin told our colleague, Ted Barrett, he said -- he said, quote, shame on her, referring to Harris. He says that she knows the filibuster is the holy grail of democracy. And Manchin went on to say, it's the only thing that keeps us talking and working together. If she gets rid of that, then this would be the house on steroids. And then Ted went on to ask him whether she would consider endorsing her, and he said, quote, that ain't going to happen. So he could have given her some effort -- as the Harris is trying to move to the middle, guys, perhaps she could have touted a Manchin endorsement, which seemed to be coming to her side, but now that she has said this, he says, no way, that is not going to happen, as she tries to promise her voters she can get abortion rights passed and if she wins the presidency in November.

What is the plan if debt is an issue for Republicans to correct the other side of that equation? How -- how are you going to do both? That would seem to presume massive spending cuts.
