A key confidante of Benjamin Netanyahu is coming to the White House today for talks about the war in Gaza.But first, let's get to those new details out of Iraq where President Biden ordered air strikes on three facilities used by Kata'ib Hezbollah and affiliated groups. The strikes were in response to an attack that injured three U.S. troops in Erbil Air Base. An attack the Iranian backed militant group claimed responsibility for. U.S. Central Command says the strikes likely killed a number of militants there. Let's lead off with CNN's Natasha Bertrand, who is in Washington for us. Natasha, what are you learning about these strikes and the fall-on effect?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, this is really, you know, coming as the Iran-backed Shia militias escalate their attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. And yesterday we saw the Iran-backed group, Kata'ib Hezbollah, attack a U.S. base that resulted in three injuries to U.S. personnel, including one critical injury. Prior to this, most of the injuries that U.S. personnel had suffered had actually been fairly minor. So, this was really something that the U.S. clearly felt they needed to respond to.And President Biden was briefed on options by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin yesterday morning. And Biden decided to go with the option to strike three facilities that are used by Kata'ib Hezbollah in Iraq. And as you mentioned, Central Command has said that it is likely that several militants were actually killed in this strike by the U.S. However, it is not known at this point, or is unlikely, that there were any civilians that were injured simply because there were none in the area. Now, the White House said in a statement that, quote, \"the president places no higher priority than the protection of American personnel serving in harm's way. The United States will act as a time and in a manner of our choosing should these attacks continue.\" And I think it's just important just for context here, there have been over 100 attacks by these Iran-backed groups on U.S. and coalition bases in Iraq and Syria since October 17th. They have pretty much been relentless daily attacks. The attack that was carried out yesterday in Iraq by Kata'ib Hezbollah was carried out with a one-way attack drone, according to U.S. officials. And that is pretty much how they have been conducting these strikes, via drones and rockets over the last several months. And so the question has always been, if the U.S. responds -- this is not the first time that they have done so, conducting air strikes in Iraq and Syria, but it has not yet deterred these groups. Now, the U.S. says that they are optimistic that by degrading their infrastructure, hitting these groups. Killing some of the militants, that it will send a message of deterrence because the U.S. does not want to see this conflict escalate into a broader war. And so they say this is proportional. But the question now is, is this actually going to work to deter future attacks, Sara?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, this comes at a critical time as the White House talks to Israel about being more precise in not targeting innocent civilian casualties. Now, of course, Ron Dermer, he is a close confidante to Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. He's a member of the war cabinet. He's also previously Israel's ambassador to the United States.Now, U.S. officials have previously said that Israel has assured them that they are going to move from a high intensity war to low intensity and have more of a precise strategy in targeting Hamas leadership, again, to contain the innocent -- the deaths of innocent civilians. But also the U.S. is saying that they don't really have a timeline they can share for that. U.S. officials have previously said that that might look like localized operations by January, but they haven't said much more than that and providing additional details into what this next phase looks like and when that will happen. So, that is going to be a topic of discussion going into these meetings today is, when do we see more of that targeted, precise military strategy far from -- or move away from this high intensity warfare. But then in addition to that, the president has been warning that Israel can lose support on the international stage if it doesn't move in this direction. And we've seen the domestic pressure and the international pressure build up over the last several weeks. In fact, just yesterday, we saw protesters at the houses of National Security Adviser Jack Sullivan and at the home of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. So clearly the pressure is still there. And the White House is trying to navigate this really complicated landscape by continuing to have conversations with Israel, again, in hopes that they can start to see more of a targeted military strategy. Now, a senior Israeli official said on our air this morning that they have been, quote, \"very good\" conversations with the U.S. The question is, what does that look like today and then what is the aftermath and the outcome of those conversations?",

And one of the things, you know, the head of Hamas in Gaza, Sinwar, spoke out publicly for the first time this weekend and said that they were winning.So, we're going to see a lot more intensity here. And, you know, we had more Israeli troops killed over this weekend than we've seen at any other 24-hour period. So, you know, things are going to continue to get rough.

They were expected to discuss ongoing efforts to secure the release of hostages as well.

I'm curious, from your perspective, as to whether or not you see this blowing up into a much bigger regional war. SANNERperspective, and from the Iranian perspective, neither side sees it in their interest to have this war blow up into a full-scale regional war. But that doesn't mean that Iran is standing or sitting on their hands. Quite the opposite. There is this strike about on a ship right off the coast of India, which was struck by a drone, which the United States says was caused by Iran. We have now the death of this brigadier general, IRGC general, inside Syria. The number one most important general in the region. Kind of one of the lieutenants to Soleimani, whom we killed in January of 2020. And this attack. So, you know - and then we have Hezbollah also stepping up attacks from Lebanon onto northern Israel. So, while, you know, I think the United States is really working to keep things calm, things can get out of hand. And it does take me back to that Soleimani strike in January 2020 where, you know, it was this ratcheting up of strike and retaliation, strike and retaliation, to the point where the United States then decided to kill Soleimani. Now, in this case, we don't want to do that, but things can get out of hand.",

The same justices who ruled last week that Donald Trump is disqualified from appearing on the state's 2024 primary ballot.CNN's Katelyn Polantz has more on this. She's joining us now. Katelyn, what are you learning about these threats and now this investigation? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kate, just a week ago was that ruling out of the Colorado supreme court saying Donald Trump couldn't be on the ballot, on the primary ballot, because he had engaged in insurrection in 2020 and 2021 after the election. And so just two days after that, the Denver Police had to respond to a justice's home from the Colorado supreme court, responding to a hoax report. And then law enforcement was continuing to look into threats around these justices who took part in that decision, four of the seven voted to remove Trump from the ballot, and learned there was a rise in the online discussions, especially among extremists, about general violence toward these justices. And so then the FBI has gotten involved. We just heard yesterday from a public affairs officer at the FBI. They said, \"the FBI is aware of the situation and working with local law enforcement. We will vigorously pursue investigations of any threat or use of violence committed by someone who uses extremist views to justify their actions, regardless of motivation.\" So, law enforcement is on high alert here. And it comes in a climate where there is an unprecedented rise in threats toward public officials, particularly judges, justices, especially ones involved in highly political cases. And so law enforcement out in Colorado is definitely tracking this now. Kate.",

And there are also people who have been inside Donald Trump's circle for a long time who kind of give reminders of the ways that she stood up to him and the clashes that they had when she was part of his cabinet for about those two years that she served in the Trump administration. So, when you look at a candidate like Nikki Haley, you know, certainly she has been doing better in the primary that, as you point out, Donald Trump has continued to be far and away the frontrunner. But as she is kind of creeping forward in some places, you know, that conversation keeps happening. Her name keeps coming up. But there are also those reminders, remember, you know, when -- if he is the nominee, Donald Trump may be looking for a running mate who he's 100 percent confident is going to stand behind all the choices that he would make as president.
