      "sentences": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing that their response to this weekend's rocket attack that killed 12 kids will be severe.Netanyahu issued the warning today while visiting the site of the strike in Israeli-occupied Golan Heights near the Israel-Lebanon border. Now, Israel is blaming Hezbollah for the attack. The militant group is denying responsibility. Yet, amid fears of a wider regional conflict, the U.S. embassy in Beirut issued this warning to Americans: Get out now or prepare to shelter in place for long periods of time. Joining us now is CNN political and global affairs analyst, Barak Ravid. He's also the politics and foreign policy reporter for Axios. Barak, great to see you. What are your sources telling you about what a potential response from Israel might look like? BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Well, what I hear from Israeli officials that there's going to be a significant response. The security cabinet, last night, authorized Prime Minister Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Gallant to take the decision about the exact scope and timing of that strike. I think the Israeli military's sort of waiting for the right operational opportunity, which means that it might be today, it might take another day, it might take another two days. It's still unclear when exactly this response is going to take place.",

Last week, we heard U.S. officials, including the secretary of state, say that talks were on the 10-yard line. Where does it appear that they are now? Are we any closer to a deal?",

And no one is pushing forward to score.That's where we are right now. That's my that's my feeling from speaking to people on the Israeli side and with the mediators and with U.S. officials. It doesn't seem to me that we're getting close to a deal.",

I'm wondering how you see the response, not just from Netanyahu's orbit, but other Israeli officials, to remarks that Harris made about the war in Gaza.",

      "sentences": "Well, when you look at the remarks themselves and the substance of them, they're not different at all than things that President Biden said many times before. And to be honest, not very different from things that President Trump,former President Trump said the same day several hours before, where he also called for ending the war as soon as possible and for a return -- returning of the hostages. Obviously, there were other nuances between him and Kamala Harris that we're not the same, especially the ones that have to do with the suffering of the people in Gaza that Trump did not that mentioned at all. But I think what happened was that Netanyahu met with Harris and he did not know that right after she's going to go and hold this on- camera statement. I think it was caught off guard. I think -- and he doesn't like to be caught off guard on such a thing. And I think his reaction was a combination of an immediate jerk reaction of, why, why is she doing this statement that I didn't know of? And second is, let's push back immediately regardless of what she actually said.",

House Speaker Mike Johnson and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have announced the members of Congress who will serve on the bipartisan House task force on the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.There are seven Republicans and six Democrats on the task force. The Republican chairman is Pennsylvania Congressman Mike Kelly. He represents Pennsylvania's 16th district. He lives in Butler, of course, the site of the assassination attempt. The ranking member of this taskforce will be Colorado Democratic Congressman and former Army ranger, Jason Crow. This task force has full investigative authority, including subpoena power. We'll be speaking to a member of the taskforce next hour. CNN is also learning some exclusive new details about the Supreme Courts surprising decision to allow emergency abortions in Idaho. The June 6-3 ruling had three conservative justices siding with liberals coming to a compromise on the state's strict law, which had outright banned abortions except for if the pregnant woman's life was in jeopardy. We have CNN, chief Supreme Court analyst, Joan Biskupic, here with her exclusive reporting. The decision did not come lightly. Tell us what happened here.",

Brett Kavanaugh has, in a few rare instances.

CNN's Matt Egan has the troubling numbers for us. And, Matt, when we talk about the numbers behind the economy being sound and this being a great economy, a lot of people don't feel that way and it's because of this.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. Exactly, Boris. This American dream of homeownership, it does feel out of reach for far too many people. They want to buy. But they feel like they can't, because mortgage rates are high and home prices are even higher. And so some of them, they're throwing in the towel, they're walking away.This brand-new CNN poll shows that 86 percent of renters say they would like to buy a home, but they just can't, 86 percent. Only 13 percent say they could buy a home, but they're just choosing not to. Now if you dig in a little bit further, we can see that among the people who say they can't afford it right now, only 46 percent think that eventually they'll be able to. Most of them, 54 percent, say that that is not likely. So this really does speak to some people's pessimism on this front and really a sense of hopelessness among renters. This is a concern when you talk about the economy, because, listen, as you mentioned, homeownership, that is the ticket to building wealth in America. And so this housing affordability crisis, it's actually widening the gap between haves and have nots, right? Homeowners, their net worth is going up as home prices go higher and higher. Everyone else, though, they're on the outside looking in.",
