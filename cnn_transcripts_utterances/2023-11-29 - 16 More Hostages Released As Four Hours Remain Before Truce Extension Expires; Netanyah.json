      "sentences": "Tonight on 360, with just hours left on a truce that has been so -- seen so many hostages freed from Gaza, the latest on efforts now ramping up to extend it, but also tough talk on what might happen if it expires.Later tonight, my conversation with Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie and why he's continuing his campaign and what he makes of the big boost of his rival, Nikki Haley, just got. Plus, Gayle King and Charles Barkley here on set with me to preview their new program King Charles debuting later tonight. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. Just four hours from now, the six-day truce between Israel and Hamas is set to expire with no indication yet it will be extended, as it was two days ago. No word yet that talks now underway have yielded any progress. And just a short time ago, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ramped up the war rhetoric, saying his answer is, quote, \"unequivocal,\" unquote. Israel, he says, will fight until the end, his words, after what he called maximizing this phase of returning Israeli hostages. The question now, how long will this phase, as he put it, last. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has just landed back in the region. CIA Director Bill Burns arrived yesterday, both trying to delay new hostilities. Tonight, another 10 Israelis are back in Israel, including one American-Israeli dual national. She's a high school history and a civics teacher. Her father says a tour guide at the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem as well. Whether there will be more hostages freed now very much in limbo and that much more to bear for families with loved ones still being held, it cannot be easy either for the family of Shiri Bibas and her two young boys, Ariel and Kfir. Today, Hamas claimed without providing evidence that they had been killed by an Israeli airstrike. Israeli officials say they are investigating, but so far, there are no answers. I want to start tonight with CNN's Clarissa Ward in Tel Aviv. So what more do we know about the latest release of hostages?",

That was brokered in a separate agreement between the Russian government and Hamas. Then there were four Thai nationals and 10 Israeli nationals, as well as that dual US-Israeli citizen.Also, among those released today was Raya Rotem.  You remember we talked about her before. She's the mother of Hila Rotem, who was released on Sunday, who was held with Emily Hand. So some much needed respite for that family and for Hila who was separated for her mother on the last two days. But now, of course, everyone's attention very much focused on the remaining hostages whether the truce continues, and no answers yet about it -- Anderson.",

Qatar has said that they're optimistic about the truce. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Israel. He said publicly now that he very much wants to see the truce continues, that he believes it has -- it is essential in the sense that it has opened up the release of all these hostages, but also that it has allowed desperately needed aid to get into Gaza and given the people of Gaza -- the ordinary citizens of Gaza -- some respite from the consistent bombardment. So now, it's sort of a game of sit and wait and see what happens over these next four hours as one can only assume critical last-minute negotiations are ongoing, Anderson.",

It can buy you another four, maybe five days of pause. So there is a lot of room for maneuver. The main question is what Hamas really wants to do.",

It's also meant having her worst fears confirm that David, her husband of 53 years, whom she knew had been shot by Hamas gunmen while hiding with her in their saferoom, had indeed died of his wounds and that their home was destroyed. I visited that home in Nir Oz and their devastated community about two weeks after the massacre. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COOPER (voice over): We found their home completely torched. Dishes were still in the dishwasher. They hid in their safe room when the gunmen came. Inside the saferoom, a pool of dried blood evidence of what happened. David Moshe was shot holding onto the door handle to prevent the gunmen from getting in. Their attackers dragged Adina Moshe out through the saferoom window.

Priority number one, protect the territorial integrity and the safety and security of the Israeli people. Priority number two, degrade Hamas' military capability so that they can no longer do what they did on October 7th to the Israeli people.

In fact, the Republican candidate Joe Pinion for United States Senate won there by four points.So if the Republicans were worried, \"Hey, if we get rid of him, would that necessarily mean we lose a seat?\" I would say not necessarily.
