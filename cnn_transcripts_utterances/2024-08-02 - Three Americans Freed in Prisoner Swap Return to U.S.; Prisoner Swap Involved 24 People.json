Chrissy is off today.It is Friday, August the 2nd, 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where three Americans took their first steps on U.S. soil since being released from Russian prisons. It's part of the biggest exchange of its kind since the Cold War. U.S. President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris welcoming home Marine veteran Paul Whelan there. He spent the past six years in prison. Next off the plane was \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich. He ran to hug his mother and father before speaking with his colleagues. Also returning to the U.S., Russian American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva. Her daughters were in tears after not seeing their mother for more than a year. The President and Vice President took a few minutes to speak with reporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Remember what I said? Alliances make a difference. They stepped up, they took a chance for us. It mattered a lot. KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is an extraordinary day, and I'm very thankful for our president and what he has done over his entire career, but in particular as it relates to these families and these individuals, what he has been able to do to bring the allies together on many issues, but in particular this one. This is just an extraordinary testament to the importance of having a president who understands the power of diplomacy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

President Vladimir Putin greeted them Thursday in Moscow. Freedom for convicted assassin Vadim Krasikov, who was jailed in Germany, was critical to getting Putin to agree to this deal.

But they are now on route to San Antonio in Texas. They will be heading to the Brook Army Medical Center where they will be undergoing medical checks and evaluation and care there. Some of them are traveling, of course, with family members as well. But, of course, this is an important step, particularly for the Biden administration, to ensure that they are in the best of conditions upon their return.

I cannot cover my country because I would be detained and thrown to jail immediately, just like other journalists, independent journalists who were forced to leave the country.After Ivan Gershkovich was detained more than a year ago, there were a lot of foreign journalists who decided to leave the country. And there were a lot of editorial boards of big media outlets, Western media outlets, who understood that there was no chance for their reporters to keep on working in the Russian Federation. There are still people there, of course. They're very brave colleagues of ours in Moscow, in St. Petersburg and other parts of the Russian Federation. But I think that, you know, as time passes, there would be less and less people who would have an opportunity to stay there, who would have accreditations from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who would have an opportunity to cover at least something. And we would get less and less professional reporting from Russia. The only thing that we actually rely on right now as Russian journalists is citizen journalism. There are a lot of, I would say, tens and hundreds of people who are brave enough, smart enough, strong enough to cooperate with people like myself. And they are sending footage and they are reporting to us anonymously. And this is the only way right now. One of the few ways left for journalists to work in Russia, about Russia, cover Russia.",

The high profile killings of several powerful militant leaders have led to vows of retaliation from Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah. The Israeli military says it's on high alert and ready for a range of scenarios.On Thursday, Israel claims responsibility for the assassination of one of the reported masterminds of the October 7 terror attacks, Hamas military chief Mohamed Deif. The Israeli military says he was killed in a strike carried out in southern Gaza last month, but they weren't sure about that until this week when they received new intelligence on his death. Now, in just a few hours, a funeral procession will begin for the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, who will be buried in Doha two days after he was assassinated in Iran. Hamas is calling for prayers and a day of anger over his killing. CNN's Ivan Watson standing by for us in Beirut. First, though, we're going to speak to Salma, who's here in London.

This is the second most important militia group, of course, second to Hamas in Gaza, that it has killed a man who is in charge of their weapons, basically. So this is yet another assassination.So just in the last few days, we have seen Israel claim responsibility for a Hezbollah assassination, a senior Hezbollah figure. They have not claimed responsibility for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, but that has happened as well in Iran and now Islamic Jihad as well. It begins to really beg that question. How many fronts, how many groups, how many different sides and angles is Israel going to aggravate with these assassinations? And what will be the response? And how do you calm this down? How do you bring down the temperature? There was a ceasefire deal on the table that is very much in question now with assassinations. President Biden and the U.S., of course, leading this effort.
