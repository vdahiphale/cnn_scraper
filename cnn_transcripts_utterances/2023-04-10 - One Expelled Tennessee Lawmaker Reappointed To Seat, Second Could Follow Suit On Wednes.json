Late today, officials in Nashville voted to reinstate Justin Jones, one of the two lawmakers expelled from the State House last week. The second, Justin J. Pearson of Memphis joins us shortly. They, and a third lawmaker who was not sanctioned took part in a protest against gun violence in the wake of the Covenant School mass murder just a few miles from the State House. Jones and Pearson's expulsion for violating decorum, essentially talking out of turn, sparked local protest and national outcry. Now, in a horrible turn of events, people in neighboring Kentucky are living through a mass shooting of their own and we will have a live report in Louisville just ahead. First, though CNN's Ryan Young in Nashville for us tonight. And Ryan, you spoke to Representative Jones after he was reappointed. So what did he tell you? RYAN YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: John, this was amazing to see. We saw it all play out right there in front of us, not only from City Council, and then the march down the street here from the State Capitol, but all of these thousands of people showed up to be here for a rally to walk up the stairs here to the State Capitol, and this all played out right before us. Right there at the State Capitol, that's where he was sworn in on those steps. People were cheering, they were yelling. They said they wanted their voices to be heard. And let's just say this, Justin Jones says he was energized by what happened, and he said, the fight is not over just yet. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUSTIN JONES (D), REAPPOINTED TENNESSEE STATE REPRESENTATIVE: Today, we sent a clear message to Speaker Cameron Sexton that the people will not allow his crimes against democracy to happen without challenge. We are calling on House Speaker Carmen Sexton to resign as Speaker of the House. (PEOPLE cheering.)",

The decision by a Trump-appointed judge in Amarillo, Texas would otherwise take effect by week's end.

The leaks also revealed a level of spying done not just on foes, but friends as well, including South Korea and Israel.

Now, in this case, there's a lot of different directions they're likely going. They're probably starting by looking at those photographs to figure out everything they can from the photographs, from things that may have been captured in the background of the photographs to the metadata that's always kind of attached to digital photographs, and then look at things like IP addresses that and from which the photographs may have been posted to the internet. They'll also look at establishing a pool of people who they know would have had access to these documents at the respective times that are of concern. Now those pools I can tell you from having been involved in many of these investigations are always about 10 times bigger than you think they'll be.

Or potentially, I would think one of the avenues of investigation will have to be whether or not this information was hacked, which was an unauthorized access into systems. So those are the types of questions at this very preliminary stage that will have to take place. There's also a really, I think, important difference between our current environment in 2023, versus that which it was in the -- when the Snowden disclosures happened that you mentioned at the top of the segment 10 years ago, and that is, is that we are currently in a online and digital information environment, where investigators have to be looking at whether information and images are altered or false or not what they appear to be.
