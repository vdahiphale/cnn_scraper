Right now, it is finalizing a package that includes two and a half billion dollars' worth of weaponry, and that includes Stryker combat vehicles for the first time. Source telling CNN, the package is not done yet, but it could come before the end of the week.The new aid would be one of the biggest packages since the war began last February. Would reportedly include more armored Bradley Fighting Vehicles. Combined with the Strykers, it marks a significant escalation in the armored vehicles that the U.S. has committed to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Joining me now is the former President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko. Thank you so much, Mr. President for the time today. So there you heard it, the U.S. had to deliver Stryker combat vehicles for the first time and additional Bradley Fighting Vehicles. How significant will this new equipment be for the country?",

Prior to the last few days, the U.S. was set on the February 23rd boundaries there in terms of whatever it would take to get to the negotiating table.Now it seems that the United States seems open for Ukraine to actually take back or attempt to take back Crimea by providing Ukraine with weaponry to at least attack that land bridge connecting Russia to Crimea. Of course, Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Ukraine has always been defiant. That is your mission to take back Crimea. You say it is yours. I'm curious to get your response to what appears to be a shift in strategy on the U.S.'s part too.",

And that is tanks.The United States says they are not going to be sending Abrams tanks. They are in favor of Germany sending their Leopard tanks. There are about 2,000 Leopard tanks that have been distributed to other NATO allies. Germany, at this point, has said they will not do so and not even permit other countries to deliver tanks to Ukraine unless the United States delivers its own tanks. What do you think Germany is up to here? And what is your message to Chancellor Scholz when he says that he won't bring you tanks now? POROSHENKO: Look, all western world, the major, should learn unity. You should learn how to speak one voice policy. Germany, United States and other member states. At the end of the day, we can bring to the situation that Poland and other NATO member states will supply for us, the tank, without the permission of Germany. It can be challenged from the United Kingdom, the Leopard from Germany and others. We definitely now need the tank. Without tank, it is impossible to provide the offensive operation. And if we expecting that we should, through Russian aggressor, wait from Ukrainian territory, this is impossible without that defense. This is very difficult without jet fighter. And this is impossible without the tank. And the sooner we do that, the better. And this is my message to Chancellor Scholz. I know -- and the Chancellor from the position of the Germany, now, it's strongly connected with the position of NATO. And in other messages that the whole European people support supply of Ukraine the tanks.",

So it's not over yet.But at this point in time, this idea of critical race theory has always been created as the Boogeyman. And it means everything and nothing at this point, because generally, critical race theory is taught in law schools. And it is about the idea of the theory that racism exists and is embedded in the legal system that we have here. And it's kept that way to keep basically black America down. That's kind of the overarching idea of critical race theory. But when it comes to this particular course, it's been tested in 60 schools. There hasn't been a lot of reaction to that. And this is the same organization, the College Board, that oversees the SATs. And so this is sort of a rigorous look at what African-American history is in this country. And when you're talking about AP, we should mention, it's Advanced Placement. And what does Advanced Placement mean? Well, Advanced Placement means that you're studying a course that you can get college credit for if you pass the AP test. And so if you're arguing that CRT is part of this, which they are not, then you are also arguing that this shouldn't be taught ever at all, even in college, which is where it's sort of exist. It really is not taught in most K through 12 schools across the nation. We have checked and looked into this. But I do want to let you hear from someone who was the preeminent scholar on American history, but specifically African-American history. Here is what Robert Gates has said -- Dr. Henry Louis Gates has said this. He says, \"Nothing is more dramatic than having the College Board launch an AP course in a field that signifies ultimate acceptance and ultimate academic legitimacy. AP African-American Studies is not CRT, it's not the 1619 Project. It is a mainstream rigorously vetted, academic approach to a vibrant field of study.\" This is a man who has been studying this his entire life, has done many, many, many, many documentaries that many of us have seen. And this is how he sees it. And I think you're going to have teachers caught in the middle of all this as well. So it is a complicated issue, but it is one that has been used as a political sword, basically.",

And Microsoft, along with all of the other companies, Amazon, Lyft, Coinbase that have laid folks off, they are looking -- we're looking at this month alone, 37,000 layoffs. That's more than any other month last year, except for one in November when you had sort of a large slew of tech layoffs.But what happened was, during the pandemic, a lot of us turned to e- commerce, we were online, we were investing in tech. That, of course, is changing. And Microsoft saying, we need to keep up with changing consumer behaviors. And one of the -- one analyst put it to me this way, they said that tech companies were spending like rockstars. And now, one analyst also suggesting that this is a little bit of a course correction, a little bit of pulling back. But it's important to note that tech represents about two percent of employment. OK? So this is a smaller, smaller base of employment compared to something like leisure and hospitality, which is 11 percent. And we know that this morning, unemployment claims came out, 190,000. That's below the norm. So we're seeing maybe in other industries that there aren't layoffs happening. This may be just something that is specific to tech. And we've heard from many other industries as well, they're having trouble hiring people. And one analyst also suggesting that during this course correction for these tech companies, this may be short lived that we may see hiring in other ways. Microsoft saying that they're going to have a huge investment in AI, Artificial Intelligence. So while we're losing, unfortunately, painfully, folks now in the tech industry, we could see gains rather soon, sooner rather than later.",
