But I remind you that after he left the White House back in 2021, particularly after January 6, a lot of people who were close to the former president in his orbit really tried to distance themselves from him. Susie Wiles did not. She remained by his side and has remained very loyal since. So that's one thing -- one thing to keep in mind. The other thing about this as well is that she is very well respected within Donald Trump's team. And that's very hard to do for someone who has been in a top leadership role and really in power for several years now. People beneath her really like her. They see she's disciplined. They like the fact that she's not really someone who's always on camera or trying to get media attention for herself. She likes to hang back. That's another thing that they cited. But one thing that's very interesting to your question about how we should think about how she'll operate. I mean, so we had great reporting from our colleague, Steve Contorno, who said essentially that, you know, one of the key conditions for her taking this job was that she did not want the clown car going to the White House and said that Donald Trump agreed.

Maura, let me start with you, because I do want to talk about this issue of abortion rights in the U.S. and why that seemed to be much more popular than Kamala Harris herself. When you look at where abortion rights was actually on the ballot, the 10 states, eight out of those 10 states, the majority of people voted in favor of abortion rights. But then at the same time, they voted for the man who was responsible for trying to take those rights away. How do you explain that to people?",

And it looked like turnout was lower, ultimately, than it was four years ago. And while the majority of women did vote for Kamala Harris, 53 percent to Trump's 46 percent, Biden won 55 percent of women's votes, 43 percent went to Trump. So in trying to parse through these numbers, and obviously women don't vote as a monolith, I'm wondering what questions you're asking about why we saw a decrease in the number of women voting for a female candidate and why you think voter enthusiasm and turnout wasn't as high as it was four years ago.",

      "sentences": "So I think, you know, one thing to start with is that actually when you disaggregate across racial lines, thenumbers look radically different. Women of color overwhelmingly went for Kamala Harris. White women split -- effectively evenly split their vote between Trump and Kamala Harris. And I don't think we should be surprised about that, because that's actually a trend that has held up for the last several presidential elections. But I think when we think about the larger trends about turnout and turnout being slightly down as compared to 2020, we have to actually revisit a conversation that we've been having for essentially the last year, which is that voters are tired. They were tired of their choices. They felt in a lot of ways that they were having a rehash of the 2020 election that they voters were very clear that they wanted some kind of new inspiration. And this is actually why we saw a lot of momentum in the initial weeks after Kamala Harris announced her campaign and then got the democratic nominee -- nomination to be president of the United States. There were moments where people felt like she had the energy perhaps to be seen as anti-establishment, to be outside of the Democratic Party, because voters were very clear that they did not want Trump versus Biden again. And so I think one of the things that we can point to is that even in an election where it feels like there's been this overwhelming shift to the right, that Donald Trump may look at this and say, I have a mandate from the American people to do whatever I want, it's also clear that the American people are saying very clearly and very loudly that they want something different, that they do not trust establishment politicians. And I would also look at the policy, the way that the policy ballot initiatives shook out during this election, which is that right-wing policies weren't actually very -- didn't do very well on the ballot. And policies that we initially associate with, I think, progressive ideas like abortion rights and reproductive rights ended up doing really well. The other thing that ended up really doing well are initiatives that address the economy. So, these are things that voters are looking for, in particular, women voters and the larger electorate.",

In fact, you know, just recently, now we have the Conservative Party leader, Kemi Badenoch, who is a black woman, very far to the right, but a black woman nonetheless. And I do -- I just -- I want to find out from you, just, you know, give me your take on this, why the glass ceiling in the U.S. is so much harder to shatter than in Europe.

And some of the reflections, looking back on the Harris campaign, was it was a freebie to show Americans that she's a woman and she's a woman of color. So they didn't spend much time focusing on that. She was a political candidate who the party said is the best person equipped for the job. This is one of the hardest issues to really poll on, because, let's be honest, very few people will honestly say, I just won't vote for a woman or I just won't vote for a woman of color. So if the lessons learned from the Hillary Clinton loss was not to harp too much on the fact that history would be made electing the first female president, what are the lessons learned here? Because it seems that, oh, I'm all in favor of a woman, just not that woman doesn't tell us much.",

You know, there were a lot of voters, I think, who looked at Nikki Haley and said, I like her. But then there were a lot of voters in the Republican primary who said, I don't know that I can vote for a woman. I don't know that I can vote for a Nikki Haley type. And who pivoted, again, it's really hard to kind of tease the sound and pull for this. But there were a lot of people who said, I feel just more comfortable with Donald Trump and who would articulate necessarily why they felt more comfortable with Donald Trump despite all of, I think, the kind of troubles that he was going through, whether it be his criminal liability troubles, whether it be the kind of things that he was saying off the -- off the cuff or the way that he was criticizing people, the arguments that he was getting into. And so a lot -- I think one of the things that we can tease out there is that there are real struggles happening with how we understand women in politics. But I think the lesson from this, from the 2024 election cycle shouldn't be that women of color can't be president of the United States or certainly that women of color can't be president of the United States, and said it needs to be a much, I think, a much deeper, more nuanced assessment of what went wrong. You know, Kamala Harris had almost everything running against her. Donald Trump comes back and, against all odds, is incredibly popular with a Republican base. An economy that looks great on paper, but in practice, in people's daily and lived experiences, is really just not translating. And we hear this over and over again. And then, of course, there's the blame that people put on Joe Biden, not necessarily for dropping out too late, but for being relatively unpopular for a number of different reasons, but especially upfront when it comes to Ukraine and when it comes to Israel and Gaza. So there, here you have somebody like Kamala Harris, who's carrying all of this on her back, in addition, and is essentially running an uphill campaign. The question needs to be, what does a successful campaign look like for a woman who is not encumbered by all of the baggage that Hillary Clinton and that Kamala Harris had? That's a very different conversation to have, but it's also one that is unconstrained by the very realities of, you know, incumbency and a very angry electorate.",

And a lot of them have been specifically targeted at black and brown individuals, some of them children. There on your screen, you can see one of the texts. That one's sent to us by a woman in New Jersey. It's blurred at the top, but the text actually had her name in it and then referenced picking cotton, it referenced slave catchers and plantations. And some of the messages even specifically refer to President-Elect Donald Trump. Now, to be clear, the Trump campaign tells us they denounce these messages and they had absolutely nothing to do with them, but so many people, as you know, are really on edge in these first days since the election. We heard from the president of the NAACP, who put out a statement saying, these messages represent an alarming increase in vile and abhorrent rhetoric from racist groups across the country who now feel emboldened to spread hate and stoke the flames of fear that many of us are feeling after Tuesday's election results. Since from now there are these investigations underway all across the country. The FBI is part of them. They sent out a statement saying, they're now working with the Justice Department. We know that the FCC is also involved, given that we're talking about text messages and emails. And it does appear, as you mentioned, that at least some of those messages we now know were sent using a service called TextNow. It's a company that allows people to create phone numbers for free. That company says they're aware of it. They believe this was a widespread and coordinated attack. And now they're working with industry partners and with law enforcement. They are trying to stop any new accounts from being created so that they can stop these messages from going out, and then ultimately they want to help track down whoever is sending them.",
