Donald Trump literally responded to Joe Biden's proposal with, let's get ready to rumble. Marking -- this will mark the third time that these men have faced off on a debate stage, also marking the earliest general election debate in modern history, June 27th, right here on CNN.This morning, there are new details on how Biden and Trump are already preparing. And new reporting on why the candidates agreed to face off so far out from Election Day. For Biden, it's a chance to boost lagging poll numbers. For Trump, it's an opportunity to change the conversation from his criminal hush money trial and the others that he's about to face. On top of that, the timing gives both a chance to recover if they don't perform well. The debate plans seemingly came together at lightning speed and now puts the candidates and the country on a collision course with history for the very intense start to summer ahead of us. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now from the White House with more. Priscilla, what are you learning this morning from there about how they're now preparing?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, there was groundwork that was being laid leading up to the announcement yesterday that these two will go head to head. Of course, remember, last month, President Biden told Howard Stern that he was, quote, happy to debate Trump. And that really started to set things in motion in earnest.In recent weeks, we've learned the Biden campaign and Trump campaign were having informal conversations behind the scenes largely focused on their mutual disdain for the Commission on Presidential Debates, which wouldn't have started its debate schedule until September, which both campaigns viewed as too late. But still a remarkable moment to see two campaigns, two candidates agree when they usually just don't, and not only that, but also shun the commission. So, yesterday, in rapid succession, we saw the Biden campaign pitch an altered proposed schedule for debates, as well as lay out their criteria to have a one-on-one debate and coordinate directly with the broadcast networks. The president accepted an invitation by CNN and ABC News, former President Donald Trump doing exactly the same, the dates there, CNN on June 27th and ABC News on September 10th. Now, as far as the criteria for CNN that's going to happen in Atlanta. There will be no audience. And both candidates will have received 15 percent in four separate polls meeting CNN standards. But, of course, here at the White House, it now turns to preparation. And on that end, we're learning that Ron Klain, President Biden's former chief of staff, will take vacation from his job at Airbnb to come and help the President prepare for that June debate. And, look, at the end of the day, the Biden campaign has wanted to put President Biden out there on the debate stage. They think he performed well in 2020. And this will allow them to bring that stark contrast that they're eager to shine a light on between him and former President Donald Trump directly to American living rooms. Kate?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think Priscilla laid it out very well. And, look, she's exactly right. There had been conversations behind the scenes. I was told between two very senior people at the Trump campaign and also with the Biden campaign, kind of laying the groundwork to make sure, are we doing this, are we going to go ahead with this.They kind of agreed on a lot, I think, you know, from the Trump campaign's perspective, when they looked at the proposal that the Biden team had laid out. A lot of what they were asking for were exactly the type of conditions that the Trump team wanted. One is that they wanted these debates to be earlier, and we're seeing it three months earlier than you would normally have any debates. They wanted this to come early. They also want to have more debates. That's where they do differ. Donald Trump's team yesterday said that they want to have four debates. Of course, Biden's team saying they only will agree to two. And, look, when I talked to Donald Trump's team, they said that behind the scenes, they had really kind of come to the conclusion in recent weeks that they wanted to circumvent the Commission on Presidential Debates. And part of that is because, again, they wanted these earlier and they wanted more. They also are very aware that they do not want Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or a third party candidate to also be on the debate stage. They really want this to be a one-on-one match up with Joe Biden. And part of that is because they believe that this will be a great opportunity to show that Biden is much more weaker and more feeble, in their words, not mine, than he was in 2020. And remember, back in 2020, when we saw these two face off on the debate stage, Donald Trump was very aggressive. He barely let Joe Biden get a word in. And we did see in the aftermath of that Donald Trump's poll numbers fell. However, Trump's campaign, and this is really the view of his campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, they believe that Biden has declined in recent years and that having as many of these debates where they can have these two men together on stage will be the kind of contrast that they need looking ahead to November. Now, I also just want to give you some sense of what happened after that chain of events yesterday, where we saw the Biden campaign agree to debate. That was really frustrating for the Trump team. When I talked to his advisers, they said, look, you know, they kind of felt like they were getting the back foot on this. They were the ones who were playing catch up. However, remember, Donald Trump and his campaign had repeatedly called on Joe Biden for months to debate. And so they're trying to put that message out there that this is something that they want, that they have been asking for, and that they're ready to go with these series of debates. We also saw them say that they want to do a third debate in October for with Fox News. Of course, the Biden campaign not agreeing to that third debate yet. John?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Sara. So, remember, Michael Cohen was on the stand for about two hours with the cross-examination. And just like you said, Todd Blanche was hammering, firing questions at him. But he was also a bit scattered in his approach, kind of jumping around to different topics, actually, as you noted just yesterday, but we're hearing now that Todd Blanche is going to be a little bit more zeroed in on the charges that are against the former president.They're going to be challenging Michael Cohen's words, what he has said in the past, sometimes under oath, and basically trying to elicit the fact that he is a liar. You know, that is what they are trying to show to jurors. We're also understanding from sources is that they're really going to be focusing on some conversations that Michael Cohen said he had during direct with Donald Trump in regards to those hush money payments. So, we really do are hearing that the defense is going to really get to the heart of this case. Now, we understand that he could be on the stand for the entire day today under cross-examination, and it could even go into Monday. Remember, there is no court tomorrow because of Barron Trump's graduation. Trump wanted to attend that. And one source is telling my colleague, Kara Scannell, that it takes a long time to get through all the lies. So, that's what we're hearing. It may take a while to finish up with Michael Cohen when it comes to these defense questions. Now, our understanding is that once that happens, the prosecution will rest its case. But, again, that might not happen until next week.",

What would be admissible if they brought that expert witness to the stand? That is the only indication that we have gotten exactly of what defense they might put on. Of course, the former president could take the stand, but it's very unlikely.So, here's the other thing, that there is only, you know, today for trial this week, and then next week, there is also only three days of trial. So, it's possible that we might, you know, see these closing arguments at some point next week, but, again, the timing is so uncertain at this point. So, wish I had it more clear for you, Sara, but, certainly, we do expect the defense to put on its defense at some point next week.",

      "sentences": "Good morning, yes. So, this pier has now been anchored on the beach, as you said, John, off the coast of Gaza. Now, that it has been anchored, there can begin humanitarian aid to be flown into the strip from that location. This isn't going to happen today, but CENTCOM says the expectation is that this is it's going to start happening in the coming days here.And this system has two parts. First of all, it's that floating pier, and then they also have the causeway that's heading in to Gaza to that location where the actual humanitarian aid will be distributed from. And U.S. officials won't be on the ground, no U.S. military will be on the ground in Gaza for this operation. Of course, it's CENTCOM that has taken the lead in setting up this complex system, but it's the United Nations that's actually going to be meeting the humanitarian aid and distributing it into the Gaza Strip. And we should note that this is obviously deeply needed aid, of course. We've heard from the World Food Programme just earlier this month that Northern Gaza is in a full blown famine and also warning that that is spreading to the other parts of Gaza. But this specific location where this humanitarian aid is coming in, U.S. officials stress that the goal isn't for it to replace the humanitarian aid coming in from the other locations, it's for it to be a supplemental to that. So, the expectation is that once they get up to 150 trucks per day, which is going to be the goal, that would be in addition, of course, to the trucks that are coming in through the other humanitarian ports over -- no, excuse me, not ports, over land that have already been operating. And the one last thing I want to note is that there have been challenges in setting up this pier over the last few months. It was President Biden who ordered this pier during his State of the Union Address in March, but we should note that it was set up pretty swiftly. That happened over the course of the last two months before this was able to be at a place where it is today, where it is about ready to be operational.",
