She became friends -- they became friends when Melania Trump was in the White House. They worked on a series of events together.But what's most striking about this event really goes to the heart of Donald Trump's current campaign is which is hear him almost every time he's out there talking about pledging that if he was reelected to office, he would expand on those hardline immigration policies and that includes making it harder to become a U.S. citizen.

They asked the Justice Department to investigate Donald Trump's handling of classified documents or presidential documents after he left office, which led to the investigation, which led to an indictment and charges with a trial set in May.
