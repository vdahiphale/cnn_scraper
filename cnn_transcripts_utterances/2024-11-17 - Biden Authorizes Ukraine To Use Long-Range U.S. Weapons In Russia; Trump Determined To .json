President Biden now authorizing Ukraine to use long range U.S. weapons inside of Russia for the first time. The decision comes as North Korean soldiers have been deployed to the southern Russian region of Kursk, the site of Kyiv's only major military success this year. A U.S. official tells CNN that the weapons are intended to be primarily used in that region for now. CNN's Kevin Liptak is traveling with President Biden in Brazil. Kevin, what more is the White House saying at this point?",

      "sentences": "Well, we should specify, Fredricka. The White House isn't saying anything at all about this. We've learned about it from a senior U.S. official. But neither the White House nor the State Department are actually confirming this decision, which I think gives you a sense of the sensitivities that are surrounding it. And it is a major change in American policy.President Biden now allowing Ukraine to fire these U.S. provided long range missiles into Russia. And it comes at what American officials say is an inflection point in this war. You do have tens of thousands of Russian troops massing near the Kursk region as Russia prepares an offensive to try and claw back some territory. They are being supplemented by thousands of North Korean troops. And that in the end is part of what officials say led to this decision. President Biden wanting to send a signal to the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un that sending his troops into war with Russia in Ukraine could lead to their certainly own peril. And I think that is part of what is contributing to this decision. But I also don't think you can necessarily separate this from the fact that Donald Trump will be president in two months. And certainly he has taken a very different view of the war in Ukraine than President Biden. He has cast a very skeptical eye towards continued American assistance to Ukraine, be it military or financial. And he's also said that he would be able to resolve this conflict in one day. He hasn't necessarily said how he would do that. The implication, of course, is that it would require some territorial concessions on the part of Ukraine. And I think what the Biden administration is trying to do in this decision, but also in trying to rush as much financial assistance to Ukraine as possible before Biden leaves office, is to position Kyiv in the best possible place going forward, given the uncertainty of what will happen once Trump comes into office. Now, this decision was a long time coming. It was the subject of quite an intense internal debate inside the Biden administration. Certainly you had the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, very vehemently calling on Biden to allow this capability. But you also had officials who were worried about escalation, worried about the number of these missiles that actually exist that are in the stockpiles. But certainly President Biden now coming to this decision as he prepares to meet world leaders here in Rio de Janeiro.",

      "sentences": "I have, Fredricka. I've actually been in touch with the spokeswoman of Russia's Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova. And, and she told me, look, Vladimir Putin already commented on all of this three weeks ago. So went back and looked what the Russian president said back then, which obviously completely still pertains to what is going on right now.And back then, Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin said that if the United States and NATO partners would allow the Ukrainians to use NATO supplied weapons, American supplied weapons, to strike deep into Russia, that could lead to a severe escalation not just in the war in Ukraine, but between the United States and Russia and between Russia and NATO as well. Essentially what Vladimir Putin said back then is that he believes that these types of weapons, the ATACMS, surface to surface missiles, but also, of course, some of the weapons that other NATO partners, like for instance the Brits and the French have been supplying to the Ukrainians, that these weapons cannot be used without the help of NATO specialists, without the help of U.S. specialists or other specialists. That is the belief of Vladimir Putin. And he said that the fact that NATO specialists are needed to make these weapons works means that this is now direct involvement, as he put it, of the United States in combat with Russia. So he believes that if Russia were to get struck with weapons supplied by the United States to Ukraine, that this would be the United States essentially striking the Russian Federation, which obviously the Russians are saying would lead to a big escalation in the war there. He also, and this is probably even bigger, changed Russia's nuclear doctrine because of all of this to now include a scenario where a non- nuclear country attacks Russia with long distance weapons but is aided by a nuclear nation, that could then also lead to a nuclear response from the Russians. So certainly the Russians are saying that potentially if U.S. supplied long distance weapons are used to strike deep into Russia, that this could bring a big escalation between Russia and the United States. And the Russian spokesman for the Kremlin already said that Russia could do what they call a, quote, appropriate response. Fredricka.",

And one person telling CNN, quote, he is not going to back off. He is all in. And so there's now this period where we're going to have to wait and see whether Trump can convince Republicans that they should stand by his side on this. Sean Spicer, a former White House press secretary, telling CNN, quote, telling Donald Trump something isn't going to happen is a surefire way of him doubling down.

We've heard from top senators, even Trump allies who've indicated they want to treat these Cabinet appointees like any other, which means hearings, which means committee stops before you get to the floor, which means a vote on the floor. Who's going to give? Because we know that when you bring some of these more controversial picks like Gaetz, like Hegseth, there might not be the votes to confirm them.

Those are two very different things. But they're not just factoring in how they feel about Matt Gaetz and how they feel about President Trump. Some of these senators will be on the ballot in 2026. So they're factoring in how this will play back home. Some of them are in states where voting against Trump may play poorly. Some of them may be in states where voting against Trump actually helps them come across as independent minded. So all of that is kind of part of the calculus. That's why Trump has said, hey, don't vote at all. Just let me appoint who I want during the recess. Now, that also carries risk. You know, it's a lot on the senators' plates, and we're just going to have to see where it shakes out. We're going to see which senators really are the ones to watch who may fuck the system.",

And then, since Nasrallah's death, he'd become much more visible, giving several press conferences, more available to the press. So, again, it sort of begs the question. If this was somebody who was sort of more in the public domain now, albeit a senior figure within Hezbollah but not a military commander, a more sort of political position, why was he killed now? And that sort of throws into the real question of the talks with Hezbollah that are going on right now.",

Is Hezbollah going to take this and say, hey, we're trying to talk and you're killing us?But the reality is that Israel has made it very clear it's going to continue to strike Hezbollah's armed stores. It's going to continue to try to push them out of southern Lebanon, where Israel says that they are a threat to the -- to the peace and security inside of northern Israel. So, I think that's sort of taken as written. What I have been hearing from sources is that Hezbollah has been inclined to accept the terms that the U.S. is putting forward in its proposal. Even though I'm told that these conditions and terms are tough conditions, a Lebanese official told CNN, just a couple of days ago, that he expected Hezbollah to have an answer by Monday, whether or not they'd go forward with the U.S. proposal. But I think the reality, partly for Hezbollah, is this, at the moment. That they are not an effective fighting force the same way they were. Their communications are crippled. Their leadership is decimated. They can fire rockets with some effect into Israel, not a huge effect into Israel, but they are not the force they want -- once were. And, in those terms, for military grouping like Hezbollah, you'd expect them to be trying to find a way to kind of back out of the fight, so they can lick their wounds and prepare and come back another day. And, obviously, Israel is going to put forward demands that are not going to let them do that.",

Every time you eat, all sorts of hormones are released, like GLP-1. They are called post-nutrient hormones. They travel here to the hypothalamus in the brain to tell you that you are full or satiated. They also travel over here to the pancreas to kick out more insulin to help absorb the energy you just consumed.
