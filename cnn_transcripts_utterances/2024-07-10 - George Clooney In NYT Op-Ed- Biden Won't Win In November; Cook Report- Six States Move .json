Its going to be a conversation that he has with his family.

As you point out, it's the tip of the iceberg. I think when you see Nancy Pelosi say the things she said, she knows what she's doing.

One of them is Arizona State Senator Jake Hoffman. He's been charged as being part of the fake elector plot in Arizona. He's pleaded not guilty. He told CNN: The American people are awake to the perverse weaponization of government at the hands of power hungry Democrats. So, certainly, not backing away from his feelings how about his criminal charges. In Michigan, we have Matthew DePerno. Now, this is someone who is a failed candidate for attorney general.

Everything about this party now is, does Trump approved? If the answer is yes, then we supported Republican state tariffs. Not anymore. They loved tariffs. It's central to their platform right now. We're going to modify or tried to moderate on abortion. Okay, we're all in on that. Let's do that as well. Everything that Trump points to when says its important is where Republicans feel like -- to Adam Kinzinger's point, they have to be, and no issue is more central than this issue.

But about 61 percent of the weight that you lose, whether it's these medications or simply restricting your calories, is it going to come from fat? And about 39 percent from lean body mass, muscle mass. So just keep that in the back of the mind. I think there's two messages here when you take these medications, you got to anticipate date what you're seeing on the screen, which means you got to do resistance training, maybe as much even more so than aerobic training. And also really think about your protein intake it, should be getting about one gram per kilogram of protein every day. So if you weighed 200 pounds, that means you should be getting about 100 grams of protein every day. You got to pay more attention to that when you're on these meds.",

The concerns we hear about are usually more short-term. These drugs slowed down how much your gut empties or how quickly your gut empties. So people do develop nausea, they do develop vomiting, you know, situations that are related specifically to that, constipation. More rare side effects can occur as well where people will actually developed stomach paralysis and obstructions. But, thankfully, those are rare and you're getting more and more data. One thing to keep in mind when you talk about side effects that's either big side effects in a small number of people, which makes it significant or smaller side effects in a large group of people.
