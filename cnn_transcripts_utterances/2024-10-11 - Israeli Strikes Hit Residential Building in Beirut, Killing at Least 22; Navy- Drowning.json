The head of the peacekeeping mission at the U.N. said that the safety of peacekeepers was in jeopardy. The IDF said that they were targeting a threat and had warned the U.N. peacekeepers on the base to be in a place of safety.But nevertheless, two peacekeepers were injured today. This was after two were killed through IDF action yesterday. And one of those injured today receiving serious shrapnel wounds to his stomach, apparently, and has been medevacked to hospital.",

Colonel Leighton, thank you so much for being with us. It wasn't that long ago that we were talking about strikes like this in central Beirut being uncommon, and now we're seeing them with more and more frequency. What's the significance of this latest one? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: So what we're seeing, I think, Boris, is that the Israelis have moved their targeting into central Beirut, and the reason they've done that is because Hezbollah has moved into central Beirut. Hezbollah is normally in the southern suburbs and in places like the Dahiyeh Quarter. But since the attacks on Nasrallah and others, the IDF has basically cleaned out, if you will, that particular area of Hezbollah fighters, at least they think they've done that, and they know that Hezbollah has moved into other areas, more centrally located. And of course that puts a large portion of Beirut's population at significant risk at this point in time.",

One of the key things about this is that when the Israelis target something, they go after that particular target, regardless of what's in the way of that target, and they believed that there was a Hezbollah weapons area near the U.N. installation, and the U.N. installation happened to be in the way, and the Israelis just went ahead and attacked anyways. It is true, as Nic mentioned, that they had warned, at least they say they had warned the U.N. peacekeeping forces to take cover, but nonetheless, two of them were still injured.",

      "sentences": "Boris and Brianna, the investigation found that the root cause of the drowning of these two elite members of the Navy SEALs was, quote, negative buoyancy. That is, they were unable to float and drown because they were loaded up with gear. Compounding that problem, the Navy found, was insufficient training and unclear guidelines on buoyancy.Here is a picture of the two SEALs, that is 37-year-old Chief Special Warfare Operator Christopher Chambers and Naval Special Warfare Operator First Class Nate Ingram. The two were posthumously promoted. They deployed to the waters of the Middle East with SEAL Team 3 in early December. They carried out two intercepts in December. And it was this third intercept where this incident occurred in heavy seas, in eight foot seas, near the maximum for an operation like this, especially at nighttime. First, Chambers fell in, according to the investigation, as he was trying to board. Then Ingram dove in after him trying to save him, as is essentially standard operating procedure when something happens to a Navy SEAL, according to how they operate. The entire incident, however, lasted less than a minute. The two men, even with all of their training, their physical fitness and their expertise, were unable to stay on top of the water and were unable to breathe. Within a minute, both of them were lost at sea. After a 10-day search and recovery effort, that search and recovery was called off, having searched some 48,000 square miles of ocean, and they were effectively laid to rest at sea. Now, part of the problem here was that there aren't clear Navy guidelines on buoyancy. Some Navy guidelines reference positive buoyancy, that is being able to float on top of the water. Others recommend neutral buoyancy, which is essentially hovering, neither sinking nor floating. And in the end, the investigation found that it was up to each individual team member to determine their buoyancy. On top of that, there was a lack of clear training on buoyancy and on emergency equipment to assist in floating should something like this occur. The investigation recommended that and more be improved -- Boris and Brianna.",

It looks really cool. You have this very sci-fi looking, self-driving taxi that doesn't even need to be plugged in to be charged.And Musk said that he expects the cyber cab to be in production by 2026. But here's the thing. Elon Musk is sort of famous for making these timeline predictions that he doesn't deliver on. It was five years ago that he said he expected his fleet of Robotaxis to come within a year. And yet we're only just seeing them and seeing them in this really controlled demo environment, whereas you have competitors like Google's Waymo already driving people around major cities. I was in a Waymo in San Francisco just a few weeks ago. That also doesn't require a driver. And so I think that's the main question for investors now and why you're seeing the stock down almost 9 percent today after this event. I also think there were some questions about design choices. Why does it only have two seats? And you look at those butterfly doors. They look pretty cool, but I don't know how well they would work here in New York City traffic.",
