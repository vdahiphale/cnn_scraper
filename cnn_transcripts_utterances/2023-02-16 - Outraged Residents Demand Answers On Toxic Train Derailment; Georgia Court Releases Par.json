President Biden and his team, they're debating whether he should speak publicly about the mysterious series of airborne shutdowns we've been tracking. First, of course, was the Chinese spy balloon that was taken down by the U.S. military nearly two weeks ago. And then the three other unidentified objects found over North American airspace. Now, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, they have been pushing for Biden to speak about this, especially after they've received a series of classified briefings on it all. Arlette Saenz has the very latest for us. She's at the White House at this hour. Arlette, what's behind this deliberation at the White House still? I mean, why can't they make their mind up about this?",

And one thing that officials have been trying to keep an eye on is that exactly how much information they are able to get relating to those three unidentified objects. But President Biden could potentially be speaking about this as soon as today. And when he does address both that Chinese -- suspected Chinese spy balloon and these three aerial objects that were shot down over North America just last week, and it will really reflect the most extensive remarks that we've heard from the president about this issue that has prompted both fascination and concern.Now, officials here in the U.S. are increasingly confident that those three objects that the U.S. shot down over the U.S. and Canada between Friday and Saturday that they were benign objects. But there are still other details that are unknown, including who exactly they belong to, whether it was a country or a private entity. And, of course, over the past two weeks, officials have been trying to glean as much information about that suspected Chinese spy balloon that was shot down nearly two weeks ago. One area that intelligence officials are analyzing is whether that balloon which originated in China, inadvertently accidentally made its way, changed course to the continental United States. Now, I will note. President Biden is currently at Walter Reed receiving his physical, expected to come back here to the White House, so we will see whether he might add any potential remarks about the balloon and the unidentified objects later today.",

He's the White House and national security correspondent for The New York Times, of course. David, what have you been hearing about the maybe-maybe not nature of this kind of discussion behind the scenes at the White House, and the -- with the president and his team about him speaking publicly on this?DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, he wants to speak publicly only if he has some news to convey here. And part of the problem is that the news about the Chinese balloon, the initial one that was shut down in South Carolina, has been pretty much classified that we're beginning to get more and more detail, including what you just heard, which is that, as the Times reported last night, we believe that this balloon started in Hainan Island and was probably intended to go over Guam and Hawaii and that they didn't really intend for it to go over the continental United States. The other three balloons look to be the equivalent of a sort of low- altitude space junk. The best guesswork that they have right now is that they were not surveillance. They were probably leftover weather balloons or other experiments. And therefore, you know, the kind of thing that probably would have gone by with no one shooting at it three weeks ago.",

This also speaks to -- there's been -- the reaction from lawmakers, kind of coming out of these briefings has been noteworthy. I mean, the administration gave the Senate a classified briefing on the kind of the overall threat from China now with relation to this. And senators from both parties coming out. They had some pretty stark warnings. Let me play this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R-FL): China today is the single most formidable adversary the United States has ever faced. Soviet Union was not an industrial power, technological power, or commercial power. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, (D-CT): The Chinese have become a more vigorous and real threat than ever before in our history. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's because of the cyber threats from China. It's because of the industrial competition and semiconductors and software in AI and quantum computing. And that was all true before the balloon incident. And what's interesting is that it took something that was relatively low tech, a balloon, with a -- probably a sophisticated sensor pack in it, but one that you could see to wake up Congress.The concern I have right now, Kate, is that Democrats and Republicans are sort of in a competition to show who can be tougher on China. And in China, you see a mirror image of that in their own internal debate. And that's how you get two countries to descend into confrontation. And so, I think part of what the president's seeking to do if he does speak on this, I suspect he will soon, is to try to come up with some ways that China and the U.S. can talk to each other again. It'll be interesting to see here in Munich, where I just arrived for the Munich Security Conference, whether it's Secretary of State Blinken and his Chinese equivalent, Wang Yi, actually ended up meeting.

The panel in Fulton County has been investigating efforts by Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election results there. And they say in this report that they believe one or more witnesses who came before the panel may have committed perjury.

I'm told that they are going through that report, crafting a response right now and that shouldn't be out again any moment. But I will tell you that I spoke to multiple advisors ahead of this release who said that they were really concerned about these potential criminal referrals. And Donald Trump himself grew agitated recently when talking about this Georgia probe.I spoke to him just a few weeks ago, and he repeated that constant defense that he's had for himself where he says it was a perfect phone call. But he went a step further. He continued to say that it was free speech, that it was his opinion, that it wasn't actually a crime. There was nothing wrong with that phone call. Again, this is with his Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger at the time. And that he was just giving his opinion. And that there were so many lawyers on the call that there was really nothing wrong with it. It was not something that was done in secret. So, we'll see if he addresses this when they do finally get us that response. The other thing to notice here, Kate, is it is very clear that he will take issue with the part of that probe -- of that release of that report, when he talks about how they unanimously decided that there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election, something he still believes or at least still repeats today, Kate.",
