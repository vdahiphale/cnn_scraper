Fed Chair Powell delivered an important speech on finance. And on Wall Street, a higher open, we still have got a chance. U.S. futures pretty flat at the moment after two days of losses for the S&amp;P 500. Europe meantime is fairly higher with new numbers showing Euro zone inflation is slowing for the first time in 17 months. Closely watched U.S. data has just been released too. An updated read on third quarter GDP shows the American economy expanding at an annual rate of 2.9 percent. That is a stronger pace than the initial reading and also a better performance than expected. In Asia, meantime, another strong showing for the Hang Seng, that said, weak Chinese factor was also released, data was also released today and it is a further sign that zero-COVID policies are pressuring the world's second largest economy. But the main event for global markets today takes place less than five hours from now, and Fed Chair Powell delivers a policy speech at the Brookings Institution. Will Powell cool like a dove or talk like a hawk on the size and scope of rate hikes? We will discuss later in the program with Kristina Hooper. She is the chief global market strategist at Invesco. But, first, we begin in China, where China is seeing more COVID protests despite government attempts to stop them. This new video here shows angry protesters shouting and throwing objects at riot police in the major city of Guangzhou. Ivan Watson joins us now from Hong Kong with the latest. Ivan, it appears that these protests have escalated, at least these protests, from just protests to clashes with police. I mean, how significant are these latest rounds of protests?",

What all the more startling is then the next day, city officials announced the relaxation of some COVID restrictions. The Chinese state appears to be in a bit of a dance right now talking very tough, promising to calm down hard on demonstrators while also showing signs of relaxing some of the onerous COVID restrictions that have made people so angry. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WATSON (voice over):  China's police state strikes back, flooding the streets of Beijing and Shanghai with police, an unmistakable show of force after a weekend of unprecedented protests in at least 15 cities across the country. In the eastern city of Hangzhou Monday night, police arrest people in a central square. And an eyewitness tells CNN police searched people's phones on the Shanghai subway, looking for apps that allow users to circumvent China's strict internet censorship. The communist party's domestic security committee ordered officials to resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as criminal activities that destabilized social order. No compromise for peaceful protesters to voice their opinion. Meanwhile, health officials striking a slightly softer tone, calling for a shorter lockdowns in the Chinese government campaign to eradicate COVID-19.",

And we can anticipate big state funeral for Jiang Zemin. Online, there is a certain amount of nostalgia for this man who was president of China when it hosted the 2008 Olympics. He then ruled the country as the top official of the communist party during a period when China was opening up more to the world, when the handover of Hong Kong -- the peaceful handover took place in 1997. He was president at that time. And the difference between his time in office and today is pretty stark when China has quite literally been cut off from the outside world for some three years due to COVID restrictions. It's almost impossible to get into the country from the outside. And there is perceived to be much less freedom to discuss than there had been during his time.

So, those players are on a plane. Some have remained here. But for the U.S., it is now all about building up to that round of 16 game against the Netherlands. You have seen from the pictures of the team arriving back at their hotel in the early hours of morning. Just what this result means to Gregg Berhalter young and hungry side, and, absolutely, they deserve to be celebrating this moment, a first U.S. place in the round of 16 since Brazil in 2014. A lot of questions had been asked about how this young side, 25 out of 26 of them playing in a World Cup for the first time, we're going to cope with the pressure on them at that match. They did it admirably. Up stepped Captain America, Christian Pulisic with a decisive goal. The big question over the last 12 hours or so is, is he going to be fit to play in the next round? He was taken off the pitch straight to hospital where he had some scans, examinations for what is being called a pelvic contusion. There is good news though for U.S. fans. This is what their coach, Gregg Berhalter, told CNN This Morning a short while ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GREGG BERHALTER, U.S. MEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER COACH:  He seems to be doing good.

I'm sure everyone remembers the surge in hate speech on the platform. And he talked about the fact that his team was able address that and build technology to take care of that problem. But it seems that things sort of deteriorated from there. And in the early days, Musk did seem to be trying to continue to appease Twitter's advertisers, which requires keeping the platform safe, so you have to imagine that sort of played in. But Yoel Roth then talked about the fact that Muck launched this updated version of Twitter subscription product, Twitter Blue. And the trust and safety team have predicted all of the problems that happened, impersonation of prominent accounts, he said that they had told Musk that that was going to happen and that Musk decided to launch the product anyways. And that seemed to really sort of have been the breaking point for him. And he addressed this in an op-ed in The New York Times a couple of weeks ago when he talked about the future of Twitter under Musk, and he sort of talked about the fact that Musk is going to be the chief decider, as chief twit at Twitter, Musk is going to be the person who is going to make these decisions sort of regardless of the fact, regardless of the advice that he is receiving from the staff or whether or not these are good decisions.",

Let's turn to some health news now. An exciting development in the fight against Alzheimer's disease, data from a clinical trial show an experimental drug appears to counteract the effects of the disease. It's one of the first treatments to slow the decline of brain function in someone with Alzheimer's. But the trial also found some adverse effects were more common among people taking the drug.

And there are some issues thatthe doctors and patients are really going to have to talk about if this gets approved, and that is an if. This has not been approved yet. So, let's take a look at what the study found when they looked at this drug. So, they took about 1,800 people who had mild, sort of early stage Alzheimer's disease, ages 50 to 90. Split them in half, half of them got a placebo, half of them got the real drug. After 18 months -- so, it took a while for this to kick in. After 18 months, those who were taking the drug saw a 27 percent decline in -- a slower cognitive decline, I should say. In other words, there was still cognitive decline but it was 27 percent lower or slower than those who got the placebo. Also, their amyloid levels dropped. So, amyloid levels are -- amyloid is that plaque that gets in the brain of people with Alzheimer's. Now, here is the question. Are those improvements -- and there is no question that those are improvements. Are those improvements enough to really make the difference for someone with Alzheimer's? Will they feel those improvements? Will it make a difference in their daily lives? And you have to weigh that against the potential downsides. And here are the potential downsides. They did find some adverse effects. So, what they found was that folks who were taking the drug, 17 percent of them had brain bleeding and 12 percent had brain swelling. Now, folks who got the placebo also had those two things, but it was a much, much lower percentage. So, this is going to be something that the FDA will have to consider when they review this drug. It's expected that the FDA could be issuing some kind of decision within weeks. But on the other hand, in this study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the author said that longer studies need to be done. So unclear if the FDA is going to say, hey, you know what, guys, we're not ready to make a decision on this yet, or if they will make a decision soon. Rahel?",

Speaking of data, we got the GDP report today, the second estimate that showed it was an upward revision. But what got my attention was because it was an upward revision largely because of consumer spending. And, of course, we are just coming off of black Friday, we're coming off of Cyber Monday, where the consumer just continues to spend. On the one hand, it is a sign perhaps of consumer strength.

And as this publicity video shows, it can be used to cut corners on the racetrack. This limited edition model will be the last pure combustion engine Lamborghini to be released, as the company transitions to hybrid. Stephan Winkelmann is the CEO. Stephan, wonderful to have you today. So, lots to discuss. So, it's the last with a pure combustion engine, but the first sports car that's essentially an ATV.

And then in '24, with the hybridization of Urus and the complete new Huracan at the end of '24, we will accomplish what we promised. So, it is very easy. On the one hand, though, we have more sustainable car. In fact, we are going to reduce the Co2 emissions by 20 -- or stating from '25 in comparisons up today by 50 percent. And the promise we have to give to the customers, and this is something we will keep, is the fact that these cars are going to be more performing than the ones we have today. And the sound will stay. Then by the end of this decade, we will have the first full electric car, and for sure, here, in my opinion, the fun to drive will be there, the design will be very appealing as a true Lamborghini. And we are working also lot on not only the longitude and acceleration but what you call lateral acceleration, so how you get into the corners, out of the coroner's corners, so handling and, let's say, the opportunity to go also on roun tracks, on race tracks.

It will be more a GT (ph) car, so daily useable car, 2x2 with more luggage compartment. And then, the super sports cars, they will be at the beginning of the 30s. And I think, with the upcoming technology, and also all the things we have in mind, we will have also a new generation of car drivers, which will embrace this much easier.
