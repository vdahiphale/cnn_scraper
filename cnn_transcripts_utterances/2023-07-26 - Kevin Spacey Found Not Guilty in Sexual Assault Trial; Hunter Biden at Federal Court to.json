      "sentences": "Just moments ago, Rahel, and this has been a riveting case that has taken the jury nearly four weeks to hear what has been astounding evidence with Kevin Spacey defending himself against 12 charges that were brought forward by four men. Those were later dropped down to nine offenses. I'm speaking about very serious charges here, three counts of indecent assault, one count of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent, one count of causing a person to engage sexual, penetrative activity without consent. He has now been found not guilty of all of those charges, Rahel.This will, of course, be welcomed by Kevin Spacey and his lawyers. He has said throughout this trial that he welcomes his day in court. He welcomes the opportunity to defend himself. But, again, we are talking about very serious allegations that date back to the early 2000s and 2010s, a period in which Kevin Spacey was the artistic director of the Old Vick Theater here in London. The prosecutor, of course, bringing forward these accusations of by these four men who had been at the time aged in their 20s and 30s described Kevin Spacey as a sexual bully, saying he delighted in making others feel powerless. Of course, Kevin Spacey hit back in court, yes, I was a big flirt and a promiscuous person and went on to describe the encounters as simply romantic, fun, flirtatious and, again, denying all those charges, now, again, found innocent of all 12 of those charges. This will be huge for Kevin Spacey, who has said he hopes to be found innocent and he hopes to get his award-winning career back.",

      "sentences": "Now, the rules will not allow me to name those victims, Rahel, and that's very, very important. We are not going to identify them in any way. Again, these are alleged victims of sexual assault, so they absolutely cannot be identified by us. But these are four people who knew Kevin Spacey well. One of them was a driver who alleged that Kevin Spacey at one point, while sitting in his vehicle, grabbed his penis with such force that he screamed out in pain. This was an allegation dating back nearly 20 years ago.Another was a young actor also who was aspiring to learn, to have Kevin Spacey as a mentor. He described being drugged by Kevin Spacey. That was his allegation against this award-winning actor and said that oral sex was performed on him without his consent. Again, these are just absolutely horrifying and riveting tales. The prosecutor in this case brought these cases to life, brought them to a juror of 12. What the issue is, of course, when you're looking at these cases is that this jury needed to find Kevin Spacey guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And that seems to be the conclusion, of course, with them now finding him not guilty of any of these charges, that that was not the case, dating back to these charges. Again, some of them nearly 20 years old, very little physical evidence there. It really became a matter of he said-he said in court with the prosecutor trying to paint the picture of a powerful actor in a great position of influence. Of course, Kevin Spacey, as the artistic director of the Old Victor -- of the Old Vick, rather, who tried to take advantage of that position. Kevin Spacey and his lawyers hit back on that, saying that was absolutely not the case. Yes, he was a flirtatious person, yes, he was a person engaged in the youth scene here in London, but that he never, as he says, never engaged in anything untoward with these men.",

      "sentences": "That's right. We expect that the hearing is getting under way right now there at the federal courthouse in Wilmington. This is a five-year investigation. And in the end, what prosecutors are agreeing to as part of this deal with Hunter Biden is that he's pleading guilty to two misdemeanor counts related to his taxes, not paying them on time in 2017 and 2018.As part of this investigation, investigators also found that he had purchased a gun during a time that Hunter Biden says he was addicted to drugs and, therefore, making that purchase an illegal purchase. So, as part of that, he is going to agree to abide by certain conditions and at the end of which if he satisfies them and if the court is satisfied, the federal government will get rid of this felony gun charge. It's something that obviously -- this is a case, obviously, that has now become highly politicized. It's just a matter of where you think the politicization comes from. If you talk to Republicans, they believe that this investigation was politicized by people inside the Justice Department. Now, of course, they are making this the center of their effort to go after the current sitting president. What we expect, though, at the end of this, John, is that the prosecution is going to suggest that Hunter Biden serve no prison time as a result of this. Now, there's a very bizarre little sideshow that happened just in the last 24 hours where the federal judge who's overseeing this, a Trump appointee, by the way, she is very angry apparently that a member of Hunter Biden's legal team may have said something that caused a filing by Republicans to be taken down. So, we expect that that's going to be part of this court hearing as well, John.",

Consider what we've heard from IRS whistleblowers saying that there was political interference in this case. So, that is certainly an interesting move, but it fits with the political strategy we've seen from these House Republicans, which is that even if this signals the end of Hunter Biden's legal problems, it's not going to signal the end of the political headaches for Hunter Biden or for Joe Biden or for the rest of the Biden family.I mean, one thing that Republicans want is they want to get testimony from David Weiss, the U.S. attorney overseeing this probe. He said he would agree to testify in September or October. They want to know essentially what the avenues of investigation he covered included. They want him to answer more directly than he has in some of his letters so far about some of these allegations of political interference. And it's clear that this sort of fodder around the Biden family business dealings is building a potential campaign for Joe Biden impeachment. We've heard some of the most pointed words from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on this so far. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  If more of this continues to unravel, it rises to the level of an impeachment inquiry. What that simply provides is that the American public has a right to know. And this allows Congress to get the information, to be able to know the truth. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One, how did this take five years? I've not heard a reasonable answer for that from anybody. And just for the record, there's no way this case should have taken anything close to five years. Another big question is, did you, David Weiss, have complete control over this case or were there others pulling the strings? He has already said in a letter, I had complete control.
