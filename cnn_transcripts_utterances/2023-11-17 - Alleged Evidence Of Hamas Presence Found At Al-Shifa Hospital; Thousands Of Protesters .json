Israel says it has uncovered new evidence of Hamas' presence at the Al- Shifa hospital. The U.N. is demanding to see that evidence up close. And march of solidarity right now. Thousands of protesters are on their way to Jerusalem with one key demand -- bring the hostages home. And later, what do Ferragamo shoes, Botox and OnlyFans have in common? They're all things that were allegedly purchased by George Santos with campaign funds. We'll dive into the stunning allegations. All right, coming to you live from New York, I'm Zain Asher. I want to start with some stunning new details that we're getting from the Al-Shifa Hospital. Israel says it has uncovered new evidence that proves Hamas was indeed using Gaza's largest hospital as a hideout. The Israeli army actually put out this video, which it says is a tunnel entrance. It's essentially a shaft reinforced with concrete. You can actually see what appears to be, if you look closely in this video, exposed pipes and other rubble as well. I want to point out, though, that CNN cannot independently verify this video, but we have geolocated it to the hospital complex. Hamas, in terms of their response, they're calling this video and the IDF's claims overall they're calling it ridiculous. The Israeli army has also released this video as well, saying that troops found a booby-trapped car close to that tunnel and that it contained a large amount of weapons and ammunitions as you see here, laid out on the ground. Separately, the army says that troops recovered the bodies of two hostages near the hospital as well. A 65-year-old Israeli grandmother seen on your left and a 19-year-old corporal in the IDF, as well. Israeli Prime Minister is saying that it's possible other hostages were indeed held at Al-Shifa, as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health says that more than 11,400 people have been killed and that includes 4700 children. And that number is almost certain to rise, possibly even dramatically. The U.N.' World Food Programme warns that the entire population in Gaza -- that's more than two million people, by the way -- about half of them children, face the immediate possibility of starvation -- starvation. The WFP says that seven weeks into this war, food and water are practically non-existent. And some residents are forced to survive on about one meal a day. That's if they're lucky to even find that meal. A spokesperson for the U.N.'s Palestinian refugee agency -- children are pleading -- says that children are pleading for a sip of water and a piece of bread. Children are begging for water and bread at shelters across Gaza. Those aren't the only things that are running critically low right now. The shortage of fuel, also a massive problem, because that means that the food that does come in cannot be distributed. The WFP also says that the dwindling fuel supplies has meant that bread production across Gaza has pretty much come to a standstill. Local markets have shut down completely, and the U.N. is warning that the entire system is on the brink of collapse. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLKER TURK, U.N. HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS:  It would be catastrophic across all of Gaza, leading to the complete collapse of water, sewage and crucial healthcare services, and ending the trickle of humanitarian assistance that has been permitted to date. Massive outbreaks of infectious disease and hunger seem inevitable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And if you look at the amount oftrucks and convoys that were going in Gaza with the commercial sector before the conflict, it was around 450 trucks a day. Now, we have around 100 trucks a day with, like, probably 10 to 15 percent of it carrying food. Once this food gets inside, Gaza, there is the difficult, you know, journey of how we can get the fuel so that we can move these food supplies inside Gaza to where it's needed to go. Of course, the priority is for people who are in shelters. But, right now, the situation is terrible for everyone inside Gaza. No one has the luxury. Even if you have the money, you don't have access to food. The shops have run out. So, the choices are that you prioritize the people who are in shelters, you know, living in the open. But the reality is that the 2.2 million people in Gaza are in need of humanitarian assistance. And this is why it is extremely important that we have access through all border crossing points, not just through the Egyptian border. We need to get food supplies inside Gaza because the situation is at the breaking point.",

When we started on the 7th of October -- distribution of food assistance inside Gaza, we were using around 23 bakeries and we were giving fresh bread on daily basis to around 200,000 people who were in shelters. Now, none. And all of the 130 bakeries in Gaza, maybe one or two, if not at all any of them are operating. And that's because of the -- some of them have sustained damage but right now, it's the shortage of fuel that has brought all of these, you know, bakeries into complete standstill. Some people are burning coal to cook on it, but even these are like wood or whatever they can get their hands on. But that's really not, I mean, there's nothing that can make up for the fact that you need to run fuel for communication networks, for bakeries, for the transportation. In some days, the food supplies went in from the Egyptian side of the border. They got offloaded at the other side of the border and were left there for days waiting for trucks to come and pick this up.",
