But the unemployment rate ticked up slightly, rising above the 4 percent mark. I'd like to bring in CNN's Paula Newton to learn more on this. So we've got the jobs report. Even more than expected.

He also entered 10 Downing Street for the first time as its newest resident and started naming his cabinet. CNN's Max Foster is outside parliament in London. So, Max, again, this is history.",

They will switch between parties if they're unhappy with the status quo and what they're really feeling about cost-of- living crisis, which we're seeing across Europe. The way they expressed it was by booting out Rishi Sunak's Conservative party after 14 years, as you say, a crushing defeat for him. And a resounding victory for the Labour Party. So what we still have here is a centrist government. But we have one slightly to the left. Undertones, though here, you've got to remember, there have been benefits to the extremes here. So on the left, the Green Party gaining a few seats, which they haven't done before. And also the Reform Party on the hard right, led by Nigel Farage. He's also a quite well-known figure in Trumpian circles. But quite an extraordinary turnaround. And we were predicting something like this. But I think even Keir Starmer, when he met the king, was pretty shocked by it. If we show that video again, you can't really hear it, but we've had a close listen. And you hear the king saying, \"You must be utterly exhausted and nearly on your knees, a very grueling campaign.\" And then you hear Starmer saying, \"It's a very sort of quick changeover, isn't it?\" And the king says, \"The very least -- at the very least,\" that is, \"to get to grips with everything straight straightaway. Must be quite exhausting.\" Starmer says yes. And his big challenge is really unity, bringing together all those disparate groups that actually emerged through this campaign. Let's hear from him.

But if you see President Trump coming to power later in the year, I think there will be a difference.Because he would traditionally get on better with a Conservative prime minister. He's now got to Labour prime minister, who's firmly in support of Ukraine. He wants that campaign to continue. A lot of attention will emerge with Donald Trump, if he's saying that war has to end sooner rather than later. And Ukraine sometimes -- somehow loses out as a result of that. They're very different people. We'll see how that relationship evolves. But I think what you've got here in Europe, a set of key allies to America. A firm move to the right of politics here. But in the U.K., the center ground is held up. And I think that's made it a bit of an outlier here. So a bit more stability, perhaps, in one key ally, which is the United Kingdom.",

And first responders and law enforcement are trying to do their best to save lives.But I want to start with the response by U.S. Border Patrol because, according to a CBP official, they're just happened to be two off-duty officers from an elite unit, called Bohr Star, that happened to be on the beach. They were probably vacationing there at the right place at the right time. And they jumped into action. According to this official, these two agents ran into the water, pulled a victim out of the water and immediately started rendering aid. But the response was not just by land. It was also by air, according to Texas Department of Public Safety, Lieutenant Chris Olivares. He shared this video with us. Take a look. He says that this is the shark that was lurking in the water, that people we're afraid of, that attacked multiple people. How do they know that? Because their response was to try to maneuver that helicopter to keep that shark away from the shore. And so Olivares says that the helicopter pilot was flying very low, trying to keep that shark way until the threat was gone, until the shark swam away to deeper waters. Now, imagine being those beachgoers, imagine being a mother, and senior daughters in the water while the shark is in on the beaches of South Padre Island? Well, that's exactly what happened. Take a look at these photos. This mother posted photos on social media. The 18-year-old is the gal with the gauze around her leg. This mother says that her two daughters were in the water. They, all of a sudden, started screaming, running towards her. One of her daughters had blood running down her leg. She's says -- she said that the good thing is that both of her daughters are OK, but that it was a very scary and intense moment for this family and for the other beachgoers. Now, according to officials from South Padre Island, they say they're counting their blessings today because there were no fatalities. Back to you in the studio. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
