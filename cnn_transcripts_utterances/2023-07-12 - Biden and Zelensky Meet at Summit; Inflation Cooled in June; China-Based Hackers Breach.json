      "sentences": "Yes, Sara, we do expect President Biden and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to sit down for the first time for a private meeting here at the NATO summit in just a short while. But right before that we are anticipating that the president and other G-7 leaders will be appearing at an event to roll out what they've described as the joint declaration regarding Ukraine. And officials say that this will include the U.S. and other G-7 countries, laying out some long-term commitments that they are making towards Ukraine, security assurances that they are offering them to try to help them defend themselves in the current war, but also defend themselves and deter any future aggression that they could face from Russia.Now, this all comes as there had been so much tension heading into this summit around the prospect of NATO seeking membership - or of Ukraine seeking membership into NATO. The communique that was released by the NATO alliance yesterday fell short of the timeline that Zelenskyy did want to see put in place at this summit. But there were some issues in that communique that did remove one -- at least one of the barriers to -- for Ukraine to join the NATO alliance down the road. And NATO Secretary-general Stoltenberg said that they would invite Ukraine into the alliance once certain commitments had been made. Now, that's a point that President Biden has been making heading into this summit. He said that Ukraine was not ready to join at this time, in part because of that war in Russia and the fact that if they were to join that would then dive the NATO alliance into direct conflict with Russia. Additionally, the White House has been saying that they want to see these reforms, democratic, and on the security side made by Ukraine before they can be accepted into the alliance. So far they really haven't detailed exactly what those reforms would be, but that would be part of a pathway for Ukraine to join into NATO. But so much of this summit has been trying - been about trying to send a message to Russia, not just with support for Ukraine, but also when you think of the fact that they were able to expand the -- expected to expand the alliance with Turkey blocking their opposition to Sweden joining. And with these meetings coming up today, as the president and Zelenskyy are expected to sit face-to-face, officials say that they do anticipate that some of the disagreements might come up. But the president will be straightforward in explaining why he felt this way and took this position regarding Ukraine's members hip in NATO, and also listen to what Zelenskyy has to say. But what they are trying to focus on today is putting some of that tension behind them and focusing on what they can offer Ukraine in the here and now and also long-term down the road.",

Once again he's come into this summit almost messaging back home, butalso messaging all of the populations that Biden, Britain, European nations answer to, preparing them and also asking them, push your leaders, we need this now, we are under fire. And while he doesn't look like he's going to get that -- look, we've already got the concession of NATO is not going to make them go through the bureaucratic membership plan, which is a series of economic and other hoops that a country would have to jump through. And they're also talking about giving Ukraine Israel-style status, which is a huge security guarantee that is very different from, hey, remember going into this war, before the invasion started, President Biden was saying that Ukraine wasn't part of the United States' security strategic pantheon.

Do you think the fact that that is the case in Ukraine will push NATO to go even further in what is going to be given as we're expecting this major announcement this morning?BRIG. GEN. MARK KIMMITT, U.S. ARMY (RET.): No, not really. Kim makes an important point, that to become a NATO member there is a logical and rational membership action plan that all aspirates (ph) have gone through. You don't bring in Ukraine simply for security guarantees. But to get into NATO, you also have to meet certain economic, the resourcing, some pre-market ideals. In other words, the idea that you can't just join NATO by applying. You have to meet criteria to join the club. And they are eliminating these criteria, which many countries -- most countries have taken years to meet, to go straight to the heart of the issue, which is to bring in a security guarantee eventually for Ukraine, which is not simply a guarantee, but it's an obligation on the part of other countries to defend the land of Ukraine if attacked in the future. So, to me, it seems to be a logical responsibility and it seems to be a responsible way to bring Ukraine into NATO.",

Even if they offered Ukraine a path to membership, you saw how hard it was for Sweden to go because of Turkish and Hungarian objections. I can only imagine how many NATO members might balk at having Ukraine join right now when it would obligate them to send their troops against Russia.But what this agreement -- there's a side agreement that's being worked on between the G-7 and the U.S. and U.K. where they give multiple-year financial guarantees. We are going to keep giving you this kind of military aid. What that does is, one of the things that Ukraine has faced is shell hunger, not enough ammunition, artillery for the battlefield to keep this war up. And one of the problems is defense companies don't want to invest in very expensive factory production lines that can take a couple of years to build if this war is going to be won and done. Now that they've got this financial commitment coming up that there are going to be multiple-year buys from these countries with big pockets to keep supplying Ukraine, that means the defense industry can really ramp up. That's good for Ukraine. It's also bad for Russia because it means that capabilities available for all NATO members.",

And so you saw futures jump on this news, economists on Twitter are sort of raving about the news. But, yes, so 3 percent on an annual basis. As you pointed out, the lowest figure we have seen in quite some time. Compare that to 9.1 percent last year, which was the peak of inflation. So, part of this is that, right, the base is sort of very high and so we're seeing a lower figure now. On a month-over-month basis cases, the index - Kate, the index increased 0.2 percent. We got some help over the month from declines in areas like airline fares. We saw those prices went down. We saw used cars, those prices went down. Household furniture also going down. And if you look at the chart here, this is the annual increase over the last few years. Again, now we're at 3 percent, 9.1 percent a year ago was the peak. So, what a difference a year makes. Let's take a look at some categories specifically. Gas prices have really just come down quite a bit from last year, down 25 percent -- 26.5 percent to be clear. Food prices still much higher. So, if you're going to the grocery store and you feel like, I don't know, I mean things still feel more expensive than they have been, you're probably right. Still higher by 5.7 percent.

The White House and Microsoft say that email accounts at roughly 25 organizations, including a number of U.S. government agencies, were targeted in attempts to gain access to sensitive information. The full scope of what happened is under investigation right now.CNN's cybersecurity reporter Sean Lyngaas is following this story. You have some new reporting for us.

And that the State Department, according to a source, alerted Microsoft. And that's how this hunt began for the hackers.This kind of espionage is quite common. It's very narrow and targeted. They're looking for senior officials, we believe, who might have information that would be of interest to Beijing. And, of course, there's a lot of possibilities in terms of what the State Department is tracking that may be of interest to the Chinese government. But the Biden administration, the FBI, numerous agencies have been saying for months that the Chinese government is the most advanced cyberthreat in terms of nation state cyberthreats to the U.S. government. And this is another reminder of that. Now, Beijing routinely denies conducting cyberattacks and they, in turn, accuse the U.S. government of doing their own cyber espionage, which certainly happens. But this is another challenge for the administration that came to power facing a couple of cyber crisis with the Solar Winds hack from Russian hackers and another Chinese hack involving Microsoft that people have already forgotten about that occurred in the early months of the Biden administration. So, this is a really thorny challenge in terms of how to detect these stealthy attackers and then how to kick them out. And this is not - this is espionage. This is not violating any norms that we know of. I mean this is something that governments do. But, obviously, the Biden administration doesn't want these hackers in government systems, even unclassified systems, because it could reveal sensitive information that would help the Chinese government.",
