      "sentences": "Well, this has been a major shot in the arm for morale inside Ukraine, because you remember that, for months, it's been pretty much a stalemate, with Russia slowly gaining ground in the east of the country.Now that the Ukrainian forces have done this daring raid into part of Russia, into the Kursk region, they have captured the headlines inside Moscow. What's not clear, though, is, how long are they going to stay? It's an estimate -- estimated, say, 5,000 to 10,000 troops in there. That is not enough to hold that territory, but it could be enough to draw some of the top Russian troops away from the east of the country to try to push them out. That alone could give other Ukrainian troops a bit of relief, but, most of all, sends a message to the West, we're not out of this fight.",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly.As thinly stretched as the Russian forces apparently are along their eastern flank, they're entrenched in there, and they're going to have to pull some troops out to push this incursion out of Kursk. But that also means that Ukrainian troops are thinly spread. And so those 5,000 to 10,000 troops that we believe are inside Kursk had to come from somewhere, plus all the supplies to keep them there. The longer this goes on, it could be taking resources from other parts of the battlefield. But, at the same time, the one-note sort of scream in the West was, you guys are losing, you're losing. And from President Zelenskyy's point of view, countries that decide something that they're spending money on is not worth the time or the cost. They start to pull away. That's the vice president candidate J.D. Vance's point of view. And that's something that Ukraine can't afford. So this changes the channel.",

And, also, those strikes have hit a lot of infrastructure.So, sometimes, the capital, Kyiv, is without power for 12 or more hours a day. Seeing Ukrainian troops pulling down Russian flags is just a boost for everyone, especially coming, as we are, into winter, when it's going to be a lot colder and a lot tougher without that power supply.",

Other news we're following, Donald Trump's campaign is now blaming Iran for a hack on its headquarters over the weekend. Politico is reporting that it received anonymous e-mails with documents from inside the former president's campaign, including internal research on his V.P. nominee, Senator J.D. Vance. Let's bring in CNN's cybersecurity reporter, Sean Lyngaas. Sean, tell our viewers what you're learning.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, we have kind of seen this movie before, right?2016, the Russians hacked the DNC, the Democratic National Committee and others, and leaked documents to try to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign, according to the intelligence community. Now what we're seeing is what appears to be a hack and leak that certainly at least the Trump campaign is pointing to, to the finger at Iran on. Now, we're still waiting information from our sources in the federal government and elsewhere to sort of corroborate some of these claims. What we do know is that Microsoft, which obviously has a lot of visibility in cyberspace and their e-mail accounts are used everywhere, they have warned -- they did not specifically say the Trump campaign in their report, but they released a report last week saying a campaign was targeted by Iranian hackers. And we understand that that campaign was indeed the Trump campaign. Now, it gets a little murky where we try to connect the dots, right? There's this anonymous e-mail account that is e-mailing reporters, these documents, and then we have the Iranian cyber threat. But we're going to learn a lot more in the coming days, Wolf, about what exactly went down. We do know that this is, again, a little bit of a repeat of 2020, when the Iranians, according to the U.S. intelligence community, got a lot more aggressive in cyberspace to try to influence the election. They posed as the far right group the Proud Boys and e-mailed voters, trying to intimidate them. And that really caught some U.S. officials off guard at the time. Now we're going to see in the next few weeks how much we have learned in the four years since then about dealing with this threat and about how the media can play a role in sort of tamping down any panic, but also trying to get the facts out about what is going on behind the scenes, and that's what we're going to do, Wolf.",
