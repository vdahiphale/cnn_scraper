Damning new video obtained exclusively by CNN, showing a clear violence, assault by one of the biggest names in entertainment, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. Video showing him throwing his ex-girlfriend the ground, bragging her, kicking her. This was 2016. Why are we only seeing this tape now? And is Diddy going to remain untouchable? Plus, Israel confirms bodies found of three hostages held by Hamas. Their remains found in a tunnel. How the IDF made the discovery and what we know about how they were kidnapped. And the world's top golfer arrested just hours before he was supposed to tee off. What Scottie Scheffler now saying about the incident then ended up with him in handcuffs and a police detective in the hospital? (MUSIC) TAPPER: Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. The man who wants famously sang about being a bad boy for life is caught on tape, living up to that description in a horrifying way. A 2016 surveillance video exclusively obtained by CNN's Los Angeles bureau shows multi-millionaire rapper and producer Sean \"Diddy\" Combs appearing to violently assault his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. We're going to show that video to you in a moment. It's tough to watch. It's a beginning that matches Ventura's allegations in a federal lawsuit she filed in November, a lawsuit that's now been settled. That lawsuit, of course, opened the floodgates for even more lawsuits which ultimately led to a federal sex trafficking investigation into the 54 year-old artist. You might remember when Department of Homeland Security agents raided Diddy's Miami home and his Los Angeles home back in March. What you do not remember is Diddy being charged with a crime, because that never happened? Diddy, a multimillionaire, has denied a multitude of allegations against him related to Ventura and to others who claimed they were subjected to parties that he threw that turned into nightmares, where they were drugged. Some raped. They threw up. They passed out. The new surveillance video matches Ventura's story and it raises more questions about what exactly goes on inside Diddy's world. What is he getting away with? And whether he will face with any consequences? CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister is all over the story. Elizabeth, you're going to show us the video, but first, give us some context on what we're about to see.",

So, John, Cassie filed her lawsuit in November. The feds raided Diddy's home in March now, we see this awful video which is more than 8 years old.

So we got records of the police calls to that apartment complex, and indeed, there were no reports of any disturbances over the past 17 months to Airman Fortson's unit. However, there were about ten calls since August to a neighboring apartment on the same floor. So it sort of raises even more questions about whether the deputies went to the correct department even though, you know what happened may have happened no matter which apartment he want to, it's still important for law enforcement authorities to get all the facts before they start firing their weapons.",

And just days before Biden's 2021 inauguration, pictures from \"The New York Times\" article show the upside-down flag, January 17, 2021. It is generally a distress symbol that's been used a number of times throughout political history with the election of Trump, with the election of Obama and on and on.At that point in time, \"The New York Times\" asserts that the upside- down flag was a symbol of the Stop the Steal movement. With us now is CNN's Joan Biskupic. Joan, Shannon Bream reached out to Alito himself and seem to get more of a response, I guess he gave \"The New York Times\" an email to answer, but spoke with Shannon Bream on the phone. And she says, Justice Alito told her that the upside-down flag was in response to a neighborhood sign that was anti-Trump and then maybe even a different sign that was anti-Alito. I don't know. And that is wipe is the one who put the flag upside down. What do you know about this?",

In fact, what he told Shannon Bream of Fox News was also that it was an expletive with Donald Trumps name that especially incited his wife, Martha Ann, and that she was the one and put it up.Look, this happened three years ago, but it's especially salient right now because of cases that the justices are considering. And as you know, Jake, judicial ethics rule say that if a justices impartiality should can be reasonably question, he or she should sit out the case. So that's why it's drawn so much attention. But let me tell you what Samuel Alito said in a statement. I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag. It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs. He said it was their only briefly and his essentially just tried to brush it away. TAPPER: So the reporting doesn't come in a bubble, we should note. But as you alluded to, there are two election-related cases in front of the Supreme Court, right now, and there is sitting U.S. senator, Democrat who says Alito shouldn't be involved in these cases. He should recuse himself.",
