Defiant mourners are chanting \"no to war\" as Alexei Navalny is laid to rest. The judge in Florida picks apart Donald Trump's schedule in his classified documents case. We are live from New York, new month has arrived. It is March. It is March 1st, I am Richard Quest, I mean business. Good evening. We begin with our business agenda and Elon Musk, who is taking open AI to court in a fight that really is at the heart of the future of AI. Musk's lawsuit is accusing AI and its CEO some element of abandoning their founding purpose. It was created as a nonprofit, and it was to develop AI for the benefit of all humanity. Now, the reason he has standing is he helped start OpenAI and left in 2018. Now, it operates as a for profit entity, and is valued around $90 billion. There is no comment yet on the lawsuit. Clare Duffy is with me. All right, so they went from nonprofit to profit, but what gives Musk the right to say I'm going to sue?",

Elon Musk has been raising his frustrations that this company that he helped to found has sort of abandoned in his mind, its founding mission and its founding organizational structure, and that is what has become the basis of this lawsuit. Musk is alleging that by making its most advanced AI model private and available for purchase, OpenAI is essentially avoiding, it is essentially letting go of this founding document. And I want to read to you a bit from this founding document, which is included in the lawsuit. It was written in 2015 and it lays out that OpenAI would be a nonprofit corporation developing AI technology and interestingly, it says here: \"The resulting technology will benefit the public and the corporation will seek to open source technology for the public benefit when applicable. The corporation is not organized for the private gain of any person.\" But Richard, I think the key here and my big question is if Elon Musk were still involved with this company, if he were still making money from OpenAI, if he were the one making money, I should say from OpenAI, if you were getting credit for this game-changing technology, what do you have a problem with this in quite the same way?

What Musk is seeking here is, you know, there is some financial damages, but he is the richest person in the world. What he really wants is an order that will force open AI to make all of its technology, all of its research, open to the public and to no longer financially benefit from this technology, and that I think really could undermine OpenAI's business and also the business, this huge ambitious AI business that Microsoft has built on the back of OpenAI's technology.",

We still don't know a lot about the true corporate structure of OpenAI, the true -- you know how this partnership with Microsoft is structured and I think that's one of the really interesting things that we all could get out of this lawsuit, if it makes it to discovery is more information about how OpenAI is structured, and how this partnership with Microsoft works -- Richard.",

He said this is equivalent to the US trying to pull out all the stops. And yes, I think inherent in that statement is that Israel isn't doing enough. You know, we know that senior US officials have been putting and trying to put a ton of pressure on their Israeli counterparts to do more. We've seen this with USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who has been in the region, meeting with the Israeli prime minister and the defense minister, and putting all of these ideas out there, including opening up more humanitarian aid corridors, the airdropping of aid that just got announced, that's been an idea that's been out there for a while. So the pressure has been on Israel from really all sides to do more. And again, I think this announcement sort of underscores that the Biden administration clearly feels like the situation is completely untenable and the US had to intervene in this way. The question, of course, is whether this will end up making that much of a difference. I think a lot of experts would say this is akin to sort of a Band-Aid on a problem, and that is I think why it's so important that in these same remarks, the president called for a \"immediate ceasefire.\" And he talked once again about this negotiation that is ongoing to --",

So how can you do it in a way that ensures their safety? I mean, that is going to be a big question. Clearly, the calculation was made, though, that doing this is better than not doing it, and particularly the situation that we saw yesterday that you were just talking about, where just the incredibly tragic scene of dozens and dozens of people dying, because they were simply clamoring to get their hands on food, and aid and other just life necessities. They were trampling over each other so that they could feed themselves and feed their family. So yes, none of this is tenable. And again, as I was just saying, I think the focus is all the much more on the hostage negotiations and the ceasefire deal. The fact that the president is talking about a ceasefire, calling for an immediate ceasefire, when I think even just a few weeks ago, the word ceasefire was one to be avoided in Washington, I think that actually speaks remarkable volumes as well.",

Who cares what they did in that relationship? How does it impair, impact, affect or otherwise, deal with indictment against Mr. Trump and now 14 co-defendant? Why do I say 14, Richard? That's because four have already pled guilty, and including three of his that is the former president's election attorneys. And so it's a very good point, right, in your question, which is that notwithstanding the theater, and the reality TV that we're seeing, playing out with regard to who she was with, and when and what they did, does it impair, affect, or influence the integrity of the indictment, the nature of the evidence, the competence of the evidence, the strength of the evidence, that's what the case is ultimately all about.

When I talk from the beginning, when I talk about the integrity of theproceeding, what happens is, is that when a defendant is indicted, there is a process. In this particular instance, 18 defendants were indicted, plus Trump, what is that process? That process is a grand jury. A grand jury is composed of citizens from that locality in Georgia, their job is not to assess guilt or innocence, their job is twofold. Is there a probable cause to believe that a crime was committed, and that the defendants before the grand jury committed it? After a grand jury indicts, the defense attorneys get discovery. That's information that speaks to the alleged guilt of their clients, they review that and make certain challenge motions. This is one of them. It's an evidentiary hearing. And then ultimately, the case goes to trial. When or if a case goes to trial, you get to establish if you're the prosecutor, if you do beyond a reasonable doubt, there's guilt. That's the proceeding. That's the way it should be. Now, having addressed that issue, that's what the case is. All this theater, this case is about the issue of subversion of an election in Georgia allegedly by the defendants. That's the hearing. That's the process, as it should play out, very quickly, Richard. This, however, goes to show this being the preceding we are hearing, Fani Willis, she's the prosecutor in Georgia, she was involved with the special prosecutor prosecuting the Trump case. What if any effect did that have on a case? That's the ultimate issue. Now the judge has to make a determination of whether there was a relationship and should the indictment be thrown out? Should Fani Willis be thrown off of the case and leave the indictment to stand and another prosecutor be appointed to prosecute the case? All of that is fair game for this proceeding.",

This is all done. Let's have a do over. That's the issue. The judge can do that. In the event that that's the case, Richard, what will end up happening is, is that this special counsel in Georgia would appoint a special prosecutor. The timeline of the case moving forward would be impaired because obviously a new prosecutor can look at it anew. They will then present the case, again, if they chose to, to another grand jury. I have already explained that process. By majority vote, they decide is there a reasonable cause to believe a crime was committed that they committed it, and then the case would go forward. That all is what the Trump team would love, because that would push it way back well into 2025. The election would be over. And by the way, I think that's the play here, to push this back, move this off, get it off the table any way you can, that would be a huge win for Trump's team and the defense.",
