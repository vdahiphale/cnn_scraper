And a warning, this video from the World Health Organization shot during the last couple of days is hard to watch. Doctors Without Borders warns that a handful of medical staff at Nassar Hospital in Khan Younis don't have enough supplies. The aid group, MedGlobal, tells CNN there's absolutely no room in the hospital whatsoever. And an investigation is now underway into some U.N. workers who were allegedly involved in the Hamas terror attack. Israel claims there were staff members with the U.N. Relief and Works Agency. That's the group that helps Palestinian refugees in Gaza. The agency says it has fired those accused while it looks into the allegations so it can continue its vital humanitarian work. The White House says there is no imminent prospects of a deal for Hamas to release its hostages. The talks are said to be productive, but not yet successful. Our Scott McLean is live in Istanbul with more on all of this. Scott, good to have you with us. I want to start first with those serious allegations by Israel about the U.N. workers being involved in the Hamas terror attack. What are you learning?",

But we don't know who they are or precisely what their involvement may have been.But this is already having big impacts on the U.N. agency that is an essential component of the humanitarian response to the war in Gaza right now. And frankly, also a very important critical component of day-to-day life in the Palestinian territories. This organization has been around for more than 70 years, created specifically to cater to the needs of Palestinian refugees and now several generations of their descendants. The U.N. or UNRWA put out a statement yesterday, as you mentioned, saying that those 12 people have had their contracts terminated while they look into this. This has been a welcome step for many observers. But just this morning, we're learning that Australia is cutting funding for the organization, at least for now. We know that the United States State Department is pausing additional funding for UNRWA as well. And this organization, frankly, has been a lightning rod of criticism in Israel and the United States in recent years. In 2018, it was the Trump administration that actually cut off United's -- American funding for the group, which it relies on heavily. Because not only does it draw some money from the U.N. regular budget, but primarily it relies on voluntary donations from U.S. -- U.N. members. The United States is obviously a very big one. In 2021, the Biden administration restored that funding, but that hasn't stopped criticism coming from Republicans. The ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jim Risch, said in a statement yesterday, for years, I have warned the Biden administration about resuming funding to UNRWA, which has a history of employing people connected to terrorist movements like Hamas. Today's news is yet another example that underscores how corrupt this organization truly is. We're also hearing criticism from Israel. Here's the -- an adviser to the Israeli prime minister. Listen.

They can't be a party to the case.And so, this put the court in an almost impossible situation, in my view, of being asked to order a ceasefire when both parties that would be a party to that ceasefire aren't within its authority. Now, it's really interesting, I think, that we see these different interpretations of what the court has said emerging. And it really mirrors the fact that we have two completely different narratives out there about this entire case and this conflict in the first place. So, South Africa's position has been, yes, the court didn't order a ceasefire, but in practice, it should be understood as a de facto ceasefire, because that's the only way that Israel will be able to meet its obligation to deliver humanitarian aid. Israel says, no, the court's just asking us to do what we already are supposed to be doing under the Genocide Convention, and we -- our position is that we are completely in compliance with the Genocide Convention. I think the real way to read the court's decision is somewhere in between these two understandings, and that's that the court is directing Israel to show far greater restraint in the military campaign. That doesn't mean the operations have to completely stop, but the court and the world that is watching is going to expect Israel to find ways to moderate its approach in meaningful ways.

That is the punishment phase for Trump, which they were sending a clear message to Trump and agreeing with Carroll's attorneys closing arguments.

The month before October 7th had been the happiest of times for the family, celebrating Sara's engagement and Mohammed's graduation from university. KHREIS (through translator): My mother was going to be 58 years old on December 30, and had her grandson with her. So, why would you shoot her? What's between you and her? You made us feel like it's safe to leave. We had white flags on our hands. So, what happened? Nobody knows. Nobody knows. WARD (voice-over): It is a question many are asking as more videos have emerged of unarmed civilians displaying white flags apparently shot dead. The Geneva based Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor tells CNN they are investigating nine such incidents. We analyzed four. The most widely reported is the shooting of the three Israeli hostages with the IDF admitted killing under the mistaken impression that their surrender was a trap. The most recent incident, just this week in Mawasi, in Southern Gaza. 51- year-old Ramsey Abusahu (ph) says he is trying to get back to the house where his brother is being held by Israeli forces to plead for his release. The camera zooms in on two Israeli tanks beyond a berm. A drone can be heard overhead. Ramsey (ph) and four other family members move tentatively forward, hands in the air, white flag held high, then suddenly a burst of gunfire, Ramsey (ph) falls to the ground. If you slow down the video, you can see the impact, the first round against the wall, clearly fired from the direction of the tanks. The men hastily drag Ramsey's (ph) body away, the white flag now soaked in blood. His wife runs after him, but he is already dead. Another video obtained by CNN was recorded by journalist, Rami Abu Jamous, on November 10th. He says the IDF ordered his family to evacuate their home and to carry white flags. As they walk, gunshots can be heard. On the other side of the street, a man is wailing over the body of his dead son. I told you, let's stay home my son, he says over and over, still clutching his white flag. If only we had stayed home. Around the corner, two more people shot, also carrying white flags. CNN cannot say who fired the shots. We sent the coordinates of all the incidents to the IDF and repeatedly asked for comments. Hala Khreis was buried in a shallow grave in a small alleyway next to the family home. Her gravestone written in chalk. Her family hopes there will be justice for her killing and a proper burial when this war is finally over.",

Other protests bogged down roads in other parts of the country. Unions representing the farmers accused the government of not doing enough to help them cope with low food prices and excessive regulations.Later in the day, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal announced some relief measures, but the head of the biggest farming union dashed hopes for a swift end to the protests, calling for continued mobilization.

But we got a brief statement from Buckingham Palace, saying he has been admitted for this scheduled treatment.Also saying that his majesty would like to thank all of those who sent their good wishes over the past week, and that the king is delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness. What he's referring to there is that the palace didn't necessarily need to reveal that he had an enlarged prostate because it didn't have a huge public interest as head of state. But the king wanted to release that information to encourage other men to go and get themselves checked. And it did have that effect, because there was large increase in inquiries to the National Health Service about enlarged prostates off the back of the king's announcement. A source has told me that the king has gone to visit the Princess of Wales who's in hospital for abdominal surgery. She's in recovery at the moment. The king went to see her before his own surgery. We believe they're in the same hospital. I don't think we're going to get any more information. A source saying they're not going to reveal any more details about the treatment that the king is receiving. Whilst they accept, they need to reveal some medical details, they do think there's a line there. And at some point, they start invading their privacy. Max Foster, CNN London. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
