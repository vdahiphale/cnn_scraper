Trump had a little bit more to say even yesterday, as he exited court, about one witness in this case, Michael Cohen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The things he got in trouble for were things that had nothing to do with me. He got in trouble. He went to jail. This had nothing to do with me. This has to do with the taxicab company that he owned. And when are they going to look at all the lies that Cohen did in the last trial? He got caught lying in the last trial. So he got caught lying, pure lying. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think what we will hear is that he violated, that is the former president, a specific gag order which precluded, prevented, prohibited him from speaking about certain things, namely witnesses, namely the jury, less so I think he has cooled off a bit in terms of family members, but the prosecution is concerned and they should be. You know, it is one thing to have an election and certainly people in a democracy can decide their leaders. It is another thing to have rhetoric that can put people in danger and we are (ph) just such an entrenched aside (ph) different points of view, so it is important to know, Amara, when we speak about the gag order, the context is the protection and preservation not only of the process, but the safety of witnesses.And so the prosecutors want to hold Mr. Trump accountable for violating the order. I think what we could expect today is accountability. I think that prosecutors will lay out the specific instances in which they believe Trump violated the order. They will ask the judge, as they noted, to fine Mr. Trump $4,000, the maximum permitted under New York State law for the violations of those orders. And the judge has a number of options with respect to either, A, admonishing Mr. Trump and saying, hey, just don't do that again; B, imposing fines and see the most drastic step would be jail time, but it is very serious. It is the first test of this judge to control the temperament and the tenor of this trial. And so, the judge has to do something, Amara, to get teeth to that order. Otherwise, Mr. Trump will continue to violate it with no consequences.",

Jean Carroll, the defamation. He is uninhibited, unimpeded. He just speaks away. So, does money have an impact on him? Potentially not.And so, the question really is, does the judge enter into that third step, which is jail. Now in saying that, the judge certainly, he has the option up to 30 days under the statute. I don't expect that to happen. Will he put Mr. Trump in for a few hours maybe to make his point clear? That is even (inaudible) maybe Trump wants that for political reasons, but I think the judge needs to do something.

The prosecution is going to be about he is reliable witness, but don't just rely on Mr. Pecker, don't just rely on Cohen, don't just rely on Stormy Daniels, rely on the hard evidence and that's why I pivot back to a check signed by Donald J. Trump. Who was it to? Mr. Cohen. What was it for? To kill that story. Why did they do it? To boost his election prospects. And there you go, you have your falsifying business records for the purpose of concealing or engaging in other type of illegal activities. That gets in that conviction. That of course is what the prosecution wants to do, whether they are able to do it will depend upon the compelling nature or lack thereof of the witnesses, Amara, moving forward.",

But of course, we have seen over the course of the past week, what at times have been tense pro-Palestinian protests, some coming in the form of very peaceful and in solidarity with Gaza, others though, at times, anti-Semitic and even violent in their messaging in nature.But in particular that contrast has been from the campus -- from the students -- from the protests, I should say, that have originated from those on-campus versus those fueled from off-campus, especially organizers of student protests have tried to distance themselves from those coming from off-campus saying that those individuals are inflammatory and do not represent what is being put forward here. Now, of course, yes, there have been protests that have stemmed to campuses across the country here in the northeast, like Yale, even New York University, NYU further down in Manhattan here, where students and professors were arrested after NYU called in the police department to clear out essentially the Plaza were protesters gathered. But all the way to the West Coast as well, you mentioned some of those schools, Cal Poly, we have seen also protests in the Midwest, at University of Michigan, all around, this pro-Palestinian movement wave that, of course, started here at the very least, this most recent wave seem to stem from last week when Columbia University's president testified in front of the U.S. House in D.C. around how they are handling anti-Semitism that also coincided when we saw encampments begin by students here at Columbia to protest and encourage Columbia University you to divest from corporations they say support Israeli apartheid and genocide.

And so that meant students were arrested and it prompted a walkout of faculty yesterday in support those students, asking them to clear their arrest records.

In the coming hours, the U.S. Senate is expected to hold procedural votes on a foreign aid package that includes roughly $61 billion for Ukraine. It was approved on Saturday by the House of Representatives. And if passed by the Senate, U.S. President Joe Biden has promised to sign it. Ukraine, which desperately needs western weapons as its military is struggling to contain Russia's invasion, has praised the House's passage of the legislation over the weekend. But the Kremlin also had a message. It says the new aid won't change anything on the battlefield. But as CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports, Ukrainian see the renewed U.S. support as a sign of hope.

So that first hour-and-a-half or so, will be Judge Merchan holding this gag order hearing. What do we expect from that? BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. It is like what you kind of laid out for the viewers, Amara, essentially reminding, again viewers that at the end of March, this gag order was placed on Donald Trump, essentially saying he couldn't talk disparagingly about how members of the court staff, their family members, the jurors, also witnesses. And in a filing just last week, the prosecution says Donald Trump has violated this ten times and they'd like that he be fined $1,000 for all the times the judge finds that he might have done that. They also in their filing have said that they want the court to remind Trump that he is a criminal defendant in this case, and that means that he is subject to court's supervision. So they are basically saying, hey, you are a criminal defendant. If you violate these gag orders, you could also possibly go to jail. So they want that to be said in the open court. Now, Trump from his defense team essentially said, all these times that he has posted on social media, these tweets that come into question, this is the only way that he can actually defend himself, especially against particular witnesses who they say like Michael Cohen, that is a main witness in this trial and Trump has gone on social media against him, and they say that it has nothing to do with this trial. This has to do with his campaign. But these are the arguments that are going to come up during that gag hearing.

And that is really going to have ripple effects throughout the campaign as the candidates continue to make their political arguments against one another. You know, as you said before, Trump trying to make the case that because he is making an argument in the court of public opinion as part of his political campaign, that that is somehow separate from the legal requirements of being a defendant. But they are intertwined. They are one and the same.And so, I think the other takeaway from yesterday as David Pecker began to take the stand and we expect him to come back on the stand today and continue to testify, for so many Americans, this is raising those memories of the 2016 campaign. This story was intertwined with the 2016 campaign. It reminds people of sort of all the tawdry scandals of that time. And so I think for a lot of people, it is going to really refresh their memories about the things Donald Trump was accused of at that time, whether for better or worse. Maybe for some people, this is a reminder of the ways that he has always been in his telling victimized by the legal system.

There is a bit of a cover up there, all sorts of conspiracy theories emerge.So what they did this time was simply released this picture taken by Kate, who is recovering or is being treated for cancer, and put it straight onto their social media accounts. I think they're taking control of their content. I think they're taking control of their narrative a bit more here, and they are also trying to be as open and honest, but that will go into (ph) these pictures, so they can avoid those conspiracy theories.

She is also well enough to have a discussion about whether or not this photo should be released. So think nothing negative to read here.It seems pretty positive and they'd be telling us if she had taken a turn for the worse. So, I think we can be hopeful.",
