He has questioned the relevance of the NATO alliance. And he said that America might not defend NATO allies who are not contributing enough to the NATO alliance. And then National Security Adviser Mike Waltz or President-elect Trump's proposed National Security Adviser put out a tweet on X afterwards saying that a strong NATO that is able to deter attacks is one where every country is putting in its fair share.

So if you have some flexibility in the travel, maybe wise to kind of keep an eye on the forecast.So let's take a look at what we've got. We start with today. You'll notice most of the eastern half of the country, smooth sailing here. No real issues. Today, the focus is going to be out west. We have multiple systems that are going to be coming in. The first one starting today, then another one coming in on Monday. And so it's going to be day after day of watching these systems as they traverse across the country. Here's now a look. Fast forwarding to Monday, the big issues are going to be across the Midwest, but then also taking a look out to the west. You've got separate systems there that we're going to be keeping an eye on as well. Now we fast forward late into Tuesday. You can see that system in the east really starts to expand. So now you have those rain showers beginning to creep up into portions of the southeast, but also still along the Great Lakes in the Northeast. The secondary system out to the west now starting to spread into the Rockies, bringing rain and snow to much of Eastern Colorado. That system there, that's going to be the big concern as we go into the middle portion of the week, because now we fast forward into late Wednesday that really starts to take shape across the central portion of the country. And by Thursday, you're looking at most of the East coast, top to bottom, looking at the rain showers. That is the forecast for Thursday. But the big question is, what about the parade? Unfortunately, it looks like we may have some shower chances, guys, on the latter end of those parade hours. And you're going to need to bundle up temperatures at the warmest in the low 40s.",

But let's just serve up a little bit of presidential history here. The rumors of the first presidential turkey pardon date back to the Lincoln administration when the president's young son asked him to spare his pet turkey from the Thanksgiving table. And then in the Wilson administration in 1920, a pair of turkeys from Texas and Kentucky duked it out here at the White House, according to newspaper reports from the Time. But the first documented turkey pardon, as we know it today, happened in 1963 during the Kennedy administration.

We're talking about more than 72,000 pounds of meat and poultry ready to eat products. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the contaminated products have caused at least 11 illnesses in four states, nine hospitalizations and the death of a baby. Some of those illnesses were reported in California, two in Illinois, and one each in New York and New Jersey, according to the CDC. The Department of Agriculture says some of the products included in the recall are Yu Shang brand cooked chicken, Chinese brand spicy duck necks, and braised pork belly in brown sauce, among others. In a statement, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service reported that the problem was discovered after performing routine testing and follow up activities of finished product by Yu Shang Food in late October. The USDA says the recalled products tested positive for listeria monocytogenes. Additional testing confirmed the presence of listeria and those products, as well as environmental samples collected by FSIS. The USDA says that consumption of food contaminated with L monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Some of the symptoms include fever, muscle aches, headaches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. Yu Shang said in a statement to CNN that although the woman reported eating the company's product before she became ill, there was no proof, they said, that they were the cause. Officials say if you bought any of these products, you should throw them away or return them to the place of purchase. Earlier this year, officials reported other listeria outbreaks, including last month and contaminated salmon being sold at Costco and over the summer involving Boar's Head deli meat. Victor, Amara?",

As you noted, we've heard from some other major retailers that they're expecting strong shopping from our own forecast for this season and what we're hearing from shoppers on the ground right now is that they're excited for the holidays. They have product in stock. They're expecting to go out and spend. And we're actually looking forward to record numbers of turnout around busy times of the year like Thanksgiving weekend.So, we're expecting steady growth and maybe even sales as large as up to $989 billion for the last two months of the year.",

But there's telling us that they're spending a little bit more than last year, especially on gifts.Of course, they're looking maybe to save a little bit where they can. So, we're seeing certainly people taking advantage of early online deals, shopping across a lot of different retailers. We know today's consumer, today's customer goes out and does a lot of research, they're reading reviews, they're price comparing and that shopper is coming to you very, very knowledgeable. And they're also, you know, heading to thrift stores, heading to secondhand shops, heading to discount retailers. You've got a shopper today who is not afraid to go to a lot of places, whether that's online or heading to stores to make sure that they can find the best items for the season.",

But if shoppers are feeling a little uncertain of whether they should buy now or hold off, we're also seeing a lot of retailers saying, hey, don't feel too worried. We'll price match. If this goes down later in the season, if you see a Black Friday deal on our site, that's a little better than what you saw say in earlier in November or October, we will honor that. So, you're seeing that assurance as well on the part of retailers because they know people want that great price.",

And two of those, 21st ranked Arizona State and 14th ranked BYU. Here now, Arizona State at five with the ball in the final minute, but on fourth down with seven seconds left. Quarterback Sam Leavitt launches the ball out of play to try and run out the rest of the time. Sun Devil students rushing the field to celebrate. The stadium crew started tearing down the goalposts. But after review, the officials determined that the ball touched a fan in the crowd with one second left.So, instead of game over, it is BYU ball. Meaning, that everybody had to get off the field. And when they finally did, this happened, BYU heaving the ball towards the end zone and amazingly, it's caught. But the receiver gets tackled two yards short of the score. So, here come the students once again. Arizona State holding on 28-23. Seventh ranked Alabama, one of the teams on the losing end of things, the tide held to just a field goal on the road at Oklahoma 24-3 the final. And after an impressive last few weeks, Bama couldn't move the ball. Jalen Milroe under pressure all night. They couldn't stop the run either. Alabama losing three games for the first time since 2010, putting them in serious jeopardy, if not eliminating them from the playoff race. Colorado's hopes of playing for the Big 12 title, taking a big blow courtesy of Kansas, who beat a ranked opponent for the third straight week. Jayhawks running back Devin Neal gashing Colorado's defense for 280 total yards and four touchdowns in the 37-21 win. Under the lights at Yankee Stadium, Notre Dame tasked with taking down one of the most surprising teams in college football this season. 19th ranked Army and the Irish did just that thanks to a big running night and some shutdown defense, handing Army their first loss of the season, 49-14 in the Bronx. And we end with the much-hyped battle between fifth ranked Indiana and number two Ohio State. The Hoosiers coming in 10 and 0 for the first time in school history, but also facing a ranked opponent for the first time in the season. They were on the road in front of more than 100,000 fans, no less. And they did hang in there for a half. But the ending was familiar in this one. Ohio State taking advantage of special teams miscues the big one, a return punt 79 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter. So, the Buckeyes win 38-15. And after the game, Indiana coach Curt Cignetti was asked if he thought his team still belonged in the 12-team field. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
