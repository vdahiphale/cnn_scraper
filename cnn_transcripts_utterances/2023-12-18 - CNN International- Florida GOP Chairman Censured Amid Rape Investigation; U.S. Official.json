(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC CAPUTO, U.S. NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, THE MESSENGER: They're going to come back in a month and vote to officially kick him out of office. They had to do it in this two-step fashion, according to their rules. All of the Republican members that I spoke to and that the other media spoke to, were just surprised that Ziegler just didn't quit. He showed up at the meeting. He apologized. Sorry for putting you guys through this, but I'm staying, he told them. And so, then they started the motions censoring him, stripping him of his authority, taking away his ability to get reimbursed for travel. So, like the mileage driving between Sarasota, where he lived, and Orlando, where they held the meeting. He's not going to get that. Sending his salary to a dollar. One of the members, Rep. Michelle Salzman, the state rep, said, I don't know what he's doing here. No one really does. But he is. He says he's innocent and that if he resigns, it'll look like a sign of guilt. And therefore, he's saying you're going to have to kick me out. And so, the Florida GOP is saying, OK, we'll take that deal. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Seen here in this Hamas propaganda video, which was also posted by the Israel Defense Force. They are reinforced with concrete, too. Two years ago, Hamas claimed to have built 500 kilometers, more than 300 miles of them. The tunnels are spread all over Gaza. This map over two years old.

There could be hostages in those tunnels. There are very few details about how precisely the water is getting into the tunnels. How much water? How fast it's going in?
