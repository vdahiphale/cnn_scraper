Just ahead, a fire tragedy that's still unfolding in Johannesburg after a blaze broke out in a five story building killing at least 73 people that are the live report from the scene.Tropical storm Idalia brings heavy rain to North Carolina after leaving a trail of destruction in Florida. And there may have been eight military coups in West Africa, Western Central Africa in the past three years with Gabon being just the latest. We'll take you through what's sparking them all. Well this hour Johannesburg firefighters are going through the charge remains of a building that caught fire. At least 73 people lost their lives and dozens more were injured when flames engulf what authorities they're call a hijack building. That's usually an abandoned building taken over by groups who lease it to people who can't afford to live elsewhere. No word yet on what started the deadly blaze. David McKenzie is in Johannesburg joins us live and as you appear on air, the number seems to be going up, David.",

I've been speaking to survivors about the terrible experience they went through. Firefighters are in this area they're trying to recover the buddies have been laid out on the streets. They've been forensic teams here trying to start the difficult and painful process of identifying those who were killed in this fire once about it from Malawi describe how it was when the blaze started. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WISEMAN MPEPA, FIRE SURVIVOR: People were making noise, yelling 'Fire! Fire! Fire', and when I woke up I actually see the gate, I saw the fire. After that I come back into my room, and then I broke the window. When I broke the window my head entered but my body has not entered. So I come back in the gate the fire is full.

Really speaks to deep inequality in this country and what people have to do especially migrants from the rest of Africa to try and survive. And if you look at this inferno behind me and as a result of this, there are going to be many questions asked just how this happened and why the loss of life was just so dramatic, Max.",

And I think that was essentially what they were looking at, given how difficult the conditions are to the south of here, where that counter offensive has been making progress beyond Robotyne.Towards one village to the east, one village to the south, it is extremely slow going. What we're hearing is that the Russian forces are counter attacking very viciously. There are extra reserves being brought and Russia is really putting up a fight not to give an extra inch of terrain. And this is what some Ukrainian sources have been saying what a month of fighting this last month in these areas have shown is that this is not going to be given up without a fight. Still, they look at every inch, every meter that they managed to take as a success. They are looking to get to the Russian defensive lines. And of course, this is going to continue to be extremely hard going and I think what you've seen this week, these increased drone attacks on Russian soil. And again, Ukrainians neither confirm nor deny them. But they do accept more broadly, when you listen to officials, that this has been a tendency that the war has increasingly shifted to Russian soil. And again this week after that most the largest attack, as you mentioned, Tuesday night to Wednesday morning largest drone attack on Russian soil since the start of the war. What we heard was from an advisor to President Zelenskyy, that this was something that is happening and that something that could not be stopped this bringing of the war to Russian soil. And so you've seen according to the Bryansk Governor, those three drones are heading towards Bryansk that sabotage operation that Russia claims was headed by Ukrainian secret services. Again, neither a denial nor a confirmation from the Ukrainians on that drone attack on Moscow constantly these attacks trying to take on logistical infrastructure. So what you've seen for instance, on the night of the biggest attack was an -- airfields being struck oil depots. The point of these attacks is to try and limit Russia's ability to bring equipment, men to these lines where the Ukrainian say they're finally making some progress, Max.",

The floodwaters have receded and the cleanup and recovery effort across Hillsborough County here is well underway. Just to the west of us is Pinellas County that is home to the Clearwater and St. Pete area.That part of the state is also starting to dry out a lot of the flooding there has also receded. It's where we spent a good part of yesterday as the folks there were allowed to return to their homes if they had evacuated or there were two mandatory evacuation orders that were put in place ahead of this hurricane in this part of the state of Florida. Both of those have since expired. Now it is a very different situation to the north of us about two hours from Tampa in Pasco County. The folks there really are dealing with a pretty dire situation to thousands of homes over there are currently underwater after this storm surge of anywhere between four to six feet made that part of the state of Florida nearly impossible to get to overnight. We're told that at least 150 families had to be rescued 150 people rather had to be rescued from their homes as a state emergency officials in that part of the state of Florida are trying to deal with all of this flooding. Going into this storm, of course, the biggest concern was where it was going to make landfall. That storm stayed just off the coast of the Tampa Bay area. And it continued to make its way north eventually hitting the Big Bend the panhandle of the state of Florida. And as you mentioned, Max it has now moved across parts of Georgia and the Carolinas where right now they're experiencing some wind and some rain. But again, Max, at this hour here in Tampa. The good news is that this part of the state of Florida is starting to get back to normal. The folks that evacuated this part of the state are being allowed to return home after this near hit by this hurricane, Max.",
