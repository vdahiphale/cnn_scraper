Obviously, not safe to be there. Three radio towers used to dispatch fire and ambulances in Vermont's Washington County have also been compromised. Vermont's Swift Water Teams have now performed more than 100 rescues throughout the state and they are still very busy. Jack McCollough is the mayor of Montpelier, which is under water with extreme flooding right now. Mayor, thank you for taking the time to speak with us. We're very sorry about what your city is going through and we're looking for an update from you. We heard a few hours ago that police said the dam there in Montpelier, the Wrightsville Dam, which we have a photo of here, was only about a foot from overflowing, which would have risked even more flooding. Can you tell us where things stand right now with that dam? MAYOR JACK MCCOLLOUGH (I-MONTPELIER, VT): Yes, thank you for your kind words. We appreciate the support and attention. What I can tell you is we have been paying attention to the dam overnight, and into today. And for the last three hours, we've been right at the same level, just about a foot below the overflow status. We take that to be a good sign because it indicates that it is not getting any worse. And in a day like today, not getting any worse is something that I'll take.",

I think we're likely to see people displaced who are going to need to have work done before they can return. All the businesses are going to need a lot of work before they can get up and running. In fact, I know from previous events that where buildings, basins have been filled with water, the systems will need to be inspected and determined to be safe before the space can be energized and people can go back to working in those buildings.

CNN's Omar Jimenez is here with more. Omar, looking at this case, he says he didn't know anything about claims of hazing and does not appear to be clear evidence he did.

But I played basketball. This year is about football. And some of the basics of what this case is about as far as hazing goes, 11 former or current players talked about how hazing had been ongoing within the program. But specifically, hazing that included forced participation, nudity and sexualized acts of a degrading nature. Some student athletes believed it was fun and games. Others looked at it as posing significant harm. And the investigation, the results of which were presented, or summarized by Northwestern, said this was widely known within the program but made the key distinction that there was no credible evidence that Head Coach Pat Fitzgerald knew about this. That said, as part of Northwestern's statement, \"The hazing we investigated was widespread and clearly not a secret within the program, providing Coach Fitzgerald with the opportunity to learn what was happening.\" That's the key point there. Either way, the culture of Northwestern football, while incredible in some ways, was broken in others. We're hearing now from Head Coach Pat Fitzgerald who has said in response, in part: \"I had no knowledge whatsoever of any form of hazing within the Northwestern football program. Last friday, Northwestern and I came to a mutual agreement regarding the appropriate resolution. \"Therefore, I was surprised when I learned that the president of our Northwestern unilaterally revoked our agreement without any prior notification and subsequently terminated my employment.\" He's talking about how he was initially suspended for two weeks. Details became more public and, of course, things progressed here. I should say, he's hired legal representation to help navigate his next steps.",

Scientists putting out a new warning about the damaging effects excessive heat caused by climate change is having on coral reefs. NOAA's Coral Reef Watch said there's greater than a 60 percent chance of coral mortality in southern Florida and the Caribbean between now and October. Ocean temps in that region have recently risen as high as 95 degrees, well past the mid-80s necessary to maintain coral marine life. The stress caused by excessive heat can lead to coral bleaching and the eventual death of reefs. The high ocean temperatures is not just limited to Florida. The Caribbean, of course, parts of the north Atlantic also seeing a major spike. Also, there is still a chance for to you cash in on one of the biggest Powerball jackpots ever. They always seem to get bigger. There was no winner in last night's drawing, meaning Wednesday's jackpot will rise to an estimated $725 million. That would make it, if you believe it, just the seventh largest jackpot in Powerball history. The odds of winning, one in 292 million, give or take. So good luck. And a Hollywood A-lister is now accused looting a chateau in France. Court filings on behalf of Angelina Jolie's former investment company accuse the actor's ex-husband, Brad Pitt, of stripping those assets from the winery they once owned together in an attempt to control it. The company is seeking $350 million in damages. The representative for Pitt disputes the details of that court filing. Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt back in 2016. She sold that investment company in 2021. Boris?",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, these are alarming allegations against one of America's largest banks and they are eerily similar to the Wells Fargo scandal of years ago.Here's what regulators are alleging Bank of America did. First, that they had this double-dipping fee scheme. When customers tried to buy something, if they didn't have enough money in their account, they were slapped with a $35 fee, but not once, multiple times for the same transaction. That's a big no-no. Regulators also say Bank of America was withholding credit card rewards. Think about bonus points and cash rewards. Withholding tens of thousands of credit card customers. And also this is reminiscent of Wells Fargo, regulators say employees opened up fake accounts in an effort to hit sales goals that have since been disbanded. We've reached out to Bank of America and the company told CNN that they had voluntarily reduced overdraft fees and non-positioned fund fees last year. And that caused their fee revenue to plunge by more than 90 percent. I'm sure a lot of people are wondering, what should I do? If you are a customer of Bank of America, CFPB told CNN that customers don't need to do anything. Bank of America is being required to refund people hit by bogus fees and they are being required to reach out to customers who may have been hurt by fake accounts. What about customers of other banks? The CFPB is hinting there could be other action there. In a statement, the CFPB director said, quote, \"These practices are illegal and undermine customer trust. The CFPB will be putting an end to these practices across the banking system.\" Boris, I think the lesson here for customers of all banks is check your statements. Make sure there's no shady fees there. If there are, speak up. Not just to the bank but to regulators like the CFPB.",
