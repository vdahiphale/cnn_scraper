The threat of a shutdown thankfully appears to be over. The next few days though could get messy as lawmakers work to turn that framework into a reality, into legislation.

Those are the members of Congress in the House and Senate who actually draft legislation to fund the federal government. But we have seen no details about this and they are still going to haggle over the details from the days ahead. And that's going to be the big question, what ultimately is in this package, which could cost about $1.7 trillion or so to fund the federal government.And, remember, this was supposed to be done in September 30th, then they punted the deadline until this Friday. They are not going to get an agreement by this Friday, so they're planning to pass a one-week stop gap measure to fund the government for an additional week to finish the negotiations on this larger package. Now, there is one key group that is missing from endorsing this package. That is House Republicans, who are now not signing on to this amid opposition from the top Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, who, of course, is battling for the votes to become speaker, and has been courting the right-wing of his conference, which is steadfastly opposed to this measure. Now, as this has been development, there has been tension growing behind the scenes between Senate Republicans and House Republicans on this issue, including Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who supports this deal, suggesting yesterday it would have broad agreement that whether it ultimately comes together. But still also underscores the growing divide between these two men who, over the past year, have split on some key issues, not just on spending but on Ukraine, on guns, on infrastructure, as they too, both men, dealing with different realities in their respective chambers, dealing with different conferences and are headed into a new power dynamic next year when Republicans will control the House. Republicans will still in the minority in the Senate but that is the argument Republicans are making in the House. They want to punt this into next year so they believe they would have a firmer hand to deal with it next year. But Senate Republicans simply do not agree, they want to get this done right now. Because they're concerned, guys, if this goes into next year, only intensify concerns about a potential government shutdown.",

One of the things -- one of the key issues are the rules by which he would be the speaker.And so you have members of the Freedom Caucus, the conservative faction that is trying to make sure they extract something out of him, and the thing that they want is the ability to basically yank him at any time in the middle of his speakership, if that should come about. That's how he toppled John Boehner a generation again. I mean, it is entirely possible that they could get that. And that's the negotiation to keep an eye on. If it is such a tenuous speakership that he can be recalled or removed at any point by an organized faction of the Republican conference, it won't be a very powerful speakership at all. And so he's in a very difficult position. There are a lot of conservatives who want him to say, hell no, that they want him to -- if he is going to be the opposition speaker, to damn well act like it and just oppose almost anything that comes out of the White House or out of the Democratic side of the House.

And so one of the questions is whether or not the committee that was blown off will refer these members to the Ethics Committee.What is interesting, because, again, we are on the cusp of a new Congress, in the new Congress, the January 6th committee won't exist, because there's no way Republicans will keep that committee because it is a select committee. The ethics committee is different. It is an evenly split committee. And my understanding, in talking to a former member of that committee last night, is that just because there is a new Congress doesn't mean a referral will die.

So, a hike is expected here, but we're told it's likely going to be a half a percentage point as opposed to the three quarters that we have been seeing. Rate hikes typically take, as I understand it, about six months to really show that they're starting to have an impact. So, the first big increase of three quarters of a percent was in June.

The Fed rate hikes have had, understandably, a major impact on people's mortgages, what they pay every month. But when we look at the housing market, the speed with which it feels, homes have become expensive both to buy and to rent.

One, of course, is the pandemic shifting people's preferences for where they want to live, how they want to live, how much space they want. Rates were very low, interest rates were very low for a long time. And, of course, you have the aging of the millennial generation into their prime child-bearing and home- buying years. All of that has put upward pressure on prices.Then we've had the Fed raise rates. We've had rates go -- the 30-year mortgage goes from around 3 percent to over 6 percent. And so the monthly cost of paying down a mortgage has gone way up. And you've seen some impact on prices so far, but not nearly enough to offset those much higher borrowing costs. As a result, if you talk to economists, if you talk to housing analysts, a lot of them think that housing prices still have much further to go down in the year ahead, particularly since it looks like, as we've been discussing, those interest rates are going to stay high. And as long as those interest rates are going to stay high and people can't afford to buy homes, those prices are going to have to come down a little bit.",

On the other hand, there's a lot of concern about an impending recession, in part because the Fed has been tightening financial conditions.And there are some of these other puzzles that are out there, like why are there still so few people participating in the labor force given that there are so many jobs available. Is it because more people retired? Is it because we have fewer immigrants? There were a couple of years when there was very low immigration is because of persistent child care issues. So, it's really hard to make sense of the overall picture. Of course, like everyone else, I'm paying attention to prices, I'm paying attention to the job market and I'm paying attention to some of these squishier measures, consumer sentiment, to see how people feel and what that indicates how they might behave in the months ahead.",
