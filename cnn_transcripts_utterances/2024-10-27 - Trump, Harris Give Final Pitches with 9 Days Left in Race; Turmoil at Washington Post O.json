And Donald Trump tries to appeal to young male voters with a rally near Penn State. What he has to say about Kamala Harris' recent rallies. Plus, it's been a month since Hurricane Helene devastated the city of Asheville. We'll look at recovery efforts and how you can get involved. With election day fast approaching, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are preparing for their last full week of campaigning. Later today, Trump will hold a rally in New York's Madison Square Garden. Meanwhile, the U.S. Vice President will be courting black and Latino voters in Battleground, Pennsylvania. Michelle Obama brought star power to the campaign trail in Michigan Saturday. The former first lady rallied for Harris and offered this message on what's at stake for women on November 5th. Here she is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER U.S. FIRST LADY: It is reasonable to be frustrated. We all know we have a lot more work to do in this country. But to anyone out there thinking about sitting out this election or voting for Donald Trump or a third-party candidate in protest, because you're fed up, let me warn you, your rage does not exist in a vacuum. If we don't get this election right, your wife, your daughter, your mother, we as women will become collateral damage to your rage. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The former president spoke for about an hour and 20 minutes, and there was much of his normal Pennsylvania- type speech. He spoke about fracking. He bashed Vice President Harris and the Biden administration on their handling of immigration. He also actually at one point made fun of Vice President Kamala Harris and her rally with Beyonce on Friday night, saying that Harris can't draw a crowd on her own and making fun of Beyonce, the superstar, because she did not sing. But when I mean that the campaign has been reaching out specifically to young men, part of the theme of this particular event at State College was all about focusing on the Penn State wrestling team. The former president admiring the members of the wrestling team's muscles at one point, bringing them up on stage. Take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Just like your wrestling team dreams big, you know, where the hell are they? Where are they? I hear that team is brutal, I can tell. It's easy to tell. I could pick every one of them. Jim Jordan told me about you guys. You know, Jim Jordan, he told me about -- look at the muscles all over the place. You better get ready, because they're going to bring you up here in a little while. So you guys better get ready. You guys better get ready. Maybe I'll wrestle one of them or two of them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And one opposition figure is saying the strikes don't go far enough. Another one saying that military logic has prevailed and that the Israelis seem to have carried out a retaliation attack that doesn't necessarily threaten to drag the country into a direct war with Iran.And so, yeah, again, mixed response politically here in Israel to that. I think the key question is, has this retaliation by Israel done enough to restore deterrence in the ongoing conflict between Iran, its proxies, and Israel? I guess we're just going to have to wait to see what the Iranian reaction, if any, is to this latest Israeli strike. In terms of the prospects for, you know, a ceasefire and a hostage release elsewhere in the region, well, as you rightly pointed out, for the past two months there's been a hiatus in negotiations to secure a hostage release and a ceasefire. But that is now coming to an end as well because Israel has sent top security officials to Doha in Qatar to engage with the Qatari authorities and the Egyptians and others, the United States representatives are also there, to talk about what can be done to secure a hostage release and to implement a ceasefire in the region as well. The big problem, of course, in Gaza we're talking about here, the big problem, of course, is that the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, was killed recently by an Israeli military patrol and it's not clear what the negotiation, who the new leadership is of that organization. And once that leadership is appointed, what their negotiating position would be, would it be hardline or would they be more prepared to compromise? And so that's something that we hope to get some clarity on in the hours ahead and in the days ahead as these talks continue. Kim.",

Vice President Harris said during an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists just a few months ago, specifically talking about Black men, that she knows that she does not have Black men in her pocket, that she intends to earn every single vote. And what I think is so fascinating about the Harris campaign's approach to targeting Black voters is that they're showing that they recognize the Black community, that Black voters are not a monolith. They have a unique engagement strategy to target young Black voters, older Black voters, Black men in particular, Black women in particular, and saw the release of the opportunity agenda for Black men just a few weeks ago.

So again, the support that we've seen from the black community for Democratic candidates in recent memory is certainly very strong.Now, Kim, I think one thing that we can certainly acknowledge is that the Democratic Party, regardless of the outcome in this election, you know, must continue to grapple with how to engage especially younger black voters in light of the fact that we're now decades beyond the civil rights movement. We know that decades in the past, there was a stronger association between the Democratic Party sort of being the party of civil rights that sort of was on the forefront of pushing for rights for black folks. And now that we're a little bit further past that, I think there are a lot of black voters who are looking for more. And I think the Harris campaign recognizes that. And that's why we've seen them release the opportunity agenda for black men. Just again, as one example, showing, hey, black men, we see you, we hear you. We don't want to just help you get by, but we want to help you get ahead and lead in your communities. And I believe that it's the intentional decisions that the Harris campaign has made that has led to this record-breaking turnout across the country and which I believe will help carry her across the finish line. BRUNHUBER: Well, let's look at what Donald Trump is doing. He seems to be going after a more male-focused approach, which seems to be making, you know, some inroads with Latino and to a lesser extent, black men.

And certainly same can be said, you know, for black voters in terms of his Project 2025 agenda.But again, I do think there are certain cultural reasons that are pushing, you know, men toward, especially in Latino and black communities, that might push young men to someone like Donald Trump who feel like, for whatever reason, he gives them a voice. But again, that is not an overwhelming portion of the community, Kim. And what I think is striking to me is the fact that the Trump campaign made such a big deal about all these minority outreach centers that they opened in these communities across the country. Last I checked, every single one of them has shuttered. So what I've seen for the Trump campaign right here in Georgia, Kim, is a lot of photo ops that mean virtually nothing.",
