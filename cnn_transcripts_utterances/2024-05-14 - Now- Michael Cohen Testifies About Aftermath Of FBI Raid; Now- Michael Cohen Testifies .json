And everyone around Trump will ask, why on earth do you keep that person close? Do you know -- do you know that that's not a good idea.And I've been told that he learned a lesson from what happened with Michael Cohen. And there are some people that are far more dangerous, right? If you let them go, they can be so useful to prosecutor so potentially dangerous, that just do whatever you can to keep them close.

I mean, you've got Cohen talking about these issues. You have -- by the way it's not even noon -- is now just noon. He is not yet to be cross examined. There is not trial tomorrow. There is not trial on Friday. We already know because there's barons has the graduation and beyond.

After they had a Wednesday, I mean, they went for as long if not longer than they did in the first round.So, the way the timing plays out here really could be detrimental for Michael Cohen in terms of what he's going to face on the witness stand. But we are in the homestretch. Once they've wrapped Michael Cohen, defense case expected to be brief. Then, of course, they'll have to likely have some arguments over the specific instructions for the jury. They'll do closing arguments, instruct the jury.

I might add, Jake, that one of the tough things for a witness, which I spent a lot of time on the witness stand are sidebars.

He ultimately ends up getting sentenced to three years.He serves about one in -- one year and a little bit of spare change, largely because he got released early because of the COVID scares. They were trying to reduce the inmate population. So, the argument from prosecutors will be he's owned up. He's taken accountability. He's literally done this time.",

And he's nodding his head, slightly -- and he's also just talking about the repayments he made to the government. To his testimony, he is owning up to the payments to the two women.Cohen says, he apologized to the American public vote for lying to them, for acting in a way that suppressed information that the citizenry had a right to know in order to make a determination on the individual who was seeking the highest office in the land asked.

When I had to make the decision to represent Michael and to take him public. I needed to believe he was ready to own what he did, because I had seen the Michael Cohen for 10 years that I didn't like very much, attacking everyone, defending Donald Trump.And so, over a period of time, and it was Elijah Cummings that ultimately helped me decide that he was believable in his contrition. It took a former minister in a black church. Elijah Cummings to say, when a sinner asked for redemption, I have to be sure the sinner feels it.

She's Director of Criminal Defense Clinic at New York Law School. Also, Adam Kaufmann here, former executive assistant D.A. for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. Really important, Adam, we bring you in here because I do wonder, do you find it problematic that they are going through the things they had to find when they had to get to these issues of his honesty or dishonesty? How are they doing at presenting and framing this to the jury? ADAM KAUFMAN, FORMER EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT. D.A. MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE: Thanks, Laura. It's so hard to get the feel of the courtroom when you're not in there. And this really is. I mean, you can read the record and the record says whatever the words are, that are being uttered from the witness stand. But a record doesn't show eye contact. It doesn't show fidgeting. It doesn't show body language. It doesn't show how the jurors are reacting to this. All of that is happening within the courtroom. Jurors, you know, I've found in some cases, jurors buy into -- believe in a tale of redemption, that someone who did these wrongs in the past that lied and lied and lied again, but who -- you know, pled guilty, owned up to his crimes and paid whatever the penalty was. That jurors will respect that and see that as their sort of redemption tale. And they may credit that testimony. So, I think this could go anyway.",

We're seeing Alina Habba handed a note from the gallery to another lawyer, who then gave it to Necheles defense counsel, who then passed it to Bove, who then handed the note to Blanche.And so, you mentioned what the jury is looking at and how they are receiving information.
