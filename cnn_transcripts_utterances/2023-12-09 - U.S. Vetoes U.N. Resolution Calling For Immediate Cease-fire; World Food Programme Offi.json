Despite growing international pressure for a cease- fire, the deputy U.S. ambassador explained why the U.S. blocked this measure. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT WOOD, U.S. DEPUTY AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: We proposed language, with an eye toward a constructive resolution that would have reinforced the lifesaving diplomacy we have undertaken since October 7th. Increased opportunities for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, encourage the release of hostages and the resumption of humanitarian pauses can lay the foundation for durable peace. Unfortunately, nearly all of our recommendations were ignored and the result of this rushed process was an imbalanced resolution that was divorced from reality. We still cannot comprehend why the resolution's authors declined to include language condemning Hamas' horrific terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, an attack that killed over 1,200 people. We are very disappointed that, for the victims of these heinous acts, the resolutions offered not their condolences nor condemnation of their murderers. It is unfathomable. Nor is there condemnation of the sexual violence unleashed by Hamas on October 7. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: An appeals court has largely upheld a gag order against former president Donald Trump in the federal election subversion case, saying he can be barred from making certain comments about witnesses as well as prosecutors, court staff and their family members. Trump immediately vowed to appeal the ruling all the way to the Supreme Court, calling it a violation of his First Amendment rights. In this ruling, the three judge panel from the, D.C. appeals court said they did not take this step lightly, recognizing his status as former president and, of course, as a candidate for president. But they said Mr. Trump's documented pattern of speech and his demonstrated real-time, real-world consequences pose a significant and imminent threat to the functioning of the general criminal trial process in this case. The judges went on to say that, Trump is a criminal defendant like any other and, quote, \"He must stand trial in a courtroom under the same procedures that govern all other criminal defendants. That is what the rule of law means.\" The ruling Friday also pushed back on Trump's efforts to try to delay this trial, which is set for March. The former president calls prosecutions against him election interference. But the judges said that, to allow Trump to delay the case would be, quote, \"counterproductive, create perverse incentives and unreasonably burden the judicial process\" -- Evan Perez, CNN, Washington.
