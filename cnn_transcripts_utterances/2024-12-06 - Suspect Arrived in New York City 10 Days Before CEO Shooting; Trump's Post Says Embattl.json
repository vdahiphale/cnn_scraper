And then they recovered a cell phone on top of that. That could have some touch DNA as well. Bottom line, police say they are done processing those materials and have turned it over to the office of the chief medical examiner as well as of this moment for further testing. And of course, you talked about the facial recognition technology. We've seen a few images of this person come through, the ones of him unmasked. They've described him as a person of interest, but nonetheless someone that could be very significant to their investigation, if not the suspect himself. And so putting that image through their technology and sending it to every member of the, of course, large New York Police Department sort of shows where their priority is right now to, again, try to track down anybody who may know who this person is or has seen this person to try to at least find some clue of a location.",

His support is strong and deep, much more so than the fake news would have you believe\". A source says that Trump's allies are noting they've heard no hard nose on Hegseth's nomination, at least among the Republican senators that he's met with this week. Let's get the latest from our Congressional Correspondent, Lauren Fox. Lauren, it's still early days for this nomination, but what are you hearing about whether the Trump transition will stick with Hegseth in the end?",

You know, over the course of the week, there were a lot of questions about how he was going to handle some of these very difficult meetings with people like Senator Joni Ernst as well as the incoming Republican Leader John Thune.But what you saw from some of these high stakes meetings is that some lawmakers came out and made clear that they were not going to just say they were opposed to Hegseth. Some even said that they could get to yes, eventually. You know, that's what I heard from Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota who met with him as well as Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who said he had a really frank discussion at various points, really pushing Hegseth on questions about his past alcohol use and that he got a promise from Hegseth that he would not drink if he got the position of leading the Pentagon. And I think that that makes Hegseth's team, as well as the Trump transition feel pretty comfort about the fact that perhaps they started the week in one place, ended the week and maybe even a better place than they had expected. Obviously, things can turn on a dime. There are a lot of questions about whether or not anything else comes out about Pete Hegseth. You know, Kevin Cramer told me we cannot have any more surprises. And he really did hammer home that point with Hegseth making it clear that in the Senate and in the confirmation process, that is the last thing that you'd want. Again, we are a really long ways away from the potential public confirmation battles. But that is going to be another place where senators are going to be looking really closely to how Hegseth handles himself, how he handles some of the tough lines of questioning you might see. But again, this is going to take time to play out. They feel very good, though, about where things stand right now.",

The question really is, as HTS drives south towards Damascus, will regime elements hold firm and will they get any support from Russia or from Hezbollah, both of which have bigger fish to fry closer to their homelands. So this is an amazing attack. It's obviously been well planned and has been in the works for quite some time. And as that amazing report on the ground in Aleppo shows, you know, the group is also ready to transition from a military organization to a governance organization.
