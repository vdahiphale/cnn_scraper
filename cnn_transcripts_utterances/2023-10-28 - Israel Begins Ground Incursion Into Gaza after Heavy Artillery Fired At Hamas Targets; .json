Understandably, they didn't want to talk a lot about the case. So hopefully today, this morning, we will get more information. Yesterday, when police updated us here, they didn't take many questions.

Right now people are sitting in the dark as we heard, communications are blacked out. This as the IDF ground forces, as we are hearing, are in Gaza right now. They entered from the north as a part of this expanded ground operation. In terms of President Biden's unwavering public support for Israel, do you get a sense that there may be limits when there are conversations behind the scenes? BOBBY GHOSH, EDITOR AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST, \"BLOOMBERG\": Well, the White House has been making clear that there are limits. The White House has said openly that it is, it is trying to restrain Israel from making a full land operation, which may explain why the Israelis are describing this one not quite in those open terms. They're describing it as a slightly more, slightly heavier operation than the ones that have gone before. The White House is also saying very clearly that there has to be humanitarian support extended to the Palestinians, particularly those who are in the southern part of Gaza, away from Gaza city and closer to the Israeli border. The White House has been drawing its red lines very clearly. The Israelis have been quite close to those red lines and testing just how much patience the White House will have on these kinds of operations.",

I suppose something could happen to lead us in that direction. So whatever that is, 800 and something leads and tips. The primary reason we were back in that location is because, I will say this, from a community policing, from a relationship standpoint, the owner of a business calls his police chief and says, hey, you know, I want somebody to make sure that they're clearing that. That's good cop 101, right? To have an automatic connection with somebody in your community, that's why the additional follow-ups occurred, because we had, again, searched and documented, there's logs and all of this stuff of when we were there, who was there, what did they do, which allowed us to do the follow-up work to say, well, did we? Did you check across the street? Well, what's across the street? There's a dozen businesses that surround this thing, and nothing that says that's the recycling corporation.

And I think we had a great deal of resources in play. I think we had resources all over the place, resources that maybe you saw, maybe you didn't see, 24/7, 365, out on the street. I know that Chief McGee was working with fellow chiefs to bring him additional resources. I've seen that email string, like, hey, we're trying to have two-person cars from a safety perspective, we want to make sure that we're properly staffed across the board.Another incredibly positive aspect of this is that search that Chief McGee led was because one of his officers found an open door to that building, right. So that's what's happening. People go to bed, whether they can sleep or not, and all night long there are police officers crawling through their neighborhood, looking at these businesses, looking at their backyards, trying to make sure that everyone is safe. So I will, for the rest of my life, be looking at this event and say, could we have done this different, could we do that different. I think we had resources in play. And our hearts go out. The reason we do this work is because of the trauma that is caused to our communities, all communities, when these things happen. So it is a completely legitimate question, but not one that I think was resource intensive for that particular area. But sir, in the middle? Why don't you follow up. Go ahead. I'll give you that one.
