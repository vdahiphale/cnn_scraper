The reaction is coming in fast and furious. Senators Mark Kelly, Cory Booker and Tom Cotton are all here to join me. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. With pressure building on Donald Trump, as he is facing a new and potentially formidable opponent, the former President is turning back to his old playbook, back from 2011, reviving that strategy of his infamous birther lie, about former President Barack Obama. But fast-forward to now, and 2024. And today, in Chicago, in a room full of Black journalists, Trump questioned Vice President Harris' identity, saying falsely that she, quote, \"Happened to turn Black\" just a few years ago. Moments ago, we heard the Vice President respond, for the first time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump spoke at the annual meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists. And it was the same old show. The divisiveness and the disrespect. And let me just say. The American people deserve better. The American people deserve better. (AUDIENCE APPLAUSE)",

And it's very obvious to me, watching him, and just what I've seen over the last week, while she's been, across the country, just kicking his butt, that he's afraid, that he's probably afraid to debate her. He's certainly afraid to lose an election to her in November. And he's afraid about his own future. So, I'm not surprised to see it. And I understand, you know, what he's up against.

DE BLASIO: Well, first of all to pick up on Errol's point, I think the worst thing in the world is happening to Donald Trump, humanly, emotionally, which is he's being ignored. This is the one thing that flummoxes him the most. And I think when you think about that kind of language, it's just obviously patently false to say she was not being authentically Black.

And he attacked the journalist, who was interviewing him, and went on and on. And, I mean, it was something that Cory Booker said, though, earlier today, on your show, I think it's really important.

I think the former President had a great opportunity there, to articulate a case, similar to what Senator Cotton just did, talking about some of those important, crucial, critical issues that do indeed impact all Americans, from cost, immigration, to foreign policy, et cetera. Black voters are certainly concerned about those things. But when you get into this issue of race, Kaitlan? And I have talked about this on this show, all day today. You're not going to win on that issue. Republicans have not done well on matters of race, in what, five, six decades. It's why most African-Americans do not vote Republican. That's why most Hispanic-Americans do not vote Republicans. Because many in those groups view the Republican Party as frankly, being hostile towards issues of race.

FINNEY: Well, he's going to keep answering -- I mean, let's be clear. This is not someone, who's going to change, right? So, it's going to continue to be racist and sexist and misogynist. I mean, you could just see the disrespect with which he was treating Rachel Scott, was reminiscent of 2016. So, I think we're going to only see more of it.
