And the idea that that is reason enough to vote to throw away the votes of millions of Americans? I mean, let's extrapolate that for one second, what that reasoning would mean. I mean, right now, Twitter or X is run by Elon Musk, who's very much on record supporting the election of Donald Trump. He gave nearly $75 million to a pro-Trump Super PAC, and he tweets in favor of Trump all the time, which is his right.And we should note, Musk's changes to Twitter have, by many studies, created an explosion of false information, much of which, by the way, is amplified by Musk himself and algorithmically force fed to millions of users. So going back to J.D. Vance's logic on election certification, if Vice President Kamala Harris loses to Trump, which could happen, would Vance be OK with her refusing to certify the election on January 6 as vice president, as Mike Pence was in that position four years ago, simply because she doesn't like how X handled her candidacy or refused to allow the dossier hacked by Iranian hackers into J.D. Vance that was stolen from the Trump team, like that has been suppressed on X, and I'm not saying it shouldn't have been, but that's, you know, a subjective determination. She could say it wasn't fair. So obviously, if she were to do so, that would be checks constitution, not how this should ever work, which is, frankly, of a piece with using the military to go after your political rivals or the government, quote, unquote, \"straightening out the free press.\" And here we are. Now to Trump's attempt to cut into his opponent's lead with women voters. Today, Mr. Trump participated in a Fox town hall with an all- female audience. One issue he was pressed on is fertility treatment access and how he would protect it if elected. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But also, you know, make it very clear exactly what as a campaign and as a president, this vice president would do, which is ensuring that there's access to the health care that is reproductive rights that is getting the government out of the bedrooms of so many Americans.

Some states are going to ask for -- you know, some states going to be more restrictive than others, but at the federal level, we're going to fund IDF, and we're going to make sure the insurance companies backs up.

What it does mean, is that there could really be a focus on the volatility in the Middle East just within days of the presidential election.We are also told that U.S. officials do believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is very sensitive to the potential political ramifications of his own actions here in the U.S. As you know the Biden White House has been in a wait and see mode since October 1st since some 200 ballistic missiles rained down on Israel. And there have been serious consultations between Israeli and American officials on what exactly comes next. What we did report is that the Prime Minister did inform President Biden in a recent conversation that one thing he is not going to do is hit Iran's nuclear and oil facilities. Something that was a relief to the White House given that this is something President Biden made very clear that he did not want to see happen -- goes without saying that this has been an incredibly politically fraught issue here in the U.S. both for President Biden and of course now, for Vice President Kamala Harris. It is not a coincidence that she is going to campaigning three days just this week in a state like Michigan. Of course, home to a very sizable Arab-American population where this kind of issue and the administration's handling of particularly the Gaza conflict could end up being particularly decisive, Jake.",

But right now, this week the focus has been on the devastating and worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, in particular, in northern Gaza.The United States sending a letter earlier this week to top Israeli officials telling them that they have 30 days to improve the humanitarian situation or risk losing key U.S. military aid. And we are seeing the Israelis seeming to take this quite seriously. I -- I've been told the private conversation -- in private conversations, Israeli officials have been looking for things that they can do to start improving the situation. And already today, we heard the State Department spokesman saying that the Israelis has reopened the Erez Crossing into northern Gaza. They've also kind of streamlined some of the processes for humanitarian organizations to get into Gaza and this week, we've seen COGAT the agency in charge of allowing aid in, talking about a number of steps that they are taking in the amount of aid getting in. So at least, on the messaging front they're trying to show that they're serious. But let's be clear, they are nowhere close to reaching the target of 350 aid trucks per day that the United States says that Israel needs to hit within 30 days. And we know that the situation in northern Gaza right now is dire. It's been describe -- described as catastrophic by the United Nations. Hundreds of thousands of people either at risk of -- of being displaced from northern Gaza or trapped in their homes as the Israel's bombardment continues and as the fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas intensifies, in particular in the city of Jabalia. And -- and so for now the question is will the Israeli's take all the steps that the United States has said they need to take within the next month and will that quickly improve the situation in northern Gaza, Jake.",
