But one of the things I want to tell all of you is you never stop dreaming. I don't want any of you to stop dreaming. I don't want any of you to stop believing in America. I want you to believe in America and continue to believe in the Constitution and believe in our elected officials, most of all. Continue to pray for them because all the prayers you have given me, I have felt those prayers. I want to thank all my team as well, team Herschel, because they put up with a lot. I want to thank team Herschel. I want to thank all of my donors as well because you guys, without you, I could not have done what I have done. I want to thank all of you as well because there are no excuses in life, and I'm not going to make any excuses now because we put up one heck of a fight. And that is what we have got to do because this is much bigger. This is much bigger than Herschel Walker. I told someone this the other day, I said, guys, I have done a lot of stuff. You talk about Heisman trophy, you talk about all the athletic awards, business wards I have one. But the best thing I have ever done in my whole entire life is run for this Senate seat right here. And the reason I'm going to say that is because we had a chance to meet all of you and to hear what you guys feel about this country. And I got a chance to, for you guys, to tell me what do you do, feel about this country. I got a chance to go into your homes. I got a chance to invest in Herschel Walker. And I thank you -- and I thank you so much. And as I said, you cannot blame anyone because I want you to continue to believe in this country, believe in our elected officials. And most of all, stay together. Don't let anyone separate you. Don't let anyone tell you that we can't because I am here to tell you we can. I'm here to tell you we can. And as I said early on, they say, God is good. He is a good God. All the time, he is a good God. So, I want to say I'm never going to say fighting for Georgia. I'm never going to stop fighting for you because you are my family. I always -- hey, we are all winners and that's what I want to say. We are all winners. And I want to say God is a good God. God bless you guys. And let me tell you, stay together, continue to believe in all our elected officials, always, always cast your vote no matter whatever is happening. Cast you vote. In God we trust. I do. In God we trust. Continue to cast your vote. Never, never, never give up. All right? God bless you, guys. Thank you, guys. Thank you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's also a lot of Trump voters who are -- we are Trump is and maybe even beyond that at a certain point. And that is what is pushing the party so far to the right that they are not able to get out of these primaries unscathed with a candidate who can really survive in a general election. The primary process is a huge part of the problem here. It is making them vulnerable. It's making them unpalatable in the suburbs.

We had one state where somebody is kind of throwing a fit about a clear outcome. There were a lot of predictions that we were going to have another 2020-style meltdown. That did not happen.And so, for all the county clerks and precinct workers and everyone else who runs elections in America which I am a strong supporter of the diffused election system we have, all these people, some of them are volunteers, they get very low pay and they take these jobs, they are in the crosshairs of a lot of controversy, but we had a pretty well-run election. And tonight, we had a gracious winner, we had a gracious loser. If you think that American democracy was damaged somehow after 2020 and you are wondering what was going to happen here, I would think, no matter what party you are in, this whole election should have given you some heart that when push comes to shove, America will get it right, the American people will get it right, and we did.",

CNN projecting that Senator Raphael Warnock has been reelected in Georgia, defeating his republican challenger, football star Herschel Walker, after a close and whiplash-inducing runoff election.We saw the lead changed multiple times as votes came in this evening. This means Democrats are getting what they wanted, an outright Senate majority of 51 seats. That will strengthen their control of the chamber over the next two years. Republicans will lose a seat. They will have 49 in the next Senate. Their hopes of keeping the Senate evenly divided dashed. Herschel walker's loss is clearly a huge blow to Republicans, perhaps, especially to Donald Trump.

Former -- excuse me, prominent Iowa Republican Bob Vander Plaats, who once supported Trump, tweeted that conservatives are tired of losing, that 2024 should be a time to reevaluate, that they need to choose well. The big question here now for those around Trump is whether or not he can actually hold on to his base. I spoke to one former Trump advisor who said there is still a large portion of the republican base who only cares about Donald Trump. But some in his orbit just are not so sure. Jake, I'm going to say what I said in the beginning of the night and repeat it again now. Donald Trump needed Herschel Walker to win. He needed him to after those lackluster midterm results, after a number of candidates that he had put forward fizzled or flopped in the midterms, and after his own campaign seems to be stalled. He now has even less momentum going into his 2024 cycle after he announced his third presidential bid than he did when he announced after his midterms bid.",

They want to move on. Now, as Mitt Romney told me yesterday, he said, yean, it doesn't really matter what the elected officials say, it matters what the base says.

I think the fact that this is the first time since 1934 that the president's incumbent party picked up governor seats, two governor seats and a Senate seat, not to mention the red wave that really never happened, Joe Biden is going to view that as a victory for him as well.

And I think that Biden, personally, based on talking to people close to him, he believes that he can beat Trump again. He's very confident about that.
