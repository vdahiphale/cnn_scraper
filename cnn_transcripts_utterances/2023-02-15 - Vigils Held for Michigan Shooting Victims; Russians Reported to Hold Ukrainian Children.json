We actually spoke to multiple villagers around here. None of them ahead heard of a balloon factory in specific. But when we show them the state TV documentary, they said it was definitely filmed in this area. And two of them said they knew that several of the factories in recent years have been torn down. (voice-over):  We don't know if the balloon that was spotted over the U.S. this time around had anything to do with the six blacklisted companies. But Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technologies balloon has flown over the U.S. before according to state media. In this 2019 state media video, a co-founder of the company, Scientist Wu Zhe (ph) points to a computer screen showing the trajectory of an unmanned airship flying around the world.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Rosie. It's almost like we have a one-two punch swinging through the Western and Central U.S. right now, two distinctly different storm systems but both creating havoc, depending on where they're located.Now, you can almost track the first system on her satellite loop as it exits the Texas panhandle and moves towards the Upper Midwest. This is creating blizzard conditions on the back side of the storm system, Western Minnesota as well as eastern sections of the Dakotas. Now, the second more powerful storm system is starting to wind up across Southern California and into Great Basin. This is going to be the catalyst for some significant snow and potential for severe weather as well. Take a look at the winter alerts that are spread out across the country right now. You can almost draw a line separating the two separate storm systems. One to the north, you can see the blizzard warnings in effect for Western Minnesota. The winter storm warnings ongoing with a secondary storm moving across the four corners. This is a what with that shading of blue that means within the next 36 hours we'll look out for the potential for heavy snow. Notice that extends into northern section of Illinois as well. Now, with both of these storm systems moving through, there is a significant amount of energy pent up with this and that's translated into high winds at the surface. We've got 80 million Americans under wind alerts. You can see that through the Great Lakes through the Ohio River Valley. And then more high wind warnings extending throughout much of the western and southwestern parts of the U.S., including just outside the Los Angeles area. Wind gusts could exceed 60 miles per hour. Just look at the forecast wind gusts with the secondary storm system as it traverses eastward and encounters a significant amount of warm air. So, we know what happens when we get that collision of air masses. Here we good again. Another round of severe weather possible across the deep south. Here it is for Wednesday. We have roughly 20 million Americans that need to keep an eye to the sky from Paducah to Memphis Little Rock all the way southward toward Shreveport and Lake Charles. And then more of a wide spread severe weather event possible on Thursday, stretching from the Gulf Coast through the Lower Mississippi River Valley and then to the Ohio River Valley. Isolated tornadoes, damaging winds can't be ruled out. And I want to draw your attention to the central portions of Tennessee. Some of our computer models here picking up on several inches of rainfall. So, a slight risk of flash flooding throughout that area. And then you can also notice the snowfall starting to accumulate across much of the central plains into the Great Lakes and into the Midwest. This is north of Chicago. So, let's say Madison and Milwaukee perhaps into Grand Rapids and Trevor City, Michigan as well. So, all these locations expecting up to a half a foot of snow. And then, of course, the cold air that settles in behind it, that will be short-lived, unfortunately. You can see that dip in our temperatures for Dallas and then rebounding nicely, more the same for Chicago. Rosemary, back to you.",
