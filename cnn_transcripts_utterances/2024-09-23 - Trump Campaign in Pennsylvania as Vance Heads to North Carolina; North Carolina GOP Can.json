As new polls show, the Republican ticket is doing well in the Sunbelt states.And a day of reckoning in Lebanon, as nearly 300 people are reportedly killed in Israeli airstrikes. IDF plays a high risk game with its new strategy for confronting Hezbollah. And new details from the investigation into the Titan submersible disaster. The company's cofounder explains why they needed to build their own subs while defending a controversial decision over how they did it. We're following these major developing stories and many more, all coming in right here to CNN News Central. A major blitz of battleground states underway today as Election Day is just over six weeks away. Next hour, former President Trump will hold the first of two campaign events in the critical state of Pennsylvania. His running mate, J.D. Vance, campaigning in the swing state of North Carolina, where Mark Robinson, the embattled Republican nominee for governor, is also set to hold a campaign event this hour. The defiant GOP candidate vowing to continue his campaign despite a big exodus of his top aides after CNN reporting uncovered lewd and racist comments that he made on a porn website years ago. He denies making the posts. All of this coming as a brand new polling is out today. It shows Donald Trump narrowly ahead in Arizona, no clear leader in Georgia and North Carolina. We do have a team of correspondents joining us to break all of this down. So let's start with Kristen Holmes here. We have Trump campaigning in Pennsylvania today as he's getting what is some pretty encouraging news on these key states in the Sunbelt.",

Obviously, as we're looking at them, they're within the margin of error other than Arizona, which he has a five point lead on, according to this New York Times poll. These were the kind of numbers that they were hoping to see after what they believed to be was a boost for Kamala Harris. They're also looking at the poll numbers, and they believe that this is really the strongest that Donald Trump has ever pulled in 2016 and 2020. He was polling far below where he's pulling now. So they believe that this is encouraging information.Now, I do want to note one poll on, there obviously, is that North Carolina poll, which shows within the margin of error, we know Donald Trump is going to be back now in North Carolina in two days on Wednesday, notably not by his side is Mark Robinson. We don't expect him to be anywhere near the candidate. They are trying to keep him as far away as possible. The one thing I want to point out is something that had nothing to do with this election. It was actually something that he said when he was asked about the future and his political future. This is Donald Trump over the weekend. Here's what he said about what would happen if he loses this election and whether or not he would run again. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Some were afraid of this exact thing happening. But Donald Trump now, I mean, he endorsed him. So, yes, they're trying to distance themselves from him. The question is, what is the effect on the down ballot? And a lot of Republicans are very worried about this.North Carolina is a rare state that has a history of electing Republican presidential candidates and Democratic governors that happened in '16. It happened four years after that. So we shall see how much this impacts the Republican ticket overall.

One, that just because you had a good debate performance doesn't translate to a win in November. Hillary Clinton often came up in the conversations I was having from 2016. But also, the voters are still trying to get to know her.If you look deep into these polls, what you find is that voters are still saying they don't know enough about her, about her policies. And so this is also a play to try to get her out to a larger audience in addition to all of her campaign stops. But she directed reporters on it specifically this weekend. Take a listen.

Remember, in trying to introduce her, it also means hitting their airwaves. They already reserved $370 million in ads. And one of the ads that they ran North Carolina was tying Donald Trump to Mark Robinson. So they're trying to seize these moments. Those moments require money.

After all, Joe Biden, who had quite a head of steam under him at the end of the campaign in 2020, just barely carried it. He had a lot going for him then. I don't know if Kamala Harris will have quite that much going for her at the end, though. We'll see.Now, having said that, I find the New York Times/Siena poll difficult to swallow. Just a month ago, you had Kamala Harris in their polling, up five points. Now, a month later was the only significant event in between being the debate that almost everyone, including many members of the Trump staff, admitted that Harris won easily over Trump. Suddenly, Trump is up five points. That's a change of 10 points in a month with no clear cause. I just find that strange. You know, I look for strange things, you know?
