This was a lesson learned from that and the way they did this was basically textbook. Now, we zeroize these types of things, we erase the software, we make it unusable.",

Let's get straight out to our Chief Congressional Correspondent, Manu Raju. Manu, Eric Garcetti is the nominee and his nomination is in trouble.MANU RAJU, CNN'S CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It is. This is a rare cliff-hanger vote here in the United States senate. We don't know exactly how this will turn out. I just asked senate majority leader if they have the votes. He would not say, he said let's just watch what happens here on the floor. That's exactly what we are doing. There are several senators who are out with absences, various -- a variety of absences, some of them who actually might have supported Garcetti, which means that this is going to be very close. There needs to be a simple majority of senators who are voting in order to break a filibuster and advance this nomination to get to a final confirmation. But, Garcetti's nomination has been snarled for the last two years over allegations that he did not handle an accusation of sexual harassment against a top aide. He did not handle it appropriately, that he should have known about it and he sort of swept it under the rug. He has forcefully denied all of this and pointed to some probes that have exonerated him. One that did not was a Republican investigation led by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who said he should have known about all of this. And some Democrats seem to be concerned about this. Including Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, who told me moments ago he plans to vote against Garcetti. Also Senator Sherrod Brown is expected to vote no. So that's two no votes. But he did pick up two yes votes in the senate Foreign Relations Committee, which also vetted him and believed that those allegations were in the view of the supporters unfounded and did not have the merit that he knew and should have done something about these harassment allegations. Meantime, India, one of the biggest allies here, particularly to combat the threat of China, has been without an ambassador for the past two years. So a major push, but if Garcetti goes down here, John, India could -- the US could be without an ambassador and a key part of the world for some time to come. So a lot of eyes on this vote right now, John.",

What's interesting here is that there are some Democrats who've indicated they don't support Garcetti and there are a couple of Republicans, we think will support him. So that makes it even less able to clearly say how it's going to go. I think we should also note, there is, just like he's been campaigning behind the scenes to get confirmed, there have been people campaigning behind the scenes to say we done think he's the right person. There has been a big social media campaign as well to try to call out Garcetti and put him in a more negative light. So I think that's also influencing senators. They don't want to make the wrong choice and be caught later saying you confirmed someone who did some things that weren't the greatest.",
