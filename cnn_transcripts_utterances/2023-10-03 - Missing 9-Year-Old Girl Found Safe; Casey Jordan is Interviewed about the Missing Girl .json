Charlotte Sena's disappearance Saturday sparked an around-the-clock search involving hundreds of law enforcement agencies, the FBI and so many people. Ultimately, a ransom note is what led officials to Charlotte, where they were able to also then arrest 46-year-old Craig Ross Jr. in connection with her disappearance. Ross was arraigned overnight on a felony charge of kidnapping in the first degree.CNN's Jean Casarez joins us now with more on this. Jean, this is really a remarkable situation and how this has unfolded. What more are you learning now?",

This is what people are reading in this community this morning, either digitally or as a hard copy.And the defendant is right behind me in the Saratoga County Correctional Facility, charged with first degree kidnapping. Now, the case broke, believe it or not, beginning at 4:20 a.m. yesterday. According to the governor, while the family remained at the campsite as the searching continued, police were guarding the family's home. And they suddenly see a man come and deposit a letter in the mailbox. That letter turned out, according to law enforcement, to be a ransom note. They knew they needed a fingerprint. So, they worked all day. At 2:15 yesterday afternoon, they got a hit of a fingerprint that led them to a name, that led them to the residence of Craig Ross Jr., living behind his mother's home in a trailer. The SWAT team stormed into that trailer home at 6:30 last night. They apprehended him. And they found Charlotte in a cabinet. Now, here is what local law enforcement had to say about how this all began on Saturday. It was a very simple and nice family camping trip. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COL. RICHARD S. ALLEN, NEW YORK STATE POLICE: You know, Charlotte was no more than probably two tenths of a mile from where she was camping in a small area, and she was gone for -- for her to ride her bike around that loop would take her about four minutes, five minutes. You know, so you think they're safe doing that at nine years old, but you - you've just got to be cognizant and be paying attention to things around you, surroundings all the time. You know, these things happen in a hurry. And fortunately today this - this ended in the right way. (END VIDEO CLIP) CASAREZ: And he was arraigned in that initial court appearing in the early morning hours, charged at this point with that felony count of first degree kidnapping. Authorities are saying they do believe there could be additional charges. We just don't know when. Kate.",

But we don't get the feeling that this is like a JonBenet Ramsey kind of thing where the family is dripping in money. I mean they're of limited means. So, what could this man have thought he was going to get from his neighbors, this family, in terms of money? And they have three daughters. Why take just one of them? The ransom note being dropped in the mailbox was really just to throw the police off, to make them think that there's something else going on here. I mean he really underestimated the idea that they would have eyes on him and that that fingerprint from a DUI arrest 24 years ago would come back to haunt him. But, again, his mistake, his slip-up, that ransom note, which, again, was just to - to throw attention off what I think was a sexually motivated attack on the child, abduction of the child, that is what got him caught. So, you know, has mistake, that ransom note, is why Charlotte is with her parents safe today.",

He is going to be heading into that courtroom. You see him right there. He's set to be arraigned on three felony gun charges after that plea agreement fell apart over the summer back in July. He's expected to plead not guilty. This could be a quick in and out. But this is far from over, the end of the legal troubles facing Hunter Biden right now. We're going to continue to bring you those updates when they come. There's also this that we're watching. Quote, \"I'll take a back seat to no one on loyalty to this country.\" The newly retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff not mincing words and no longer really holding back about the attacks from and the dangers posed by Donald Trump. General Mark Milley is who we're talking about. He has his admirers. He has his critics. But there is no disputing that this relationship with the former president that he advised was contentious at best, toxic and combative near the close. Now, in new interviews, Milley is having his say since retiring on Trump calling Milley's actions treasonous for reaching out to his Chinese counterparts to reassure them about the stability of the U.S. government in the aftermath of January 6th. Milley responded this way to NBC News. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MARK MILLEY (RET.), FORMER JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN: Everyone is entitled to their opinion. And I've served my country faithfully for four and a half consecutive decades, in peace and war. And my family has made enormous sacrifices for this country. And my mother and father before me, and grandparents before them. So, I'll take a back seat on no one on loyalty to this country. And my loyalty is to the Constitution. It's to a document. It's never to an individual. And that's the loyalty to every single one of us in uniform. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because it doesn't look good for me. A person who is not truthful regarding his position on the protection of unborn life, on women, on minorities, on evangelical Christians, on Jews, on working men and women. A person that has no idea what America stand for and has no idea what America is all about.\" He continues, \"a person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators.
