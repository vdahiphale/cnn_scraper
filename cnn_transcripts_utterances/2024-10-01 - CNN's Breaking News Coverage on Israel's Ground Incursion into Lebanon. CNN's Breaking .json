You can see a thick haze is hanging over the city there after overnight Israeli airstrikes and some 200 kilometers up the coast from where we are here in southern Lebanon. Israel has started what it calls a limited ground operation, sending in paratroopers, commandos and members of the armored corps. The Israeli military says it is conducting, quote, \"targeted raids at the Israeli-Lebanese border.\" Israel says there will be no long-term occupation of southern Lebanon. Lebanese state media says strikes are underway at this hour in southern Lebanon and those attacks are causing severe damage. Meantime Hezbollah says it has targeted parts of northern Israel during the early morning hours. The U.S. says Israel informed it of a number of operations including the ground incursion. The U.S. National Security Council spokesperson told CNN that the mission can be a risk, a risk of mission creep as you will. The White House will keep discussing that with the Israelis. Alright, CNN's Paula Hancocks is in Abu Dhabi and she has been monitoring what is going on both over Beirut and in southern Lebanon and obviously this is a fast moving story. Paula, the announcement at least of the ground invasion coming around 2:00 am local time. We are now some hours into that operation. What further detail do we have?",

Thank you, Paula.Well, Malcolm Davis is a senior analyst for defense strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and he joins us live now. Firstly, your assessment of what you have heard and seen reported to date. We are some seven or so hours after the announcement of the ground offensive, incursion, invasion, call it what you will by Israeli troops albeit they suggest limited in scope. How do you assess what you are seeing to date? MALCOLM DAVIS, MILITARY ANALYST AND SR. ANALYST FOR DEFENSE STRATEGY AND CAPABILITY, AUSTRALIAN STRATEGIC POLICY INSTITUTE: Well, certainly, I think that the goal of the Israeli defense forces on the ground in this grounding incursion is to push Hezbollah forces back to the Litani River on the other side of that river to create a buffer zone, which is free of Hezbollah forces, particularly in terms of their ability to use short-range artillery, such as mortars and rockets, that sort of thing, so that Israeli citizens can return to northern Israel, to their towns and villages there, and in doing so, basically create a safe sector from which Israel can then prevent Hezbollah from infiltrating close to the border at the same time. You're seeing Israeli airstrikes continue both in support of that ground incursion, but also more directly against longer range, more distant targets such as continuing attacks on Hezbollah rockets and battlefield missiles.",

It also, at the same time, says it worries about mission creeps.So I guess that begs the question here. For how long does this go on? How -- how, what's the scope of this operation? Let's talk about what the threat is. There have been some 9,300 launches by Hezbollah on Israel since October the 8th, the day after the terrible massacre of people in Israel by Hamas. October the 8th was the first time that Hezbollah in this conflict launched strikes on Israel. What's the capacity of the terror group? And let's remind ourselves, they are, as far as at least their communications and their infrastructure, much depleted over the past couple of weeks. But when I talk about infrastructure, I'm talking about physical commanders and a chief, but the actual physical weaponry they have is vast at this point. Malcolm, could you just give us a sense of what the Israelis are up against it?",

And so I think that there is the risk that history will repeat itself. Israelis will go in for yet another limited incursion on the ground, but they'll get bogged down because they'll have to defend that demilitarized zone that exists along the Litani River.Obviously, the technology is different these days in terms of the ability for networked sensor systems to be able to monitor Hezbollah movements across the other side of that river. But there is the risk of Israeli forces getting bogged down, ending up in a similar situation to what happened then and essentially ending up in another quagmire where casualties are incurred on the Israeli side. That then has a political consequence for Benjamin Netanyahu's government and it also encourages other forces, Hamas, the Houthis, even Iran to take advantage of Israeli's predicament.",

We know that paratroopers, commandos and armored corps troops are now taking part in a ground operation in southern Lebanon. The IDF says it's taking aim at Hezbollah targets that threaten residents of northern Israel. Lebanese state media say the attacks on southern Lebanon caused severe damage, and Hezbollah says it has targeted parts of northern Israel during the early morning hours following the Israeli military incursion. Lebanon's capital Beirut also saw overnight Israeli airstrikes. The White House warning that mission creep can be a risk and discussions it says with the Israelis will go on. Lebanese officials report at least 95 people were killed within a 24- hour period on Monday. The government says about one million people, one million people have been forced from their homes. Well, H.A. Hellyer is a Middle East Studies scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies. He joins me today from Athens in Greece. This is, H.A., thank you for joining us, described as an incursion, limited in scope, clearly taking advantage of the momentum the Israelis have got since the successful targeting of key Hezbollah leaders, including the former chief Hassan Nasrallah. This is an invasion, call it what you will, this is an invasion, but it is a stated goal of the Israeli government here that they will restore security on their northern border for the some 60,000 odd more or more Israeli citizens who have been displaced since October the 8th. What do you make of what you have seen to date in the last few hours? H.A. HELLYER, MIDDLE EAST STUDIES SCHOLAR, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE, AND SR. ASSOCIATE FELLOW, ROYAL UNITED SERVICES INSTITUTE FOR DEFENSE AND SECURITY STUDIES: Well, thank you, Becky, for having me on your program. Always a pleasure to be here. It is an invasion. I think it's very unhelpful to describe it as an incursion, as we've seen many people do over the last few hours. This is a ground invasion across the border from the north of Israel. The stated aim, of course, as you mentioned, to restore deterrence and restore security for residents of northern Israel so they can go back to their homes. I'm not sure what the long-term strategy is, however. Tactically, of course, on a tactical level, the Israelis have been successful. They have managed to inflict a great deal of damage on Hezbollah, although I don't think Hezbollah has been destroyed by any means. I think it's been degraded. But they took out Hassan Nasrallah, the top military leadership. So certainly they've scored quite a lot of tactical wins in that regard. But in terms of long-term strategy, I'm not sure what actually exists here. I think this is a major problem for the Israelis. The north of Israel can only be secure if the south of Lebanon is also secure and if there's a recognized relationship and full normalization of relations with the Lebanese government and hitherto the Israelis have rejected the basic prerequisite of doing so when it comes to not only Lebanon, but to the majority of -- well, not just the majority, but really the overwhelming majority of the Arab world. And that's resolving the issue of Gaza and more widely the Palestinian question. So I think what we've seen is just use of force --",

      "sentences": "So I think it's undeniable that when it comes to Hezbollah's record in the region, if you look at how it's engaged within Lebanon with its opponents, if you look at how it engaged in Syria in support of the Assad regime, its record is awful and looks quite odious.Having said that, if the supposition is that the degradation of Hezbollah can come at any cost, then we're in for a really wild and very destructive ride. When the Israelis took out Hassan Nasrallah, they leveled six residential buildings in the south of Beirut in order to get him. And right now the quote-unquote \"degrading of Hezbollah\" is happening with huge numbers of airstrikes all over Lebanon, resulting in more than a million people displaced in Lebanon. So I think that we have to be very careful here about what we think are acceptable losses or acceptable repercussions in order to gain what is defined as a tactical victory by the Israelis. And I don't think that anybody is really centering the lives of the people of Lebanon in this particular context. When we talk about the region and the region's leaders, I'm sure that there are many who are not unhappy to see the power of Hezbollah decrease. I happen to be one of those who are sympathetic in that regard, but the cost of that is really quite extreme at present, which is why you see not only leaders in the region but also many around the world, including in the West, calling for a ceasefire, of course, not only in Lebanon, but also in Gaza. And as much as the Israelis and D.C. want to decouple what's happening in Lebanon from what is happening in Gaza, I think it's very difficult to do, because the overarching issue here is all about that. And when we saw even a ceasefire, a temporary one, take place in November, you saw diminished tensions across the region from the Houthis to Hezbollah and elsewhere. When you see an increase in that regard, then you see more tensions. And I think we have to look at this in a very holistic manner in order to bring security for all.",

It was just earlier today, not far from here, at Tiananmen Square, where we saw a flag raised in a very big ceremony. There were balloons.

They've just put out a draft resolution claiming that his treatment was disproportionate, saying that he qualifies as a political prisoner.He didn't detail exactly how he plans to continue to advocate for freedom of speech. That certainly is going to be something to watch. One other thing to note, Max, is that he was very critical as he outlined the various abuses that he's faced over the years, very critical of the Trump administration, the first Trump administration, in particular, claiming that they ran a campaign of retribution against him. That was after WikiLeaks published documents purporting to show CIA hacking tools in 2017. He claims his family and he were targeted by the CIA. This timing of this may hint at another motive. Obviously, we're just over a month out from the U.S. election where we may see Trump re-elected. So perhaps it's a warning, especially since there's been noises from Trump during this campaign that he may still be willing to pursue cases against journalists. But the other thing is that he claims his recovery from his ordeal is still incomplete, that the isolation he said is taking its toll and expressing himself in this setting is a challenge. But Wikileaks has said that he decided to do this to come all the way from Australia to Europe because this is an exceptional circumstance to try to get his message across.",
