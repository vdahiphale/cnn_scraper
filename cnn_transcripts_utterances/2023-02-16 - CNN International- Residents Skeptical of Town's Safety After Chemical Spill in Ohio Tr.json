May 14th will never be the same for me.JIMENEZ (voice-over): It wasn't just emotions. It was reliving May 14, 2022, all over again. The shooter walked into a Tops Supermarket in Buffalo and killed 10, wounding three others with the express intent of killing black people. In court, the shooter apologized, but it didn't seem to have any impact. BRIAN TALLEY, GERALDINE TALLEY'S BROTHER-IN-LAW: How can you possibly get any kind of -- how can you possibly stand up here and say that you're sorry? The hatred that you must have in your heart for black people, I would never understand. I don't want to understand it. But I must say this, I pray to God, they do not kill you.",

They say that they hit the TOS-1 multiple rocket launcher, a Russian rocket launcher that's capable of firing weapons with thermobaric warheads. And they say the one they hit did have those warheads.You can see from the scale of the explosion there that that is potentially plausible. Thermobaric warheads, of course are commonly known as vacuum bombs. They are very destructive, much more so than conventional munitions. They suck the sort of oxygen out of the surrounding area. And for that reason -- although they're not explicitly banned under the Geneva Convention, they are extremely controversial because of the sort of mass casualty impacts that they can have. And we know that Russia has been deploying these kinds of weapons sporadically throughout the war. Most recently there has been evidence of it being used on the front lines in Donetsk. So, a big prize, as you say, to Ukraine. The head of the president's office calling this a nice picture.",

But attention really turned to ammunition. Because Jens Stoltenberg was warning -- the Secretary-General of NATO -- that essentially Ukraine is going through ammunition faster than it can be produced by NATO allies.So now the attention has to turn among NATO countries, really to the military industrial complex, how they can ramp up production. And we have seen promises of the fact that they are going to try and do that. So, this is a stage we're at in the war that has shifted the calculus for NATO countries is to how they can keep their own stock replenished at the same time they're supporting Ukraine.",
