Witnesses describing the horrific scene, saying they saw people burning alive in their tents. Officials say four people were killed, dozens more injured. Israel says it was conducting a, quote, \"precise strike\" on a Hamas command center. The United States, for its part, is deepening its involvement as thewars escalate, sending one of its most powerful anti-missile systems to Israel, plus around 100 troops, which are needed to operate it. The THAAD defense system is capable of intercepting ballistic missiles at a range of up to 200 kilometers. The Pentagon says it will help to bolster Israel's security after two unprecedented attacks on Israel by Iran this year. A CNN military analyst says it will also be helpful against Hezbollah. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: What we're seeing is a massive increase in the number of missiles and drones that Hezbollah is firing into Israel. The first 10 months of this war, they were firing anywhere from 30 to 50 per day. Over the last three days, they fired somewhere around 300 per day. This is the best system in the world, and there is only six of them, six batteries of these in the United States inventory. So, loaning one and deploying a group of soldiers to Israel is a pretty big deal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In that context, there are other conversations. We know that Amos Hochstein, who has been the U.S. diplomat, who has been trying to work out some diplomacy between Israel and Hezbollah, was in Lebanon meeting with the Prime Minister just a couple of days ago. So, that goes on.Iran, in the meantime, is having its own outreach all across the region and issuing threats. But, I think when it comes to that THAAD defensive system, it really signals this sort of ironclad guarantee about Israel's security the United States gives, but also, in a way, kind of gives the United States a little bit of buy-in on the timing of when Israel may strike back at Iran, a lot of pressure from the United States on Israel to be proportionate when it strikes back at Iran for Iran's ballistic missile strikes here two weeks ago. And until that THAAD system is set up, the defense and protection afforded to civilians and the population here in Israel won't be at its best until that's ready and installed. So, when that's installed, perhaps that is the moment, or after that moment that Israel would choose to strike back at Iran. But, before then, when it's still being established, maybe not, and that's why I say the United States has some sort of buy-in of when Israel's strike back at Iran may happen. And this is a sort of diplomacy. That's how it works out.",

CNN's latest Poll of Polls showing an average of 50 percent of likely voters would support Vice President Kamala Harris. 47 percent say they're backing former President Donald Trump. Of course, you factor in those margins of error. There is no clear leader at this point, as you can see, and especially when we look at those battleground states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, three of them, you can see just how close this is. The campaigns, of course, also looking at those numbers, and they'rehoping to make gains wherever they can. You've likely heard a lot in the last few days about the focus on black and Latino voters. The latest New York Times/Siena College poll shows Vice President Harris leading Trump with 56 percent of the Hispanic vote. That's a number that's concerning to Democrats, actually, because what it shows is an erosion in support for Democrats compared to the last two elections. The Vice President has also been struggling with black men. Over the weekend in North Carolina, the Harris campaign unveiling some new economic proposals aimed at black men, specifically Harris talking about a million loans for entrepreneurs and small businesses and the creation of apprenticeship programs. Today, she is at a rally in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Then it will be on to Detroit Tuesday for a town hall event with the popular radio host Charlamagne Tha God, who, of course, has a massive following and particularly a big following among black millennials. Ahead of that sit-down, Harris is painting a dark picture of what she says would be a second Trump presidency. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Just imagine Donald Trump with no guard rails, he who has vowed, if reelected, he would be a dictator on day one, that he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies.

      "sentences": "Well, today and for much of this week, it's going to be doubling down on black voter outreach and trying to fill the void of what her agenda would look like, if she were to win in November. And so, today, that focus especially is on the economy and her economic proposals. Let me read you some of what her team has unveiled that she'll speak more about later today, which includes forgivable loans to entrepreneurs up to $20,000, apprenticeship promotion and legalizing recreational marijuana, along with some other measures that, again, she'll detail here at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania.When taken together, it is a sweeping proposal and plan, but it is also coming at a crucial time, at a time when Democrats and the Vice President's campaign have seen an erosion of support with black voters. Of course, they still have the majority of black voters backing the campaign, but the main concern is that people either won't show up to vote or that they'll vote for her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump. So, they are trying to make up that ground. Some of this, of course, is an extension of what the Vice President was doing over the weekend in North Carolina, where, for example, yesterday in Greenville, she spoke at a church service, and over the course of the weekend, she met with black faith leaders and black elected officials. So, certainly, an all-out effort here to try to make sure that she can lock down this part of the coalition. Tomorrow, she'll also be in Detroit, where she is going to participate, as you mentioned, in that radio town hall with Charlamagne Tha God, who also has -- is popular on the radio and has more than half, millions of listeners, more than half of whom are black. Now, of course, the other part of the messaging here in Pennsylvania is going to be something that we also heard from the Vice President this weekend, which is that the former President's team is trying to hide him by not releasing his medical records or putting him up to do that 60 Minutes interview. Of course, the Vice President did both of those over the course of the last several days. So, that is also a threat that the Vice President is likely to be pulling on this week, which is essentially describing her own proposals, but also including this line of attack against the former President by suggesting that he is not being transparent with voters.

So, if you look overall at that poll, it was about -- it was 12 percent overall. But, broken down by age for voters under 35, 18 percent, so, more, said they could still change their mind. There is this real push, again, for the candidates to meet them where they are, as we were just discussing, but also to better understand them.

They're incredibly passionate about the issues at stake, and the reason that they don't vote at the same rates as older voters is because they're new voters. They're going through this process for the first time. That looks very archaic compared to their daily lives.So, it's important for organizations like Rock the Vote, or campaigns who want to be able to turn them out to actually walk them through the steps to vote, including from registration, but also helping them find their polling place, helping them understand what's at the ballot, that this election is about the presidency, but also there is so much more on the ballot down to local races and ballot measures as well.",

And as a result, we've also seen several states try and pass laws to make it harder for young people to vote, things like restrictive voter ID laws, moving polling places off college campuses. So, there is a real effort to try and suppress the youth voters, which goes to my message to campaigns of young voters are critical.

And President Biden has insisted that the federal government will be there for the long haul to try to help these communities, not just in Florida, but also places like western North Carolina, as the areas were devastated by Hurricane Helene and then Hurricane Milton. Now, President Biden was on the ground there in St. Petersburg, Florida, for several hours, seeing the devastation firsthand. He was joined there by two Republicans, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and Senator Rick Scott, though Governor Ron DeSantis was not on hand for this event. But, President Biden has talked about how they have had a very cooperative working relationship, as they had tried to help get resources into devastated communities down in Florida.Now, as the President saw this damage firsthand, his White House is also grappling with eventually asking Congress to provide more aids for FEMA disaster relief. President Biden has said that that should be a top priority for lawmakers. But, so far, the White House has yet to put a price tag on exactly how much funding they want to ask Congress for, FEMA Administrator, Deanne Criswell, last week, had said that they had already run through about half of the $20 billion that Congress had recently approved for disaster relief funding, are really speaking to some of the challenges that they're facing in this moment. Officials have insisted that they have enough to address the immediate needs of that hurricane response for Helene and for Milton, but their concern now is what other natural disasters could pop up around the corner. So far, House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he does not plan to bring the House back early to try to address this issue, but this is something that the administration is expected to put some pressure on Congress to do, as they say, that these FEMA funds, that funds for the Small Business Administration, all really need to be ramped up in preparation for other natural disasters. Now, Biden, while he was on the ground there, did announce about $600 million to enhance electrical grids across the country, including about $94 million for projects in the state of Florida specifically, really trying to show that the federal government is offering assistance where they can to try to help these communities still reeling after this disaster.",

And for the first time, the rocket booster was successfully navigated back to Earth. The so-called super heavy booster measures roughly the same as a 20-storey building. It was caught in midair by a pair of metal pincers, which are called chopsticks. It's a key part of SpaceX's mission there to recover and reuse equipment to make space exploration a little cheaper. And not content with just one mission, SpaceX has another one planned in just about 15 minutes, actually. The Europa Clipper is scheduled to launch from Florida with a mission to Europa. That's one of Jupiter's moons.As my colleague Michael Holmes explains, it's a journey that's a long one. It's expected to take about seven years. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDET (voice-over): A vast ocean in a moon hundreds of millions of miles away. That's what NASA's new and largest planetary spacecraft is set to explore. Scientists believe that Europa, one of Jupiter's many moons, is one of the most promising places to look for life beyond Earth. The moon, about the same size as our own, is thought to have beneath its icy surface an ocean of water, perhaps encompassing the entire moon.",

The Europa Clipper is about 16 feet or nearly five meters tall and more than 100 feet or about 30 meters wide. That's about the length of a basketball court. The scale of the Clipper is primarily due to its massive solar arrays. Another big feat for this spacecraft is a poem. ADA LIMON, U.S. POET LAUREATE: Still, there are mysteries below our sky. HOLMES (voice-over): U.S. poet laureate Ada Limon wrote an original poem dedicated to NASA's Europa Clipper mission. The poem will be engraved on the spacecraft as a way to connect the two worlds, Earth and Europa.",
