By this time, he was better known by his nickname, Pele, and in 1958, at 17, he became the youngest man to play in a World Cup Final, scoring twice as Brazil beat Sweden. It was the first of three world titles he'd helped win for his country. He electrified audiences with his fancy footwork and ability to score seemingly impossible goals.

Seeing Brazilians excel like he did, that is so special for Brazil. I cannot tell you how special was to see Pele in the world stage being himself and getting all of that attention, and having that charisma, bringing the world's eyes to Brazil. And also, to do that as a black man in the 1960s, he became an icon and someone -- a role model for young black poor children in Brazil. They now could look up to someone and say, hey, I could be like this man one day. I could have that kind of success, that kind of recognition, we can succeed. I say he was the first Brazilian to show our excellence to the world, and that is how he is being remembered today. That is why it's such a shock. You know, over the past 30 days, we've been following updates on his health slowly deteriorating, but still yesterday here at the hospital, we saw people coming in and saying, I didn't think Pele would die.

Flights coming from China will be partially reduced and passengers must present a negative test before entering. Spain also requiring a negative test for vaccination. And after imposing mandatory testing on travelers coming from India, Italy is now asking the entire European Union to follow suit.

And people remember that very well here. We are seeing now from this government restrictions have gone really further than anywhere else in the world at this point. They are requiring the pre-boarding COVID test showing you're negative. You also need another one within 24 hours of arrival. You mentioned the short-term visas will be put on hold. There are some exceptions to that. But beyond that, if a foreign national who is here on a short-term visa test positive, they have to go to a facility to quarantine. The residents, they can quarantine at home. And also any flights coming from China regionally around South Korea will all now land at Incheon airport, this is the main airport here in Seoul, so that they can make sure that it is all coordinated. And also, the number of flights will be partially reduced until the end of February. So South Korea is really going one step further than many countries who have said that they will check there is no COVID coming into the country.

The Italians of course had a very different experience with COVID,especially early on at the beginning of the pandemic almost three years ago. They were the first ones then to restrict some of these flights and the rest of the European Union said no, don't do that. It's not necessary. So I think, you know, just like, as Paul is saying, South Korea, it really depends a lot on the experience that people had here. People lost a lot here, a lot of people died, the economy was ruined. We were locked down. You know, Italy was one of the last countries to lift the testing requirements, too, not so long ago. And I think that Giorgia Meloni right now, the new prime minister, wants to make sure she keeps her country safe, as safe as possible. And I think she really fears that there's going to be some new variant more than anything that appears perhaps because the vaccines in China aren't as effective, and perhaps there's going to be some news like that. And I think she just is looking at what happened three years ago and saying, we're going to take this our own way, we're going to not listen to what everybody else says, we're going to protect Italians as best we can.

We do know that dozens of people have been affected by smoke inhalation. We know that people have lost their lives in this blaze to that. Others jumped from windows in their desperation. Now, in terms of the search and rescue, what happens next, we know that all Thai rescue teams have wrapped up their operations. They have now withdrawn from the site and the Cambodian authorities have said that remaining parts of the building will require heavy machinery to be brought in. But for now, rescue teams have been everywhere that they can go, searching for the missing on foot. Perhaps a more disturbing element of this is they are keeping freezer trucks running for the bodies, those who have not yet been identified.
