Now this happened in North West Rafah, it was in a displaced persons camp where there were tents, there were makeshift shelters and according to Gaza's Ministry of Health, they say that most of those who were killed and injured were women and children saying that no hospital had the capacity in the area to be able to cope with the scale and the number of those killed and injured.Now we know also from the Gaza government media office that this was designated as a safe zone and this is an area where some had moved to after being evacuated by the Israeli military and other parts of Rafah notably, in the East. Now we've had a response a statement from the Israeli military they say that they did carry out an air strike, they struck a Hamas compound in Rafah and they say that they killed two senior Hamas officials. One of them a commander of Hamas' leadership in the West Bank. Now they do acknowledge that there was a fire, reports of a fire, they say they see reports of civilians being harmed as well and they are conducting a review of the incident. Now we know a large fire did break out in that area. There are horrific images. On social media there are images obtained by CNN, where we see the bodies and the injured being pulled from those burning tents. Now we saw firefighters, paramedics, also the displaced desperately trying to put those fires out. Now also earlier this Sunday, we saw her mass fire eight missiles at Israeli territory, and for the first time since the end of January, they targeted Tel Aviv there were no reports of casualties. But we heard from the Israeli military that Hamas is operating in Rafah. They have hostages in Rafah and this is why they need to operate there. But the fact of course, that more than seven months, well over seven months into this war, Hamas is still able to fire rockets into Israeli territory does raise questions and it does also put more pressure on the Israeli government to come up with not just a military strategy, but also a political plan for the day after the wall.

Why are we seeing more and more incidents involving this severe turbulence? What's going on?O'BRIEN: Well, scientists will tell you Rosemary that climate change might have a little something to do with this as the earth heats up and heats up unevenly by both latitude and altitude. And that perturbs the jet streams in ways we can't totally predict. And when I say jet streams, you have to imagine the clear blue sky being layer cakes, kind of rivers of air, many of the moving at hundreds of kilometers per hour. Sometimes at cross currents, sometimes the speed changes. And as an aircraft, particularly at high altitude as both of these cases occurred, moves to those air streams. Sudden changes can relate to sudden changes in lift on the wing. So the aircraft is going along. And all of a sudden, that lift diminishes and down it goes and it goes suddenly. And if you're not attached to the aircraft, you have a problem.",

If you have an infant in your lap, you might want to think about using the car seat to keep them attached to the aircraft as well. And the other thing I would ask the airlines to consider is their poor flight attendants. 80 percent of the injuries in these cases, statistically, not surprisingly, are the flight attendants who are out and about trying to serve us meals, they should sit them down more frequently, frankly, when this -- when there is a hint of this happening, when we know about that pilot ahead warning of turbulence, they should be seated just in case.

And we need to be cognizant of the fact that when we're several kilometers above the surface of the Earth, approaching 800 kilometers per hour, we're not in our living room watching a movie.

So because of the whole idea of, you know, the distance between the moment as it were. So if you want -- if you're really nervous about it, get a seat by the wing, buckle up and hang on tight.

And this matters Rosemary at the heart of it, essentially, because this is all about minimizing miscommunication, minimizing the chance for any sort of escalation to break out between these three countries, because tensions here in Asia are so high right now with the United States, pulling Korea and Japan closer into its orbit. And then conversely, China pulling Russia, Russia closer to its center of gravity. So you know, Rosemary, it's astonishing. It's very notable that this meeting is even happening at all, because it's been on ice for the past four and a half years.

As you said I mean, it's a hugely cautionary tale and a very, very large problem in the country.Essentially, host clubs are bars or clubs where young, usually attractive men, flirt with women, entertain them, pour them drinks. And though this sounds like it's all fun and games in theory, in reality from what we found through our reporting is that these host clubs deliberately make women pay an exorbitant amount after clubs make them spend way beyond their means, usually with emotional manipulation or the threat of violence. Now, once they make these women pay a huge, huge amount and shoulder these massive debts, they then introduce them to sex work to pay off these debts. And then the host, of course, take a cut of that profit made. Now, this has become a huge problem in the country and has left hundreds of victims. So host clubs have announced that they would self-regulate and that by April they would ban underage girls from entering their clubs and also prevent women from shouldering these massive debts. But according to the lawmakers, the victims and the aid groups that we've spoken to that simply is not the case. There are still victims in Japan who are made to work in prostitution, both at home and abroad. We spoke to a victim of this specific type of romance scam earlier this year, a woman named Yu (ph), who told us about how she lost everything and how she was trafficked overseas to pay her debts. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) YU, VICTIM OF JAPAN HOST CLUB ROMANCE SCAM (through translator): I've hit rock bottom. I don't know if I can start over again.
