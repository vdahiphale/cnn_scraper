You know, they -- did you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything deleted and destroyed all of it. All of it. Because of lots of things like Nikki Haley is in charge of security. We offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guards, whatever they want, they turned it down. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's on the eve of the New Hampshire primary. And, you know, primaries past and campaign seasons past something like this might have been a real problem for Haley (ph), maybe not for Donald Trump.

But this is certainly an issue right now that the Trump campaign doesn't want to have to address all these other policy issues, these internal Republican battles, Trump is going to be fine with but when it comes out about a vulnerability to a 77-year-old man who has been making the same argument against his opponent, yeah, they are concerned.",

As Mark was just saying, this is the MAGA party. This is the Donald Trump party. And so to get the nomination against Donald Trump, you have to somehow convince people that Trump is no longer up to the job or can't win in November, but not offend them so much that they won't vote for you. And it's a near impossibility. We know New Hampshire is very different.

And perhaps he's going to start meeting with as Larry was noted, there's very few image evangelicals in New Hampshire, but the reality is there tend to be his voters.
