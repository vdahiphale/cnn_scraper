      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Jim Sciutto in today for my colleague Isa Soares. Tonight, aterrifying incident mid-flight leaves one person dead, dozens more injured. What we're learning about severe turbulence aboard a Singapore Airlines flight. Then Donald Trump's defense team resting its case in the former president's criminal hush money trial. What we've heard today, and what comes next, and how quickly. Plus, CNN rides along with Ukrainian drone unit using surprising new strategies to fight Russia's advances on northeastern Ukraine. That important and much more coming up this hour. We do begin tonight with a rare occurrence in the skies, turbulence, so severe, it caused a death on board. Take a look at this damage inside that Singapore Airlines jet, damaged equipment hanging from the ceiling, those oxygen mask, glass and cutlery thrown on the floor. The flight from London to Singapore hit what authorities called an air pocket rapidly dropping, then climbing again in the space of just 90 seconds. The incident forced the plane to divert as you can see here, landing in Bangkok instead. The turbulence left at least 71 people on board injured, six in critical condition. Airport officials say a 73 year-old British man who had a previous heart condition has died. CNN's Gabe Cohen is following the latest developments, he joins me now. Good to see you Gabe, but 71 people injured on that jet. What do we know about their condition and how many are in serious condition?",

      "sentences": "Well, we know 71 people injured, Jim, as you mentioned, six of them in critical condition, at least one American who wason board that plane was injured as well. We're hearing about broken bones, potential head injury, a lot of cuts and bruises and we'll likely learn more about the conditions of those passengers in the hours and days ahead. We know that they were nearing the end of the flight, flying over Myanmar when this happened, when they likely encountered some really rapidly developing thunderstorms that were in the area. We don't know if that was the cause of this at this time, but we know that those weather patterns were unfolding as it played out. And we do have flight data that shows what the plane did during those seconds. It made some really extremely violent maneuvers, suddenly dropping and then climbing, dropping and then climbing again. All of that within just 90 seconds, and just after that, we can see the plane start to reroute and make its way to Bangkok where it made that emergency landing. And you can only imagine, Jim, what the passengers were experiencing during those 90 seconds. Just looking at the pictures of the damage inside the plane. We are talking about parts of the ceiling, the luggage compartments collapsing, other objects that were flying around the cabin. We have also seen images of medics on the ground in Bangkok carrying passengers out on stretchers. It was not just a violent scene. It was an emotional scene once they got to the airport -- here's how the director of the airport in Bangkok described what he saw. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KITTIPONG KITTIKACHOM, DIRECTOR OF SUVAMABHUMI AIRPORT (through translator): The plane landed at the airport and the medical team was sent to the scene. Many injuries occurred. So, the airport had to issue an emergency plan. All our teams went to help and also found one man had died. This kind of incident rarely happens where there's death after a plane has hit a severe turbulence. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And to answer your question, Jim, there are people who do post on Donald Trump's Truth Social account. However, there are very few of them, I believe only two. And I'm not going to name names right now because I have not yet confirmed who was the person who re-shared this. However, there are very few people who actually have access to his Truth Social profile. So, I want you to keep that in mind. But, look, I do want to just walk you through some of the reaction we've had to this, and also just to respond to them deleting this video this morning. That came after hours of this being up. So, a lot of Networks, including ours, had reached out to the Trump campaign asking about this video. And we got that statement from Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson. But then we also asked -- or I asked at least, why has this not been removed? And this video was posted yesterday on his Truth Social account. And it wasn't until mid-morning today that it was removed. And so, I mean, I think it's pretty astonishing how many hours it remained up online. Now, I do also just want to point to you some of the backlash that this is receiving. We've saw the Biden campaign and to the White House swiftly respond to this. A White House spokesperson, Andrew Bates, said that it was abhorrent, sickening, and disgraceful. He added that any, any antisemitic dog whistling is dangerous and offensive. We also heard directly from the vice president, Kamala Harris. She addressed this at a campaign event in Philadelphia. She said that this kind of rhetoric is unsurprising coming from the former president, and it is appalling. And she added that we got to tell him who we are. And so, we also heard from Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, and she said that President Joe Biden is expected to address this directly when he makes remarks tonight in Boston. But look, I do just want to put a fine point on this, Jim, and kind of lay out the context of this. Donald Trump has, in the past, made antisemitic tropes. He often criticizes Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats. He blamed many Jewish Americans for not being pro-Jewish enough or being pro- Israel enough for not voting for him in the last election. He's also used antisemitic rhetoric in the past when he called -- he argued that immigrants are poisoning the blood of the country or referring to his enemies as vermin. That is language that has been directly linked and argued by -- credited to Adolf Hitler being similar to Adolf Hitler. And so, this is something we have seen in the past. But I will also add that the fact that they removed this at all, I think, shows that the Trump campaign recognizes that this was a big issue. Jim.",
