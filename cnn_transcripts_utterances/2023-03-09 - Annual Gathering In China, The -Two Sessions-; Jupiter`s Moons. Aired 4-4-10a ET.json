But after today`s meetingended, we had a few minutes to approach some delegates, which are a curated group of local representatives. This delegate is part of the Zhuang ethnic group from the southwestern Guangxi province. She says, this is her first time attending the Congress and she feels happy to see her motherland becoming stronger. The rest of the delegates quickly rush out before we have a chance to approach them. The question is, how much of these COVID controls will remain in post pandemic China? It limits access even more to China`s already extremely opaque political machine. This much is clear, the communist leadership only wants the world to see one narrative from China, that is the image of unity, strength and victory. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Ten-second trivia. Which of these holds the current title of planet at the most moons?Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, or Venus? To date, astronomers have identified 92 moons orbiting Jupiter, giving it the top spot. And it is one of those moons, specifically that scientists are getting ready to explore more. Why? Because they think that there may be life there. The name of the moon is Europa. And it`s already been discovered that just beneath Europa`s icy surface there`s an ocean. In fact, it was the first ocean ever discovered on another celestial body. Let`s learn more about the probes that NASA and the European Space Agency are sending to Jupiter and its moons and what they might find. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Jupiter has three moons with oceans underneath their icy shells. They`re called Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. Earthlings havebeen curious about these moons and their potential to house life for a long time. NASA first sent probes in part to get a closer look in 1977. Jupiter is a gas giant. That means it doesn`t have a surface. It`s a swirl of gases that can dense into a smoldering ocean of hydrogen at its core. It`s very similar to our sun in this way. But unlike the sun, it doesn`t fuse hydrogen atoms into helium to create energy and heat. Now back to those first NASA probes, they observed long lines and dark spots on the moon Europa. Typically, moons have cratered surfaces. But these images tipped scientists off that there might be an ocean beneath Europa`s icy exterior. In 1996, that theory was confirmed when the Galileo spacecraft reached Europa. It was the first ocean discovered on another planet. Then, in 2012 and 2016, the Hubble Space Telescope showed water plumes erupting from the warmest parts of Europa. Scientists don`t know much about the plumes. But if Europa has water and elements like carbon and hydrogen, it could mean that microbial life once formed there or even still exists. Armed with that possibility, the European Space Agency and NASA are sending probes deep into our solar system to look specifically at Jupiter`s icy moons. First is the Jupiter icy moons explorer or JUICE from the ESA. JUICE is traveling to the Jupiter system armed with the latest technology to take photos, observe the magnetic field of Jupiter and take readings of what is beneath the icy crusts of Jupiter`s large moons. Later, NASA will send the Europa Clipper to fly by its namesake over 40 times to sniff its atmosphere. It will gather material from the plumes for the first time. And that will give scientists a better idea if Europa`s oceans could support life. The missions will gather data. They will also aim to gather insights into fundamental questions about our universe. Is there life beyond Earth? What might that look like? And what does that mean for the future of humanity? (END VIDEOTAPE)",
