Just moments ago police holding a news conference in Chester County, Pennsylvania, as the search enters its 11th day. And this comes as officials say Cavalcante is no longer in the Phoenixville area, even though he was spotted there last night on a doorbell camera of a former work associate after changing his appearance. Police say the fugitive was seen driving this van stolen from a nearby dairy farm. They say they have recovered the van without Cavalcante inside. CNN's Polo Sandoval is joining us right now. They have expanded the search but do they seem to be concentrating on a particular area there in western Pennsylvania?",

Investigators believe that it was last night that he was able to actually get that -- to steal that truck and then make his way north near Phoenixville, specifically in the East Pikeland Township. And that's where this ring camera video appears to show him clean shaven, fresh set of clothes, knocking on the door of a work acquaintance. We're told that he only spent some time there before he eventually gave up and then he started heading west to East Nantmeal Township, and that is where Pennsylvania State Police told me he literally ran out of gas and had to ditch that van. And so that is the general area where authorities say that they have set up a, quote, \"temporary perimeter\" but they have nothing to indicate that he could potentially still be there. And that's really what fueling some criticism here with many people are wondering and asking some very important questions, how hundreds of law enforcement personnel who believe they had contained this 34- year-old escaped convict were able to not notice him slip away and arrest him and that, as you're about to hear from one of the members of the Pennsylvania State Police has, quote, \"no excuse.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE: I'm not going to make any excuse to you. I wish it had not happened. Unfortunately there are a lot of circumstances, there are a lot of issues associated with that property, tunnels, very large drainage ditches, things that could not be secured. You couple that with weather, aviation being down for a night. There are a number of reasons. Again, no excuses. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So right now what we need to do and what law enforcement is doing is they're waiting for the next incident to happen. They'll know where to set their perimeter up at that point.The other good tool we're going to have now is now that he's moving out of the area, if he is going to be in a vehicle and we can identify that vehicle, the state troopers will get involved. They're normally -- interdiction and very good at identifying vehicles. This is going to be a culmination of law enforcement in totality to bring this to an end. Fugitives move.

Residents say entire villages were damaged leaving some rescuers unable to retrieve bodies from the rubble. Emergency teams are now racing to find survivors in these critical hours.CNN senior international correspondent Sam Kiley went to one isolated village that was completely destroyed and here's his story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): People here in Asni, in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains, have thought that when this earthquake struck and it did this, they didn't so much feel the tremors as feel that they were being caught up in some kind of war. And that is exactly what it looks like. They didn't feel the ground shaking under them, they said, they felt and heard the sounds of explosions, explosions from within and without their own homes, and explosions up in the hills. And 25 people were killed in the town of Moulay Ibrahim which is just about three kilometers, a mile and a half or so from here. This is normally a tourist paradise, not just for foreigners but for locals, too. Some of the victims still be left buried under the rubble because it's too dangerous to get them out are actually Moroccans who were up in these mountains enjoying the cooler temperatures in the summer. Everybody we're talking to here, though, has got a complaint that the central government is really nowhere to be seen in their words. We have seen some evidence of their help with these yellow tents, offering temporary accommodation here. In Asni, that's accommodation for 1200 people who've lost their homes or whose homes are now uninhabitably dangerous. These areas have been struck in the last 24 hours by at least four aftershocks local people tell us. And they're saying they're just not getting the help that they need. Inevitably there is always going to be a level of frustration from people hit with this cataclysmic event but there are dozens of these villages all over this region and for that reason it is the hardest hit region in all Morocco where the death toll continues to climb well over 2,000 now.

The president was greeted with a ceremony when he arrived at Hanoi's presidential palace earlier today. The U.S. is seeking to strengthen its ties with Vietnam and counter the influence of China and Russia in that part of the world.President Biden's trip comes at a moment of heightened tension with China, and just today after he traveled to India for the G20 Summit. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin did not attend the G20. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live for us in Hanoi.

And what's really significant here is that the move that President Biden made today to upgrade the U.S. relationship with Vietnam, putting the U.S. on the highest tier of diplomatic relations that Vietnam maintains on par with countries like China and Russia. This is a move that's really just the latest in a series of steps that President Biden has taken to get closer to a number of China's neighbors.Within the last five months, President Biden has hosted the Philippines' president at the White House for the first visit by a Filipino president in more than a decade. He held a state dinner for the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and he also hosted this very symbolic summit at Camp David with the South Korean and Japanese leaders. And all of those countries are united, if not by an outright alarm, sense of alarm about China, then at least by a growing sense of concern and a wariness about the ways in which China is throwing around its military and economic might in this region. And so President Biden both here as well as at the G20 where we saw him reach out to developing nations to try and put himself as a better partner, the United States as a better partner than China, to the developing world, he is really trying to counterbalance China's appeal to the developing world and its influence, its sphere of influence here in Aia. But the president even as he takes all of those steps, he's also trying to send a message to China, to the Chinese leader Xi Jinping saying that the United States is not trying to contain Beijing.

Right now a category two borderline. It's got 110 miles per hour winds. If we reach 111, that's back to a category three. It's moving to the west, northwest at about eight miles per hour. The last two frames of this deal with a little bit better. We will get another update from the hurricane center in the next half hour or so, so we'll see if there is strengthen indeed.But this is expected to strengthen back into a category three, possibly category four by midweek. And then it will enter some cooler waters left over by Franklin, if you remember that one, and so that could cause some weakening to a category two or even one by the time we get to the end of the week, but this one is going to be a slow mover. So we will have a long time to watch this and talk about it. Several different scenarios here. This is expected to take that sharp turn to the north but exactly when that takes place will make all the difference with how close or far this is from the U.S. mainland. And so that's going to be the big question moving forward. Basically these two areas of high pressure is going to steer right in between this low that's over the Midwest. It will sort of push it across the north and east and follow that path, but two possible paths, one would be a little closer to the U.S., one farther away so the closer it is obviously, Fred, we're going to have more impacts to the U.S. coast like rip currents, high surf, things like that. So it's too early to tell if we'll see greater impacts that than or not. I think we'll have a clearer picture by the middle part of the week. But yes, this has been a very powerful storm in the past and the potential to be a powerful storm in the coming days. So one definitely to watch.",

And remember, he has been absolutely defiant up until this point. But this statement released literally within the last 10 or 20 minutes, I'm going to bring it up on the screen so you can see it.He said, \"Today, I notified the interim president at 9 30 p.m., Mr. Pedro Rocha, that I have resigned as president of the Spanish Football Federation. I have also let him know that I have resign my position in UEFA\", that's European Soccer's governing body, \"so that my vice presidency position there can be filled. To insist in waiting around and holding onto that won't contribute anything positive, neither to the Federation nor to the Spanish football. Among other things because there are actual powers which will prevent my return\". He had already been suspended by the world governing body of FIFA and it's going to be really interesting to see what happens now, because in the last three weeks, so many things have happened. Remember, all of the players refused to play for the national team again until Rubiales was gone. Then the coaching staff all resigned in protest. Then the head coach, Jorge Vilda, was fired. The players have had many, many issues with him over the last few years. So he had already been fired last week. And remember, this all comes at a time when Spain are bidding to co- host the men's World Cup tournament in 2030. And as a result of this scandal, and Rubiales defiant refusal to stand down, really the reputation of Spanish football on the world stage had been dragged through the mud. So the question now is going to be, what took so long if you were going to resign anyway? It sounds like there have been pressures upon him and he has finally decided that there's just no way he can continue. His position is untenable. And, he has exited the stage.",
