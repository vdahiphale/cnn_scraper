There are plenty of reasons to attack him on policy ground. Whatever your issues are ideologically, he is not on the far left of the party. And I think what's also interesting is, you know, there's been a bunch of stories written over the course of the last 10 to 15 days about how he's pivoting to the center or he's sharply moving and kind of doing a triangulation type thing. He's really not. His views on D.C. crime bill and his decision to veto that very much tracks with where he's been on this issue. I was not at all -- I was more surprised that the White House took so long to acknowledge the fact that once this got to his desk, he was going to look at it and say, absolutely not. No chance in heck. On climate issues, he is more to the left perhaps, than people would expect. The ESG rule, which is something Wall Street has used for a number of decades now in terms of risk assessments and analysis, was something he would never veto. That's -- he would never sign off on. That was obviously something that tracks with his agenda. And so I think the idea that he's very difficult to put into a box and utilize as a caricature from a political standpoint is part of the reason why he's been both elected president and also why he had an effective first two years.",

Manchin's point is that if you the E, the environmental part of ESG is investment managers can say, do we want to invest in this company because they're big on fossil fuels? Are they on the cutting edge of climate change? Are they 10 or 15 years from now? Are they a viable business? Manchin's protecting coal, fossil fuels, West Virginia.",

They also want more staff, they want better conditions. They have been negotiating for nearly a year now and they haven't got close. There's still a separation on pay and a couple of other issues.
