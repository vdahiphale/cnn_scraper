At least, that's how we understand it at this moment. As with every Trump case, circumstances can change.But here is how a Fulton County sheriff says he expects all of this to happen. The sheriff says Trump is not expected to be booked at the courthouse, where the grand jury indicted him on 13 charges, but rather down the road at the jail. And you can see that illustrated there how far away it is. That jail is open 24/7. Once inside, defendants are typically fingerprinted and then a mug shot is taken. Will this be the case for Donald Trump? CNN's Nick Valencia is live outside the courthouse in Atlanta. Nick, all 19 defendants including Donald Trump could really show up any time they wanted to, to be booked. This is open 24/7. What are you hearing about potential timing here?",

And what that means is all 19 of them will be processed through the infamous Fulton County Jail where multiple people have died, those investigations still ongoing into the deaths, including the death of a man who was allegedly eaten alive by bedbugs earlier this year.Even the sheriff here in Fulton County, Pat Labat, has admitted publicly that the situation there in the facility is deteriorating but he does that the former president along with 18 defendants will have to make their way through the Fulton County Jail. Meanwhile, we're getting a glimpse at the potential defense strategy for the former president. His former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, filing a petition, I should say, to try to get this venue moved from state court to federal court. He and his lawyers are arguing that because of these allegations, these claims, these criminal charges against him were committed while he was working as a federal official, that the criminal proceeding should be heard in a federal court rather than a state court. And here's what they saying in part with that filing, saying, quote, nothing Mr. Meadows' has alleged in the indictment to have done is criminal, per se, arranging Oval Office meetings, contact state officials on the president's behalf, visiting a State Department building and setting up a phone call for the president. One would expect a chief of staff to the president of the United States to do these sorts of things. Mark Meadows, of course, among the 19 defendants, he has been charged with a racketeering charge as well as a violation of public oath of office. He says, at a later date, he will file a longer petition, a longer petition, but he is trying to get this case moved from state court to federal court. Sara?",

Think about that.There is nobody running for president that truly, if you put them on the truth serum, would say that Donald Trump is anything but corrupt, but they are scared to death of him. So, choice one is either take him on, or, choice two, just endorse him and get out of the race. Listen, free political advice. If your goal is to be vice president or you just want a cushy cabinet position and you want to get your time in government and now you can be a cabinet, people call you Mr. Cabinet member or whatever that is for the rest of your life, like then just get out and endorse Donald Trump now.

But for the rest of them, look, I get it because I've been there. If you're the only one speaking out, people point at you and people will say, well, you're wrong. That's why I've got to tell you, everybody has to speak out. That's what leadership is about. Leadership is about leading.

Rudy Giuliani doesn't even have the money to respond to some of the demands that are being made upon him as these lawsuits related to the 2020 election move forward.So, we saw some court filings this week. There's even a hearing happening right now in New York in the defamation case that Smartmatic, the voting machine company, had filed against Giuliani for making false statements about them and the 2020 election. And in that case, he has all of his electronic records held by an archiving company, a data holder called Trust Point. And that company needs to have him pay for searches so that he can turn over his records in these lawsuits, not just the Smartmatic lawsuit but in others. And in this court filing on Monday, he doesn't have $15,000 or somewhere between $15,000 and $23,000 to pay them to run the search he needed to run. He also doesn't have the money to keep his electronic records hosted by this company. They charge about $20,000 a month, every month, to keep his records active and alive so that he can use them in these lawsuits to defend himself. On top of that, he has other bills. He just had a court order recently where he has to pay cell phone bills that went unpaid in 2020 related to his company. That is not a small amount either. And then there is also on top of that bills that he has to pay for sanctions, for other people's legal fees where he hasn't responded appropriately in these 2020 election lawsuits. So, Kate, it is a lot of money that he has to pay now and that's just the start if he were to lose these lawsuits and also those criminal cases that cost money to defend, as well.",

It's where Donald Trump fell short before Judge Hellerstein in New York, who found that paying -- hush money to a porn star and covering it up by falsifying business records was not within the scope of the duties of the president of the United States.

He's taking bucket loads of water from a nearby swimming pool of a home that was completely burned down. They're refilling it with a fire hydrant. But the fire department is stretched so thin here that it's really sort of do it yourself, DIY fire protection, which explains this setup. This homeowner was gone. His wife was here, but she fired up their improvised sort of fire prevention system and they're spraying it as far as they can down into the ravine here with the fear that some of these hot spots might whip up. There are a couple of storms brewing in the Pacific, nothing near to hurricane or the Storm Dora that created all of the firestorm winds, but still anything that would kick this up is one more horrible thing to worry about here. Meanwhile, in Lahaina, officials say about only a third of that area has been searched with cadaver dogs. About a dozen souls have been identified through DNA, four identified and notified families. And then they've got dozens of other families who are now giving DNA samples because they have loved ones who are missing. So, it's agony, knowing maybe the worst that's happened and hoping they'll get a better result. Here again comes another drop.
