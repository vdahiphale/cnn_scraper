      "sentences": "Hey, Abby. So one court administration source is telling us that the Manhattan Grand Jury will go on break on Wednesday of next week, that's April 5th and then return later that month. And this one source says they will be returning on April 24th because of the holidays. Now, this Grand Jury is not meeting today. It is meeting tomorrow, though one court source or to court sources tell us that they're not hearing that Trump case tomorrow. It is unclear. They will be meeting next Monday and Wednesday, but it is unclear if they will hear any testimony about the Trump investigation at that point.Now, it's important to underscore though that everything is fluid. You know, this Grand Jury process is secret and the D.A.'s Office can make changes as they go. They could always decide to bring in another witness. They could have the Grand Jury meeting and it doesn't preclude them from bringing up the Trump case if they have some new information they want to put before them. So everything is fluid, but we are learning that they do have this break that is scheduled, which could impact just how quickly a decision is made in this case. You know, we do know again, they're not meeting today. They will be in tomorrow. The sources tell us that they will not be hearing the Trump case then. They are in again next Monday and Wednesday; it is unclear then if they will hear any testimony or be asked to vote on an indictment if D.A. Alvin Bragg decides to go in that direction. All of this is a bit up in the air, but they do have a scheduled break coming up, which means if a decision is not made in the next week and a half or so, then it's likely a decision would be made later this month or possibly later. Abby? PHILLIP: Very interesting development there, Kara Scannell. Let's go to CNN'S Elliott Williams, who is well here with us. So Elliot, what do you make of this? First of all, let's just remind folks that there were some last minute developments presented to the Grand Jury in the last week. And now, we're learning that if something doesn't happen in the next week or so, it could be another month or so before we learn how this will go. ELLIOT WILLIAMS, CNN'S LEGAL ANALYST: It really could, Abby, and it's most important to note that deliberations and everything that happens around a Grand Jury, by law is secret. And so we don't know, number one, what went on in that Room #2, what were the basis for which Alvin Bragg in the D.A.'s Office put evidence on in the first place, and Number 3, what's driving their decisions now as to whether they're calling additional witnesses and so on. Now, look, we can speculate, but you know -- but like Kara's reporting had noted, part of this was a planned break that the Grand Jury was going to take anyway, on account of a number of holidays that are approaching. So more information may trickle out over the coming weeks, but it's just hard to know at this moment why exactly they're pausing right now.",

McCarthy reacted and told his several Committee Chairmen, you have to investigate this -- the Manhattan D.A. is corrupt, very much following the lines of Trump, and that is exactly where you're seeing a lot of this action, probably we will continue to see one of that speculation of look at the federal government weaponizing things against you, against Trump, against Americans.
