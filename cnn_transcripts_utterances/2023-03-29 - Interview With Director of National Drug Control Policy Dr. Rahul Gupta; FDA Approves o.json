We're learning that the Manhattan grand jury that has been hearing the case is set to take a break for up to a month and may not hear evidence again until the end of April. Let's get straight to CNN's Kara Scannell in New York. Kara, this comes after the former president, he predicted that he was going to be indicted last week. But now, if that indictment comes, it may not be for several more weeks?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Alex, so we're learning from a court administration source that the grand jury has a scheduled break for the holidays and that they will be breaking after April 5. That's next Wednesday, and they would return later in the month of April.What is not clear is whether this grand jury, which normally sits on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, will hear evidence about the Trump case before they take that break. They are off today, according to a court sources, and they are in tomorrow, but they're not expected to hear any testimony about the Trump investigation, according to those sources. It's important to underscore here, though, that this whole process is secretive. We're learning some details from court administration sources, but the district attorney's office can make decisions. They can decide to bring in a witness. They can decide to take the case up. I mean, if they decide they were to move forward with an indictment, they could ask the grand jury to vote. It is just not clear how quickly that decision-making is going and when they might bring any evidence, whether it's additional witness testimony or a final decision, before this grand jury. But we do know that there are just a few days left before they do go on this break beginning next Wednesday, after that session where they are scheduled to sit -- Alex. MARQUARDT:  All right, Kara Scannell in New York, thank you so much for all of your terrific reporting on all these many twists and turns in this case. Joining me now to discuss is Harry Litman. He's a former U.S. attorney and former deputy assistant attorney general as well, as well as Laura Barron-Lopez, the White House correspondent for PBS. Laura and Harry, thank you so much for joining me today. Harry, I want to ask you first about this break that the Manhattan grand jury is going to be taking. As you heard Kara saying there, there are several holidays coming up. But what do you think that this means that this grand jury is going to be taking a break for several weeks? HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY:  Yes I have been scratching my head some, Alex, as have others, in the one-day delay, two-days delay. This is more like flabbergasting. And he's the big point here is, the DA's office has to have known about it, has to have planned for it. So is it really just a sort of administrative little bump in the road that we have always -- for some reason, we're just learning about it now? And your -- the reporting is important that I hadn't realized. Apparently, they could still go forward before the 5th. Something is really -- this is a very unusual development to happen when the table is completely set, as it is for an indictment. It may turn out to be an innocent administrative solution, but I find it very perplexing that they're calling -- stopping the linebackers right where they are.",

Or, if he continues to fight that, does that really help him politically with that Republican base? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  That's the hope, that fighting it will -- could potentially help him with the Republican base, because, right now, we know that the Republican base doesn't really believe in these investigations, doesn't support them, does not think that the former president did anything wrong. \"PBS NewsHour\" just had a new poll come out this week that actually showed that 76 percent of Republicans would like former President Trump to be reelected again. And they don't think that these investigations are fair, even though a majority of Americans actually, we found, do think that all of the investigations that are looking into the former president's potential wrongdoing, whether it's the one that Manhattan -- the Manhattan DA is investigating, or the special counsel investigations, are fair. So, Pence right now is trying to show that he's putting up a fight and that he won't be just willingly going in to speak to the grand jury, because, if he does, the Republican base is not going to be happy about that. MARQUARDT:  And at the center of this potential Pence testimony is a heated phone call that Pence had with Trump on the day of that insurrection while Pence was at the Capitol.

And he showed a video of it. He said: \"I just don't think that that person is appropriate for the presidency.\" Those are very strong words, the strongest, arguably, against Trump by any of these potential 2024 Republican candidates. How much do you think that that cracks open the door, if at all, for others, say, DeSantis, Mike Pompeo? How much does that give them license to more directly go after Trump now? BARRON-LOPEZ:  On the issue of January 6 and the former president's involvement in January 6 and inciting that violence, I would -- I don't think that we're going to hear much from candidates like Ron DeSantis on that, because Ron DeSantis, himself, in 2022 supported a variety of election deniers that ran in states -- in swing states across the country. So he has endorsed and gotten behind people who have lied about the 2020 election, including the former president himself. And I think a lot of those other candidates are also not eager, other than former Vice President Mike Pence, to stand up to Trump on the issue of January 6 and political violence, and the threats that he -- that he has issued against law enforcement officials.",

We're also being told that the 28-year-old was never committed to an institution and that, when it comes to this mental disorder, officials, they are still trying to get a better sense of just how long the 28-year-old was seeking medical treatment for this medical disorder. Now, the chief was also asked whether detectives believe that the parents really did not know that the shooter had seven guns, some of them hidden across the home.

And since the state of Tennessee doesn't have any rules, it's -- it -- dealing with mental illness is hard. Dealing with having so many guns on the street is hard. Talking to constituents this morning, one of the common threads that I heard was that there's a feeling of helplessness. Even if we wave a magic wand and figure out how to help folks in emotional distress and get commonsense gun laws in place, you have so many guns on the streets already that it will -- it's not clear it would actually help in the short term.

So, the fact is that we have produced and provided unprecedented and historic resources to states and communities to get the ability to purchase naloxone, but it's still -- there's a lot of inconsistency across communities.

We know that four out of five, as you just mentioned, deaths that are occurring of the 100,000 are because of opioids like fentanyl.
