Inflation/economy, crime and immigration. Now, immigration, if you look at the national numbers, it might not be that much of a factor generally speaking, especially when you have the economy and even abortion sort of superseding that. But because they have been able to focus kind of like Democrats in 2018, yes, the Trump factor was a big factor, but their focus, their singular focus, issue wise, was on health care. They, the Republicans, are going to take Obamacare away from you.There's a similar regimen in what Republicans are doing. And I think, at the end of the day, that plus the economic realities and the fact that it is so personal, people are feeling it so much every time they go to the grocery store, every time they try to pay a bill, to see how much more everything costs. That is obviously in Republicans' favor. Whether that really is Joe Biden's problem or whether - it's his problem. Whether it is his fault or the Democrats in Congress' fault, that's just the way it works. They tend to get the blame. BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR: On the issue of abortion, I've heard some Democrats say they think that this is going to impact results more. They've spoken to a lot of women who say -- Republican women who say -- and you've interviewed some who say this is going to be a determining factor in their vote, and they're not telling their husbands about it. The idea being is there's sort of this like silent vote around it. What do you think about - about that idea?",

Look, if not for the economic situation that this country is in right now, abortion would -- there's no question it would be much, much more of a driver. And I think it still will be a driver. I mean the fact that we're seeing such high turnout numbers across the board in early voting means that we could see another phenomenon similar to what we saw in 2020, which is that voting is up in all parties for various reasons, for different reasons. And that could still be the case. The question is whether the issue of abortion as a vote driver for Democrats will be enough to counteract the very real vote driver which is economic pain that people are feeling.",
