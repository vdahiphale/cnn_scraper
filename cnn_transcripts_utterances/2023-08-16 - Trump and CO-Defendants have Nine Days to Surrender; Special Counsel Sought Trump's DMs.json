Even the Fulton County sheriff here, Pat Labat, has admitted that this facility had some problems and he's tried to get that facility overhauled. And the news of Trump and his co-defendants being processed here has created quite the reaction here in Atlanta, if only for the potential optics. Meanwhile, Kate, we're also learning about the potential defense strategies for some of these defendants. Former chief of staff for the former president, Mark Meadows, and his team filing a formal petition to try to get a change of venue from state court to federal court. And what they're arguing here in this formal petition is that anyone who's charged during their alleged actions while they're a federal official should have their criminal proceedings moved from a state court to a federal court. Here's what they're saying in part of their filing here. \"Nothing Mr. Meadows is alleged in the indictment to have done is criminal, per se. Arranging Oval Office meetings, contacting state officials on the president's behalf, visiting a state government building and setting up a phone call for the president. One would expect a chief of state to the president of the United States to do these sorts of things.\" Mark Meadows has been charged with two counts in the indictment, including racketeering, as well as violation of oath of office by a public official. And we understand he is going to file a formal petition at a later date, but it is now in the hands of a U.S. district judge here in Georgia. Kate.",

But, Sara, this was quite a revelation in these transcripts that were unsealed finally yesterday in this fight where the special counsel's office had had this warrant approved to get Donald Trump the @realDonaldTrump Twitter information for their investigation, and Twitter was fighting it and they were also fighting particularly the idea that they couldn't tell Donald Trump about this.But in the course of these transcripts it was a revelation because no one really knew how much Donald Trump may have been talking privately to other people, potentially to advisers, or that other people may have been using his account, would be sending messages that would be in private because, like you said, he didn't email, he didn't text and there was always a question, did he use direct messages on Twitter. He sent so many tweets publicly. And then we have, from these court hearings now, Twitter confirming to a judge that, yes, there was DMs on Donald Trump's Twitter account. The direct quote from one of the lawyers in this hearing was, \"we were able to determine that there was some volume in that for this account,\" meaning direct messages. \"There are confidential communications,\" period. And then at a different part of the hearing, the Twitter lawyer says, what the Justice Department appears to be looking for, and what they were focused on as they were trying to get that access to those messages, which they did ultimately get, saying, \"the DOJ was most interested in communications between government officials and Twitter regarding the subject account.\" Now, that could be Trump and others in his administration talking over DM. That also could be government officials talking to Twitter more generally about his account being pulled down after January 6th. But all of it got swept into the special counsel investigation.

The essential allegation is he facilitated this whole effort on Donald Trump's behalf to steal the election.The only other crime is solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer. That refers, of course, to the infamous phone call Donald Trump made to Brad Raffensperger where he said I need you to find votes. Mark Meadows arranged that call and was on that call. He doesn't really say much. So, that's all that he's looking at here. Now, he has made this motion, that you referred to, to remove the case from state court, where Fani Willis has jurisdiction, over to federal court, on the basis of this federal law relating to removal. And what that law essentially says, that you can remove to the federal district court of the United States if what you're charged for is any act by an officer of the United States -- Meadows is going to say I was chief of staff at the White House -- and this is the key phrase right here, under color of such office.
