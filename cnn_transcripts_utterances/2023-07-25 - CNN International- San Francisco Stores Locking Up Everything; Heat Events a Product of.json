Intense heatwaves an wildfires which scientists say will be virtually impossible without the human caused climate crisis. That's according to a new analysis from a group of scientists who examined the role of climate change in extreme weather events. They found overwhelming evidence that without the rampant burning of fossil fuels, those ongoing heatwaves wouldn't be happening.We're seeing the effects right now. More than 1,000 wildfires are burning in Canada, the vast majority of those are considered out of control. In North Africa, fires in Algeria have turned deadly killing at least 34 people. And wildfires in Greece have been raging for a week now. Prompting the country's largest ever evacuation effort. Elinda Labropoulou joins us from Athens to talk about the fires in Greece. Jim Bittermann is in Paris to help break down the scientist report. Elinda, just take us through the latest situation there because it seems to be going from bad to worse.

The big fire in Rhodes has been raging for over seven days now and evacuations are still under way. The biggest evacuation ever in Greece has already taken place. We understand that more people are leaving the island. It's a little bit chaotic actually the information that is coming out of there concerning who is going where.But certainly about the fire, the news is not good. So more villages have been evacuated. And the same is the case certain parts of Corfu as well. We heard from people who were evacuated in the middle of the night from Corfu last night and it remains to be seen if they'll be able go back to their hotels and their homes. Now, in Athens where I am, the Acropolis, right behind me, is receiving its last visitors for a number of hours because it has been shutting down during the hottest part of the day for a number of days until now. As Greece is going through this prolonged heatwave. We expect temperatures today and tomorrow to reach absolute maximum again and then to drop on Thursday. This is a time that the firefighters are waiting for and authorities here to try and see if they'll be able to contain the flames that continue to rage in three main fires. The one in Corfu, the one in Rhodes and another one on the island of Evia. This is the island that almost burned down completely two years ago and has been suffering extended damage since. And so until Thursday, it seems like the weather conditions and sweltering heat will continue here in Athens Max--.",

      "sentences": "Exactly, Max. This report was put together by something called the World Weather Attribution Initiative. Basically a group of scientists who are looking at historical data and comparing it to what has been happening this last few weeks in Europe and all around the world, these heatwaves that have taken place. And they say basically that the world should be repaired if nothing change in terms of the human induced climate change. That is to say the amount of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere. If nothing changes, that we should expect these kind of extreme weather events once every 15 years in North America. Once every ten years in Europe and once every five years in China.Basically it's a pretty grim picture if nothing changes. And of course, what they are urging is that things change. And that is to say that the amount of greenhouse gases is reduced. Right now the overall global temperatures around the world stand at about 1.2 degrees Celsius over the preindustrial age. And they are increase every year. If they get up to 2 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial age, that's to say they believe -- that the scientists think that you'll have these kind of events every two to five years. And they are urging their people adapt. Basically that there be better urban planning, better coordination between social services and hospitals. Better prediction of heatwaves. When they're arriving. And of course, the reduction of greenhouse gases is what they are urging the most -- Max.",

Carlee Russell's attorney provided a statement to police apologizing. The 26-year-old disappeared while she was driving home from work nearly two weeks ago. That prompted an intensive search. Russell turned up though at her home two days later. The police chief in Hoover, Alabama says he still doesn't know where she was. New York police say they've had a, quote, fruitful search of the home of a man charged with at least three of the state's Gilgo Beach murders. A number of items have been taken away by police including unidentified items from a vault containing hundreds of firearms belonging to the suspect. CNN's Jean Casarez has more on the investigation.
