Hours before a news conference where Biden must prove he's up to the task of running against Donald Trump and serving four more years as president.Plus, scandal the century. Well, that's how Republicans are framing the Biden campaign turmoil in the new ad. As the GOP accuses opponents in down ballot races of covering up concerns about the president's age. And treading climate protections, criminalizing pornography in disbanding the commerce and education departments. Those are just some of the controversial plans in Project 2025. Now Donald Trump claims he knows nothing about it. But we have new CNN reporting tying him to more than 200 people who crafted those 900 pages. I'm Manu Raju in for Daba Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start with some very unwelcome news for the Biden White House. An 11 congressional Democrats says the president must drop out of the race. That's Congresswoman Hillary Scholten of Michigan, who says that Biden should allow a new candidate to lead Democrats into November. For the good of our democracy. She says in a statement. I believe it is time for him to step aside from the presidential race and allow a new leader to step up. CNN's Kayla Tausche is at the NATO summit and Lauren Fox is on Capitol Hill. But first I'm going to start with you, Kayla, what are we expecting ahead of that critical press conference?",

Welch just came out last night in an op-ed against Biden's campaign saying that he does not think the president can win. Here's what they said this morning.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): My hope is that they will present analytics data that show a path to success in November, based on facts, not just rhetoric. SEN. PETER WELCH (D-VT): I'm expressing my opinion. You know, ultimately the president is going to have to make his own decision. I think the issue is not about -- it's not about telling us. It's about showing voters that's in the presidency, you know, he's making real efforts to do that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, the problem now, Manu, is that there are now many serious, many legitimate concerns on the president's health and his fitness for office that could supersede any more positive feelings that voters have about the economy at this point.",

And having brand new ABC News, Washington Post poll that found a staggering 67 percent of Americans, and 62 percent of Democrats -- and Democratic leaning - leaners, and 54 percent of Biden supporters believe that President Biden should step aside. And yet that same poll found the race tied nationally, 46 to 46. That's basically unchanged since before the debate, according to this poll.So, what does all of this mean? Joining me to at this table to break this all down our CNN's Gloria Borger, CNN's David Chalian, and the Washington Post's Leigh Ann Caldwell. Good to see you all. So, let me first just on the news of this, another member coming out today, 10th Democrats in the House. Hillary Clinton saying that Biden should step aside. There's 11 now in both the House and the Senate. How long can the Biden campaign sustain this? You know, day-by-day, more and more members coming out. Assuming it continues, which it's probably safe to assume unless he has an unbelievable job tonight. But there probably be some criticism after tonight anyways, how long can he sustain this?",

And I still don't think that's going to all of a sudden assuage the concerns Democrats have about the president's ability to defeat Donald Trump. The answer to your question, though, Manu, is for as long as the president wants to, that's how long they can sustain it. Because it's up to the president, if he is going to step down from this mess.He has made clear and there's been zero indication yet. And I've seen anywhere that he has changed his mind here. The indication is coming from outside, right? The indication is coming from Nancy Pelosi, who says, he still has a decision to make. Even though, he says he's made a decision. So clearly, if this press conference is resembling of the debate two weeks ago, I think you're going to see floodgates open. And I think every Democrat on the Hill is going to call publicly for it, basically, not everyone. But I think that even if he does have a solid performance, it's not going to stop.

Maybe this is one reason why he has struggled in some of these forums. He's had so few of them in his time as president.And just this past year in 2024, four press conference -- just four press conferences. There's 12 in 2023. OK. Well, how does it compare to past presidents? Trump had twice as many, Obama more, George W. Bush more. And you know this -- do you think this has an impact on how he has been able to respond.

The history books will have to write, but he has clearly done fewer of these. Now, I don't think American voters are like press conferences, we need more press conferences. I think that's more of us that do that then voters do. But I do think he is at a whole new level of scrutiny now for every single one of his public appearances since that debate two weeks ago.
