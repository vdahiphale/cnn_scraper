Therefore, we have a lot of work to do in Gaza. Biden didn't like to hear that, but, you know, that's the case for now, and what we heard from Netanyahu's people today is that they're not going to stop, at least at the moment.",

Right now, the prosecution is presenting evidence including messages between Jennifer Crumbley, you see them there, and her husband James.Now, we could soon hear from Jennifer herself. During opening remarks, her defense attorney said she's going to take the stand in the case against her. Her son killed four students at Oxford High School on November 30th, 2021, and will spend the rest of his life behind bars. Now, Jennifer Crumbley and her husband James are trying to avoid prison themselves, in separate trials that could test the limits of who can be held responsible for a shooting. Let's bring in defense attorney Misty Marris, who is with us again this morning. Happy to see you, Misty. Let's talk about Jennifer's defense.",

      "sentences": "So the purchase of the gun is very central to Jennifer's defense. In fact, it's one of the reasons why we're seeing the trials be separated, Jennifer is being prosecuted separate from her husband James, and a lot of that relates to the fact that James purchased the gun for Ethan. We saw evidence play out in the courtroom yesterday.James went to the store with Ethan. They purchased the gun. As the gun owner, he has different responsibilities relating to maintenance, safe keeping, storage, and accessibility to that gun, including it's illegal to purchase a gun on behalf of another person. So, yes, that is a huge part of Jennifer's defense. However, the prosecutors are making arguments that essentially say, who purchased the gun really isn't the point. They're presenting evidence that shows Jennifer knew that Ethan had access to the gun, who purchased it really doesn't matter. Some of the evidence we saw yesterday was Jennifer with Ethan at a gun range with that very gun. We saw videos from Ethan's Instagram, which show that he had basically unfettered access to the gun at home. And so what prosecutors are going to say is, really that question of who's the purchaser is ancillary to the issues in this case, which is did Jennifer willfully disregard these warning signs that Ethan posed a threat to others.",

Before the public knew who was responsible for the shooting, while it was happening, there was a text that was sent to Ethan from his mom, Jennifer. And the text read, Ethan, don't do it. After we knew that there was a school shooting at the school.Could this be a really key piece of evidence? It seems like that to me.",

She was so frightened and terrified about what Trump did and said that it upended her life and she had to get security for her home.

This was not a rape, but this is a sexual abuse, and there was an issue about what that meant and how far the judge would instruct the jury about that.Then the judge is going to explain this is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it's preponderance of the evidence. So basically that it's just a hair more likely than not. Just a little bit, that's all it takes, more likely than not that the plaintiff has proven their case and that this occurred. And then you're going to hear about the damages, which would be you have compensatory, and then make you whole or take care of the injury, and then there's a punitive side as well, which is how it impacted her.",
