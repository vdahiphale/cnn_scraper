      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to CNN's special live coverage of the Democratic National Convention. I'm Brianna Keilar here in Chicago and my good friend and colleague, Boris Sanchez is in Washington.It is day two here at the Convention where tonight, former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama will be taking the stage in their hometown, laying out their pitch for why Kamala Harris should be the 47th President of the United States. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff will also be one of the headliners tonight. He's expected to share personal stories about his marriage and family life with Vice President Harris. And around the same time, she will be about 90 miles away in Milwaukee, kind of just up the way. They're holding a rally in the same arena where Republicans held their convention last month. I want to bring in CNN Chief National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny. Jeff, you have some reporting on what the Obamas are expected to say tonight. What can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Brianna, we know that former President Barack Obama likes to make the case for democratic candidates as he's done since leaving office. And tonight, I'm told, he will give a forceful articulation of why he believes the country and Democrats should elect Kamala Harris.Yes, he's going to go through the roadmap of what he believes are the issues at stake. And larger than any individual issues like the economy and democracy is really going to be laying out the stakes and drawing a contrast with former President Donald Trump. It's something that we have seen him do, of course, back in the 2016 campaign. He made a similar argument for Hillary Clinton. Of course, that was not as successful. But this speech, I'm told, right here in his hometown of Chicago, will be slightly different, slightly more elevated, but it is going to be a forceful argument. And this is something that is really the arc of the relationship between Kamala Harris and Barack Obama. It was 20 years ago this summer that she was actually at his convention seeing him for the first time when he had that breakout moment back at the 2004 convention. They became friends over the years. Now, he's one of her trusted advisors. He talks with her frequently. I'm told, he was in conversation with her when she was deciding who she was going to choose for her running mate. So for all the talk of passing the porch last evening, this is also a different moment for the party, sort of moving beyond the interlude of the Biden Administration. And he's going to be making the strong case for her. But Michelle Obama is someone we do not hear much from in a public setting like this. She'll be giving a much shorter speech, I'm told, essentially introducing her husband. But her words carry so much weight because she is not seen as a political figure. So all eyes are going to be in what she says tonight. But it's also the speech from Doug Emhoff tonight going to really be putting the personal touches on his marriage, as you said, to Vice President Harris, how she has been a stepmother for his children and so much more. There's also a bigger lineup tonight of other speakers, including a few Republicans as well, making the argument. But perhaps, the most important thing is happening just up the road from here. Brianna, as you said in Milwaukee. Clearly, Wisconsin is a swing state. So the Vice President not taking tonight off to bask in the applause in this arena, she's out trying to win votes just a little bit north of here. Of course, that's key for November, Brianna.",

I don't even know if Mike Pence was invited to the convention.So Democrats are united. Usually, you know, you hear Democrats fall in love, republicans fall in line. Democrats are doing both. We're falling in love and falling in line. And so, look, President Obama, you know, is a communicator like nobody else of this generation. And so he's going to talk to, I think, all facets of the Democratic Party that we have to together unite. Even if we have differences, we're a big tent. We have to unite because defeating Donald Trump is the most important thing. And so I think that's what you're going to hear from Obama.
