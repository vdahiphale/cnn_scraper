Today we're asking, as Donald Trump prepares for a second term, will he be able to keep his most controversial campaign promises?Then the blame game. As Democrats point fingers, why it may not be who but what that's at fault for their big loss. And later, cold turkey, why some Americans are giving up Thanksgiving's main attraction for the side dishes. The panel is here and ready to go. So sit back, relax, and let's talk about it. Up first, Donald Trump's political comeback is complete following a resounding show of support in this week's election. With the wind at his and the Republican Party's back, the focus now is what to look for in a second Trump term. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Look what happened.

Welcome back everybody.Donald Trump made a lot of promises during the campaign, some of them mainstream conservative and some pretty radical. Lulu, what should we expect from the Trump two? LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, \"NEW YORK TIMES\" JOURNALIST AND PODCAST HOST:  I think what we should expect is that there's going to be a lot of change. You ain't seen nothing yet. Everyone has thought that perhaps the front -- the first Trump administration was going to show the way for a second Trump administration, and I don't think that that's true. I think that they are better prepared. I think that they're going to better staffed. And I think that some of the promises they have put forward are pretty radical. Mass deportations, we'll see if they can do it. It costs a lot of money to do that. There are a lot of people in this country. It hasn't been successful to do the kind of numbers that they are talking about, but they are talking about that. I even saw some mention on immigration of denaturalization, taking people who are naturalized citizens and perhaps taking away their citizenship.

He was more centrist than I would like on a number of important issues. And I think that he recognizes that and he is going to be someone who is going to keep Republicans in Congress in check. He's going to make sure that they are moving in a deliberate way with public opinion. It's not necessarily going to be something that is going to be entirely successful.

And do you think she will actually be successful in keeping the clown car out of the White House?KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CONSERVATIVE POLLSTER AND \"NEW YORK TIMES\" CONTRIBUTING OPINION WRITER:  She is enormously well-respected, and that is a sentiment that unites both MAGA Republicans and establishment Republicans to the extent that we're still pretending that Donald Trump is not the Republican establishment. Republicans of all stripes like Susie Wiles. I'm from Florida. I have a lot of connections with Florida political operatives. Almost uniformly they say she is a tough cookie who knows how to get things done. And I think that this suggests that Trump 2.0 is going to be a much more professional and effective operation.
