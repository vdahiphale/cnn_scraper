      "sentences": "Now, one thing just to clarify here is that Donald Trump was talking about having a lot of H-1B visa workers on his properties.We actually dug into the data from the Department of Labor, and it shows that most of the workers on Donald Trump's properties who have these types of visas have H-2B visas, which essentially allow for jobs like landscaping and hospitality, but all to say, this is different from what Donald Trump has said in the past. In the past and during his first administration, the H-1B visa program actually saw a decline. And he also ran in 2016 on arguing that too many American companies don't prioritize American workers and criticized the H-1B visa program. But now he is saying that he is a supporter of it and really standing on the side of Elon Musk, despite many people in his party, a lot of the MAGA faithful, really criticizing Musk and others for taking that position -- Pamela.",

So, Alyssa, Trump's own businesses have hired H-1B visa workers, though, we should note, as Alayna said, the majority were H-2B, with CNN finding the most recent was when Trump Media and Technology Group was approved to hire a data analyst in 2022. But Trump has previously criticized the visa program, even restricting access to foreign worker visas in his first term. I wonder, as someone who worked in his White House the first term, what you recall from that time in terms of his opposition to those visas and why he is changing his mind now.",

      "sentences": "So, this is kind of a fascinating update, because it's actually conservative and Republican Party orthodoxy to support high-skill immigration.We see it, we have always framed it as a way to counter China, to compete with China. You want to attract the best workers in STEM fields. Donald Trump kind of went back and forth on this issue. And the MAGA wing, the Steve Bannons of the world, certainly didn't support more of these and wanted these caps on visas that were in place in the first administration. But I see this as, yes, the growing influence that Elon Musk has on Donald Trump, but I also see it as part of Donald Trump's just general being tough-on-China strategy. The reality, is China is investing to try to be able to compete more with us in these areas. And I think that I'm going to take a beat and say that perhaps this is him learning something from his first administration, that, if we want to be competitive in these fields, we have to lift these caps.",

You do need to, in fact, be able to bring in the best workers, particularly in STEM fields. Listen, there was -- I think that the sort of civil war around this issue was a bit overplayed in the media, in the sense that Donald Trump's been on a number of sides of this issue, but there wasn't a primary policy objective he ran on this cycle, saying, we are going to stop high-skilled immigration. He did talk about securing the border. He talked about more jobs for American workers, but also being tough on China. And I think that there's a way in which all of those sort of square with this position.",

There are a lot of members of the Freedom Caucus who were unhappy with how he's handled things. We know how it went just last cycle, when Kevin McCarthy went up to something like 15 votes before he was ultimately ousted and replaced by Mike Johnson. But this is the best gift he could have given him heading into the new year. I think it makes it far harder for members of Congress to vote against him. I imagine a few still will. But Donald Trump wants to hit the ground running. He doesn't want to be sworn into office and then have Congress basically at a standstill trying to elect a speaker for weeks on end. So, huge win for Mike Johnson, but also Donald Trump signaling to House Republicans, I don't want you guys wasting any time. I have an agenda when I come in on day one, and we don't want the distractions we saw last time around.",

And I see your point about this -- bird flu is different from COVID, we have been preparing for this -- that she's hearing a lot of the same words that she heard with COVID, like it's low risk. Early on, that's what they were saying. And the CDC Web site still says bird flu is low risk to public health.What do you say to that? And do you believe it's still low risk?",

      "sentences": "So, to be clear, we're -- we say on our Web site that bird flu is low risk to the general population.So, every time we identify a case of bird flu, we go through an entire process to really look at our risk assessment. So we look at the story, the epidemiology around that case. Is there any evidence of human-to-human transmission? And, to be clear, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission in the United States at this time. We also look really carefully at the sequence related to influenza to make sure that we see if there is any change that could potentially mean that the virus is changing in a way that could mean that it's higher risk to humans. And I think that's been really important in the work that we have been doing and will continue to do. So, I think based on our looking at the risk every day, looking at what we're learning from the virus, as well as epidemiology, that remains true, that it is low risk for the general population. With that said, there is increased risk for individuals who have exposure to animal and animal products. So that's why so much of the work that we're doing is focused on farmworkers and others who may have exposure to birds or other products that may put them at risk for H5. And we do that by doing the work that we're doing with testing, but also making clear guidance around how people can protect themselves with personal protective equipment, as well as antivirals in terms of post-exposure prophylaxis, so using medications after an exposure to prevent potential acquisition of bird flu.",

How concerning is this? Do you think it's just a matter of time until it starts mutating to infect human to human?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so I think that, when we look at each case, we look at exposure. Did they have a known exposure? What was that exposure?Is there any evidence for human-to-human transmission? And we're definitely not seeing that. And is there any increase in the severity? So we really look at all of these together to help guide our public health response. And a lot of what we're seeing now is telling us, be prepared. And so we have done that by making sure that testing is available through our public health labs, but also through two large commercial companies that allow physicians and other health care providers to order tests in their practice from their offices. So that's something that I think potentially didn't come through in some of the comments from some of my colleagues that, in fact, we do have commercial testing available for H5 available today. And, in fact, it's been available since the early fall. I think the other part of this is that we are avidly making sure that we are prepared in the circumstance that we need to move from being prepared for a vaccine program to moving to a vaccine program. And so the work that we do every day to categorize influenza viruses has been really important, because that's how we generate candidate vaccine viruses, which are the ones that we're developing with our colleagues in ASPE in the event that we need to go from planning and preparedness to implementing a vaccine.",
