Back in the U.S., when Donald Trump's hush money trial resumes this morning, a blockbuster witness returns to the stand. Stormy Daniels has been telling the jury about intimate details of her alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump. Sources tell CNN that Trump's defense team had originally planned a relatively quick cross- examination of Daniels. But, when she implied sex with Trump may not have been consensual, they decided to ask additional questions as a way of protecting Trump's reputation. Our Brynn Gingras is at the courthouse in Lower Manhattan, and she is joining us live right now. All right. So, Brynn, what should be expected from Stormy Daniels' cross-examination today? BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. I mean, a lot more from the defense team chipping away at Stormy Daniels' credibility. That is what they were getting started on. When court finished up on Tuesday, they basically were questioning her credibility, questioning her motives, basically saying -- getting her to admit that she hated President Trump on the stand. Now, like you just said, Fred, they didn't expect to take a long time with her as a witness. But, they changed that tactic once they had heard what she was giving the prosecution, essentially saying that or implying, rather for jurors, that the sex between the former President and herself, which he denies, of course, was not consensual. And they said that they now have to ask more questions to make it clear, and to really improve the reputation of the former President. So, they said they have a lot more to go. Now, how long it is, it's not exactly clear. But, we also know right after that redirect will happen with the prosecution. So, it's unclear how long Stormy Daniels is going to be on the stand today. But, certainly, going to be an eventful day in court. I got to tell you, Fred, we're standing out here, out here every single morning for court, and the line for the public to get in has grown longer and longer and longer. And a lot of people here want to see Stormy Daniels as a witness because it was so incredible testimony, really, for this case, aside from the fact that it's just a historic trial in general.",

Now, the court has said that they -- he first wanted to just at least halt this trial until they made a ruling about that gag order. Again, their argument that it's not constitution -- it's unconstitutional. Now, they're saying expedite that ruling since a ruling hasn't been made. And so, that's essentially what was just filed with the courts.Yesterday, unclear how long that's going to take. But, we know that the former President has violated, according to the judge here, 10 times and been fined $1,000 each time.

This is a quote now, \"We will not let anyone threaten us\". That was the message from Russian President Vladimir Putin today as he addressed a Victory Day celebration in Red Square. Putin's speech came amid a military parade that, according to the country's Defense Minister, was scaled down from last year. Victory Day marks Russia's role in the defeat of Nazi Germany. Today's events came just two days after Mr. Putin's inauguration for another six-year term. Let's bring in now CNN's Clare Sebastian, joining us from London with more on all this.

And the two leaders, while they were obviously doing this for the benefit of the cameras, were keen to emphasize that these were pre- planned and were routine. So, I think, look, it was clearly a calculated threat, and I think part of a bigger picture of Russia wanting to ensure that the West is watching and taking Russia seriously, and using that to inform its decisions when it comes to supporting Ukraine.

But, I think broadly in terms of the international audiences, which he knows is there and watching, Russia wants to be seen as a global power, even perhaps a superpower with its own sphere of influence to counter the U.S.Now, there were some foreign leaders there, mostly from former Soviet countries, but also the President of Cuba. We also saw the leaders of Laos and Guinea-Bissau. So, not a large amount, but certainly enough for Russia to be able to say that it is not isolated as a result of this war. He did also claim in his inauguration address two days ago that the majority of the world sees Russia as a reliable partner. And obviously, as I said, the key lever that he can pull internationally to have Russia taken seriously is the nuclear one, and he is not shying away from that, Fred.",

That's according to two sources. Here is how it works. The rule would let immigration officials reject asylum claims earlier in the process if a person is found to be ineligible. The sources add that it's more of a tightening rather than a sweeping change to the current immigration system.Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now from Washington with some of the details on this. Priscilla, good morning to you. So, what more can you tell us about this new proposed rule?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is an attempt by the Biden administration to again try to tighten the current U.S. immigration system. There are few tools at the administration's disposal when it comes to making sweeping immigration policy changes. So, a lot of focus over the last several months and really over the last several years has been tightening certain aspects of the system, in this case, looking specifically at asylum seekers. So, what this really boils down to is being able to rapidly reject migrants who are making a claim for asylum if they are found to be ineligible. Sometimes, that happens later in the process. This essentially moves it up.So, in an earlier stage of the process, they may be able to reject someone if they see at that point that they are ineligible. And the idea here, of course, is to be able to more quickly expel or deport those migrants who are not eligible for asylum, while letting those who are continue through the U.S. immigration system. But, of course, this comes at a time when the White House has been weighing executive action, which would be far more drastic and sweeping. Now, the President has said his lawyers are reviewing this. Sources tell me the same. And there hasn't quite been a decision yet on when or if they decide to move forward with that executive action. But, in the interim, they're clearly trying to focus on what parts of the immigration system they do have control over and they can make changes. Now, we have heard from lawmakers about this that have been, I should say, have reviewed this or have been briefed on this. And what they say is, look, there was a border bill on the table. Remember, this was something that was worked on in the Senate in a bipartisan way to try to really overhaul the U.S. immigration system. And in the end, it failed. And Democrats are pointing the finger at former President Donald Trump, who told Republicans not to move forward with it. And so, in the absence of any sort of reform in Congress, it is these small changes that the administration is trying to make to, in their words, make the system more efficient. Now, of course, the devil is the details. We have not seen the rule yet. It is expected to be released at some point today. Now, this would still have to go through a public comment period. So, that means that while it is released today, it's a proposed rule, it would still need to go through a whole set of the public comment period, and then finalizing that rule for it to really take effect. But, it gives us a sense, at least, at this point of where the administration is putting its focus when it comes to asylum.",

So, they're not sure exactly what it's going to entail, and if it is a small as the administration and sources have been describing it to be. Now, I should note that immigration advocates are typically on board when it comes to tightening the system, especially for those migrants who are ineligible for asylum. But, again, like anything else, it's going to require a review of the rule itself for those reactions to really pour in. But, at this point, given that it's not expected to be a sweeping change of policy, their concerns still are very much focused on any type of executive action that the White House might take on the U.S.-Mexico border.",

What Mr. Trump is attempting to do is not only disrupt, he is attempting to intimidate. And at that point, Mr. Judge Merchan has got to take control over the courtroom again. He has got to sit there and warn him, don't do this anymore. I'm going to have to find you in contempt. And this will make finding number 11 or 12. So, he better be very careful.

So, CNN has learned that Western intelligence believes Russia is seeking to exploit what it sees as a window of opportunity to expand its attacks on Ukraine. As Kyiv waits for new U.S. weapons and other aid to arrive, three officials tell CNN that Moscow wants to take advantage of that lag time. It's important to note that it took months for the U.S. Congress to approve the new aid, as Ukraine struggles with the lack of military equipment and ammunition. CNN's Jim Sciutto broke the story, and is joining us live. Good morning to you, Jim. So, what more can you tell us? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: Well, it shows in effect, Fredricka, that there are still consequences from the long, months-long delay in U.S. aid and that Russia sees an opportunity here as Ukraine awaits that aid, that ammunition, weapons systems etc. to arrive in quantities. They see an opportunity here to step up, in particular, air attacks, missile attacks, drone attacks, to exploit that delay. And we saw a sample of that on Wednesday overnight, as Russia sent dozens of drones and missiles, specifically targeting energy infrastructure, which has been a favorite target of theirs. They want to take advantage of that before Ukraine can in effect arm itself up again to defend itself. And it's also a reminder, Fredricka, that during this delay, Ukraine lost ground. It lost territory, and it lost a lot of soldiers. And I've spoken to Ukrainian commanders who blamed those losses, including those losses of soldiers, on that delay. It really shows that the lasting effects of a long delay in U.S. assistance to Ukraine war effort.",
