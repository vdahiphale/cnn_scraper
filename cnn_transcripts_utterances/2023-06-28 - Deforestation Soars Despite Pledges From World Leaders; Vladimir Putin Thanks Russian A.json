I'm only speculating here.

But he does have a lot of support as you played the clip at the outset. And one thing I wanted to mention is that there is this real now I would say proliferation of these private militia groups, not only Prigozhin, but Kadyrov of the head of the Chechen militia group. And then individual companies even like Gazprom, the big gas company have their own militia group. So it's a very difficult situation if a country is trying to prosecute a war, to have all these splinter groups, essentially militias that are under private control. They're not under the command and control of the armed forces. So it's a terribly complex situation to for the Ministry of Defense to try to get their arms around.

So we can directly translate those numbers of forest loss to human health to malaria cases.What we're seeing right now in Peru is a really massive outbreak of dengue that's much more severe than anything they've seen in recent years. And that is likely linked to some climate variation and climate change that's happening right now. And of course, you know, you mentioned those new locally acquired malaria cases here in the United States, which have a lot to do with many aspects of global change, mostly probably people traveling around and bringing in new cases of malaria, but some local transmission is being sustained as well.

And it seems the world kind of yawned, one tv critic says Seacrest makes Pat Sajak looks edgy, writing this. \"He is a known quantity and more than that a known vanilla quantity. A creature of television who is not so much a star as he is a star adjacent. He's one of those people who just seems to always be there, no matter where there is. He's the expensive wallpaper of TV hosting.\"I guess, you know, Wheel of Fortune, as it is, is already a sure ratings powerhouse. The most watched program in syndication. So is this choice of the Seacrest simply a case of if it's not broke don't fix it? You just (INAUDIBLE).",

In any case it's just a game show host, so yes, if it's not brokedon't fix it. The show sells itself, it's been almost 50 years of Wheel of fortune. It is comfort food. It's guilty pleasure, even I turn in. And I don't watch a lot of television. You love the contestants, the games, something very guessable. Sometimes they're hard and you like seeing somebody smart get it. You root for the contestants, it doesn't even matter who is the host. Ryan Seacrest is yes, he is the every man. I remember him back in the day on the E Channel, then he hosted a talk show, American Idol. He's done everything under the sun, he produces the Kardashian shows. So who else is going to get the job? I wake up every day sweating that he is coming after my job.",

She has received only bonuses not raises during that time period. Compare that to Pat Sajak's contract, which according to a 2016 report by Forbes, was worth $15 million a year.

They want to see what she is wearing and what kind of two sentences is she going to say at the end of the show. I would say give her whatever she wants and I agree there should not be gender disparity in their pay. People also are going to want some familiarity.
