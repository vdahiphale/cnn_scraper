She is the CEO of Firearms Beyond International. Jennifer, thanks so much for being here. Let's start with this Brian Walshe case.  Ana Walshe has been missing for at last a week, 10 days.  They've found a bloody knife, hacksaw, bloody cloth, blood stains in the basement, $450 worth of cleaning supplies.  He's made misleading statements. What would it take to charge this guy with murder at this point? JENNIFER COFFINDAFFER, CEO, FIREARMS BEYOND INTERNATIONAL &amp; RETIRED FBI SPECIAL AGENT:  They could charge now. Probably they have the probable cause to prepare an affidavit to support that. What they're looking for are DNA results.  They want to see that that blood on that hatchet, on that knife, on the other things actually belongs to Ana. They also want to see if possibly Brian also has DNA.  It would be perfect if it was co-mingled in terms of a strong case to build against Brian for committing this possible crime.",

This was a determination by the secretary of HHS.  This reason is there's still a lot of COVID out there. And the public health emergency, in his determination, gives us tools to fight this.

That evidence is very, very clear. There are now at least five high-quality studies that demonstrate that.  They're all done by independent labs.

This is why I have recommended it to all of my family and friends and to Americans.
