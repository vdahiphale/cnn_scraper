The latest on that in just a moment.Then, the high stakes media trial everyone's watching. Starting today, more on the showdown between Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems. And the latest shocking incident of gun violence in the U.S. A man is charged with shooting a teenager after the 16-year-old rang the doorbell at the wrong house. An American journalist accused of spying on Russia will remain behind bars, at least for now. A Wall Street Journal Reporter, Evan Gershkovich, appeared at a hearing in Moscow just a short while ago. You can see him here standing inside that glass case. The U.S. Ambassador to Russia is demanding his immediate release. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYNNE TRACY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: I can only say how troubling it was to see Evan, an innocent journalist, held in these circumstances. I was able to meet Evan yesterday at the Court of a Prison. It was the first time he was (INAUDIBLE) since his wrongful detention more than two weeks ago. I can report he's in good health and remain strong despite his circumstance. We will continue to provide all appropriate support to Evan and his family. And we expect Russian authorities to provide continued consular access to Evan. The charges against Evan are baseless, and we call on the Russian Federation to immediately release him. We also call for the immediate release of Paul Whelan. Paul has been held more than four years in Russia. Both men deserve to go home to their families now. Thank you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, certainly this is something that has sparked international attention. As you say, his appeal was denied. The next hearing, his lawyers say, will beat the end of May, which is when this stage of his pretrial detention expires.We heard a little bit about what his life is like, Max, in Lefortovo Prison, that notorious prison in Moscow. He's said to be keeping his spirits up, reading, apparently \"War and Peace\", exercising, trying to keep his health up, which is significant because, of course, we've seen the health of multiple detainees in Russia deteriorate. Trevor Reed, among them, Alexei Navalny another. So that's significant. Pretrial detention, it can be quite long in Russia. We saw that Paul Whelan, who is still detained on the same charges for espionage, was in pretrial detention for about 15 months. Trevor Reed, also over a year. Brittney Griner was the shortest, actually. She was in pretrial detention about five months, but her charges were less severe, and plus she had pleaded guilty as well. So, look, I think we can expect perhaps more of the same as we move towards trial. The Russian authorities have made it very clear they want to see this play out in the courts.",

We believe this is the second public visit to these regions illegally annexed by Russia since the invasion of Ukraine. It's usually these tight shots which are a little bit difficult to identify.We have seen one road sign in one of the videos released by the Kremlin, which shows the town of Henichesk, which is just across the border from Crimea in the Kherson region. He is meeting with commanders. He asked for a report on the situation in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, which is significant because we are at the stage of the war now, where we are expecting Ukraine to launch some kind of spring counter offensive. So, you know, that's perhaps why he's there at this moment, but also because we are in the lead up to victory day in Russia. And I think it's important for Putin to show a domestic audience that there are areas which Russia controls in Ukraine.",

There's been a lot of overnight aerial bombardment of areas within the center of Khartoum around that key army headquarters. Area houses and districts that had previously managed to maintain access to water and electricity have now lost that. And we are going on day five, Max. We've had four whole days of this, and now people are running out of food. They've been told by both sides to continue to shelter at home, but it's hard to do that when you have hungry family members around you and there is really nowhere for them to go. Even the hospitals now. We have these extraordinary images, Max, of nurses trapped inside of hospitals, of doctors forced to evacuate. Doctors have now said that all the major hospitals in Sudan have either been hit by one or other of the warring sides or they have been forced to shutter.",

Dominion accuses Fox News of knowingly airing false claims that the company's voting machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election against Donald Trump. Jury selection was delayed on Monday amid reports of possible settlement tours, but Dominion is asking for $1.6 billion still in damages. However, as of yet, no settlement has been announced and opening statements are set to begin later in the day.

So what's going to happen ahead (ph) today is the judge is going to finalize the jury and then afterward, yes, opening statements are set to begin in this $1.6 billion defamation case. It comes after, of course, some 11th hour drama where the trial was unexpectedly and really inexplicably delayed.But things are set to get underway and opening statements are set to take place today. It's going to really be an agonizing process, I think, over the next five to six weeks. For Fox News, you're going to have some of the highest profile stars. People like Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson come to this courthouse and have to testify about their role in promoting Donald Trump's election lies in the wake of the 2020 election. You're also expected to see executives, very high profile executives like Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch, have to come testify about what his network did after Biden won the election. So it's set to be a really high stakes trial, a high wattage trial with a lot of stars coming down to Wilmington to testify. And it's going to be a really interesting trial because Fox News hasn't really been held accountable in any real way after promoting these election lies. This is a real chance for a jury to send a message to Fox News that what they did about destabilizing American democracy was not OK. And it'll be interesting to see how this, of course, plays out in court.",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, the Holocaust Remembrance Day is an incredibly meaningful and somber day for Israel, the Jewish state that was really founded in the aftermath and the embers of the Holocaust. And many, many Israelis have a personal connection to the Holocaust, usually in the form of family members, either parents, grandparents, great grandparents who perished or survived the Holocaust.And the most notable event of the day is, of course, that two-minute long siren that blare is exactly at 10:00 a.m. And it's an incredible scene to see, really, people stop in their tracks. They might be crossing the street, they will stop in the crosswalk. People driving along the highways will pull off to the sides and they will get out of their cars and they will stand for two minutes in complete silence in remembrance to the millions upon millions of people who were killed in the Holocaust. There are many different ceremonies today, especially at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial and Museum there. There are six different torches that are lit to represent the 6 million Jews killed. They are each lit by a Holocaust survivor. Max, there are more than 147,000 Holocaust survivors still living in Israel in 2023. More than 400 of them have celebrated their 100th birthday. So they have very clear memories of what happened in the Holocaust. And interestingly, they have noted that in the past year, more than 500 of them have come just recently from Ukraine. So moved from Ukraine because of the situation there, moved to Israel, and are designated as Holocaust survivors. Now, today is the type of day that politics is put aside. The Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, appearing alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and is saying that despite the divisiveness in Israeli society over politics, over the proposed judicial reform, he said, today is the day to put that all to the side and to unite.

      "sentences": "Yes, Max, without question. When you look at the issue of guns, I mean, you know, we talk about churches, schools, malls, it's just incredible. And it's incredibly disappointing. And certainly in these particular instances, you have to ask yourself whether it was necessary in the case in Missouri with respect to knocking on a door, ringing a doorbell, you certainly wouldn't expect or anticipate that you'd be shot for that.Now, obviously, there are laws in the states, and those laws provide for you to defend yourself. There's a stand-your-ground law in that jurisdiction in Missouri. And that stand-your-ground law, Max, indicates that you can fire your weapon if you're in immediate fear of death or serious physical injury. The question here is, was the homeowner in such fear? Apparently, prosecutors think not. Pivoting to the issue in New York, New York does not have a stand-your-ground law. Very briefly, all the stand- your-ground law says is that you don't have to retreat, move away, find safe harbor. You can stand your ground, but it's not a license to kill. It's not a license to shoot and fire. It's a license to protect yourself if necessary and if immediately necessary. And so if you look at the issue in New York when someone goes in the wrong driveway and then indications are that they're driving away, you have to ask yourself the question, were you an immediate fear of someone who's driving out of your yard? Prosecutors think not again, and therefore he is charged with second degree murder. So too many shootings, too much violence, and too little justification for the shots that are fired.",

      "sentences": "I think that he has an incredible point. The bottom line is that you can't have instances where you're shooting someone simply because of the color of their skin. Now, the prosecutor, certainly the home owner, is entitled to a trial. The laws in the United States provide for there to be a jury trial where a jury of your peers have to unanimously evaluate whether you did something wrong.But early indications are that why were you shooting at someone who was simply ringing your bell? What was the immediate fear that you were facing at the time? Why did you feel the need to shoot him in the head and then the need to shoot him in the arm? What specifically was he doing that represented a threat or danger to you? Why was he released? Why was he not charged then? So I think all of the information that Ben Crump raises, who obviously protects and defends civil rights of African Americans every day, I think are valid questions, and I think they need to be answered more importantly, if there needs to be some sense of justice. And we'll see what that justice looks like as the homeowner gets a trial and has the ability to explain himself. But early indications are that he has a lot of explaining to do in terms of the shooting looking like it was not justified at all.",
