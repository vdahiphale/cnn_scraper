      "sentences": "Good morning to you. You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington.Across Central and South Florida, crews right now are scrambling to rescue people from the aftermath of Hurricane Milton. In some areas, the Category 3 hurricane dumped as much as 18 inches of rain, triggering flash floods and trapping people in their homes. Those water rescues, as you're seeing right here on your screen, continue this morning. And Florida officials say the storm also spun off a number of tornadoes. This right here is a decimated storage facility in Fort Pierce. Look at that. Even before the hurricane arrived, it whipped up an outbreak, as we were talking about, of tornadoes. This camera in Fort Pierce captured a tornado as it descended to the ground and ferociously shredded and tossed almost anything in its reach. Some of the deadly tornadoes also proved, as I pointed out, deadly. At least four people are confirmed dead in St. Lucie County about 150 miles from where Milton later made landfall. High winds also stripped the roof off Tropicana Field, where the Tampa Bay Rays played baseball. Earlier this week, it was announced that the stadium would be used as a base camp for 10,000 first responders and emergency workers. Well, we have a lot to cover today and our team is here to walk us through all the latest developments. Let's begin with CNN's Isabel Rosales in Tampa. And you were there at the dramatic overnight rescue of an assisted living center, and just to hear you speak to them in the last hour and all they went through actually sitting in water waiting for rescuers to arrive.",

They have gotten 135 residents out of an assisted living facility, and they're here right now in their wheelchairs, using walkers, many of them barefooted. That's how quickly they had to get out, cold, wet, waiting to be loaded up onto a Hillsborough County school bus and then taken over to the Yuengling Center. That is USF's basketball court, where I'm told by HCSO it has suddenly become a shelter for these residents. We have seen HCSO deputies and fire rescue right now giving them blankets, giving them snacks, juice, trying to help them out,many of them going through a very, very traumatic situation. I want to introduce to you two ladies here who told me they'd be willing to talk us through what happened, what they experienced. This is Teresa (ph). She's a resident. And this is Kayla (ph), who actually works at that assisted living facility. Teresa, can you bring me back to what happened when the floodwaters rushed in?",

The folks out here are now in the process of trying to just remove all of this debris. This neighborhood is one of the two neighborhoods that we believe these two tornadoes hit. And what you're looking at now are crews, as well as the owner of this house. They were on the roof of that one home there. And they're taking apart the portion of the roof that was torn apart by, again, this one tornado that was -- we believe hit this area yesterday. The owner of the house is in front of that forklift there. He was saying earlier today that him and his family were inside of the house when Hurricane Milton continued to make its way north. And because of all of the plywood that they had up around their house, they could not really tell what was happening outside, but they knew that something quite powerful was taking place. At some point, they figured out that a tornado was hitting their neighborhood, and so they sought shelter. That family is doing just OK. This one house here -- I'm going to walk a little bit, so you can see the other damage -- also had its roof torn apart. The owners were inside earlier today taking a look at the damage there. And we're being told that all of this debris is being put out for county officials to at some point remove. Again, Pam, the concern going into this hurricane for Southwest Florida was the storm surge. I covered Hurricane Ian two years ago, and the storm surge then was about 10 feet. Thankfully, thankfully, that number was way -- we were way under that number in yesterday's storm. Again, downtown Fort Myers, just to the north of where we are, we saw the storm surge there about four to five feet by the end of the night. And then over on Fort Myers Beach and Sanibel, the folks there are being allowed to return to their homes this afternoon to take a look at the damage that played out there as well -- Pam.",

This is the main thoroughfare, Orange Street, and you might be able to see Church Street.That sign is not where it's supposed to be because that whole streetlight is down. So we have seen traffic be diverted here. Also on the sidewalk, and not sure if you can see that, but we do have branches that are in the area, and that's kind of at least downtown what we have seen. You did mention that video of search-and-rescue crews wading in, in waist-deep water, going and checking in neighborhoods for people to make sure that they're OK. That was about 20 miles east of us at one area. But, here, what we have experienced is the lingering effects of Milton for hours after the worst event came barreling through here as a Category 1, the wind gusts significant, the rain over a period of days here, so that flash flooding is the concern still. Downtown, it seems to be spared a little bit, at least not with the flooding, and also we do not have power outages here, but in the Orlando area, rather, alone 88,000 people without power -- Pamela.",
