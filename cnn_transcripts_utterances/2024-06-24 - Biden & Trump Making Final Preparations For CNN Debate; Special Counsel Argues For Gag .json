Hello, I'm Brianna Keilar alongside Boris Sanchez. And we do begin this hour with the most anticipated moment of the 2024 presidential election so far, and that is that here in three days, President Biden and former President Trump are going to face each other for their first debate in nearly four years right here on CNN. The stakes couldn't be higher as both candidates prepare to make their pitches to voters. Right now, Biden is hunkered down at Camp David doing some intense debate prep. We're learning that he's getting ready for all possibilities, including even the chance that we could see a very different, more restrained Donald Trump on the debate stage come Thursday.",

However, he's not going to be holding mock debate sessions like Joe Biden. And I was with him this weekend in Philadelphia, and it's very clear that he enjoys playing up this fact that there's a very clear juxtaposition between how he's preparing and Joe Biden's more studious approach.But there's also been a very interesting sort of resetting of expectations going into this debate. You know, for months, they have been telling their supporters and swing voters that Joe Biden isn't up for the task anymore, that he is not physically and mentally up for the job. Well, more recently, he has sort of been changing his tune. He said that Joe Biden is, quote, \"a worthy debater.\" At the debate last weekend, he made a bunch of - or excuse me, at his rally last weekend, he made a bunch of suggestions that Joe Biden might be taking some sort of performance enhancers, obviously a baseless accusation there. But it does suggest that they are, you know, that doesn't necessarily project strength or confidence going into this debate, that they have sort of raised these questions. Yet before, he was saying he'll debate Joe Biden anytime, anyplace, anywhere. Now there's all these sort of like caveats about this week.",

Expect him to reference comments that Trump made where he would be a dictator on day one.Second, Trump's economic plan with an expectation that President Biden is going to talk about how Trump's plan would serve the wealthy and corporations, whereas his plan would do otherwise. And then finally, reproductive rights, with the administration and the campaign blanketing the airwaves this week, marking the second anniversary of the reversal of Roe v. Wade. Earlier today, Vice President Kamala Harris gave a speech where she appeared to be workshopping some newer and sharper language. [15:05:00] She said that if she were prosecuting the case, she would easily find Donald Trump guilty of being the one who revoked those rights from women and appeared to play into some of the parlor game around Trump's vice president search, saying that she knows that Trump has selected his vice president, but it doesn't matter who it is. In Harris' words, she said any one of them would be known to support abortion bans at the federal and state level and said that that outcome needs to be stopped, guys.",

In the first, which we now know that he had been diagnosed with COVID, he was combative. He interrupted the President. At one point leading President Biden, who was then the candidate, to tell him to shut up.And voters, by and large, left that debate with not feeling favorable about either candidate. Then, fast forward a little over a month later, there were muted mics in that situation, and there was a much more well-mannered, mild-mannered President Trump at that time. And so Biden had experience with both of those options and his advisors have said that they're prepared for both of those outcomes, if that were to happen. But CNN knows from its reporting and covering all of these debates going back for decades that first debates for sitting presidents can often trip them up. Sometimes they feel too comfortable in the job they've been living in it for so long. They're steeped in the content, and the challenge here for Biden will be to not let history repeat itself in that way.",

That's something that really animated his base. But they're saying that this could lead to threats and harassment against those in law enforcement who were involved.

And the real worry that caused the attorney general to speak out as you quoted to execute a search warrant and people think, you know, you're coming in with deadly force and that's when violence can happen.What's different here? In a word, nothing. The - what they've asked for is what's been approved again and again. That is any statements that Trump makes that could have specific, imminent and foreseeable harm to an agent involved in the case. That language is not an accident. It's been approved repeatedly. And there's an interesting dynamic here because we've been watching for months to see whether Judge Cannon might make a ruling that would expose her to oversight on the 11th Circuit and maybe even a recusal because the Special Counsel is saying this is exigent and can already point to two attacks, verbal attacks on FBI agents. If she doesn't rule as has been her want, it's possible that this motion gives Jack Smith an opportunity to say, I want to appeal her because she hasn't ruled. I want to go to the 11th Circuit and say she's got to do something here. And that would give the occasion that he hasn't had yet to try to recuse her.",

That is where that conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has been driven up over the course of the last few weeks and months here. Another message was the need to get humanitarian access into Gaza more easily. That continues to be an issue. And another issue is the need to discuss the day-after plans for Gaza. This is something that U.S. officials have said Israelis have been somewhat resistant to dig into. Matt Miller telling me today that they are somewhat more focused on those conversations now. But there are also a number of things that Netanyahu said over the weekend that Miller said the U.S. officials are opposed to. One of them is the possibility, Netanyahu said, of temporary military control over civilian life in Gaza. The U.S. opposes that.

How does that translate to what happens on the ground? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, that's going to be a really difficult aspect of this conflict because really what Israel is getting into right now, Boris, is what amounts to a two- front war. Gaza is not finished, no matter what anybody is saying in Jerusalem or what anybody is saying in Washington. Right now, the key thing is this, Gaza, there are major military operations that have stopped there. The Israelis basically want us to get into a phase where that operation looks like it's more or less done, and then they're just mopping up operations going on there. And then Israel wants to shift up to the northern front, which is, of course, the Lebanese border, and that means Hezbollah. What the ultimate goal there is for the Hezbollah forces to be forced back to the north of the Litani River. That is a boundary that was established back when they had a U.N. resolution that said Hezbollah should not go further south than that. Of course, they violated that many times. But basically, what we're looking at is a two-front war, the possibility of that, and Israel has to be very careful at this juncture.",

They're not allowing those weapons to move forward. Every other form of weapon, to my knowledge, is being supplied to Israel.So factually, the prime minister is wrong and - but he's using this as a way to, in essence, drive a wedge within the US body politic between the Republicans, who are very pro-Israel, and the Democrats, who basically support what President Biden is doing, also pro-Israel, but with certain limits.
