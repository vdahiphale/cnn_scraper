Tonight, President Biden says the strike sent a message to Iran about its allies, the attacks on ships in the Red Sea as mass protests erupt in Yemen and fears of a full-scale regional war intensify.Also, this hour, a potential blizzard and bitter cold are disrupting the final push to the critical Iowa caucuses. We're tracking the candidates and the severe weather with only three days to go before the first presidential votes of 2024. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Will Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get straight to our top story tonight, Iran-backed Houthi militants vowing to hit back after a U.S.-led coalition struck the rebel group's positions in Yemen. CNN National Security Reporter Natasha Bertrand is joining us now. She's got the latest developments. Natasha, first of all, what is President Biden saying as the U.S. braces for retaliation? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Well, Wolf, the president spoke briefly earlier today and he reiterated that the United States stands poised to respond to any additional Houthi action, including missile and drone attacks that they launch in the Red Sea. And he addressed concerns that Iran might get involved in this conflict because the Houthis are supported and backed by Iran. Iran has been providing them with intelligence to attack these vessels in the Red Sea. He was asked if we are in a proxy war with Iran. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The possibility now of an increase in attacks by these Iranian-funded, trained and equipped groups cannot be discounted.COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Probably through proxies, because the Iranians don't want to -- at least not yet, they don't seem to want to directly confront the U.S. and its allies. The other aspect of this is that the proxies that Iran has aren't necessarily as directly controlled as we sometimes think they are by the Iranians. HANCOCKS: All ideologically linked, supporting Gaza and attacking Israel in the United States, but with varying degrees of autonomy. DR. SANAM VAKIL, DIRECTOR, MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA PROGRAMME, CHATHAM HOUSE: Iran has benefited from decentralizing management over the groups. This comes with risks, though, because there is a much more agency for these groups and then thereby much more risk for Iran as well. (END VIDEOTAPE) HANCOCKS (on camera): A senior State Department official says that the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, brought a specific message to his Middle East tour recently, namely that if the U.S. were to carry out actions against the Houthis, it should be seen as defensive and not escalatory.

First of all, what can you tell us about these strikes and how far does all this go to degrade the Houthi's ability to carry out future attacks? REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D-NJ): Well, what's very clear as these are, as you heard, Iranian-backed proxies, so the Houthis have been firing missiles and drone attacks on ships in the region now for weeks. Many global ships have been diverted. You're talking about going to have 15 percent of all global commerce in the region. The Houthis, between drones and their missiles, have shot in the direction of U.S. ships, military ships, and, of course, have gone after U.S.-owned ships. So, the bottom line is, in this case, I think the president was completely right to respond. You can't let this go on unanswered. And as the president also said today, Wolf, which I think is very important, is Iran does not want war with the United States but this is are their proxies. They're backing the Houthis, they're behind this and you can't just let them go unanswered.",

But as the president also said today, they should expect a response. This just can't go unanswered. I called along with Brian Mast, Congressman Brian Mast, for the Houthis we designated as a foreign terrorist organization. And, clearly, this is clearly terrorist activity. They're doing it on behalf of the Iranians, the Iranian government. And so this is a very aggressive move from Iran's proxy. It's just like Hezbollah, just like Hamas. So, this is a very -- it's a very tense region right now. But the bottom line, the best way to keep things in check is you can't let them go unanswered.",

And that's like -- I don't think they got them themselves in and Iran has been pretty clear of who that they funded many of their proxies in the region, including Hamas, including Hezbollah.So, you know, what you have to look at here is Iran itself, and this has been their pattern over the years. Iran uses their proxies to attack others and to threaten others including Israel and our other allies in the region and, of course, us. Now, they've gone directly as well, the Iranian military, the IRGC, has attacked our allies, have gone after our bases, but, usually, the activity is through the proxies.

That's the commander-of-chief's to respond when there's an attack on our interests, and this is clearly an attack on our interests. And the president acted responsibly and, of course, proportionally. And that's what he's -- as commander-in-chief that's what his responsibility is.Now, if this goes on longer and it goes deeper in the region, I believe the president should come to the Congress. But when in terms of responding to an attack on our interests, where you're talking, again, thousands of ships have been affected, 15 percent of global commerce affects the supply chain, affects the global economy, and, of course, there's been a there's been missiles fired and drone attacks fired in the direction American ships and military, you have to respond, and I think the president acted accordingly.",

So, this is absolutely going to turn into a political issue.Now, it's not clear that this would make the charges themselves go away, but there will likely be calls for either one or both of them to step aside, potentially someone else to take over the case. I mean, it's -- this, for the Trump team, let me tell you, talking to sources in and around Trump world, I mean, this is really a gift because this gives them the opportunity to really try to undermine the credibility of this case that has always been such a concern, Wolf, because it's a state level case.
