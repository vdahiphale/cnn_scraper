So, we are, of course, waiting to hear from Donald Trump any moment, who will deliver this prebuttal speech ahead of Kamala Harris' speech tonight. What can we expect for her -- from her when she speaks at the Ellipse in Washington?EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Lynda, the goal of this speech is to get voters to imagine who they want to see in the White House in just three months. It's an opportunity for her to draw contrast in stark terms, but also to lay out her policy vision for America, and for her, who has run this truncated campaign, they've been constantly looking for how they can make the most of these big moments, and a speech in Washington at the same site where the former President had his now infamous January 6 speech is bound to garner a lot of attention. One of the themes she has landed on is that the former President has an enemies list, while she has a to-do list for the American people. She is going to talk about home ownership, lifting up our small businesses, lifting up families and children, and stepping away from this discourse that she argues that Trump is so wedded to in which he trashes people all the time. But, what we see from her is this effort to strike a balance between dire warnings about her -- the former President, calling him a fascist, and also, at the same time, trying to make sure that she maintains a forward-looking optimistic tone for the country. Take a listen to how she is thinking about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And it remains to be seen whether this conversation of democracy is really resonating with voters. There is a survey from Black Voters Matter that showed that young black voters in particular don't resonate with that. They care more about the economy and immigration. And so, you've noticed that the Harris campaign has used different language, like freedom, to communicate the threats of what Democrats see as the threats to democracy. But, she has to strike that balance between talking about democracy and the threats of democracy if Donald Trump returns to the White House, but also laying out her vision for what she calls this new generational vision for America.",

That was what I was told from Donald Trump's senior advisors that his Sunday speech was going to be about to be kind of, how could Donald Trump leave a final impression on Americans? And this isn't exactly what they want to be talking about.And just one other thing, because I do believe he is actually -- we're hearing that he is going to be coming out shortly, and one thing that I think Donald Trump will do at this press event here in Mar-a-Lago is really try to draw a sharp contrast with Kamala Harris, because she is actually giving remarks on the Ellipse later today, something that Donald Trump himself had done four years ago on January 6, 2021, right before that attack on the Capitol. When I talked to Donald Trump's team, they said that's really what his goal is with this, to try and draw a sharp contrast with Harris a week before Election Day, and recognizing that he wants to give a speech on his home turf with the trappings of Mar-a-Lago, just as she is doing so on the Ellipse.

Jackie, if I can go to you, Harris' team says this will be her closing argument, not only highlighting the difference between her and Trump, but also outlining her vision on economic policy, reproductive rights. What are the expectations, and what does she need to do to drive home her message, especially to those undecided voters? JACKIE KUCINICH, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE BOSTON GLOBE, &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: So, one of the reasons they were talking about democracy is they were seeing that it could potentially make inroads with those wavering Republican voters who Harris has really reached out to. But, as was said earlier, she is really trying to strike a balance between reaching out to those voters, adding them, and keeping some of the younger, more diverse voters engaged. She is also -- we also can't look at this in a vacuum, right? She has been traveling to these swing states. She was recently in Michigan, talking about manufacturing, really a part of the Biden administration's agenda that she has embraced and pushed. So, it -- I think hammering that home, and you know what she is looking forward to implementing, will be a focal point. That said, Trump is not doing her nothing but favors when he is talking, when he is having to say the words, I'm not a Nazi.

And I think what Democrats have to do is connect the issue of democracy with the issues of the economy and abortion rights and other freedoms that are important to them, and connecting the dots that, having the ability to vote, having the ability to demand something from a candidate, is a part of democracy, and I'm not sure that that's really resonating with voters.",

But, no, look, I mean this event, as you said, was supposed to be his prebuttal to what Kamala Harris is doing, the speech that she is giving later today on the Eclipse. So far, this has been a pretty standard Trump speech, for someone who has gone to dozens of rallies, and particularly those in recent weeks. This is exactly what you have heard from Donald Trump. He is talking about the economy. He is talking about inflation. But, he keeps saying that, even though others are telling me that that is the -- that the economy should be the number one issue, or is the number one issue with voters. I actually think the border is more important.He has been talking a lot, though, about immigration, again, something he has done increasingly in recent weeks, and he is really blaming Harris heavily for what he said are criminals coming over the border and flooding into this country. He overexaggerated, in some cases, I think, falsely stated the state of affairs on the southern border. But, I do want to say, he actually introduced something new that he would do, that he said he would do if he is elected. He said that for the first time, under his administration, that they would be seizing assets from drug cartels and use those assets for restitution for victims of migrant crimes, essentially saying that they will use government money, but also any money they can get from seizing these assets that he is speaking of to pay victims of migrant crime. And I'll keep that in mind, Lynda, because this is something we've seen. It's kind of an underlying theme of a lot of what Donald Trump has done and his messaging on immigration, really, throughout this entire cycle. They've really found specific cases of victims who, whether they were murdered or have had other crimes committed against them, really highlighting those stories, particularly if they from alleged crimes of immigrants who have come over and into the country illegally. But, all to say, he also did bring up the comments about there has been a lot of talk about whether or not Donald Trump meets the definition of a fascist he brought up on stage and he thinks Kamala Harris keeps calling him Hitler. Not true. Harris has not called him Hitler, but she did tell CNN that she believes Trump is a fascist. He said she is only using that type of rhetoric because she is not winning and she has nothing else to run in. So, he is continuing, again, to say a lot of the things we have heard. I think one key question I still have is whether or not he takes questions. These were remarks to the press. Unclear if he is actually, though, going to answer some of the press' questions, and if he does, I think that's where you may hear him address some of that rhetoric from Sunday at Madison Square Garden.

Julian, Donald Trump said Kamala Harris has caused misery, the destruction of our economy. Interesting to note, though, that Moody's Analytics, Goldman Sachs and of course 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists say that under the economic policy of Donald Trump, the U.S. will be much worse, and that his policy will actually reignite inflation.
