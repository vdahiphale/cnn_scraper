He actually faced the questions head on and to a raucous crowd, Richard, that was yelling. \"Let's go, Joe.\" He said, everybody is wondering what is Joe going to do? And his answer was: \"Here's my answer. I am running and I am going to win again.\" He is saying that there is no way that he is dropping out and you know, he is saying that, look, you voted for me as the nominee. There is no way that I am dropping out. What was also interesting was that he really took it to Donald Trump in the speech. Again, prepared remarks, called him the stable genius, also said referring to his felony conviction that he was a one-man crime wave and saying that he had failed all the character tests that he was given.

Sanjay, your article, which obviously took a great deal of thought and debate and consideration, particularly getting other doctors, their thoughts -- calling for detailed cognitive tests by Joe Biden and the results. You obviously did not do this lightly. Now, you say -- you had just heard my question. The fact is, people like me who have got no medical training at all, I am just sitting here waiting for something to happen. When he makes a speech, you're waiting to see if he is on top of it. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, I think what people saw in the debate, some of what they saw was not necessarily new. I think what was different was that it seemed very pronounced and it seemed very sustained. I mean, really from the first answer to the question in the night, I think it was pretty clear right away, this was not the performance he was hoping for, and I think that was what was concerning to a lot of people. I think the issue that I raised in the article and Paula just sort of alluded to this, what we don't know is, are these episodes that are intermittent or is this something that is sort of indicative of a larger, more concerning underlying condition? And the way to sort of get at that would be to do some pretty detailed cognitive testing. As far as we know, and we've asked the White House about this. he has not had any of that sort of testing done. But I will tell you, Richard, I was overseas when the debate happened. I was getting lots of texts and e-mails and phone calls from other brain doctors and all weighing in, but I think collectively, there were several things that we were noticing at the same time. And again, this isn't going to necessarily sound new, but in totality, it raised a level of concern, sort of the slowness of the speech, the slowness of the response, sometimes halting speech, sometimes the confused rambling that sort of went on. Also, you know, there was another thing, sort of the lack of expression in his face at the time. I was just watching him in Wisconsin. He seems to be smiling. His expression is there. But during that debate, it was not. What was going on? None of these types of things in and of themselves make any kind of diagnosis. But what I think they tell us, Richard, is that more testing is warranted. If he were my patient or if you were my father who is right around his age, that is what I would recommend. And in large part because there is something you can do about it nowadays as well. So giving tests, it is important not just for the country, but I think also for him in terms of possible treatments.",

And I think, you know what I was pointing out. These were things I think that everybody has been seeing for some time. I think again, what was particularly concerning was just to see it in such a sustained protracted fashion during the debate, but yes, I think asking and recommending testing to try and determine are these episodes related to things that are much more simpler to explain -- a poor night sleep, low blood sugar, a viral illness, a new medication, things like that, which it very well possibly could be, but the testing could also figure out that maybe there is something else going on cognitively are in terms of a movement disorder or something like that. And again, Richard, I think as physicians, the point is that you test in order to potentially do something about it, not to malign or demonize, but in order to actually potentially help the individual. So, we will see. But yes, you know and I know, you and I both have been doing this job for a long time. I know that it is going to be a very sensitive topic for a lot of people.",

So that makes that a very uphill climb. I think the general view in the Democratic Party is that if he wants to stay in the race, it is almost impossible to dislodge it.

But I'm not sure that withstands the kind of statements we've seen today when I think most people, you know, do this for a living in the Democratic Party, do not think any more than he can be Trump and that he could lead them to losses in the House and Senate, that could be pretty severe and take a long time to overcome.",

The other thing I'm just taking from this, Richard, and you can speak to this as well, you know, the incumbent parties in both France and Great Britain in the global inflation that we're experiencing post COVID.

But that does not seem in any way to be happening if anything, he's doubling down on this insistence. So, I think that the first thing you're going to see, as you're talking about pushing to the nth degree are more people expressing publicly what all -- what many of them are saying privately and which they are kind of leaving to a strange group, the donors, you know, to be the most public and saying this is not tenable. I do think you're going to see more senators and more House members coming out in the next few days if the White House continues to send the signal that he is not even really considering this. At a time when I think public and private polling would show you him trailing in all of the swing states that he needs to win. So, I do think that the Warner thing is significant.
