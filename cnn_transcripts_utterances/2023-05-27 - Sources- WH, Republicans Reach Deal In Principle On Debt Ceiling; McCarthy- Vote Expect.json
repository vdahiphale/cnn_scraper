We begin with a crucial moment in the debt ceiling talks. Multiple sources tell CNN that the White House and House Republican leaders have reached an agreement in principle, we should know, in principle on raising the nation's debt ceiling.Just 10 minutes from now, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will address reporters, we are told. Then, at the bottom of the hour, Republican leaders will brief their fellow colleagues in the GOP conference on the outlines of this deal. The briefing comes after a phone call earlier this evening between McCarthy and President Biden. And CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is at the White House for us. Priscilla -- and Manu Raju is still with us up on Capitol Hill. Late night, guys. Priscilla, what can you tell us?",

For now, a few details here. The deal keeps non-defense spending roughly flat with current fiscal 2023 levels in 2024. Also, looking through here, work requirements, the President, it says according to the source, fought policies that would have taken away healthcare and push people into poverty. No changes to Medicaid. And we're also learning that the President protected the Inflation Reduction Act. This is something that has been critical for the White House, is protecting those legislative accomplishments by the President.So, we're learning slowly some of the details that have been reached in this agreement, again, from a source familiar with the negotiations. And Jim, we will bring that to you as we delve a little deeper into these details. But, look, this has been the product of a lot of work, or especially over the last 24 hours. Over the course of the day, we were in touch with White House officials who were expressing optimism about the direction of these talks. Even last night, President Biden himself, on his way to Camp David, saying that they were \"very close to a deal\". So, we're starting to see that take shape. Now, the timing is critical. Just yesterday, right before President Biden went to Camp David, we also learned from the Treasury Secretary that firm June 5 date when the nation would no longer be able to meet its obligations, and in other words, run out of cash. And so, this has been a really critical 24-hour timeframe for this White House, as they worked with Hill negotiators, and as the President stayed engaged from Camp David, as -- or sources have told us. So, again, learning more and more about these details, and I'm sure Manu will have more from the House Speaker as well soon.",

Just to go over a couple of things, Jim, holding the spending flat, the domestic spending flat is not -- there are not real cuts with that. It is protecting -- you are protecting what you have. And then, the Military and Veterans will also be protected. In fact, they could get some increases. Extending this for two years is a real gift to the President, because if this agreement went on for two years, he doesn't have to worry about this politically as we -- in a run up to the elections, it's just a few months before that. We have a major crisis over this issue and how the stock market and everything else go to pieces, could be -- could really be a catastrophic loss for him.But, again, a two-year extension, which it sounds like they have, the Republicans are -- I think are conceded something to do the Democrats I wouldn't have expected. And it does seem on these work requirements, the -- again, the President is trying to protect, very hard to protect what he has, the programs he has. And for the most part, he is doing all right. The work requirements may well go in his direction. So, bottom line, we still don't know there are a lot of ifs, ands and buts. There is a lot we're going to learn at 9:10, hopefully, and -- but I'm just sensing this, the sense that I have over this, I'm surprised this is more to the President's liking than a lot of members were going to feel.

It has historic reductions in spending, consequential reforms that will lift people out of poverty into the workforce, rein in government overreach. There are no new taxes, no new government programs. There is a lot more within the bill. We still have more work to do tonight to finish all the writing of it. I do want to take a moment, though. I do want to thank Garret Graves and Patrick McHenry for all their work on this, and for all the work that we're going to continue to do tonight.

So, the country doesn't have to go through all this again during a presidential election cycle.Catherine Rampell, let me go back to you since I cut you off there. I hate doing that. But, we knew the Speaker might only speak for a few moments, and that's exactly what he did.

That's relevant information for the American public to know. But also, because it matters for forecasting the likelihood that this will actually get through the House.Again, I keep coming back to the fact that there is a large contingent of the Republican Conference that has said the bill that was passed before is the floor not the ceiling on what they are demanding. And clearly, not only has Biden made some concessions but McCarthy has made significant concessions relative to that bill that was already passed. So, without knowing the meat of this agreement, it's very hard to know whether it is likely to get through the House, and if it doesn't get -- or if Republicans are not all on board, is it appealing enough to some Democrats to supply votes, and what's the downstream fallout from that? So, he didn't say a lot. The fact that he didn't say a lot suggests to me that we have a lot to learn, and we need to figure out what's in this deal, how likely it will be to get through, and what it means for the American public.",

That is the situation here. They're going to -- he said that they're going to release the bill text tomorrow. There have been some expectation that they could get it done today. They want the bill texts out today, which is why they had hoped that the 72 hours would expire on Tuesday, they could have a vote on Tuesday.But, now that the bill text is not going to be out till tomorrow, that means they can't vote until Wednesday at the earliest, which will push things even closer to the default deadline. Now, the question would be, whether he'll have the votes to get it through this chamber by Wednesday? He would not say in that very brief statements whether or not he wouldn't take any questions. So, it's unclear if he has got his members on board, which is why he has -- he is briefing his members. But, that is going to be his challenge. The other challenge will be, let's just assume they get the votes in the House. The House Republicans are expecting a majority of their conference will support it. We'll see if that actually happens. We'll see how many Democrats help defray those Republican defections and push it through the chamber. That's another question. Other question, how long will it take to get to the United States Senate? The Senate could take up to a week to get legislation done. Any one member could slow down the process. There are ways to object. And if there are some members who are not happy with this ultimate deal, that we've already heard some griping among some conservative Senators who did not like the reports of this emerging deal, how are they going to respond when they have been essentially jammed, not shed off this process, had not had chance to really weigh in? Will they slow down the process as we are staring at the prospects of the first ever default? Those are all huge hurdles and real questions, which is why typically something like this needs to be hammered out over a month of time and take weeks to go through the House and Senate. They're trying to do this in a matter of days, which is why this is so complicated. And every hour is so significant, but significant that they have a deal in principle. Now, they got to finish the writing of the text, and then starting to count the votes, the next two big major hurdles ahead. Jim.",

There is no new taxes, according to McCarthy. There is also worker protection, from Biden's point of view. He -- they're not getting rid of all -- are not imposing a whole series of new worker reduction things (inaudible) people on food stamps. It doesn't seem to be part of the pact, which also would help Biden.But, he -- McCarthy argued, first thing he said was the bill has \"historic restrictions in spending\", reductions in spending, historic reductions in spending. We'll have to wait to see what that is. But, if -- if what we see coming out of this all together, is that the spending levels will be held steady. They won't -- we won't rise, they won't fall.

I think because a lot of market participants had been operating on the assumption that what's past is prologue, that they worked it out at the last minute in 2011, in 2013. Other times when it looked like there might be potential brinksmanship, they will work it out again today.Again, my view is that we are not out of the woods yet. I very much hope that there is a real agreement and that it gets through both Houses of Congress swiftly before we hit the so called X-date and potentially become unable to pay some of our bills. But, I think we don't actually know that we are at that point yet because of all of those other steps that my colleagues have just mentioned, including the fact that whatever the deal may be, may continue to be divisive within the Republican Party as well as within the Democratic Party. So, if you start to see, in the next couple of days, lawmakers, in either party for that matter, noting that they're going to do something to try to obstruct the smooth passage of that legislation, then, yes, I would imagine that markets would take that into consideration. You might see some greater stresses in certain markets. But, if everybody assumes that we are on a pathway to raising or suspending the debt limit, that there is a pathway that gets us there that will not exert significant stresses on the overall economy, as some of the potential plans that had been discussed might, then I think we should see some calmer market activity in the next couple of days.

They can object to anything on the floor of the Senate, because everything requires unanimous support to essentially have the Senate to operate. If not, they have to go through all these motions to overcome those delaying tactics.So, a lot of questions about whether anyone will actually go to that length.

One of the biggest hurdles so far is their shortage of air traffic controllers. They're down about 3,000 controllers so far. The agency has warned that it will impact summer travel. Jim.",

So, one reason that AAA said we may not have crossed the threshold of pre-pandemic road trips from Memorial Day weekend is because these prices are still pretty high.But they are coming down, especially here in California, Alaska, New York, New Jersey and Florida seeing some of the steepest declines. Also, Jim we talked to analysts from GasBuddy. They said that it is appearing less and less likely that the national average for gas will go above $4 for the summer travel season, certainly good news for anybody about to take their great American road trip.

Well, it certainly is a pretty remarkable video that was put forward by Ukraine's top general, Valery Zaluzhny, on one of his social media accounts, and it essentially seems to show Ukrainian soldiers getting ready for battle and saying it's time to take back what's ours. Now, you also see a lot of Western-supplied Military equipment in that video as well, including HIMARS, of course, supplied by the U.S. but also German-supplied Leopard 2 main battle tanks. It is absolutely unclear whether or not that could be an indication that that looming possible large scale counteroffensive by the Ukrainians might be inching closer.However, one of the things that we've sort of been picking up on over the past couple of days is increasing long-distance strikes seemingly by the Ukrainians on cities in Ukraine that are under Russian control. It seems to focus on two places. One of them is Berdyansk where we've seen strikes in the past couple of days, but also Mariupol as well. And in fact, today, there were reports of three explosions happening in Mariupol, Mariupol certainly one of the main staging grounds for the Russian Military for their operations in Ukraine. So, that could be something potentially that could hurt the Russians quite badly in the rear echelon. But, all this comes as the war continues in its full brutality. And of course, there was that massive incident that happened in the town of Dnipro where the Russians apparently struck a medical facility there. Two people were killed. A lot of people were injured as well. A lot of them are still actually in hospital. And the Ukrainians are saying one of the things that made all of that so deadly is the fact that apparently the Russians used missiles that are normally used to shoot down aircraft and fire them into an urban area. And of course, if you use those missiles in a ground-to-ground configuration, they do become extremely inaccurate, and that certainly increases the possibility of them killing civilians and causing large human carnage. That appears to be what happened there in Dnipro, and that is something that's been heavily condemned, not just by the leadership here in Ukraine but internationally as well, Jim.",

According to a source, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says he plans to speak with the President again tomorrow afternoon before the actual text of what's in the legislation is posted.The Speaker also said he expects the House to then vote on the agreement on Wednesday, calling it worthy of the American people. A democratic aide tells CNN, House Democrats will be briefed on the tentative deal by the White House tomorrow at 5 p.m. Of course, it still has to go through the Senate before going to the President.
