I want you to listen now to the mother of Samya Stumo, she was killed in that 2019 Ethiopian air crash. And she says that Boeing is incapable of cultural change, listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NADIA MILLERON, DAUGHTER SAMYA STUMO KILLED IN 2019 737 MAX 9 CRASH: Every single rubric that he has in place to push for safety he had in place five years ago. It's just that they don't follow it. So, when they get pressed for time, and they need to produce a lot of planes quickly. They throw all of their safety rubrics out the window, and they tell the people that work at Boeing, don't pay attention to that, don't pay attention to that, we need to produce planes faster.

But there have been quality issues over and over again at Boeing not only with the 737 line, but also with a 787 line and whistleblowers coming forward there. Also on the 777 line and whistleblowers coming forward on that plant as well. They build those planes at a separate plant from the Renton plant that builds the 737. They built those at the Everett plant in Washington. So, this is really a big thing here for Boeing. And also, it's something that acknowledged by CEO Dave Calhoun, he says that Boeing will change its culture, that it's been listening to the concerns, although we will see if that is the case. There were a lot of questions immediately after the door plug blow out, whether or not heads would roll at the top. He is letting go of that top post at Boeing, said to retire at the end of this year, although not without one more blasting from (AUDIO GAP).",

Now, I should note that the 2024 questions specified undocumented immigrants specifically, but still the timeline here. Oh, my goodness gracious. In 2016, it was just 40 percent who favored deporting all living in the U.S. illegally. Look at where we are in 2024, 62 percent in a read -- recent CBS News YouGov poll. So, what we're seeing is much more hawkish views on illegal immigration in the American public at large and perhaps not so surprisingly, look at this question, which compares 2020 and 2024 at this point. All right, Biden versus Trump on immigration, August of 2020. Look at this. Biden was favored by seven points on immigration, look at where we are in May of 2024. Donald Trump is favored by 11 points. So, what we're seeing is those more hawkish views on illegal immigration, translating when American voters are looking at Biden versus Trump on the issue of immigration, with Trump being the beneficiary.",

This was a guy who went out there and passionately fought for DACA for passing a pathway to citizenship. Marco Rubio, the architect in the Gang of Six (ph) for immigration reform many years ago, running to be the vice president for Donald Trump, the guy who is quoting Hitler, the guy who is saying that we need to -- the immigrants are poisoning the blood of this country. The reason we have not had action on immigration reform is because of the Republican Party. Joe Biden has been willing to upset some members of his -- of his coalition of voters to try to get a deal on immigration reform. He is putting things out there now that are humane and positive, that are trying to find solutions to help people. On my way over here, when I was taking my taxi over here, the driver that I was -- that took me here, he is in a mixed status family, he would actually benefit from what Joe Biden just did today. This is not just some issue that's numbers and statistics, this is about people. This is about families. This is about providing solutions, and helping make our country better.
