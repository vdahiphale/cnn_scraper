Maybe this won't happen, or it will happen only to a small degree. But if it does happen, I can guarantee you, you will hear one thing from Donald Trump and all of his minions. It's Biden's fault.

Democratic House leader Hakeem Jeffries revealing in a new statement this afternoon that there is at least one consistent detail in all of these threats that were sent to several lawmakers on Thanksgiving. And he writes in the statement, quote, \"These incidents range from detailed threats of a pipe bomb placed in mailboxes to swatting, all signed with, quote, \"MAGA\" at the conclusion of the message.\"So obviously the last part there is something Jeffries is revealing for the first time that does appear to have been consistent in all of these threats that were sent and targeted Democratic lawmakers over the holiday. And look, we need to be very clear here too, that law enforcement officials are still working to investigate whether there was any sort of motive or potential ideology that went in and was behind these threats, right? This is a key part of the investigation and one that will play out in the coming days and weeks. But again, we at least know that there is a consistent theme or at least a consistent detail that ranged across the various threats that were sent out. And this speaks to something that a spokesperson for Senator Chris Murphy, who you obviously mentioned was among those who received one of these targeting these threats. In a statement to me earlier, she said that this appears to be part of a coordinated effort involving multiple members of Congress and public figures. So potentially this could be what she was referencing, some similarity across the threats. And more broadly, this does underscore a concerning trend that law enforcement officials are taking notice of and one that, you know, even if these bomb threats, which in this case all were investigated, no evidence of a bomb was found, but even if there was no bomb ultimately discovered, these threats can have an incredibly destabilizing effect. Law enforcement officials increasingly believe that they can be intended to intimidate government officials to disrupt government operations, including vote counting process and the vote administering process. So really a range of possibilities here as law enforcement officials work with members of Congress and others who have received similar threats to try to pin down where they're coming from and what's motivating them.",

I mean, attacking leaders in Congress, people newly appointed to the next administration, all those kinds of things, you can maybe start to see some kind of tie in. You'll get some copycats. But you know, law enforcement is going to take this very, very seriously. And people need to understand, again, this is not a joke. It is something very serious. And I think that when we start using terms like it's not credible and things like that, it kind of makes people think it's not as serious as it really is. Obviously, if a bomb doesn't go off or you wind up, it's really not a home invasion in progress. But in this current climate, it's just a matter of time before one of these kinds of calls turn out to be legit. And then where are we? And so, you know, everything has to kind of ratchet down a little bit, and we really got to start taking this stuff serious.",

One, in places like the United States, bans like this are almost unenforceable because of the First Amendment. You've seen various states introduce similar laws like in Utah, only for courts to strike them down, saying that they go against the, the Constitution. And then secondly, age verification online is really hard to do.Now, this law requires the platforms, so social media companies to be the ones doing that age verification. But when you talk to platforms, they're going to argue that the responsibility should be really left to the device makers, whether that be the mobile phone manufacturer or the computer manufacturer. But overall, it's really hard to do age verification right. If you were to introduce something like biometrics, you run into a ton of privacy data violation problems. And that's especially problematic with kids because you'll note in most countries, including the U.S. we have stricter data privacy laws for kids than we do adults. And then you also run up against the problem of government issued IDs. A lot of young people, as you know, especially under 16, they don't have any form of a government issued ID yet.",

And if we can give that balance back to the families and give them that extra three years. As a psychologist, I tell parents, get them through middle school, get them into hopefully their junior year of high school, and that's really when kids can actually, I think, tolerate some of the things that come through those algorithms. So if you're just looking at it from a clinical perspective, then my doctor opinion is that I think it's a really great idea and we've got to figure out ways that we can make these age verifications work for families and for these kids.",

Is instead of coming up with some sort of blunt law where it's virtually unenforceable, come up with various transparency measures, various changes to privacy measures so that you can make it a safer place for the kids that are using it. And that has been the route that we've been going on in the U.S.I mean, if you look at the FTC, they've been urging to bring child privacy laws down from age 16 to age 13. They've been cracking down more on child policy -- policy violations. On companies like Meta and TikTok, the platforms are trying to introduce more children friendly features and products. If you look at Meta, they've got messenger for kids. You know, TikTok has an under 13 policy, but then, you know, kids over 13 have a different experience which is much more moderated. That to me is the route that you should be going because it's actually enforceable. Whereas if you look at what Australia is doing, it's so blunt trying to expect that these social media platforms are going to be able to actually do age verification otherwise face huge fires. What's going to end up happening is they're going to have to actually pull some of their features from these countries and that's not the viable solution either. So I think from the U.S. perspective, we're actually kind of treading the right path here, trying to find that middle ground as opposed to doing something so blunt that it's not even possible.",
