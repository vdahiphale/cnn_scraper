I just want to look at Dover to see what the margin is. Again, you know, 71% of the vote in there. You come down along the Seacoast. This is an area where I think Dan and her friends were calling them country club Republicans. But there are also a lot of blue-collar people as well. That's what makes the mix so interesting.

The last polling places are closing in New Hampshire, and we now have a key race alert on where the Republican presidential race stands right now.As of now, it is too early to call the Republican presidential primary New Hampshire. Donald Trump is taking an early lead in the vote over Nikki Haley with 12% of the vote in. Donald Trump has 52.4% of the vote. Nikki Haley is about 2,300 votes behind that, with 46.6% of the vote. But there's still 88% of the vote outstanding. It's too early to make a projection in the Republican primary race as of now. But we do have a projection we can make right now. And CNN is projecting the President Biden will win as a right-in candidate in the Democratic Primary New Hampshire over multiple challenges -- or challengers who were on the actual ballot. Remember, this primary is not sanctioned by the Democratic Party here in Washington, DC, and it does not count for delegates. Still, the DNC did not want Biden to lose and he did pull off a right-in candidate victory in a primary that is not official. Now that the voting has ended, we can reveal more specific exit poll information about the Trump-Haley face off for you. David Chalian has those numbers. David?",

Among registered Republicans, which make up 50% of the electorate, Donald Trump is winning 74% of them to Nikki Haley's 24%, a 50-point lead with half the electorate, the Republicans. Now, those registered undeclared, they make up a slightly smaller share, 47% of the electorate. Haley's winning them 66% to 32%, so she's winning them by a narrow or slightly narrower margin than Trump is winning Republicans and they're a slightly smaller group. As for the education divide, it's not just in American politics broadly, it is also within this Republican nomination race in New Hampshire. College graduates make up 48% of the electorate. Haley wins them by 20 points, 58% to Donald Trump's 39%. Voters without a college degree make up a slightly larger share, 52% of the electorate today in New Hampshire, and Trump wins them by a big margin, 66% to Haley's 32%. So again, we're seeing Donald Trump win these slightly larger groups by bigger margins than Haley's winning the groups where she has strength -- Jake.",

So if these numbers hold, and it is still very early, and we're just talking about a small number, but if it is within single digits, what they're saying to me is that's a win for them. But coming in first is the win. Coming in second, even under 10%, still means you're coming in second.

He went in there. He got 100,000 votes, I believe. Obviously, there were many more candidates still in the race. It was much more competitive at that point. But they are hoping to see him have a real big margin here. And if they don't, that's what his concern is. That's why he's been talking about and pushing a false claim that Democrats can vote in today's election. As we know, they can't. The cutoff is every official in New Hampshire has reminded us, including Republicans, was back in October. But Trump has been pushing that. He's also been addressing this argument that has been made by Nikki Haley in the closing days, which is that she is more electable than Donald Trump is in a race against Joe Biden. He's just posting about it in all caps on his website moments ago, because it is a real concern of his, of what his electability is going to be. It's also a concern that Ron DeSantis is sharing. People like Bob Good, the congressman who's the head of the House Freedom Caucus, they have also -- despite the fact that they've endorsed Trump, have also raised concerns about what the longevity for his success is, despite how well he is.",

That is something that the Trump campaign needs to pay attention to if he is indeed the nominee. Just in 2016, he won undeclared voters in New Hampshire, in the primary, over a much more crowded field. In that crowded field, he took about 36% of the crowded field. He only got 32% in a two-person race. It shows you the challenges that he is facing here. But not only that, 88% of Haley supporters say they'd be disappointed if you were the nominee. 47% don't believe you'd be fit to be president if you were convicted of a crime.

I'm going to obscure votes. I'll probably take it back in a minute. If you're looking at the state itself, come back here. Nikki Haley needs to do well along the southern part of the state, number one, particularly in Nashua because it's the second largest population center. Manchester is your largest city. It is a Trump country. She's competitive there right now, but well behind him. So if you want to match that, he's leading at the moment. Looks like he's on a path to win in the biggest pool of votes. You need to match that here in the second largest pool of votes. Again, this is one ward. But this is Donald Trump making a statement that, no, I'm competitive down here. Again, right along the Massachusetts border, tends to be -- if you get to the southern most part, it tends to be a little more blue-collar. You move up to Nashua. It looks much more suburban. You move up here and you go through it. But it's one ward, so we need to count the rest of them. But if you're in the campaigns and you're watching, this is what they do. They have people in the wards. They're calling it -- just like we're watching it live, they're calling it as it comes. If you're Donald Trump, you're thinking, you know, of course, you want to win everywhere. You want to win by big margins. But in a place that Nikki Haley wants to take away from you, at least in this one ward, Trump is holding his own. That's very close, that's very close, very competitive for her there, but not the victory if she's trying to go to a path to win. Let's come back out to the statewide numbers now. If she's trying to come back to a path to win, and right now with 16% of the vote, you know, Donald Trump has an eight-point lead on you right there, you can't have too many wards like this. You need to start winning wards and then winning towns to build up from there. Just one will count more. But again, Jake, that's the great value of having people right on the ground like that.

      "sentences": "Yes, Dana. I mean, what they had been hoping for was a double- digit lead. They want this margin to be definitive enough that, one, they can pivot to a general election. They want to focus on battleground states that are crucial in general election, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, and to definitive enough that it makes it so that he appears to be the presumptive nominee, essentially trying to force Nikki Haley out of the race.Now, of course, what we saw there was a very defiant Nikki Haley urging Donald Trump to debate with her, saying she was going to stay in the race, particularly through South Carolina. And I will note, when I talked to his senior advisers, they don't feel concerned, necessarily, that Haley would beat Trump out for the nomination. They just believe this is going to prolong the process. They particularly feel strongly about South Carolina. I do want to remind you, one of the strategies that Trump's team used here in New Hampshire was essentially getting Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina to endorse him before the New Hampshire primary and then come out and stump for Donald Trump endorsing him, essentially trying to send a message that the people of South Carolina, including Tim Scott, are backing Donald Trump. Again, part of a larger message he's been trying to send that it's time for the Republican Party to coalesce behind him. The other part of this is that we are expecting him to come out at some point sooner rather than later. We know that they are still watching to see exactly what those margins land at. As I said earlier, they're hoping for double digits. They said anything above 7 percent would be considered a victory for them. The one thing we should really listen to. Earlier today, Donald Trump said he would never ask an opponent to drop out of the race. So we'll be listening to see what he says tonight. We've already gotten a note out from his Super PAC calling for her to drop out of the race. He's already fundraising, saying that he won the state of New Hampshire and it's time to move forward, it's time to go on and take on Biden. But that will be interesting to see if he actually calls for her directly, which he has not done to drop out of the race.",

Even if it's just 10 points, there's something about it that potentially makes a difference here. And then she's going to have to see how the polls move as she goes back to her home state because there is going to be something for her about it, you know, going into staying on a ballot where she's potentially facing a loss that's embarrassing.

In other words, Erin, for the Biden campaign, it doesn't matter whether Nikki Haley is insisting that she is going to be staying in the Republican race. In their eyes, this is all but done. They are making the hard pivot to the general election. And we have some new reporting that further shows this in the form of big changes that are coming to the campaign. We are learning that two top West Wing aides will be moving over full- time to the campaign. That includes Jen O'Malley Dillon. She, of course, ran the president's 2020 campaign and is currently the deputy chief of staff. She's going to be moving over as the campaign chair. And Mike Donilon, who you might know as just one of the most senior advisers to the president in his innermost circle, he is going to be moving over to the campaign as chief strategist. Now, we are told that these moves have been under discussion for weeks. But particularly for DOD Jen O'Malley Dillon, that departure could actually come sooner than was previously expected because the campaign is seeing Trump consolidate the Republican race so quickly. One adviser tells me that this is the moment that they see as an all- hands-on-deck moment. And in their eyes, Erin, this is already a race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.",
