Obviously, the situation to here on the ground in Ukraine is a very different, one Russia invading this country. And one of the really interesting things that he said as well is that he claimed that Russia had never said that they would be willing to use nuclear weapons or never threatened that, one of the things that we have to keep in mind as we've been covering this conference is several days into the invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on heightened alert.
