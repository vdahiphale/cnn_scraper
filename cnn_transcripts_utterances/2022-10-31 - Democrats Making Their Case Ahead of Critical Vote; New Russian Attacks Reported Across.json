If you're just joining us, to let me bring you up to date with the latest news this hour.Brazil has elected former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva by razor thin margin on Sunday's presidential runoff. Lula beat Jair Bolsonaro. The head of Brazil's electoral authority says he thinks Mr. Bolsonaro will accept the results. However, videos posted on social media show apparent Bolsonaro supporters blocking highways after his loss. And we are just eight days away from the U.S. midterm elections. More than 20 million preelection ballots have been cast so far. Republicans are using the economy and inflation as they look to press an advantage against Democrats. The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates by three quarters of 1 percent again on Wednesday. It would be the fourth- straight supersized hike. And it's still possible another rate increase of that magnitude could come before the end of the year. There's also a growing chorus of Democratic lawmakers they're warning Fed Chair Jerome Powell to slow down the rate hikes, fearing it could lead to recession. With the economy a key issue for Americans, U.S. President Joe Biden and other top Democrats are now making their case and hoping to sway undecided voters. CNN's Kevin Liptak is following developments from Wilmington, Delaware. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Democrats are narrowing their closing argument now in the final stretch of this midterm campaign. And they're centering on this warning about what might happen if Republicans were to gain control of Congress. And you hear that from President Biden, from the first lady, from the vice president, even from President Obama all trying to narrow their focus on these economic issues. Items like social security, Medicare, trying to get those issues in front of voters before November 8th.But they do face some serious head winds, economic head winds, political head winds and just historic head winds. Typically, the president's party fairs poorly in his first midterm elections. Now listen to a little bit of how President Biden described his strategy for the coming week. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So, I'm going to be spending the rest of this time making the case that this is not a referendum. It's a choice. A fundamental choice. A choice between two very different visions for the country. And that's what it's about.",

New video out of Kyiv shows smoke rising across the city. Local officials also say Russian missiles hit facilities in Kharkiv and in the regions of Zaporizhzhia and Shmyhal.But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his forces have stopped a fierce assault by Russian troops in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, delegations from the U.N., Ukraine and Turkey have agreed to move more than a dozen vessels today under a Black Sea grain deal this after Russia decided to suspend its participation. Russia's decision follows its claims of drone attacks on the Crimean city of Sebastopol. No Ukraine says the movement of more than 200 ships participating in the UN brokered deal has been blocked and Russia faces growing calls to renew its participation. Also facing criticism from many countries including the U.S. which accuses Moscow of weaponizing food. For more let's bring in CNN's Salma Abdelaziz live in Kyiv. What was it like there this morning -- Salma?",

      "sentences": "Well, this early this morning we woke up to the sounds of air raid sirens, Max, after that we heard several loud explosions. We saw smoke over the sky. And we're now getting more details on what exactly was hit. We understand from officials there were 50 cruise missiles this morning, 44 of them intercepted but several of them, of course, falling, hitting critical infrastructure.One of the facilities that was hit, an energy facility that provided power to 350,000 apartments. That's where the mayor of Kyiv. We're seeing these in the east of the country, as you mentioned, in Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv and other areas. And it's a continuation really of the strategy that we've seen over the last few weeks the targeting of civilian infrastructure, particularly the city's power grid here in the capital. That's meant that some 30 percent of Kyiv's power capacity has been taken, destroyed or damaged in these attacks. So, continuation of these blackouts that are only getting worse and worse as families head into the winter. You can understand the concern and fear that that causes. And this comes just a couple days, Max, after Russia pulled out of that all-important grain initiative, that deal that was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey this summer. It's already led to some 200 ships now being blocked, unable to get out, unable to provide those exports that the world so desperately needs, particularly in parts of North Africa, Southeast Asia. There's a huge amount of international pressure to try to bring Russia to revive this deal. You hear that from the United States, from Ukraine's allies. They are accusing Moscow of weaponizing food, of blackmailing the world by pulling out of this deal. No signs from Moscow that they want to revive this. They for their part, blame Ukraine. They are accusing Ukraine of carrying out drone attacks in occupied Crimea over the weekend. Something that Ukraine denies. But you're seeing again, these pressure points, these ways in which Moscow can ramp up, intensify, escalate this war. Continue through the striking of civilian infrastructure and of course through pulling out of this grain deal -- Max.",

This message appeared on the outside of the stadium, reading Kanye is right about the Jews. It's a reference to the series of antisemitic comments the rapper made recently. It's not clear how the message got there and how long it was displayed. Other videos on social media show the same message visible on at least one building in Jacksonville on Saturday night.Twitter's new owner billionaire Elon Musk posted a tweet on Sunday promoting baseless allegations about the attack on House Speaker's Nancy Pelosi's husband. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan looks at how this incident is proving to be an early Test for Musk in his new role as leader of the social media platform. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So, just as we approach election day here in the United States, there are people at Twitter working to combat misinformation and disinformation about the election. But we saw on Sunday their new boss, the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk tweeting out a link to an article that was making baseless claims about what happened to Paul Pelosi. That Musk eventually deleted that tweet, perhaps acknowledging he was wrong. But that website that he had linked to was basically a website that often publishing nonsense, including in 2016 that same website actually claimed that Hillary Clinton had died and that the person on the campaign trail was a body double. And just a few days in to Musk owning this company, we have seen a lot of upheaval within the company and now we see Musk doing this publicly. It's going to be a rough ride for people at Twitter for the next time. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We saw the violent clashes over the weekend. Security forces firing tear gas at protesters at university campuses right across the country.On Sunday, large numbers of protesters mainly students converged on the grounds of universities, calling for an end to the regime. Something we have heard time and time again over the last seven weeks. We saw these protests on social media. That is how, you know, this activism is shared. It came a day after the head of the country's feared Revolutionary Guard issued that ultimatum claiming that Saturday would be the last day of protests. Obviously threatening a much tougher crackdown. Iran, as we know, has been gripped by protests following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini back in mid-September after she was arrested by the morality police for wearing an improper hijab. Rights groups say that hundreds of protesters have been killed and thousands arrested. Max, as we know, they are conservative numbers. As authorities struggle to contain an outpouring of public anger and demonstrations, calling for the regime's overthrow. Now I also should mention that more than 300 Iranian journalists have issued a statement calling for the release of two of their colleagues, Niloofar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammadi, accused by the ministry of intelligence of being CIA spies and quote, the primary source of news for foreign media. Now that is a crime punishable by death after breaking the story of Amini's death. Those two female journalists, Max, have been held in Tehran's Evin prison since their arrest last month.",

The men served more than 20 years in prison. They were exonerated last year after a judge determined there were, quote, serious miscarriages of injustice.
