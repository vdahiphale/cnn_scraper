You can see the liftoff there very early this morning from Boca Chica, Texas, right on the border with Mexico. Then there was that hot stage separation, which was a success. And that's when things really got interesting, because this is when Starship went further and faster than any of the previous two flight tests. And it sent back this incredible HD live footage for almost the entire duration of its 49-minute test flight. And we saw it re-entering or entering the Earth's atmosphere, this plasma, red-hot plasma burning up around Starship. It's the kind of footage that I've never seen before, Julia, before it broke up, likely just over. There it is. That's that red- hot plasma that I was talking about before breaking up just over the Indian Ocean. And, you know, yes, the ultimate goal, pie-in-the-sky goal, was for a splashdown. Starship literally landing in the Indian Ocean. It didn't quite make it there. But, you know, Julia, I should point out that in order to get a launch license, SpaceX has to put an ultimate destination, even if that's not the primary objective. The primary objective here was for Starship to reach orbital velocity or orbital speed. And it did do that. So, that's why it's being called a success.",

He can sell them all over the world. That can't be right. And even Judge Cannon who has been very favorable towards Donald Trump and at times has been reversed by the appellate courts that oversee her, even Judge Cannon cannot go for this.

I've often seen that happen when documents come in. The important thing is that the case is still moving.

In recent years, federal officials here in South Florida have had trouble processing large numbers of migrants. We're talking about instances where boats with hundreds and hundreds of people arriving all at once. That kind of a situation really puts a strain on local law enforcement, which often has to hold these migrants until federal officials can take custody of them. So far, the U.S. Coast Guard tells me they have not seen an increase in the number of Haitian migrants trying to make it to the U.S. As for the situation on the ground in Haiti, sources tell CNN that armed men attacked the home of Haiti's national police director. We're told that they ransacked and set fire to the place. Now, it is unclear if anyone was hurt. CNN has also learned that the country's airport could soon reopen. We're told that repairs in areas that gang members broke through last month are almost complete and that about 150 Haitian police and military officers are guarding the grounds. Now, exactly when air traffic could reopen is still unclear. The United Nations is still not moving staff in and out of Haiti. And it is still unclear at this hour if Prime Minister Ariel Henry will make it back to Haiti after announcing on Tuesday that he would step aside.

I'm just happy Russia has accepted us, says this woman in Donetsk. And I love everyone who votes for Putin, she says. The Kremlin leader has barely campaigned for his fifth term in what observers say is the most vacuous empty Russian election in memory. Putin's campaign ads simply ask voters who they trust. 86 percent according to latest opinion polls say it's him. The Kremlin's crackdown down on dissent, makes a mockery of public surveys.
