And secondly, the Biden administration, in particular, needs to, as I said, remove the shackles and allow the Ukrainians to start striking deep inside Russia with U.S.-supplied weapons, including ATACMs. They also need to provide those F-16s, which would make a huge difference in terms of denying the Russians the ability to strike inside Ukraine.

And then the Russians can bring their military industrial capacity and their superior numbers to bear. And they can start to, once again, make advances. So I think that what we're seeing is, essentially, Putin recognizing that the United States, in particular, but also Europe is fearful of escalation. Putin rattles his nuclear sabers on a regular basis, and that inspires a degree of fear and an unwillingness on the part of the Biden administration to allow Ukraine to strike back hard. But secondly, we lack time. We need to get that aid moving much more quickly. So that Ukraine can start to make real headway.

He plans to attend a Russian Chinese expo. And also interact with students at the Harbin Institute of Technology. Now, this university is interesting, because it was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2024, its reported role in procurement for the Chinese militaries. So analysts point out that that choice of location is highly symbolic. It symbolizes solidarity against U.S. sanctions, as well as access to Chinese military technology. Now, on Thursday, yesterday Putin and Xi, they issued that sweeping 7,000-word joint statement to declare a new era partnership. It said that Russia-China relations are experiencing, quote, \"the best period in their history.\" And the document also laid out how these two countries are fully aligned on a host of issues from trade to Taiwan, to Ukraine. And they also, as you see on your screen, they also scolded the U.S., saying this, quote: \"Both sides will strengthen coordination, cooperation to deal with the so-called 'dual containment' policy of the United States that is non-constructive and hostile toward China and Russia,\" unquote.

CNN's Paula Reid has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Michael Cohen, the only witness being called by the prosecution who can directly implicate Donald Trump in an alleged hush money scheme, has crucial parts of his testimony undercut. Returning to the stand for a second day of cross-examination, Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche grilling Cohen about all the times he has lied, painting him as unreliable and out for revenge after not being given a job in the Trump White House. \"You were disappointed that, after all the work that you had done for President Trump for 9.5 years, nobody, including President Trump, offered you a position in the White House.\" Blanche asked Cohen after showing him text messages he sent to his daughter about potentially working in the Trump administration. \"That's not accurate,\" Cohen insisted, and he began to grow agitated as Trump leaned forward in his chair behind the defense table, at times staring intently at his former fixer. The Trump defense then reached a crescendo, turning to a key moment of Cohen's testimony, a 2016 phone call he says he had with former Trump body man, Keith Schiller, who says he then passed the phone to Trump. Cohen says he told Trump on that call how he planned to pay Stormy Daniels to keep their alleged affair quiet. But referencing phone records, Blanche asked, \"This is the call that you testified about on Tuesday. It was to talk to President Trump about the Stormy deal and to move forward?\" Cohen was then shown a text message he sent to Schiller the same night about a 14-year-old prank caller who had been harassing him. Cohen texted Schiller, \"Who can I speak to regarding harassing calls to my cell and office. The dope forgot to block his number.\" Schiller texted back soon after, \"Call me.\" Blanche then raised his voice, asking Cohen to confirm the call was not actually a conversation with Trump about Stormy Daniels, but about the 14-year-old prankster. Cohen defended himself, saying, \"Part of it was the 14-year-old, but I know that Keith was with Mr. Trump at the time, and there was more potentially than this.\" Blanche shot back, \"That was a lie. You did not talk to President Trump. You talked to Keith Schiller. You can admit it.\" Cohen calmly responded, \"No, sir. I don't know that it's accurate.\" Blanche responded, \"A one-minute and 36-second phone call, and you had enough time to update Schiller about all the problems you were having and also update President Trump about the status of the Stormy Daniels situation because you had to keep him informed?\" \"I always ran everything by the boss immediately, and in this case, it would have been saying everything had been taken care of. It's been resolved,\" Cohen answered. He maintained his composure. \"I believe I also spoke to Mr. Trump and told him everything regarding the Stormy Daniels matter.\" \"We are not asking for your belief. This jury does not want to hear what you think happened,\" Blanche retorted. The prosecution then objected. The judge sustained. And Michael Cohen shook his head.",

So he admitted that he lied when he told the judge that he was guilty of those crimes, not the campaign finance one. But prosecutors have brought that out on direct, so I didn't think that had the same kind of effect as the Keith Davidson moment, which again by itself is not enough to undo all the good that prosecutors have done in the case that they've built.",

PLEITGEN: This is exactly the place where Robert Fico was shot. And you can see on that tree over there that there is a hole where the forensic teams appear to have carved something like a projectile out of the bark. Now, he suffered several gunshot wounds and had to be air medivacked into a hospital nearby. PLEITGEN (voice-over): The hospital little says two surgical teams had to operate more than five hours to save the prime minister's life. Slovakia's president elect confirming Fico is now conscious. PETER PELLEGRINI, SLOVAK PRESIDENT-ELECT: He is able to speak, but only few sentences and then he's really, really tired, because he's under some medical -- some medical commutation (ph). So of course, it is very difficult for him. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Slovakian authorities claiming the attack was politically motivated. The 71-year-old suspect, they say, unhappy, among other things, with the Russia-friendly Fico government's decision to cut off military aid to Ukraine. The country's interior minister stressing, though, the assailant was not part of a wider network. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): He is a lone wolf whose disappointment with the government accelerated after the presidential election when he decided to act. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Dismay and disbelief in the suspect's neighborhood. \"I was very surprised by what he did,\" this neighbor says. \"I don't understand how it happens. Something must have clicked.\" Robert Fico is often viewed as pro-Russian and critical of the European Union. Slovakia society deeply divided.
