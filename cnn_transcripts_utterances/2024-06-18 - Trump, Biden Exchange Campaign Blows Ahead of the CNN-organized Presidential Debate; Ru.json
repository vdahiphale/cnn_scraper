And I'm told that they walked Donald Trump through some of the critical House races that they think he could be helpful in come November.Now, remember, Donald Trump last week traveled to Washington, D.C., where he met with House and Senate Republicans, and he promised them that he would do more: more tele town halls, more messages of support to try and get these people not only reelected, but to also try to expand their majorities, both in the House and the Senate. And that's really important, not just to lawmakers and Congress, but also to Donald Trump, because if he were to reclaim the White House in November, he's going to need a lot of Republicans to pass his legislative priorities. And so that was the key focus. They said that they wanted to talk about a unified message about how they can all be on the same page in the next stretch looking forward to Election Day. Now, I also think it's important to note that Donald Trump has been far more hands-off this election cycle than he has been in the past. And that's because, in 2022, he endorsed several candidates that went on to win their primaries, only to lose on the day that it counted, which was Election Day in the midterms. And so, according to my conversations with Donald Trump's campaign, they tell me that they don't want to get involved in races where they don't think the candidate can actually win. And so they're going to be mapping out where Donald Trump can be lending his support and which races it will really matter. Alayna Treene, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

From the Midwest and Great Lakes to the Northeast, more than 260 million Americans, or roughly 82 percent of the U.S. population, could see temperatures above 90 degrees. Nearly 200 daily high-temperature records could be tied or broken in major cities, including Boston, D.C., Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and New York City. And little relief is expected even at night, with low temperatures not dropping below the middle 70s. ISCOL: Extreme heat is the most dangerous weather phenomenon we have in New York City. We lose over 350 New Yorkers a year on average to heat. MYERS (voice-over): Caribou, Maine, which prides itself as the most northeastern city in the U.S., could hit their hottest temperature ever Wednesday, with a forecast of 99. That's three degrees higher than their all-time hottest high temperature on record. Boston is forecast to be nearly 100 degrees on Thursday, which would be their earliest 100 degree day in 99 years. And it's not just the high temperatures causing concern, but how long they're expected to stick around. Pittsburgh, which hasn't seen a single day go over 95 degrees in more than a decade, is forecast to see six consecutive days above 95 degrees. And Philadelphia is expected to see five straight days at or above 95. If it seems like these scorching heat waves are happening more and more each year, it's not your imagination. DR. ASHWIN VASAN, COMMISSIONER, NYC DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HYGIENE: While very hot days are, of course, normal, the number and the duration of these hot days we are seeing each and every year is not. The risk to our planet presents risks to our health. And heat is, of course, the deadliest of all extreme weather events here in New York City and across the United States.

Joining me from Oxford, England is Richard Johnson, lecturer in U.S. politics at Queen Mary University in London. Thank you so much for joining us.I just wanted to ask you about Steve Bannon because he's obviously been speaking, you know, he's obviously got close contacts with president Trump still very much coming into the fore again. And speaking of how there'll be blowback for anyone that opposes president Trump right now, it's quite a threatening message, but do you think it'll be effective? RICHARD JOHNSON, LECTURER IN U.S. POLITICS, QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON: Well, it'd be effective with a subsection of Trump voters. I guess what we have to think about is when the different campaigns are putting out their surrogates, the surrogates are not talking necessarily to the same people. So Steve Bannon is not someone that the Trump campaign is putting out to talk to swing voters or people who voted Joe Biden at the last election. Bannon is trying to talk to those people who have stuck with Trump from 2016 to 2020 to now. And in a sense, Bannon's message is one of trying to raise the stakes of the election to mobilize the kind of core MAGA base of Trump voters.",

And I think what this ad is trying to do, in effect, is for the Biden campaign to say to voters, OK, you may not love Joe Biden, but you really don't like Donald Trump. This is not an election where it's both are equally bad. One might be bad, but one is even worse. And negative partisanship is when you vote to stop another candidate from winning. And in effect, that's the message they're saying. If you want to stop Donald Trump from being re-elected, you're going to have to hold your nose and vote for Joe Biden. Don't stay at home. Don't vote for a third party candidate. Come out and vote for Joe Biden. And they realize that those voters ultimately, I think, will decide the election.",

I mean, just ahead of that, he said he's not concerned about the actual visit, it's what it means for Ukraine. Can you just explain what's happening here?IVAN WATSON, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Sure, I mean, what I think is important to seek from the point of view of context is that Vladimir Putin has not been to North Korea since 2000. Right? So that's nearly a quarter century. And so much has changed since then. He had only just become appointed president then. The ruler of North Korea at that time was Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-il. And North Korea was still at that time one of the most isolated places in the world. Russia was not. Well, fast forward 24 years, Russia is now very, very isolated, certainly from the West. And there is a need for Vladimir Putin to reach out to North Korea. He's been accused of acquiring conventional weapons from the North Koreans to use on the Ukrainian battlefield. And look at one of the top lines of his open letter to North Korea. He says quote, \"we highly appreciate the DPRK's unwavering support for Russia's special military operation in Ukraine\", special military operation, Max, \"not a war more than two and a half years into this war\". And then Putin goes on to write \"Pyongyang was and remains our staunch like-minded ally and supporter, ready to resolutely resist the desire of the collective West to prevent the formation of a multipolar world order based on justice\". At this point, Moscow is very much an antagonist and rival of the U.S. and its Western allies. And it is aligning itself very much alongside, again, one of the most isolated dictatorships in the world, North Korea, which has a proven track record of creating trouble for, for example, the close U.S. ally, South Korea and other countries in the region, Japan. And now what we see is that the Kremlin is saying that it is planning to sign a new strategic partnership with North Korea. So they'll be watching closely to see how could there be more weapons transfers, more technology transfers between these two countries that appear to be growing closer together.",

He says that North Korea is committed, a committed and like-minded supporter, ready to confront the ambition of the collective West.Look, yes, this is a visit, I think, that will be in part about the war in Ukraine, but also motivated by some of the same impulses that provoked that war in the first place, which is Putin's desire for the so-called multipolar world, these new spheres of influence and to counter Western dominance. I think also the Kremlin likes symmetry. And yes, although this visit was sort of preplanned and quite heavily trailed, there is a sense to which that coming off the back of that sort of major Western diplomatic spree last week with the reconstruction conference for Ukraine, the G7, and finally the Ukrainian peace summit in that this is a chance, even though to the rest of us, you know, North Korea looks like one of the most isolated countries on earth. This is a chance for Russia to show that Putin is not isolated by the war in Ukraine, that he does have other options. And those optics of seeing his photo lining the streets of Pyongyang will help push that message across to the Russian people. I think in terms of the war in Ukraine, this also reinforces the strategy that we are seeing play out in real time on the front lines, that attrition is key. Putin wants to exhaust and destroy Ukraine into surrender and, you know, obtaining, as the U.S. and South Korea have suggested, artillery shells, ballistic missiles from North Korea will help prolong that effort. So that certainly is the context, I think, in which to view this meeting. Although, of course, North Korea has denied weapons transfers to Russia.",

He's accused the prime minister of putting his own political interest ahead of the country and a plan for Gaza post-war and in polls at least one published on Friday it showed that more Israelis would prefer Gantz to lead the country right now than Netanyahu. Netanyahu will undoubtedly find it difficult, Max, to agree to anything resembling an end to the war without toppling his own government. The far-right has already threatened to do exactly that and so he's in this very awkward position right now when it comes to the peace deal that's on the table. Hamas coming back with changes to that deal or proposed changes to that deal seems to have kicked it down the road to some extent. But also this tactical pause that we've been talking about the also perhaps demonstrates the odd position in the contortions that the prime minister is having to put himself through in order to satisfy all of the pressures he's under not only at home but of course from the international community as well that wants to see more aid get in either way. UNICEF made very clear yesterday that this pause that's been announced for 11 hours a day so far hasn't shown any signs of actually working. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Since the 8th of October we've been attacked every day, Stern says, I don't think there's any nation in the world that would be prepared for its citizens to be fired upon every day. At a nearby location the mayor shows us a much larger rocket that hit the street, its shrapnel tearing into nearby homes. Also this, Stern says, this is shrapnel look and hear you'll find them in every place. Along Israel's northern border once thriving villages have become ghost towns. In Shlomi the spirit of the country may be strong, but its people have left. Approximately 60,000 people have been evacuated from the north to hotels across the country. According to Israel Hezbollah has fired more than 5,000 rockets and drones since the start of the war. Israel has carried out strikes against Hezbollah targets and commanders amid fear of a simmering conflict boiling over into a war. We are approaching the point where a decision will have to be made, says chief of staff Herzi Halevi, and the IDF is prepared and very ready for this decision. In recent weeks the north isn't just under fire but on fire sparked by Hezbollah attacks and missile intercepts. Locals caught this video of an interceptor explosion which rained burning shrapnel on the area. Firefighters are still coping with smoldering embers that reignite in the dry conditions a fire that keeps burning on a border that threatens to do the same.

The university's president said the occupation put staff and students inside the building at risk.Now, a task force at Columbia University, one of America's most prestigious schools has real disturbing instances of anti-Semitism and a hostile environment for Jewish students and faculty on campus.
