It is the first timean African leader has been on a state visit to the White House since 2008. We're expecting a joint press conference later this hour and we'll bring it to you live. Also, Live Nation lawsuit. Moments ago, the U.S. Justice Department sued the parent company of Ticketmaster. What it means and what comes next. And later, Cassie speaks. Her first comments in CNN's exclusive surveillance footage shocked the world. Hello, everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching \"One World\". Kenyan President William Ruto is meeting with President Biden at the White House this hour. You'll hear from both men later this hour at a joint conference in Washington, D.C. It is the first state visit to Washington by an African leader since 2008. An official arrival ceremony was held just a short time ago. And while the visit is aimed at boosting ties between the allies, there is another goal for the U.S., countering China's influence in Africa. Now, for his part, President Ruto wants greater investment in Kenya and across the continent. The visit also highlights U.S.-Kenyan cooperation on a number of security issues, including the fight against militants in Somalia, Houthi attacks in the Red Sea and Kenya's security mission in Haiti. We're covering this trip from both the U.S. and Africa. David McKenzie is in South Africa for us. But we begin with Priscilla Alvarez at the White House. Really a significant meeting here, not only the first of an African leader in the U.S. and to visit Washington in 15 years, Priscilla, but also one that marks 60 years of diplomatic ties between the U.S. and Kenya. What more can we expect to hear from both leaders?",

And the two leaders really underscoring that decades-longrelationship earlier today during that ceremony and also during their the top of their bilateral meeting. Of course, the two are expected to talk about a broad range of issues which affect the two of them. First of all, the President wanting to elevate Kenya as a regional --l from a regional partner to a global partner. Then, too, the two are expected to talk about the importance of democracy and also private sector investments. In fact, just yesterday, the two leaders meeting with business leaders here at the White House to continue to talk about those investments. But there is no doubt that looming over all the pomp and circumstance today is countering China's influence in the region. Of course, the U.S. and China both jockeying for economic and geopolitical influence in Africa and China, of course, one of the countries that has made high interest or provided high interest loans to Africa. So, those investments, that economic cooperation are all core to the conversations that are happening today. And the two are also expected to announce a spate of commitments, including the Nairobi Washington vision. That is a call on creditors to help alleviate the financial burden. And also, President Biden designated Kenya as a major non-NATO ally. So, the two clearly underscoring this relationship that comes after in 2022, President Biden said he was, quote, \"all in for Africa\". Now, he had hoped to visit the continent. He has not done that during his time as President, as he has also grappled with multiple foreign conflicts that have kept him here at home and visiting a certain country. So, in some ways, this is also making up for that broken promise. But what has been clear so far over the course of the day is that the two are really trying to strengthen their partnership and their relationship over the course of these conversations. And we'll hear directly from the two of them later this afternoon during their press conference. Bianna.",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianna, I think the -- the proposed and now almost on the ground paramilitary policethat are going to Haiti speaks to the ambitions of William Ruto, the President of Kenya. He sees himself as a statesman. He's spent a great deal of time outside of Kenya and has been criticized in his nation for that. He is not entirely as popular as he might be on the foreign stage as he is locally. But certainly that's proposed trip or that those boots on the ground in Haiti speaks to that ambition. I think these are critically important meetings, both for the Kenyan President and for the U.S. President. There is a sense that the U.S. has limited options when it comes to strong, powerful allies in the African continent. The relationship between the U.S. and Rwanda has cooled. Ethiopia has gone through its civil strife and accusations of human rights abuses on both sides of a conflict there. And in West Africa recently, the U.S. will have to move out of its anti-terror bases in Niger and is kicked out of Chad. So, the U.S. is struggling for, well, I wouldn't say struggling, but it's trying to regain a strong presence diplomatically within the African context. Kenya is the obvious country to strengthen that relationship and expand it. And in William Ruto, they have a very amenable President who's also looking to burnish his own reputation. Bianna.",

David McKenzie in Johannesburg for us. Thank you.  And we'll bring you that press conference at the White House when it happens. Meantime, in the last hour, the U.S. government took steps to break up what it says is a monopoly in the concert industry. The target of the antitrust lawsuit is Live Nation, the parent company of Ticketmaster. Thirty state and local district attorneys have joined the U.S. government effort to break up the company. Live Nation dominates the concert industry, controlling a huge percentage of both ticket sales and venues in the U.S. The U.S. attorney general was blunt in pointing out the ways Ticketmaster and Live Nation harm both musicians and their fans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: With exclusive agreements that cover more than 70 percent of concert ticket sales at major concert venues across the country, Ticketmaster can impose a seemingly endless list of fees on fans. Those include ticketing fees, service fees, convenience fees, platinum fees, Pricemaster fees, per order fees, handling fees and payment processing fees, among others. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, we will soon be getting brand new video of the arrest of the world number one golfer ScottyScheffler last week at a PGA tournament just minutes ago. The Louisville mayor and the chief of police said they would release two videos of the arrest, but they say they do not have video of the initial incident between Scheffler and the arresting officer because the officer didn't turn on his body camera. The police chief says the officer had received corrective action for not following proper procedure. A source tells CNN that some officials in the police department think charging Scheffler with a felony assault may be excessive. CNN's Gabe Cohen is in Louisville tracking this story. And Gabe, there had been rumblings about this police officer not following protocol by turning on his body camera. How much of a setback is this for the police's case here?",

We did expect potentially for the police chiefor the mayor to address the charges that Scotty Scheffler faces. He faces four, but by far the most serious of those charges is that second degree felony assault on a police officer charge. As you mentioned, we were reporting yesterday that a source tells me that in a recent meeting, several high ranking officials within the Louisville Metro Police Department talked about the case. And there was really consensus that that felony charge is excessive and perhaps those charges need to be revisited and reduced. We thought they may talk about that today. They really didn't. They talked about the body camera issue that you, you spoke about, that the detective who arrested Scotty Scheffler did not turn on his body camera. They say he has received some, corrective action, some counseling from his supervisor. They also said they're going to be releasing more video of the arrest today. One angle from a traffic pole camera in the area, another from a police vehicle, their dash cam. We don't know if there's any body cam video, any other angles of the arrest itself. But what the mayor is now saying is that there is no video that they're aware of that shows the initial encounter between that police officer and Scotty Scheffler. So, we don't know at this point how any of that is going to affect the charges in this case. But listening to the tone of the mayor today, he was really clear saying that this was this unfortunate set of circumstances, that it was a dark that morning, very rainy, very intense setting, really, painting a picture that this may have been a big misunderstanding as a Scotty Scheffler has said from the very beginning, he said that on day one at a press conference after he was released from jail and went and played his round of golf at that tournament here in Louisville. We've also heard that from Scheffler's attorney who I spoke with just a few minutes ago. He says that the videos that are coming out later today really back up their version of the events that Scotty Scheffler did nothing wrong. And he has said really for days now that they are not planning to plead out this case. They don't want to take a plea deal that it is either all of the charges are dropped or they're prepared to litigate. The Prosecutor's Office has said from the beginning that they have not made any final decisions on how they're going to charge this case. So, it is very possible that the charges are going to change in the coming days or weeks. Remember, Scotty Scheffler's arraignment now scheduled for June 3rd. And to be clear, Scotty Scheffler is not here in Louisville today. He's going to be teeing off at the next PGA Tour event, a tournament in Fort Worth, Texas, here in the next, I believe, hour and a half or so.",

She says that domestic violence is the issue. She says, it broke me down to someone I never thought I would become. But with a lot of hard work, I am better today. But I will always be recovering from my past. Now, she thanks her family and her friends and strangers who have sent an outpouring of support and love to her.

That is very powerful from her because what she is doing here, again, she is shining a light on this larger issue.

Thousands of French security forces have been deployed to New Caledonia since the violence began and Mr. Macron said they will remain in the country for, quote, \"as long as necessary even during the upcoming Olympics\". Protests began a week ago after the French government voted to approve changes to New Caledonia's constitution giving greater voting rights to French residents who've moved to the islands and at least six people have died as a result. Well, any moment now, we're going to be hearing from Kenyan President William Ruto and U.S. President Joe Biden. The two will hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House. This is the first state visit from an African leader since 2008. Now, earlier the two men touted the 60 years of relations between the two countries. Later this evening the Bidens will host a state dinner for President Ruto and his wife. CNN Senior White House Reporter Kevin Liptak joins us now with more on this. So, what can we expect to hear from these two leaders today at this press conference Kevin?",

The President had promised to visit Kenya while hewas in office this year and that hasn't happened. Now, he said that if he wins re-election in a second term that he will make that trip in February. But interesting that you bring up China because China has continued to increase its stance and position in African countries. Kenya, we should note, is a recipient of the Belt and Road Initiative as well now, leveraged heavily in debt obviously to China. What more can the U.S. do other than verbally now announce that the U.S. will be investing more in African countries, particularly Kenya?",

It's called the Nairobi-WashingtonVision and it's a way I think for President Biden to show the Kenyans and President Ruto specifically that the U.S. is serious about helping alleviate these debt burdens in developing countries, much of which come with his borrowing from China. And this is something that President Ruto has been outspoken about over the last several months, really since he took office, is trying to get that debt down. And President Biden wants to assist by things like debt relief, better borrowing from places like the IMF. And so, that was a big topic of discussion when they sat in the Oval Office earlier today.",
