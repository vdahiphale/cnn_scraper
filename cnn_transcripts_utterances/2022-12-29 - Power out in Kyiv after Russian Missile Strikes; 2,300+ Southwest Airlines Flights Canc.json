Inside, there were two men, elderly father and his adult son. They were sleeping on the other side of this House, which was hit at about 8:30 in the morning. They emerged, miraculously, with just scratches. But the adult son, I spoke with him, he told me they heard a massive explosion. The windows shattered and the walls, as you can see, just crumbled. He managed to get out, barefoot, and it's very cold at the moment. Neighbors gave him some boots. But as I said, strangely enough, despite the damage you see and the exploded car right next to the House, to the left of the House, they emerged unscathed. So the air defenses seemed to work fairly well. But as you mentioned, in for instance, the city of Kharkiv in the Eastern part of the country, the second largest city in Ukraine, four missiles did get through, hitting what we're told was critical infrastructure. Here in Kyiv, 40 percent of the capital is without electricity. The authorities are trying to restore that at the moment, but by and large, it appears that the goal of this massive strike using missiles and drones was to hit energy infrastructure. And, of course, the goal, it appears, is to leave the country in the dark and cold as New Year's approaches. Now the commander in chief of the Ukrainian armed forces said that, apart from the drones, 69 missiles were fired at Ukraine, but the air defenses managed to take down 54 of them -- Poppy.",

The chairman of the committee, Bennie Thompson, said there's basically just not enough time. He said the Select Committee can no longer pursue the specific information that was covered by that subpoena. And in a letter to the former president's lawyer, they wrote that Trump is no longer obligated to comply or produce records. Obviously, not a lot of legal experts did not think he actually would. Trump filed a lawsuit back in November to block the subpoena after the committee had waited after months of investigation until October to actually issue that subpoena.

But we have to also keep in mind, even if he wanted George Santos to go away, neither Kevin McCarthy nor any other member of Congress has the power to exclude him.We've actually been down this road before. Back when I was a kid, Adam Clayton Powell tried to get sworn into the 90th Congress, and they simply refused to do it. It went all the way up to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court said there are only three criteria that Congress can consider. Are they a -- have they been a citizen for seven years? Are they 25 years old? And do they -- are they an inhabitant of the state that they want to represent? Period. Nothing else. And so, you know, legal processes may catch up. And clearly, if you're convicted or something else happens, and two-thirds of Congress votes to throw you out, that's another thing. But they don't really have the ability to stop him.",

That's -- that's not an easy thing to do. And you know, you're going to have to ask the question, if the conduct happened before he was sworn in, on what basis would they throw him out?

I really support all of his statements, because the Constitution just doesn't permit things like this to be dealt with during this time frame that we're talking about here.But what you can do is exclude him from committees. You can basically say you're in time out; you're on probation. Essentially, that's what you'd be doing, until all these investigations into your background are cleared up. That's why I think, to me, sending him to the Ethics Committee and saying, We fully support the criminal justice system working its way through here, is about what the House Republican leadership can do. My suspicion is there aren't too many people on Capitol Hill who are going to want to be seen palling around with this guy. And also, the voters of that district are obviously getting, finally, some news about this person. So even if nothing happens, next time around in two years, the beauty of America is there's always another election. And I suspect it will be real hard for him to get re- elected, given what we know about him today and what we may find out in the coming weeks.",
