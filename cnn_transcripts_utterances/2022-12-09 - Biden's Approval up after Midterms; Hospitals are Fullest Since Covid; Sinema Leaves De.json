It's other respiratory viruses now too that are to blame. Joining us is CNN's medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula. Doctor, this is kind of a surprising number because I think if you just generally ask people what they would see when it comes to these -- the capacity at these hospitals, they would have thought it would have been higher earlier on in the pandemic. But now with the confluence of all of this, we're seeing them at capacity. DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Kaitlan. And, you know, hospitals were required to begin reporting capacity back in the mid part of 2020 to help track the Covid pandemic. And, in fact, over the past two years, in general they've been operating with about 70 percent of beds full. That number this past week is up to 80 percent. In fact, it jumped about 8 percent in the past two weeks. The only other time where we saw beds about 80 percent full was last January at the height of omicron. There are many states where the number is even higher. For example, Rhode Island, we're talking over 90 percent. There's about eight states, including Washington, Oregon, Massachusetts, where the numbers are over 85 percent. Now, we've been clearly talking about this in terms of pediatric hospitals as well. Those numbers, we're talking three quarters of capacity versus typically about two-thirds. And when you look at the breakdown, only 6 percent of the patients are Covid patients. That's compared to about 25 percent last January. So, as you mentioned, clearly more going on.",

And so certainly it seems that RSV numbers are peaking in many parts of the country and hospitalizations are slowing down. But when you look at the flu, those numbers are still high. In fact, the CDC director this week saying that hospitalizations are at an all-time high for this time of year compared to the prior decade. And almost all but six states are really reporting high levels or very high levels of circulating respiratory viruses.So, that is definitely a big part of this. Seventy-eight thousand hospitalizations this year already for flu, 4,500 deaths. But, Poppy, there's also the issue of workforce shortages.",

You have to discharge them somewhere. To nursing facilities, to rehabs. And when you don't have staff there, that can be a problem.And then, finally, I would say, a lot of people delayed care over the past two years, their own care, for other issues. Those are now taking up hospital beds. So, it's a confluence of all of these issues at the same time.",

But there is a wonky question in all of this, and I asked it of Evan McMullen, and the question is, OK, you're going to be an independent, but will you caucus with either party because, if you don't, won't you lose any committee standing? And he cited for me on CNN a Senate rule, I think it was 25 but don't hold me to it, but he said that there's a Senate rule that applies that guarantees that a sitting senator has at least two committee assignments.",
