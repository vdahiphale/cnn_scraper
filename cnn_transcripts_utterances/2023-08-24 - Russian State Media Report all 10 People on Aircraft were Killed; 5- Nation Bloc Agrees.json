David McKenzie is live for us in Johannesburg where the BRICS Summit took place. We've added too many vowels here and not enough consonants. I don't know what we're going to call them after this.

On paper it certainly is a powerful collection of so called Global South nations, from all over the world. Interestingly, no additions in Southeast Asia, and I'm sure China and India have something to do with that. There has been a lot of talk during these past few days about de- dollarization. And that was obliquely brought up again, in the final statement. You know, financial experts say that is a long shot, at the very least to try and move the international monetary system away from dollar based transactions. But I think thematically it is important that these countries are pushing it and certainly is, as you alluded to a big win for Russia, which has been frozen out of banking systems because of its invasion of Ukraine. The UN Secretary General was in attendance today. And it was interesting that he used this expansion of BRICS and the criticism of multilateral organizations to warn that they needed to reform or die basically.

We've seen multiple defendants so far, a total of nineof the Former President's codefendants have turned him in. And it was yesterday perhaps the most notable name other than the Former President on those codefendants list was Rudy Giuliani, the Former Mayor of New York. A man who at one time was said to be America's Mayor, but now finds himself on the other side of the justice system. And it's really interesting Julia, because we had been told up until this point that he was seeking help trying to get people to pay for his legal fees and then yet he showed up here in Atlanta on a private jet and when we talked to him as he was released after his arrest. We asked him that who paid for his private jet? He did not answer that. And he went on to play the victim saying that he's being essentially indicted for trying to help the Former President as a lawyer. He called himself the -- you know, one of the best prosecutors in American history. And he challenged those to find a prosecutor with a better record in the last hundred years. He went on to pair it with Donald Trump, the Former President has said about this investigation, calling it political in nature. And then he left. We asked him several questions that he did not answer. One what was it like to be on the other side of the justice system? And also, you know, if he's had any communication with the Former President, and if he still believes this election was rigged, those questions he did not answer, and he kept it. You know, he got back in his car and then the next thing we know he showed up at a bail bondsman. So we expect more defendants to turn themselves in later today, the biggest, of course, the biggest name being Donald Trump. But it was on Wednesday that a U.S. district judge ruled that his Former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows as well as Ex-DOJ official Jeffrey Carr, who Jeff Clark, who were trying to move their state proceedings to federal court. They have their delay their motion to try to delay their surrender denied by a judge. So they're going to have to turn themselves in and the clock is running on this. They'll have a lesson 24 hours by noon, tomorrow is when they have to turn themselves in and they have to still work out those bond agreements.

And there's a lot of Putin in this response, right, there is the murder by aircraft, which is an old, Soviet and post-Soviet tradition. It's not quite as common as murder by Putin, but it's been known to happen before. And it's the two month break between the actual coup and what appears to be a reaction to it. And this is very much in Putin's bureaucratic style. He takes a pause. He creates the appearance of having considered this and maybe even followed some kind of procedure, if there is indeed a procedure for having people killed. And then, on the same day, he removes the General who, as you mentioned, hasn't actually been on public in two months, who is largely blamed, I think. In the Kremlin, for allowing this conflict between the military of defense and Prigozhin's to fester, and more important for allowing Prigozhin's troops to move unhampered through Russia on their way to Moscow during the failed mutiny two months ago and of course, Prigozhin and his top commander of Wagner, Dmitry Utkin whose nickname is Wagner.

He wanted television while Prigozhin through promotion to Moscow, who's in went on television, and called because in the traitor from that point on, Prigozhin was a dead man. But I think Prigozhin knew in his heart that he wasn't a traitor. He was just trying to get Putin's here, his school was basically accidental. He thought that the military operation as they call it was not going well. He thought that Putin was making bad decisions. He thought that Putin's generals were making bad decisions. He wanted to get to Moscow, to have a sit down with Putin about the war. This was the origin of his school. And I think he probably believed that, as again, we humans tend to believe that everybody sees the world exactly the way we see the world. Finally, the fact that he was ostensibly banished to Belarus, but clearly had total freedom of movement within Russia, and between Russia and Belarus, probably suggested to Prigozhin that he was -- .",

Although, you know, God forbid, you have to choose between someone like Putin and someone like Prigozhin. And you know, I should note here that no, Prigozhin was not opposed to the war. No, are his allies as opposed to the war. Prigozhin thought that the war was not being prosecuted decisively enough. He thought that if he'd had the reins, he would have been able to take over Ukraine in a few days. So he just thought the Putin's generals were uncomfortable. But anyway, I think the message that it sends as if you thought that something like this was possible, but dissent was possible, that criticism was possible that God forbid armed uprising was possible.
