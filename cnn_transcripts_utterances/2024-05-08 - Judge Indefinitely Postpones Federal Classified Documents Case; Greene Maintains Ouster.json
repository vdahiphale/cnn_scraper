These pretrial proceedings, at least, could go well into July, which makes it virtually impossible at this point for us to really think of a -- of a trial happening before the November election, which is always Donald Trump's goal, right? His goal was always to push this off and make sure that this didn't happen before the November -- before the November vote. The judge cited a number of matters -- motions -- eight of them in all that she says need to be tackled before she can even consider setting a trial date. She also set a couple of hearings for late June on things that, frankly, were looked -- would look to us as longshots, right? There was an effort by Trump to get records from inside the administration to try to prove that this was a malicious prosecution. Also, a motion for -- to consider whether Jack Smith was even legally appointed. These are all motions that don't really normally have very good chances. But this judge, Aileen Cannon, has decided that she wants to hold hearings on those later in June -- Sara.",

Every time we got to a court hearing down in Fort Pierce, Sara, we wonder whether this is the day we're going to hear the judge set a new trial date and then she doesn't do it.And one of the reasons why there's so much frustration is a lot of speculation has been that the government could ask for her to be removed. But the problem is she doesn't have a lot of record for them to use against her. She doesn't make any rulings. She just kind of kicks the can down the road.

There was a pending Supreme Court case that was holding him up that if he guessed wrong the case could have been thrown out altogether. It was decided just a few days after he filed. He should have waited. It's one of his biggest mistakes in his record of prosecuting Trump. There's no excuse for what this judge has done. I do think it's a mix of incompetence and bias. She was reversed twice by the extremely conservative 11th Circuit for interfering with the investigation when it was getting going -- getting going with very harsh words.

This is known as the so-called Hastert rule in the House. Now, leadership argues that many of the bills that have come to the floor do have the majority of the majority support. They also are demanding that all 12 appropriations bills have Republican support that they move them individually. If you remember last year, though, John, this became a major lift, in part because conservatives were the ones blocking the advancement of the series of bills that came to the floor. They are also asking for a defunding of Jack Smith's special counsel office. That is something that they are asking for as part of those appropriations bills. And, I mean, look, the reality is that Marjorie Taylor Greene continues to dangle the threat of a motion to vacate against Speaker Johnson. But I talked to a number of Republicans who said that they really don't think Johnson should make any concessions, make any promises, make any compromises with Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene because they argue that the goalpost could move in the future. They also say that it empowers just a small number of members when the majority of the conference does not have the list of demands that Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie have. So what this is really doing over the course of the last several days is just further revealing how divided the Republican Party is. And despite the fact that there are so many members in the conference who are united -- who are standing behind Mike Johnson -- who really want this whole episode to go away -- they also are arguing that this is a moment where Speaker Johnson has -- they have his back but they believe that Marjorie Taylor Greene needs to move on. Now, Speaker Johnson, for his part, is making the case that this isn't a negotiation. Here he was. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

Bakari, first, I just want to get your reaction to what president -- former President Trump said, making this comparison with January 6. We're starting to hear this more and more and more. BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, (D) FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  Well, I mean, it's a talking point and you have that during political season, AKA silly season. I think the best thing you can say about it is that it's asinine. I think that it's intellectually dishonest, but those are two words that really go hand in hand with the former president when he's making these arguments. These protests that you see are no equivalent to trying to overturn an election. They're no equivalent to storming the Capitol. They're no equivalent to trying to harm United States members of Congress or the Senate, or threaten to hang them, or running with Confederate flags, or stealing laptops, or stealing lecterns. I mean, they're -- this is just not that. We've had protests in this country as long as this protest -- as long as this country has actually been in existence. And you're seeing that with young people today on college campuses around the country.

And, of course, they want the fighting to stop. But they also tend to see that Hamas and some of these other folks are actually wanting a ceasefire -- a true ceasefire. When they fire rockets into Israel and they've got all these other allies that are coming in, it makes it very hard I think for Trump's base to actually come over to the Biden mentality or messaging of let's have a ceasefire and end all this endless suffering.
