Again, as we illustrated before, when 352 House members, including the vast majority of the Democratic caucus, voted for this bill -- it's not a ban, it's a divestiture.And it's really not about TikTok, it's about ByteDance, which is ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. And further published reports, since we actually pass that bill, have illustrated a number of things that give legislators even more pause. Such as, for instance, the fact that the ByteDance parent company used user data of Americans against them in surveilling them. And also that the user data that was supposedly off limits to Chinese employees at ByteDance are routinely accessed by those employees. Again, another misrepresentation by the company. So I think I'm feeling good about this vote as well.",

There's been a lot of criticism, even from the president himself, over recent developments in Gaza based on the IDF's handling of aid workers, for instance, an accidental strike against World Central Kitchen aid workers. Do you think that something needs to be in the bill that acts as a kind of restriction to ensure that the IDF is following international law, or at least a mechanism to have the United States observe that aspect of the war more critically?",

And so I think that this aid will be subject to those conditions being met. Whether it's in accordance with humanitarian -- international humanitarian law, but also the -- the laws of war.
