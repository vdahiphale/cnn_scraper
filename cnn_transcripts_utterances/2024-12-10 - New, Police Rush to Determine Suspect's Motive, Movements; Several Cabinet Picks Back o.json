It'll be sent to us, and we have to hear him out. But there's so many issues, his treatment of women, his long time declaration that they should not serve in combat, which would be, I think, weakening our readiness, not strengthening it, his drinking habits, all these things together with the fact that he simply doesn't have a great deal of experience running large organizations.

She clearly had some concerns. But those concerns have been alleviated. There's been a massive pressure campaign on her. She is not a yes yet, but she's moving much closer to yes. And, of course, despite the concerns from a number of Democrats, Republicans ultimately can carry the day because in the Republican-led Senate next year will be 53-47 Senate, which means that they can lose three Republican votes and still get the nominee confirmed. Four would kill a nomination, assuming all Democrats vote no. And at the moment, there just really are not more than three Republicans who are voicing concerns on any individual nominee at the moment. Some may be voicing, Jim, private concerns, but we're not hearing that in public. Now, could that change? Yes. But for Hegseth, which is undoubtedly the shakiest nominee at the moment, the push has gone into overdrive to quell any of those concerns. Today is a critical meeting for him this afternoon with Senator Lisa Murkowski, a key swing vote in the Senate Republican Conference, tomorrow with Susan Collins as well. So, if he's able to keep them at least keeping the door open for them for his nomination and Trump, of course, will continue to push Hegseth and perhaps he can get them on board.
