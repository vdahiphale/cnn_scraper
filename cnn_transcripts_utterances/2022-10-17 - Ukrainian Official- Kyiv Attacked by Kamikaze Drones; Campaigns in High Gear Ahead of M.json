You can probably see behind me quite a lot of smoke still coming from that area where, according to Ukrainian authorities, a residential building was hit. The mayor Vitali Klitschko of Kyiv saying that 18 people were rescued from that building. That two people are still believed to be trapped beneath the rubble.And that's why you're seeing this ongoing, significant rescue effort. There are police here. There are paramedics here. You've got the fire department just over here trying to get more water to put out those flames which have been burning now for several hours. These blasts were the result of the so-called kamikaze drones, these Iranian drones that have really been wreaking havoc on the battlefield here in Ukraine for just about a month now. And while there were at least four explosions of drones that successfully hit targets, though not necessarily the intended targets, Ukrainian authorities are saying that another 15 were intercepted inbound for the capital alone and 26 around the country. So just giving you a sense, Max, of the scale of the battle that Ukrainians are now up against, really using the full power of their air defense systems to try to stop these kamikaze drone attacks and desperately pleading today with the international community to supply more in the way of air defense to help them in the fight against these drones -- Max.",

And the goal or the target appears to be civilian infrastructure. Because while I'm showing you the wreckage in the background there of a residential building, there are -- we're right in central downtown Kyiv. There are several key civilian infrastructure buildings right in this area. And so, it seems that Russia is choosing to target more and more those types of facilities. The hope is to maximize the challenge for Ukrainian authorities, especially as we head into the winter, targeting power, targeting heating, things of that nature to make it as painful and uncomfortable as possible for people on the ground here in Ukraine -- Max.",

Democrats are fighting to keep the control of the majority in both the House and the Senate, but their chances could be pretty slim. A CNN Poll of Polls finds Americans are almost evenly divided over which party should control Congress. Analysts say that a Republican red wave is very possible. The Democrat's majority in Congress is very thin with a 50/50 split in the Senate and all 435 seats in the house are up for grabs. This year, key issues like abortion rights after the Supreme Court's decision Roe versus Wade may tip that scale and the current state of economy with recession worries and inflation skyrocketing remain a top factor. It's a lot to take in with local officials also running. So here 's what you should probably keep an eye on. There are six states at the center of the race. President Biden flipped five of them or turned them blue in 2020. These states all have multiple races that will determine who takes control of the Senate, the House and State departments -- State governments rather. Meaning what happens in these states will impact the entire country. Early in-person voting starts across several states this week including some of those states that we're very closely watching. Now polling places will open in just a few hours in Georgia, a state where there are two highly anticipated heated races. First, Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock is trying to hold on to his seat against Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Donald Trump and has been engulfed in abortion scandal. Over the weekend Warnock hammered walker in a debate about that, while Walker denied those claims and tied Biden's low approval ratings for his opponent. And in the governor's race, Democrat Stacey Abrams is challenging Republican Governor Brian Kemp in a repeat of their battle four years ago. Abrams is running on abortion and voting rights. She is behind Kemp in the polls. In Arizona, Trump endorsed Kari Lake is running for governor. Lake refuses to admit Joe Biden won the 2020 election. Take a listen to what she told CNN's Dana Bash.

These protests are gaining momentum. We are still seeing demonstrations taking place up and down the country. Many, of course, taking place at universities. Students being at the forefront of this movement.

Good news in the last couple of days, some of the wettest weather in the country, it's not much, but it is some rainfall there across portions of Arkansas, parts of eastern Oklahoma as well, getting in on some beneficial rainfall. So, at least a brief change in here that area. Now another change in store is going to be the significant cold air for a large area of eastern United States where as many as 70 record temps possible across the eastern United States and 60 million Americans dealing with these temps that could get as low as 18 degrees. It's not unheard of. Of course, we're transitioning into the cold season, but you're going to get a shot of at least wintry temperatures for a couple of days across this region. You'll notice what happened, as we transition into colder air Tuesday into Wednesday, warmth right back behind it begins to push right back in. The battle, the seesaw trend between warmth and cold this time of year. And in fact, looking ahead to next week, temperatures expected to be well above average across a large area of those exact same spots.
