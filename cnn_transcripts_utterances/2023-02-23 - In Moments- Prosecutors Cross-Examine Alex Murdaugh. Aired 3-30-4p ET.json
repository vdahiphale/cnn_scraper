And he took some of those, many of those amounts of money, which were huge amounts, and funneled them into his own accounts. And the firm had no idea he was doing that.And he was doing that because he needed money. Needed money because of, as the testimony we've heard, all of the drugs that he was taking, all of the opioids that he was taking. But it was pivotal testimony, but the demeanor was not emotional when he talked about those financial crimes. Very important for the defense because the motive of the prosecution is you were so concerned about your finances and about this hearing that was coming up in regard to the boating accident where your son Paul was on the boat. A young girl died when they were all having a party one night because of, according to the testimony, excess alcohol on board. And you were so worried your finances were going to come up that you shot and killed your wife and your son. And so, they wanted to take away that motive. Wasn't that concerned about it. There was equity on the homes. He could get getting loans on the homes.",

      "sentences": "So Victor, to a lot of people, this is the, quote, suicide for hire insurance fraud scheme that happened in September of 2021 where Alex Murdaugh admittedly asked a friend, former client and he claims drug dealer of his, to shoot him in the head. He says to kill him so his son Buster could get a $12 million life insurance policy.Now, obviously, it did not work. And Alex Murdaugh, we had heard him on a recording from a rehabilitation center in Georgia telling law enforcement about this plot earlier in the trial. But this is the first time we've ever heard Alex himself in the flesh, talk about doing this. And this was something the defense had initially worked to keep out of this trial, arguing that it would prejudice the jury against him. The state has said that that shows irrational behavior from Alex Murdaugh, and they've used that when they're talking about what they say he does, when he is, in their words, backed against the wall or there is accountability coming for him. The way Murdaugh described it was a man who he says simply didn't want to live anymore. He felt that there was going to be more information coming out about the financial crimes that Jean was discussing there and that he thought that it would be humiliating for his only surviving son, Buster. Now, we anticipate to hear a lot more about this and those financial crimes during the cross-examination period from the prosecution. I was speaking with one of the attorneys who represents one of Alex's victims in one of those financial crimes, and I asked him about him testifying, and he did note that he believed that Alex Murdaugh doing this for the jury and opening himself up to having to talk about those crimes for which he has not entered a plea, nor he be convicted of yet could be perhaps seen as him putting it all on the line to prove he did not do this. And he's willing to maybe put at risk that he could spend the rest of his life in jail for those financial crimes simply to clear his name of these murders. Again, it's been demonstrated that he's lied several times. Whether or not the jury will buy that he's telling the truth under oath is still to be seen.",

They got him to admit that he lied to police and authorities and that he stole from clients and from his law firm. Is that to sort of diffuse what they expect to be an aggressive cross examination from prosecutors?",

And I believe he did this over the objections of his own lawyers and that's why he's up there crying about Pawpaw (ph) and Bubba (ph) and the fruit tree. A lot of that stuff is relevant, but he thinks that he's going to be a human being in front of this jury.But in the end, it's about the evidence and it's about his lying. He is explaining the fact that he lied about being at the kennels, the murder scene by saying the opioids made him really paranoid and that's why he lied up until today. But are you saying then that the opioids that made you so paranoid that you would lie about your son and wife's murder did not make you so paranoid that you would actually commit the murders? So there is a lot of leaps that have to be done here and I cannot wait for the cross examination. It will be must see TV.",
