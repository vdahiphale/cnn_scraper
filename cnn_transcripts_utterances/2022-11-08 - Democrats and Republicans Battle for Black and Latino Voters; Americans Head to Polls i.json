Why do you think we're seeing Republicans in a trend among greater support among black and Latino voters?LATOSHA BROWN, CO-FOUNDER, BLACK VOTES MATTER FUND:  I mean, agree with that analysis. I think right after the 2020 election and what we saw happen in 2021, there was a recognition that voters of color are the future of American politics. They reshape the political landscape. We also know that there are over 80 black candidates that are running on the Republican ticket across the country. I think there has been a concerted effort to recruit black candidates to run for office, just like we see in Georgia and the U.S. Senate race. To support an agenda that many feel is still a racist agenda but actually put a face of color to that particular gender, what we're seeing is a run across the country, we're seeing that. I also think that there is a concerted effort by both parties to appeal to those voters and we haven't seen that in recent years. I think it's interesting, I think the GOP has been going at it, and an appeal of literally trying to tap into this discontent that may be in the African-American community about wanting to have more happen. And I think that what we're also seeing is we're seeing Democrats really speak to if we're -- if the Democrats have power, we can actually do more. And so it is very interesting to see the distinction and the appeals that I think to African-American voters and other voters.",

And the way that you get the votes, you literally have to make sure that you're doing work that we're seeing, that isn't just an air war but this is also a ground war.

It is unique because the leader on Election Day or for the election in November has to receive a majority of the vote in order to win. If, let's say, the leader gets 49.99 percent, that is not a majority, then there would be runoff between either Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker come December, and that could, in fact, be that the battle for the United States Senate takes all the way until December to know who actually controls it.",

So, of course, we're all praying for a peaceful election week, but last night at a rally in Ohio, former President Donald Trump continued his incendiary rhetoric against Speaker Nancy Pelosi even after the violent attack on her husband, Paul, which Speaker Pelosi talked about exclusively to Anderson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Nancy Pelosi sid, please don't call them animals, they're human beings. I said, no, they're animals. Of course, I think she's an animal too, you want to know the truth. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  For me, this is really the hard part because Paul was not the target and he's the one who is paying the price. I mean, we all are. But he's the one that is really paying the price. But it really -- it is really sad because it is a flame that was fueled by misinformation and all of the rest of that, which is most unfortunate. It has no place in our democracy. Our democracy is one party that is doubting the outcome of the election, feeding that flame and mocking any violence that happens. That has to stop.

They're garbage and they are a mind-altering drug. And they have infiltrated politics. QAnon is in Congress. Anti-Semitism is in Congress because Republicans didn't have the courage to disavow these voters. They didn't have the courage to say, we don't want you, QAnon. If you believe there is a pedophile ring in the Democratic Party, we don't want you. They were happy to take them. And so, yes, Trump's rhetoric and other Republicans' rhetoric is a problem.

But the question I often have for a lot of friends of mine who continue to vote for this form of politics, and they can put aside the dehumanization, they can put aside the attacks, but, implicitly, when you are going into the ballot box and you're pushing on a name that you know is doing that, you are choosing that kind of politics for America.
