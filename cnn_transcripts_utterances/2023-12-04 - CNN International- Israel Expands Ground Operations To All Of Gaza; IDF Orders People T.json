This as Israel expands ground operations to all of Gaza, including in the south, where civilians have moved at the request of the IDF. Israel is ramping up airstrikes, hitting some 200 targets in Gaza overnight, and the IDF is warning civilians to evacuate large areas within the enclave. But, with limited access to power and internet, it's unclear how many will get that message. This was the scene at Khan Younis in southern Gaza after renewed Israeli strikes, homes reduced to rubble, smoke still coming out of collapsed buildings. The Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health says more than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7.Elliott Gotkine joins me now from London to discuss this. Elliott, it seems like even more of a recipe for chaos and disaster to now expand these ground operations to the south where civilians have been told to evacuate. Where else do they have to go, and how are those messages going to be communicated to them?",

It's dropping flyers which have got QR codes on them that residents can scan to see their neighborhoods kind of divided up into quadrants and get an understanding of which ones are safe and which ones aren't. There are text messages, and there're also phone calls going out to residents as well. But, as you say, it's not always clear that everyone is getting their message. And even when those messages are getting through, it's not always clear that they're being understood.And of course, when you've already had hundreds of thousands of people from the northern part of the Gaza Strip asked to evacuate to the south to the relative safety of the south, scrunched into a kind of even smaller area, it does seem that there is a greater danger of even higher civilian death count in the south than there was in the north. And indeed, Secretary of State, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warning Israel, saying that the displacement and the massive civilian death toll that we've seen in the north cannot be repeated in the south. Now, these warnings, Israel spreading these warnings around, would seem to be a nod to that although Israel has been giving warnings in the north as well. But, at the same time, we've heard, for example, from the General -- Chief of the General Staff, Herzl Halevi, saying that Israel will go into the south with as much power. It will be no less powerful, he says, than the operations in the north. And so, there are concerns, and we've seen some of the impacts there that to, again, I paraphrase the Secretary Blinken, that it's not just the intent to avoid civilian casualties that the U.S. and others want to see. It's the actual avoidance of civilian casualties, and of course, as this ground operation expands, then there is every fear that that will not necessarily be the case.",

The kind of border conflict that has been underway since the initial October 7 Hamas attack into Israel, it subsided on the Lebanese-Israeli border during that seven-day truce. But, when the bombs started falling on Gaza again, that's when the border conflict here resumed. So, even within the last two hours, and in the distance here, the Israeli border, and I can see Israeli antennas and settlements that are about eight kilometers away from here on those hilltops, we were watching periodic incoming Israeli artillery hitting these farm fields in southern Lebanon over the course of several hours. And that's just kind of part of everyday life here in this part of Southern Lebanon ever since the hostilities began and the conflict resumed here.So, towns like this, the schools have been closed now going on two months. They are partially evacuated, but people who cannot afford to go anywhere else, they're stuck living here with the sound of artillery strikes day in and day out coming from the Israeli side of the border. Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for a number of cross-border attacks over the course of the last couple of days, saying that it's carrying out these attacks in support of Palestinians in Gaza right now. But, we are not seeing at this point, even though it has been deadly. For example, there have been more than 85 Hezbollah fighters killed over the course of the past month and a half, and more than a dozen civilians here in southern Lebanon. But, we haven't seen it erupt into an enormous conflict, the likes of which were seen in this part of southern Lebanon in 2006. So, both sides have managed to not use their heaviest weapons, though Israel says it did carry out airstrikes yesterday against suspected Hezbollah targets. It is impacting the economy here in southern Lebanon. And you know, one of the strangest things, Bianca, in this town, which is largely Christian, I was watching locals putting up Christmas decorations as I could hear the explosions and see the impacts of Israeli artillery just a few kilometers away. And that just gives you a sense of the strange contradiction of life in here in the middle of this border conflict. Bianca.",

There is a yawning gap between the money on offer and the money estimated to be needed to shift the world towards green energy. Developing countries say they already need hundreds of billions of dollars every year to adapt to our warming planet. And on top of that, they say they will need trillions more to make the shift to clean energy.But, threatening to overshadow finance, science, due to a video that emerged with the president of the summit saying that there is no science. He says the phase out of fossil fuel is what's going to achieve 1.5, the limit of warming call for in the Paris Agreement.

There are three or four others, Becky, and there is work going on on technology and scale on all of these. One of those is agriculture and methane and livestock and that stuff. Another one is heavy construction materials. Yet another one is heavy transportation. And then, of course, there is the issue that some folks say, even if you do all this, you have to have some degree of carbon capture. The problem with carbon capture is that price is very high even now.So, I think you really have to tackle the climate crisis on multiple fronts.

So, for example, last year, we put $170 million to work in direct financing for natural gas plant in Central Asia. To put that in context, our total output last year was $122 billion. So, we are talking about 0.2 percent that goes into that. So, we're very clear. That's not where we're going. We're going renewables. We're going methane. We're going in that direction.",

They're counting all the way down to that. It's like the issue about scope three versus scope two.What I'm talking about is where we are directly involved in the financing. That's $170 million. And I'm quite clear that even if you took their number of a billion, just remember in the context of $120 billion, see where we're going. We're talking about putting 45 percent of our financing every year into climate financing. That's $40 billion plus a year. We're talking about doing half of that in adaptation, half in mitigation.

That creates the mistrust that we don't need. The reality is we cannot afford another decades of emission heavy growth. That happened. We cannot do it anymore. We have to move on.
