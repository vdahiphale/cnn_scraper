The agency says in the three weeks after the president's asylum crackdown announcement, migrant apprehensions have dropped by more than 40 percent.Joining me now. CNN's Kevin Liptak. But I want to start with CNN's Rosa Flores in Houston for us. Rosa, those -- that's a big drop. Can you break down the numbers for us?",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, I've been talking to sources on both sides on the border all along the U.S. southern border. And I can tell you that what I'm hearing is that this executive order by the Biden administration that bars asylum is deterring illegal immigration. Now, like everything else regarding the border, it's nuanced. It depends on what state and what border community you talk to. And the answers are a little different.But overall, for example, in the Rio Grande Valley, what I'm hearing across the border in Mexico is that some of the people that are being deported under this policy are heading home. If I talk to somebody in Arizona that works with migrants there, they -- they're saying that they're still seeing about a hundred migrants crossing illegally in an area near Sasabe, Arizona. That could most likely be the cartels using misinformation to misinform migrants. In San Diego, for example, across the border in Tijuana, they're seeing a lot of migrants simply waiting there to use some of the legal pathways established by the Biden administration to cross over. But overall, the numbers are drastically low right now. I talked to a source who said that on Sunday migrant apprehensions on the U.S. southern border were about 1900. And on Monday, they dropped to about 1600. I mean, I remember reporting live from the border where -- those were the numbers just for one particular sector on one particular day. So, these numbers are astronomically low right now. And one of the big questions, of course, is why. And why are they still crossing even though this executive order is in place? I can tell you from talking to a lot of people on the border that they always tell me you got to think about it like this, Rosa. These migrants that are making this journey, they do not have CNN access for all of the analysis and all of the information regarding executive orders. A lot of them simply don't know. And cartels use misinformation to misguide them. I should add that the ACLU has to the Biden administration over this executive order, claiming that the administration did not use the administrative procedure act properly. We have a statement from the lead attorney from the ACLU leading this case saying \"We already know that under the ban, migrants with credible claims of danger are being denied an asylum screening. In the end, the ban is unlikely to have much impact on the numbers, but if it does deter people in danger from seeking safety hears -- into safety here that's deeply troubling.\" And, Jim, I want to end with this. Because -- one of the things that I hear from border patrol agents in the field all the time is that because the numbers are so high sometimes. They don't get the chance to actually do their job, which is border security to catch the bad guys. According to DHS, more of the field agents are now actually in the field right now because the numbers are so low, and they're tackling the border security, which is their number one job. That's what field agents want to do. And according to DHS, because the numbers are so low, they're actually able to do their jobs now on the border. Back to you.",

The last time the illegal border crossings were that low was in January 2021. So, this is being welcomed at the White House, which is for someone who tried to neutralize this issue of immigration, it has been a political challenge for President Biden. Those massive waves of migrants that we saw earlier in the administration really allowed Republicans to seize on it and to claim that President Biden didn't have a way of controlling this border. And this is I think, their way of doing that.It has not been universally popular. You know, as Rosa said, the ACLU is suing. But a lot of progressives and immigration advocates really raised alarm because the authorities that he was using were the very same authorities that President Trump used when he was in office to try and get the numbers down. What you're seeing the administration do is really try and flip the script. To go after Republicans for failing to pass any legislation in Congress. And that was what we heard this morning from Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Many of them will live with the WADAs for the rest of their lives.

China's anti-doping agency said the 23 swimmers weren't responsible for the positive result because they were inadvertently exposed to the drug.So far, WADA says they found no evidence to disprove the Chinese explanation. This is a bit confusing for us because here in the U.S., of course, Jim, if you're in the NFL and you get tested positive for something that's even in a cold medication, you're always told you are responsible for what goes into your body.
