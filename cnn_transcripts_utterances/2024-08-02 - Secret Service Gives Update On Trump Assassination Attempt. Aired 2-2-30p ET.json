We should had at least some other set of eyes from the Secret Service point of view, covering that. That building was very close to that outer perimeter and we should have had more of a presence.And so as far as the timeline running of him, running back and forth, I know the FBI has provided a bit of a chronology as well. And so I'd have to go back and look at that. But the bottom line is this, David (ph), this was a Secret Service failure. That roof line should have been covered.

One of the other changes that I implemented when I became the Acting Director is we are now going to leverage the use of unmanned aerial systems at sites now.So we are putting those assets out. And, you know, we should have had better line of sight on some of those high ground concerns. We thought we might have had it covered with the human eye.

And so the teams, especially on the tactical side, when it comes to the tactical, our counter assault team, they actually had an embed with them from the local tac team. And they had that radio net as well with Pennsylvania State Police. With respect to the counter-snipers, they were using cellular or telephone text communications. At this point, moving forward, what I have directed now is that everybody should be using the radionet.And if we don't have the ability to pipe in or leverage that counterpart system, that's one of the things that we're looking at now.

Have you gotten to the bottom of why there was no one stationed on the route from a law enforcement perspective and why there was no one there to secure the building to make sure no one could get up there? Have you gotten any clarity on why those two lapses in security were in place? And I have a couple quick follow ups.",

And looking at that site, you know, it really seeing how close that site was to the stage, seeing where it was. It definitely raised a lot of questions in my mind that there should have been physical presence, if not on the roof, that there should have been better security to prevent anyone from getting up on that roof.So moving forward, we've -- I've directed our Office of Protective Operations and our special operations division now, that when we are up operational and we have counter-snipers out there, that we are working with locals, and that they, in fact, will also be out present. You know, at the very least, the presence of a law enforcement officer can deter a lot of bad activity. Having been a local police officer, I will never know how many crimes I prevented just by being there, just by walking the street and being out there. And so, moving forward, one of the things that we want to do is we want to deter people from even thinking about trying to do something like this again. And the only way we can do that is leveraging not only the resources that we have, but the resources of our state and locals and putting them out there in an overt presence.",

They want to be -- whether it's an indoor site or an outdoor site, it's on the Secret Service to make sure that we create a secure environment. And, you know, listen, we identify challenges, we identify concerns, and then it's on us to figure out what we need to do to mitigate that. So if there are going to be future campaign rallies outside, it's going to be on us to make sure that we are providing all the assets and resources to make sure that those sites are indeed secure.With respect to the radio transmissions, you know, based on, you know, what the FBI -- my colleague from the FBI testified the other day, and they are working on isolating some of those radio frequencies from the state and locals, that there was somebody who did, in fact, radio out that they had seen the individual with a weapon. What I can tell you is that that piece of information, that vital piece of information, and by no fault of anyone, it was a very stressful situation. It did not make it over. Our detail, our counter- snipers, everyone that was there that day, were operating under the assumption and under the last bit of information they had received that there was an issue that the locals were working at the 03:00. That's the bit of information that we had. Not anything about a weapon.",

They feel like they let the country down. And they are wearing this. And it is -- it's open. You can see it. It's an open wound that they are carrying.They are a very experienced office.
