They wanted him to be a fighter. And boy, fight did he deliver.Now, there is some criticism already that we're hearing from some Republicans that it was too political. And the retort already is, compared to what? I mean, you saw Marjorie Taylor Greene sitting there wearing a MAGA hat. One of the things that you mentioned, that he used the word predecessor. By our count in the prepared remarks, he used the word predecessor, Jake, 13 times. And that is not only important because I don't remember that ever happening in this kind of speech, but because of what predecessor denotes. And that's in the past.",

Their Speaker, Mike Johnson, tried to counsel them not to heckle, not to react in this way. And they did it.And it creates an opening, an opportunity for Joe Biden to react. He said to them, I know you know how to read. He had he had a lot of moments where he was kind of trolling them. And that worked for him in this speech, because that's essentially, at the end of the day, this was a speech about all the things that Presidents make speeches about. But the question before Joe Biden today that he needed to answer the most was, how does he present to the American public? Republicans, it seemed to me, really handed him a golden opportunity on multiple occasions during the speech to do exactly what his aides wanted him to do, which was show some fight, show his ability to react in the moment. He likes to ad lib. It's not always it doesn't always work out well for him. He did it a few times tonight without any major gaffes. And I think that was ultimately the bar that his aides wanted him to clear.",

This is the 36th of these for me, State of the Union's or presidential addresses at the beginning, first one being 1989.Never heard one so political. Never heard one that is such a campaign speech. But what do Republicans say about Joe Biden? He is weak and he has weakened America. And he doesn't have the vitality, the alacrity, the vigor to be the President of the United States. He came out hitting on Ukraine. Stand up to Russia. Be strong, Republicans. Don't be weak. Right at the weakness argument that he's weakened America, that he's personally weak, then went right after January 6th, said, I'm going to bury the lies and took the heckling for it, and then turned to an issue that Democrats think is absolutely critical for them, IVF, reproductive freedom, the broader issue. And he did it all with fight. He did it with punches. He came out punching and came out swinging right from the beginning. Then he did the traditional State of the Union laundry list. And then he came back at the end and took on the age issue. Does it work? Who knows? But he tried a little humor. He took the back and forth from the floor. It was clear to me that they understand what the Republicans have done and are going to try to do to him by saying he's personally not up to it. He's not strong and he's weakened America. They came out to fight.",

I mean, you could see how it was playing out as they rehearsed it in Camp David and the like.John, to your point about it being a political speech, there's no doubt about it. It is. It was a reelection speech wrapped in a State of the Union. But I found it was also a speech just reflective of our times. Nothing is as it once was in American politics. And I think this speech, the demeanor from the folks in the House, the President going into raw politics, it -- him calling on his -- calling out his predecessor all these times. Yes, that's unprecedented. It's also unprecedented to be running against a guy who once served as President, who you defeated, who's trying to come back. It's also unprecedented, you know, that he's facing all these trials and what occurred in this -- in this very chamber on January 6th. All these things are -- and I just think if we apply our sense of what State of the Union addresses have been, it's not -- that's just not where our politics are anymore. And so, while I know the Republicans will criticism -- criticize him for being political here, it seems to me he actually gave a speech that -- that is of this moment.",

This wasn't news, by the way. I mean, like we you know, we all learned a few hours ago that the Marjorie Taylor Greene was going to have these pins. And also, obviously, this has been a horrible story in the news and one that a lot of people have been talking about, including Republicans. And he not only did he did he say her name, he mentioned that he had lost children, too. And he lost his daughter when he was in his 30s and he lost his son, Beau, a few years ago, talked about their misery, repeated something Marjorie Taylor Greene said about like killed by an illegal, although he's already getting some blowback from -- from immigration advocates about using the term illegal to talk about undocumented immigrants. And then he talked about how the compromise on the border would have disincentivized people crossing illegally because instead of staying -- staying around for five or six years until their hearing, it would be six weeks. And so, it would stop the incentivization of crossing the border. Talked immediately about it. And then said, do you want to debate the border or do you want to fix the border?",

It's not statesmanlike. Let me say one more thing on Israel. A little too much. Got to hear both sides on Israel and Hamas for me. No, you don't have to hear both sides. Israel's our ally. Hamas is the enemy. He lied about our ally and implied that they are not delivering humanitarian aid. They are delivering humanitarian aid.
