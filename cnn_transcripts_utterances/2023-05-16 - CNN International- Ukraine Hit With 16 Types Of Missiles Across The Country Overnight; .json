Just ahead, Ukraine says Russia launched airstrikes of quote, \"exceptional intensity\" on Kyiv but say it said defenses destroyed most of those missiles and drones. Then a devastating cyclone leaves a trail of destruction in western Myanmar.Rescue groups are bracing for what could be a large scale loss of life. And a new report criticizes the FBI for its handling of the investigation into alleged ties between Russia and Donald Trump's campaign during the 2016 presidential race says. Ukraine says it was hit nationwide with 18 types of Russian missiles in a series of early morning strikes. And officials are calling the attack on the capital exceptional in its intensity. But the Ukrainian defense minister says all enemy targets were shot down, including six Russian hypersonic Kinzhal missiles. Meanwhile, the Wagner group chief is claiming a U.S. citizen has died fighting in the embattled city of Bakhmut. CNN's Nic Robertson joins me live in eastern Ukraine. You've been there a lot, you've seen these attacks over the months. How does this one compare?",

      "sentences": "You know, once again, it appears, and we've heard Ukrainian officials say this over recent weeks, that Russia is trying to find a way to penetrate the air defenses over Kyiv. We know that Kyiv's allies have given it a lot of air defense equipment, and it does appear to be working successfully.And this what they're describing really as its most complex of attacks so far. Six of these Kinzhal hypersonic missiles fly 10 times the speed of sound launched from aircraft in the skies. So you never quite know where the attack is going to come from. Intercepted, apparently, the nine cruise missiles fired from sea, from the Black Sea coming from the south of Kyiv, those taken down as well, and also three Iskander land-based missiles fired from the east were knocked out and put off their trajectory. So, you know, Ukraine's air defenses around the capital are looking good. They're pretty strong around some other cities, but perhaps less powerful around the front lines. Here, of course, it is harder at the front line, of course, because the trajectory of a lot of what's fired across the front lines is short range. The battle for Bakhmut still goes on. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner mercenary boss, is claiming that they have the body of a fallen U.S. person who he claims that died in battle. He says that they'll treat his body with respect, repatriate into the United States, a U.S. flag on him, because Prigozhin says he didn't die in his bed, he died fighting a worthy death, in the words of Prigozhin. But Prigozhin's words have little value. He's full of propaganda, a lot of bluster, and there is, so far, no confirmation or hard evidence to support what he's saying. What we do know, though, is that the battle along the front here is intense along the front lines, and no one is making big gains or big losses, but they are, in terms of personnel taking a lot of heat.",

But if you look at the results of that first round and what came out of this, President Erdogan certainly is in a much stronger position going into this runoff than when he entered the race.He's got a parliamentary majority. He has got a narrow-lead currently with nearly 50 percent of the votes that he needs to win the presidency. And the opposition, Max, is in such a weak position right now. They're going into this with a disadvantage. They failed their voters, it seems. They underperformed in this first round. They failed, many would tell you, to seize that moment of weakness of President Erdogan, who has been under a lot of criticism because of the state of the economy in the country, because of his government's very slow initial response to the devastating earthquake and that lack of preparedness, and they still did not manage to unseat the Turkish President. So as they go into the second round, both sides saying they are ready, but certainly the wind is behind President Erdogan.",

Some passengers feared the train had been hijacked as Nazi slogans were repeated over the intercom. Police are currently searching for two suspects. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Berlin and there is talk of a rise of Nazism in some countries. But is this just an isolated incident or where's it going?",

And you can see that there's big, wide ranging public outrage if you look at the media here in Germany, but then also in Austrian society, quite frankly, as well, in Austria also as well, Max.And with the latest that we have from the Austrian authorities is that they have now identified two people who they believe were behind all this. They use CCTV camera footage from inside the train and they say that both these people have been identified. We're also hearing that criminal complaints have been filed against them, obviously, not just for playing a speech by Adolf Hitler via the train's intercom system, but also for illegally accessing that intercom system as well. And this is something that the authorities have also pointed out, is they don't believe that the train was hacked from the outside. They believe that these two people got access to the actual train's intercom system through some sort of key that they managed to obtain and then played various messages. People who were on the train telling CNN, including, by the way, a rabbi from Vienna telling CNN that at first, there were weird noises, weird music, and then the speech by Adolf Hitler, followed by chance of Sieg Heil and Heil Hitler, which obviously caused a lot of commotion on that train. People, as you have mentioned, Max, fearing that the train may have been hijacked or that it may have been some larger incident. So as it turns out, it could possibly have just been these two people possibly playing a prank or something else or maybe there was some sort of other backdrop to all of these. But again, if you look at right now in Austria, the authorities there and certainly the railway company there say they are taking all this extremely seriously. They say that they hope very much that the two alleged perpetrators will indeed be punished very severely for these actions, Max.",

Special Counsel John Durham concludes the FBI should never have launched a full investigation into connections between Donald Trump's campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.The 300-page report also suggests the FBI used a double standard with a lower threshold for launching the Trump-Russia probe compared to investigating allegations involving Hillary Clinton's campaign. Durham was appointed by Trump's Attorney General William Barr in 2019. Let's get more from CNN's Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid.

Now, one of his big criticisms of the agency is that instead of opening a preliminary investigation that they went right ahead and opened a full investigation.Now, that's a pretty nuanced critique, but the difference is clear. A preliminary investigation requires a lower threshold, but also means that agents working on that case don't have access to more invasive tools like FISA warrants. Now here, though, of course they did open a full investigation, but Durham says, in doing so, they relied on, quote, raw, unanalyzed and uncorroborated intelligence. At this point, they're not recommending any new blockbuster indictments or any major sweeping changes of the agency.",
