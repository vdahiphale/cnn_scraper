And the special counsel investigating possible obstruction of justice charges against Donald Trump issued a flurry of subpoenas to some of Trump's closest allies, including two men in charge of surveillance videos at Mar-a-Lago.",

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on a visit to Finland says Ukraine doesn't have enough weapons to defend its own territory, let alone attack Moscow. So, for more, CNN's Clare Sebastian is live in London. So, Clare, bring us up to speed on what more we know. And on the reaction to all this. CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Kim, I think the key point at this stage is that Kyiv, Ukraine is really on guard for any retaliation. This is what Moscow said in its original statement announcing these alleged drone attacks, that it reserves the right to respond and these overnight attacks on the country, including the capital Kyiv can perhaps be viewed in that context. The Air Force is now saying the 24 Shaheed drones were fired at Ukraine, they were able to shoot down, 18 of them, including all of them over the capital Kyiv. Though an official in Kyiv saying that it's now been hit three times in the first four days of May. The greatest intensities since the beginning of the year. And we are hearing of debris from those drones that were shut down falling on some streets in Kyiv. So, even though they were shut down and there is still some impact. Also hearing of explosions overnight in Odesa, we're getting some video in showing that as well. And under this threat of retaliation, clearly, President Zelenskyy was at pains to distance Ukraine, as much as possible from these drone attacks. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Another couple of developments to bring you up to speed with overnight, Kim, is that to separate oil facilities have according to local officials and state media in Russia been hit by a legend drone attacks. One in Krasnodar which is just across from Crimea, one in the Rostov region just near Ukraine's border in the north with Russia. The Ukraine, of course, has not confirmed any involvement in these and they appear to have been relatively minor. But this is part of a spate of drone attacks and attacks on infrastructure, oil storage, train derailment, things like that across the border in Russia that we've seen in the past week or so.",

Malcolm Davis is a senior analysis at the -- analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Thank you so much for being here with us, Malcolm. You like many are skeptical that Ukraine could be behind this? Why is that? MALCOM DAVIS, SENIOR ANALYST, AUSTRALIAN STRATEGIC POLICY INSTITUTE (via Skype): Look, I think the likelihood that this is a false flag operation run by the Russians is consistent with their form in the past, you know, attacks in the past against urban civilian targets carried out by Russian forces to justify the use of force. And I think that President Zelenskyy is right, you know, the Ukrainians have so much to do in terms of defending their own country. They don't have the means to attack that -- at that distance. Certainly, the Ukrainians have attacked inside Russia, but it's a long way from where they have attacks have gone to Moscow. And I really don't think that this attack would have made much sense militarily, in terms of giving the Russians exactly what they wanted, which is a justification to escalate.

But I think what Putin is thinking in terms of is using this as an opportunity to potentially declare war, potentially undertake a national mobilization that opens up all sorts of opportunities for the Russians to bring in additional forces to also more importantly, leverage other aspects of Russian industry and society to support the war effort. So, in other words, if they're going from what they're calling a special military operation, to an actual declared war, suddenly a whole set of new operations and roles and opportunities kick in for the Russians that are not there at the moment that they can bring to bear.And I think that the Russians are thinking very much in terms of what happens at the end of the upcoming Ukrainian offensive, which is likely to go well. What the Russians want to be able to do is ultimately withstand that offensive and then come back stronger later this year or into 2024 to sustain the war because the Russians want a prolonged war, they do not want, essentially to see defeat, staring them in the face. The U.S. is analyzing and assessing sort of, you know, who could be behind this. How do they go about finding out who was behind that drone attack? Will the answer come out eventually? I know, you know, Russia has a history of producing false evidence as well. So, they'll be working in parallel, I suppose.",

But I think that third possibility is the least likely.So, I think what the U.S. and other allied governments will be doing is focusing very much on those first two possibilities. There'll be using national technical means to assess the video, to sort of monitor satellite surveillance of the area at the time, even signals intelligence.

He's accused of shooting and killing five people including a nine-year-old in his neighbor's house on Friday after they asked him to stop firing his gun in his yard. Investigators say the suspects longtime partner helped him evade police for days giving him food and clothes and arranging transport to the house where he was later captured. She is now facing a felony charge. And Serbia is also trying to come to grips with a horrific mass shooting. A very rare occurrence in that country. And police say it was committed by a 13-year-old boy who shot and killed nine people in his elementary school in Belgrade on Wednesday. A candlelight vigil was later held for the victims. Officials say the suspect didn't show any remorse after the attack. His motive is still under investigation. As Fred Pleitgen reports, police believe the shooting was planned well in advance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Horror inside a school classroom. A scene all too familiar in the U.S. but this is Serbia's capital Belgrade. This is the deadliest mass shooting in the country in over a decade. Moments after arriving at the prestigious Vladislav Ribnikar Elementary School, a 13-year-old student took out his father's gun and shot the security guard before turning it on pupils according to officials. VESELIN MILIC, BELGRADE POLICE CHIEF (through translator): There was one girl in her desk, another at the piano. He took their lives. Then he went out into the corridor to the history classroom.

They're rather -- he would rather have seen a regional bank get that. So, you know, we have all these aspects as interesting.
