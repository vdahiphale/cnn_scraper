This morning, North Carolina's Republican candidate for governor, Mark Robinson, he's the lieutenant governor right now, one of the party's most controversial figures, engulfed in scandal and vowing to stay in his critical battleground state race despite calls from some fellow Republicans to step down.A bombshell CNN report, unearthing dozens of rather lewd comments that Robinson made on a pornography forum. The posts include Robinson calling himself a, quote, black Nazi, defending slavery, and even using racist language to insult the late civil rights icon doctor Martin Luther King Jr. We'll speak to King's son about those shocking comments in just a few moments. But first, your CNN KFILE senior editor Andrew Kaczynski. Good morning, Andrew.",

My colleague Em and I found a series of highly disturbing posts more than a decade ago on the message board of a pornographic website, and we traced them directly to Mark Robinson. Now, we did interview Robinson yesterday, and he categorically denies making these posts. I'll get to that in just one moment.But first, I want to walk people through just some of them. Take a look at this post right here. In one post, Robinson called himself a, quote, black Nazi, and when discussing then President Barack Obama in 2012, writing, quote, I take Hitler over any of the shit that's in Washington right now. It even goes beyond that disturbing post. Robinson defended slavery, writing, quote, slavery is not that bad. And I wish they would bring back slavery. I would certainly buy a few. He also disparaged, as you mentioned, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., using a slur to refer to him and calling him a, quote, commie bastard. All those comments and others you can read on CNN.com were made on the message board of a porn website called Nude Africa. And Wolf, in addition to those posts, he also expressed views on Nude Africa that sharply contradict his current policies as a socially conservative candidate for governor, for example, he has been vocally anti transgender. But look at what Robinson wrote on the porn message board a decade ago that he liked, quote, watching transgender porn, adding, quote, that's effing hot. And called himself a, quote, perv. In another thread that was discussing the story of a woman who said she had been raped by her taxi driver while she was drunk Robinson wrote, quote, and the moral of this story? Don't f a drunk white bitch.",

Sixty-six years ago, 60 years, excuse me, later, that rhetoric is being propagated, or at least it's been alleged that it's being propagated by a person who's running for the governor of the state of North Carolina.
