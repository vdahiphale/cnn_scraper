      "sentences": "It's this like massive sense of gravitas and importance because you know that this is history in the making.SCANNELL (voice over): Dozens more potential jurors filed into Manhattan courtroom Tuesday and six jurors were seated as jury selection continued into Day 2 of the first criminal trial of a former president. The seated jurors include an Irish man in sales, a female oncology nurse, a corporate male lawyer, an English teacher sure at a charter school, a software engineer and an owner of an I.T. business. The jury selection strategy for both parties taking shape. Trump attorneys spending the afternoon digging into the social media posts of some potential jurors. Two were struck for cause, one for a social media post referencing Trump and, quote, lock him up. When a prosecutor asked the juror if he still believes Trump should be locked up, the jury answered, no. Trump was seen craning his neck toward him and flashing a smirk. Judge Juan Merchan issued a stern warning to Trump after he visibly reacted to a juror's answers about a video she posted on social media. He warned Trumps lawyer, your client was audibly uttering, I will not have any jurors intimidated in the courtroom. That juror was questioned outside the presence of the others about a video she posted on social media showing an outdoor celebration, quote, spreading the honking cheer around Election Day 2020. She said it was a New York celebratory moment. Trump's lawyers suggested she would was biased. The judge said he believed the juror could be fair and didn't excuse her. Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, telling those in the jury pool, quote, it's extraordinarily important to President Trump that we know we're going to get a fair shake. One juror said he finds Trump fascinating because he, quote, walks into a room and he sets people off one way or the other. Blanche seemed amused with the response. Another juror said she learned for the first time Tuesday that Trump has been charged in three other cases. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass addressed prospective jurors, asking them to set aside any strong feelings. He asked each to consider if they would be able to look Defendant Trump in the eye and return a guilty verdict, if the case is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Trump up here to look at the jurors, tilting his head once or twice as they were answering, yes, according to pool reports. One juror who was excused after she said she had a scheduling conflict, described her experience to CNN.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf. Jury selection is a fascinating exercise and it's really more art than science You're trying to read human beings inherently dynamic and unpredictable, but we've learned some really important I think potentially revealing details about these seven jurors. These jurors will be on the case. So far, we know four males three females.Let's take a quick look at what we have for juror number one. Juror number one will be the foreperson, no magic powers associated with the foreperson. That's the person who generally communicates on behalf of the jury with the judge and tends to lead the deliberations in the room. What jumped out at me, there's nothing remarkable in the bio but this is a person who said he watches both Fox News and MSNBC. That's an interesting combination. If I'm Trump and I got anyone who watches any Fox News, I want a chance that that person is going to go on the jury. But I have to note this. In New York, I picked juries in New York, people sometimes confuse Fox News with the local Fox 5. And the jury form does not separate those two. So, it could be that he was actually talking about the local news, which is really not partisan. Let's go to juror number two. Juror number two is nurse in New York. You get a lot of medical professionals, a lot of hospitals there. In my experience, medical professionals tend to be technical. They're capable of separating facts from emotion. And, really, prosecutors want that. It really depends in how strongly you feel that your case is based when you get down to the technical elements of it. So, you're always going to have nurses, doctors, medical professionals, a native New Yorker watching CNN, that's good to see. Juror number three -- okay, juror number three, now, this is interesting, Wolf. This is a lawyer. And, typically, the rule of thumb is lawyers don't like lawyers on their juries. At the prosecutor's office, we almost automatically got rid of any lawyer, but it's also hard to do because you do have a lot of lawyers in Manhattan. The concern is that a lawyer might just take over the jury. They might say listen. I'm a lawyer forget about the judge. I know what's going to happen here. But it's hard to see the jury with no lawyers on it. Interestingly, he does read The Wall Street Journal, which has been quite critical of this particular case in its editorial pages. So, juror number three, I think would please me from Trump's point of view. Let's go to juror number four. Juror number four is an older man. He's a businessman. He's a family man. He says he finds Trump fascinating and mysterious. That would worry me if I was with the D.A.'s office. I don't want someone who's enamored with Trump or finds any sort of fascination or mystery in him, but, again, he doesn't seem to have strong political views for or against Donald Trump. Let's get to number five. Number five is a young African-American. This is a teacher, a highly educated woman. She said she did not know that Trump is facing charges in another criminal case. So, she knows now. Teachers are another interesting one. Teachers sort of cut both ways. Because, on the one hand, teachers know how to say, enough, right? They know how to tell their students, you can't do that. On the other hand, teachers are interested in rehabilitation, giving people a second chance. So, as a prosecutor, we were always sort of mixed about teachers. So, again, this one, I think, strikes me as a fair juror. I don't think either side is going to be delighted or overly upset with juror number five. Let's go to juror number six here. Juror number six is a software engineer, a young person, a recent college grad. Software engineer, similar to the oncology nurse, I think this is a person whose profession requires her to be analytical, to separate out emotion. Usually, prosecutors like that. By the way, gets news from New York Times. I know there's this notion The New York Times is liberal. In New York, everyone gets their news from The New York Times. So, I don't read too much into that. And now we have juror number seven. I'm not sure if we have graphic. This just happened. Juror number seven, Wolf, is another lawyer, a second one. Now we have two lawyers, a litigator, a civil litigator, so someone who knows his way around the courtroom. So, we have a really interesting jury here. Some of what happened here breaks the normal rules, the normal mode for what you want to do when you're picking a jury. My assessment so far is there are certain indicators about these jurors. But I would like from Trump's side. There's other indicators I would like from the D.A. side. But I have to say, I have to hand it to the judge and the parties here. It seems that these seven jurors, based on what we know, are fair and capable of doing exactly what their oath will require them to do, which is to judge this case based on the facts and not based on emotion or politics.",

But he has the reputation of being smart, experienced, even- handed, and I was told last week he was going to keep it moving, and as Elie knows, each side runs out of strikes. And at a certain point, they need to impound people because they don't know what's coming.I thought it was interesting that when Donald Trump left today, he used the word, rushed, in his statement, that the trial was being rushed. What do we know about Donald Trump? He has wanted to delay, delay, delay. I think the fact that seven are down so quickly may be bothering him. On the jurors, as Elie said, I'm interested that there are two lawyers on the jury thus far. Yes, there are a lot of lawyers in New York, but as you would say, you get concerned they might influence, unduly influence a panel.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, the Supreme Court's conservative majority appears likely to toss a criminal charge that hundreds of Capitol rioters and former President Donald Trump have faced, a decision that could deal a significant blow to the Justice Department. Today's case centers on Joseph Fisher, a former Pennsylvania police officer who was charged with multiple federal crimes for his role in the January 6th attack. According to court documents, even texting, take Democratic Congress to the gallows and can't vote if they can't breathe, LOL. He is challenging a federal law that makes it a crime for anyone who otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, arguing the law passed in 2002 in the wake of the Enron accounting scandal is not meant to apply to January 6th rioters. Justice Samuel Alito pressed Fisher's lawyer on the meaning of otherwise in that statute.

REP. JASON CROW (D-CO): Well, Wolf, it would be a bad day for those of us who lived through that day, but it would be bad for the country and democracy, right? I saw firsthand the violence that, of course, ended up in one police officer dead, several of whom have taken their own lives because of the trauma after the riot and the insurrection, and of, course 160 others brutally beaten, many of whom still have terrible injuries as a result of that.
