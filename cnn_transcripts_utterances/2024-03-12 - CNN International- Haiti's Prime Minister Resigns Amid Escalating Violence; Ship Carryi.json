About two hours after takeoff, flight 830 had to turn back for an emergency landing on Monday. None of the 183 people on board were injured. The plane, a Boeing 777- 300, is believed to have suffered hydraulic failure, according to CNN affiliate 7 News. This is the fifth emergency for United Airlines in the past week. On Friday, a United airliner bound for Mexico City diverted to Los Angeles after an issue with the plane's hydraulic system. Authorities in New Zealand are investigating what's been described as a sudden mid-air drop on a LATAM airline flight which injured dozens of people on Monday. A Boeing 787 Dreamliner headed from Sydney to Auckland suffered what the airline is calling a technical event, adding that the plane experienced a strong shake during the flight. Here's how passengers describe what happened.

I had dozed off and luckily had my seatbelt engaged and the next thing you know the plane, as I kind of learned to understand, dropped something to the effect of 500 feet instantly and then had the effect of it coming like a roller coaster and then started to point down.
