CNN's Annie Grayer joins me live from Capitol Hill. It's interesting, Annie, because James Lankford, a top GOP negotiator in the Senate on this bill, said that they are just, quote, \"whisper close to finalizing the border deal in the Senate\", says that it has been mischaracterized, obviously largely focusing on the attention that former President Trump has been putting on this and the pressure he's been putting on some Republicans, namely the man we're looking at right there, the House Speaker.

You know, the Senate had been making a lot of progress, House Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats, on this pretty conservative deal that had a lot of policy changes addressing the border, but with Speaker Johnson pouring cold water on that. Now, there's kind of a standstill in the Senate over what to do with that legislation. I think, you know, what was most interesting hearing Speaker Johnson speak, as he's still going, is he talked about the need for executive action. He wants -- which speaks to what House Republicans -- what their position is right now. He wants the House and Congress to try and force the Biden administration to do more unilaterally on their own. But the President said recently as yesterday, he's done all he can do, and that it's on Congress to act and create some kind of policy change. But, you know, we saw what we're seeing happening right now is just the split in the Republican Party over the border. While you have Republicans in the Senate working across the aisle trying to come with a deal, the House Republicans, which many are beholden to former President Donald Trump, are squashing that deal, largely because the former President came out against it. So, while the Senate Republicans are trying to push this bipartisan deal through, the House Republicans are now trying to just push the Biden administration on their own.",
