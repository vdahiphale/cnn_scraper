      "sentences": "Good afternoon. I am Kasie Hunt here in Washington.We are going to begin with the scramble for answers after U.S. fighter jets were scrambled three days in a row this weekend, shooting down three separate aerial objects that were flying over North America. In just moments, the White House is going to take questions on this deepening national security mystery, as President Biden faces increasing pressure to address the nation to explain what exactly is going on and who is behind these incursions. So we're going to bring you that White House briefing as soon as it gets under way. But we want to get started right now with CNN's Kylie Atwood and Phil Mattingly, who are tracking all of this. Kyle, let me start with you at the State Department. So much of this is going to depend on what the government recovers from what is shot down. And what is the status of this? If they haven't determined the origins of these objects, have they narrowed it down? Have they ruled things out? What do we know? It doesn't seem like we know a lot. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  I would say just, no, they haven't really narrowed this down or ruled much out at all, Kasie, Kasie. There were Pentagon officials who spoke with reporters last night. And they were really quite crystal clear in saying that they aren't ruling anything out right now just because they don't have any definitive answers as to the origin of what these objects are and their purpose, why they were over U.S. airspace. I do think it's important to note that after that Chinese spy balloon was downed off the coast of South Carolina last weekend, what the U.S. government did was, they adjusted their radar system to pick up more -- to be more sensitive, essentially, at these higher elevation. So that could be one of the reasons that they're picking up these objects now that previously they wouldn't have actually detected were in U.S. airspace. But that isn't necessarily the definitive reason here. They're still trying to figure out if there are actually more of these unknown objects in U.S. airspace or if it's just that they're picking these up now. And I also think it's important to note that there are just a tremendous number of questions, but there's no direct correlation between these three objects that were down off the coast of Alaska on Friday, over Canada on Saturday, and over Lake Huron on Sunday and that Chinese spy balloon that was down last weekend, no correlation at this time. Of course, we will wait to learn more about that as just more questions arise than answers, and they're focused really on recovery efforts. But, as of last night, the team that is in charge of the recovery for that object that was down off the coast of Alaska hadn't even started the recovery, because they were still getting to the location of where the object was downed, Kasie.",

And we do want to bring you this updated information that is just into CNN. Two of these objects -- we're not sure at this point which ones, but two of these objects are believed to have some sort of payload. So that's relatively limited information, but, again, two of these three objects believed to have some sort of payload that were shot down over the weekend. So, Kylie, can I bring you back in terms of just kind of helping us understand what this may mean?",

So indications of a payload indicate that there's something on board there. There could be propulsion that was giving it the capability to actually fly and keep the object in the air. Obviously, we don't know what is in that payload. But the fact that they are now discovering that they did have a payload means a few things. First of all, the recovery efforts have begun because, obviously, we know that the flights that were going past these objects before they were downed really didn't gather many substantial details about what was on the objects or what they included, other than the fact that they were unmanned. So that is a good thing that we are starting to begin to learn some details about what was on board these objects.",

      "sentences": "All right, Kylie Atwood, Phil Mattingly, stay close. It sounds like we're going to get a lot more coming in on this story as the afternoon unfolds. Thank you both very much for this.Let's bring in now CNN political and national security analyst David Sanger and CNN military analyst retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. Thank you both for being here as we contemplate this mystery. David, let me start with you. The president, of course, has been criticized by especially Republicans for being indecisive about the Chinese spy balloon. Obviously, the approach has changed. Over the weekend, these three subsequent objects, there was very swift, seemingly decisive action to shoot them down. We're still seeing criticism, no matter what, though. I mean, how should the White House strike the correct balance here between trying to explain to all of us what the heck is going on and protecting national security?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kasie, I think you put it exactly right, because we don't have the balance right here to begin with.Last year, they weren't picking up some of the balloons that were launched from China. They should be credited for the fact that they saw this one coming in from China, the initial balloon, from right at the time it was launched, tracked is along. And my own personal view is, they probably learned more from tracking and across the U.S. than they ever would have had they shot it down early on. For the three others that we have seen over the weekend, at this point, they have turned their system up to be so sensitive that it's picking up lots of things. And it's well-known and intelligence, when you start looking for something, you find more of them. And so they're shooting down objects that I suspect a month ago they probably would not have. So there are two things we have got to get an adjustment here, first, fine-tuning the radar systems and other sensors the way you would fine-tune a metal detector going through the airport, so not -- so that a couple of coins don't set it off in your pocket. And then the second thing is coming up with a set of rules that make sense about what you shoot down.",

And there has been this gradual deterioration of communications between the United States and China. Do you think the working relationship and how that has played out, especially in the wake of the balloon that we know is from the Chinese, is that affecting how this is all playing out now? Would we be in a better position if those conversations were in a better place?",

The National Security Council had trouble getting through. Of course, once Secretary Blinken canceled his trip to China, they were offended and they wouldn't answer the phone. But the most worrisome thing here is that it has revealed how poor communications are. This is a problem that was supposed to have been solved in 2001, when the United States had a spy plane that collided with a Chinese fighter off of Hainan Island, actually the location where we think they're launching these balloons from. And after that incident, which killed a Chinese pilot and so forth, they set up these elaborate systems. But the systems only work if someone picks them up at the other end. And that's the biggest worry right now, because, if you got into something really big, like Taiwan, you couldn't have that lack of communication safely.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, those moments of hope that we have seen over the weekend and indeed even today of people still being recovered from the rubble alive has really given the volunteers here and everyone across Turkey a sense of hope.But, of course, as you mentioned, that window for finding survivors is closing pretty quickly. And this is certainly turning into more of a recovery effort. And the focus is certainly shifting now on offering our support, that vital humanitarian assistance to those who did survive, but, of course, have now lost everything. Now, this distribution center here in Istanbul really is the hub of the humanitarian response effort in this city, more than 20,000 volunteers working around the clock over the last week to collect the aid, the donations coming in, to sort through them, and to then transfer that aid to southeast Turkey. And you might be able to hear the beeping behind me. There are a couple of trucks lined up already being filled with aid ready to head out tonight to Southeast Turkey. This is one of more than already 200 trucks which have left this distribution center over the last week. Also, ships have now arrived in Hatay, coming from Istanbul filled with aid for the beds for people who have nowhere to go, as well as crucial medical assistance. But the message that we have been hearing here from the coordinators is that this isn't enough. They need more. They need more aid, more support from the government here in Turkey. But, crucially, they also need more support from the international community. And you mentioned Northwest Syria. That has been a key area of concern. And it continues to be, because the aid that we're seeing here is far more robust than the aid that is getting to those who have lost everything in Northwest Syria, the actual aid crossing Bab al- Hawa from Turkey to Northwest Syria took days to get to. And, so far, just around 60 U.N. trucks have now entered Northwest Syria. There are calls for crossline access now to aid being transferred from government-controlled territory in Damascus to that rebel-held territory hit by the quake in the northwest of the country. But aid groups say they aren't seeing this aid just yet. So that is a key focus there. The people of Syria they feel abandoned. And here in Turkey, there is a growing feeling of frustration and even anger, some questioning whether enough was done to prepare for a disaster of this scale and questioning whether enough was done to get the aid to those in need as quickly as the government could. The government, for its part, says it is carrying out an investigation into allegations of construction negligence. They have already identified more than 100 suspects they believe could be connected to questions of negligence when it comes to the construction of those now destroyed buildings in Southeast Turkey. And a number of arrests have already been made. But, of course, the calls for accountability here in Turkey are only growing.",
