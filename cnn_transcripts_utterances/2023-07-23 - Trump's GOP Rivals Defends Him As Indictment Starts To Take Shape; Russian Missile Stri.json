Even the former president himself believes the indictment is coming. The question is when.It would be Trump's third criminal indictment and a potential game changer for the battle for the GOP presidential nomination. But some of Trump's Republican challengers are shrugging off Trump's role in the January 6th insurrection. Among those questioning the case, former Vice President Mike Pence. Here he is being whisked to safety that day, if you remember this, as rioters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence\" after believing Trump's claim that Pence could overturn the election results.

We spent most of the past week there. They were just incredibly intense strikes, starting not long after Russia pulled out of that grain deal that had been in place for the past year.And in that past year, Odessa was relatively unscathed. It was not attacked in any way like this. And then as soon as Russia pulled out, they started this relentless bombing over the past week. Some 25 different architectural monuments were damaged today according to a local military official. At least one person was killed, a security guard who was at one of those historic sites. President Zelenskyy says that more air defenses are needed from the allies. He says that what is needed is a full-fledged sky shield, as he put it. And that is what he says would be the only way to defeat Russian terror. Zelenskyy is not the only Ukrainian official calling for more air defenses.

We talked about a whole range of things. But we also talked specifically and at length about NATO and Ukrainian membership in NATO.
