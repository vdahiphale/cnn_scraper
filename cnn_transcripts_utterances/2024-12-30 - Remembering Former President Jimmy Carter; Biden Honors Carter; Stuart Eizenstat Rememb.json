Interparty warfare, where Ted Kennedy divided the party by taking him on and didn't reconcile after the convention. Second, inflation, which was heavily due to the Iran crisis because it shut off Iranian oil and doubled oil prices. We had gas lines.But here is, again, a sense of being courageous. July 1979, in the midst of this inflation, Omar, he appoints, over the objection of almost all of us, Paul Volcker, to head the Federal Reserve, because Volcker said to him, I'm going to choke inflation out of the system by high interest rates, and it's going to hit you in your re-election campaign. And he said, I don't want my legacy to be high inflation. Do what you have to do. And then last, of course, was the Iran hostage crisis. Four hundred and forty-four days, which he himself said was the most debilitating part of his presidency.

All the weapons systems which President Reagan implemented, he began. His human rights campaign dramatically changed our relationship with Latin America, as did the Panama Canal treaty. And it undercut the moral argument for the Soviet Union.Camp David was remarkable. Let me give you, please, a quick anecdote. Thirteenth day after 22 drafts going between Prime Minister Begin and President Sadat, Begin comes to him and says, Mr. President, I can't make any more compromises. Please get me a limousine and take me away for going back to Jerusalem. And he knows that this will cause the whole thing to collapse.",

He puts his suitcase down and says, Mr. President, for my grandchildren. I'll make one last try. And that has brought a peace that has lasted now through everything, including this Gaza war.",

That is the tail section of the Boeing 737-800, which managed to survive relatively, and I stress relatively, intact. Fifteen yards high. And this is the section of the plane where the two survivors were pulled from, rescued by first responders, minutes after this plane was engulfed in flames.So, we're going to pan to the left. That's where you can see this massive yellow crane that will be charged with moving pieces of the wreckage. But we're going to pan down. And you can see parts of the aircraft that were hurled, jettisoned beyond the cinder block perimeter of the airport. And this is what investigators from South Korea, the NTSB from the United States, will be poring over, scouring over as they investigate certainly what went wrong and were there any mechanical issues that contributed to the landing gear not deploying? But, you know, I think we got a better sense during the day, as we pan further to my right, just showing you that some of this debris was hurled from the aircraft a distance longer than a football field. Just to give you the sense of the force of this crash, during the daylight hours we saw tray tables, yellow inflatable vests, seats that were mangled, and members of the military that were combing this area that were looking at after sunset, looking for potential human remains, looking for passengers belongings and cataloging certain elements of the aircraft, certain pieces of the aircraft. We are waiting for the NTSB team to get on the scene to begin their work. That is the next part of this equation when it comes to the investigation, figuring out what went wrong. And we do know that one of the black box components has been damaged and it's questionable - an open question, rather, whether or not it will have to be sent to the United States for examination.
