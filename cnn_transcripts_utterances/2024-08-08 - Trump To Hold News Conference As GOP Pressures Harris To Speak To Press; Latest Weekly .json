They are seeing her.In the past, she's run into some trouble when she's had sit-down interviews. And do you think this is the right strategy? And do you think that the average voter really cares one way or the other? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, they should. And there's a difference between visibility and accountability. And being visible is -- is great. She's not hiding. They're out there. They're -- they're doing rallies. They're meeting with voters. They're shaking hands. They're delivering one-liners. That's great. I think Kamala Harris is giving Tim Walz a moment as well to introduce himself to the country. But they also need to be held accountable, accountable for their records, hers as vice president and Senator, his as a governor and a representative in the House. And they need to be accountable for an agenda that they have yet to present. Voters do want to know -- and especially those swing state voters, guys. Swing-state voters don't want to be told by a vice-presidential candidate to be afraid of childless cat ladies. They want to be told I have a solution to a problem that's really important to you. And those swing-state voters, those undecideds are undecided for a reason because no one's giving them those solutions yet. So Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will have to explain what their agenda is. They'll have to reconcile their records. You know, Tim Walz, in Minnesota, has a very progressive record, some social policies that are far outside where the majority of American voters are. He'll have to explain that. He'll have to explain what the Harris agenda will incorporate of that, if anything. Will they merge their policies? Voters do want to know that. And you know, you can sort of take out of the mix the voters that are already with Kamala Harris and the voters that are already with Donald Trump. But everyone else, voters that they need to win, still want these answers.",

And then this more questionable thing about whether he pieced out on a deployment to Iraq. But I just wonder, at what point, do you think, it comes in a campaign where they actually say, OK, we really need to, this benefits us, we need to sit down and be seen as if we are being asked tough questions that we can answer.",

And I get that. This is a very truncated campaign. They've had to do everything very quickly. And I believe that they will sit down with reporters, but they need to do it, those kinds of personal questions. And I saw your great reporting on that particular issue with Tim Walz, Brianna, earlier. You know, they need to answer for that. And these don't have to be fatal questions, but they need to answer for that. And they need to show that they're tough enough to do that. And that they're not too scared to do that.

Just take a breath.After a solid report on jobless claims, some of the worries about the job market and the economy from earlier this week seem to be fading. Let's discuss more with CNN's Julia Chatterley. And, Julia, after that drop on Monday, you told us there was fear, but not panic. What would you say the mood is today? JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN BUSINESS ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Better. But just to be clear, two good pieces of data shouldn't have this kind of bang for buck in the stock market. So please keep those Tums or the Pepto-Bismol close at hand. But I do like being the bearer of good news and that's what I am today. So we'll talk about those jobless claims first. We saw a 17,000-person drop in the number of people in the latest data asking for help from the government. Now, it's still a lot of people asking for help, let's be clear, but it's a lot better than expected. Also, Texas. There was a big drop in the number of people there that were asking for help, too. Why do we care? Well, Hurricane Beryl hit Texas during the collection period for Friday's data. So it perhaps hints that we could get some payback from that bad number from Friday if those weather effects kick out. Bottom line, this number is consistent with a slowing jobs market not a collapsing one. It's also consistent, I think, with a quarter of a percentage point cut in interest rates in September. And mortgage issuers are already listening.",

For a 30-year mortgage now, we've got rates at around just shy of 6.5 percent. That was a quarter of a percentage point higher just a week ago.And it's already seeing people looking at the option of refinancing to a lower rate. In fact, 40 percent of those applications in the recent weeks to Freddie Mac are people looking to do exactly that to refinance lower. So this is good news, I think, and a welcome relief for potential homebuyers. And final quick point, all markets, since the session opened on Friday, by the way, we are virtually back to where we started. So roller coaster, Jessica, is exactly the right word. And to go back to that point that you we're making so well, the lesson here is don't panic on those down days. Just try and hold tight to something.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna, I mean, this is called some of the worst water contamination in history.So as you pointed out, Camp LeJeune is a Marine Corps base camp in North Carolina. Between the 1950s and the 1980s, it was discovered that as many as a million people who lived and worked at that camp were exposed to toxic contaminants in the water supply. These include contaminants like TCE, PCE and vinyl chloride that came from different contamination sources. The CDC, over time, through various studies, has shown that this exposure has been linked to increased risks of different cancer, like, kidney cancer, multiple myeloma, different leukemias and other cancers, as well as adverse birth outcomes and other adverse health effects, including those that affect infants and children. So the Biden administration has essentially made -- there was a law passed two years ago that enabled people who were affected by this to file claims to the U.S. Navy for financial assistance, settlement claims, essentially. And as you pointed out, the deadline to file those is Saturday. But our reporter, Brenda Goodman, found out from the U.S. Navy, there have been about 385,000 claims filed. And as we approach this deadline, the government has offered settlements only for 114. Now some of those have been accepted and some of those have been rejected -- Brianna?",
