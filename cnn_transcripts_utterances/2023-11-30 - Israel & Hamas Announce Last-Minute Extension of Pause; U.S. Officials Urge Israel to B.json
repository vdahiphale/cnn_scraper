You can see it there in that video, the big smile, the wave from 73- year-old Irina Tati, one of the 16 hostages just released by Hamas. One hundred and two hostages have been released or recovered so far. Israel believes there were 145 people taken on October 7th still in Gaza. And today, we're expecting ten more women and children to be freed. The fragile pause stands for now. The big question, how long will this last? What happens at midnight?

Passers-by, some of them sort of off-duty military personnel, opened fire on the Palestinian gunmen, killed -- killed two of them as they were trying to get back into their car and run away. Very compelling closed-circuit television footage of that incident taking place.

This is something that we're seeing play out as a tension, as there is a desire to end this war as quickly as possible, but also continue supporting Israel and its sort of stated mission of eradicating Hamas, making sure that it can never do again what happened on October 7th. So I think this is why we're starting to see a little bit more emphasis coming from the White House on talking about what post-war Gaza looks like.
