John, let me start with you, because there really are so many questions here. First of all, was this actually directed by ISIS? Was it merely inspired by ISIS? Did the suspect act alone? Was he working in conjunction with others? And how much of a link is there really to what happened in Las Vegas outside that Trump hotel? Just walk us through what the investigation actually looks like at this point, John.",

      "sentences": "Well, Zain, on the ISIS angle, all we know so far, and that could change, is that the suspect in a series of recordings he made, apparently as he drove from Texas to Louisiana to embark on this attack, he talks about he had a number of dreams, and those made it clear that he was going to join ISIS and carry out this attack. He was in turmoil with his family, but he wanted to make it clear that don't assume I'm doing this to hurt you, the family. I'm doing this for ISIS. So, that's the connection we have so far.The search warrants into his phones, his computers, his communications over the weeks and months leading up to this, that will probably illuminate the FBI and police in New Orleans as to whether he was watching propaganda, communicating with people overseas, whether it was inspired by things he watched or read, or whether it was directed or supported by ISIS, answers that right now are still unknown. And yesterday, as you recall, the Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the New Orleans Field Division of the FBI asserted that, at that time, at the very beginning, they believe there were others involved. Let's just go back and listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALETHEA DUNCAN, FBI ASST. SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE, NEW ORLEANS: We do not believe that Jabbar was solely responsible. We are aggressively running down every lead, including those of his known associates. That's why we need the public's help. We are asking, if anybody has any interactions with Shamsud-Din Jabbar in the last 72 hours, that you contact us. (END VIDEO CLIP) [11:05:00]",

It's probably the fog of war, I guess you would compare it to, but they've had time now to review the video tapes, review them carefully, look in between the crowds, and they have backed away, as we reported yesterday, from four people on the ground helping to place IEDs around the scene. They now believe that those four people had nothing to do with it. They are focused on whether he stayed alone in an Airbnb on another street in New Orleans, where the IEDs might have been produced, or if he had help. But, the idea that their original assumption was that he had a team supporting him on the ground, has pretty much been investigated out of the case theory right now.As for New Orleans, that's where they are there. But, Las Vegas, the similarities, the same rent-a-car company Turo was used to get the vehicle, another individual who is an active duty military person from Special Forces, and a car bomb basically targeting a Trump location in an Elon Musk vehicle. There is a lot of similarities that could be coincidences or could be connectors. They're investigating their way through that, looking to see, is there any association or contact between the two men? Is there any contact between the Las Vegas suspect, any terrorist groups or propaganda? Right now, none yet. But, they have to go through that to determine, are these two separate incidents that occurred on the same date, or are they connected?",

I'm sure you remember just before Christmas, you and I spoke about the Christmas market attack in Germany, where that was the case as well.

Anybody can get a car. ISIS actually honed the model further in their magazine, Rumiyah magazine, where they came out with the recipe.And listen closely to this, because it appears that the suspect in New Orleans followed the ISIS recipe to a tea (ph), find the largest vehicle you can get, find the narrowest and most crowded street you can target, and target it against the crowds at full speed to achieve maximum lethality. At the end, when you are stopped, have secondary weapons so that you can jump out and continue attack with either guns or knives or bombs, in this cases, bombs and guns were allegedly involved, and confront the police and try to achieve martyrdom, your own death, as kind of the capper to the event.

I mean, there is a New York Times reporter who interviewed him 10 years ago, who described him as cool, calm and collected. Obviously, when you sort of peel behind the curtain, you can see that there were a lot of issues in his life, financial difficulties. There was turmoil within his family. He talked about, at one point, killing his whole family, and then being inspired to join ISIS. Just talk to us a bit more about who this man actually is.",

Appreciate it.I want to welcome Jamil Jaffer, a former Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for U.S. National Security. He also served as a former Associate Counsel to President George W. Bush. Thank you so much for being with us. I'm not sure if you heard John Miller speaking there. Him and I were talking about the fact that these sort of using vehicles as weapons have become a little bit more popular in recent years, and what authorities can actually do about it. And John was actually saying that the thing about vehicles that make them a popular use in terms of weapons for ISIS and for terrorists in general is that you don't have to train anyone on how to make a bomb, for example. You don't have to teach anyone how to be the perfect shooter. Anybody can rent a vehicle. That is obviously scary, because that means that these sorts of attacks aren't necessarily going away. What can authorities do about that? JAMIL JAFFER, FMR. COUNSEL TO ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR NATL. SECURITY, &amp; FORMER ASSOCIATE COUNSEL TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Well, that's exactly right. I mean, look, one of the things that the authorities can do is identify these potential terror suspects ahead of time, identify who might be radicalized, and then see if they have enough information to get a probable cause warrant to do surveillance on them and identify whether they're renting vehicles, acquiring materials, and like. We do this in the foreign terrorism context quite a bit. Trying to figure out how to do it in the domestic terrorism context, or in the domestic target context, is harder because of all the First Amendment -- Fourth Amendment, I should say, requirements for getting a warrant on somebody in the United States who is -- in particular, who is an American citizen. So, I think that's part of the challenge here. But, you've got to figure out what the warning signs are, and then you can identify them. Otherwise, a committed attacker who is willing to use themselves, take their own life or give up their own life, it's going to be very hard to stop them. And when you give them a capability like a vehicle or something easy, or firearms or anything of that matter, even building bombs that are homemade, you can get instructions on the internet now, unfortunately, it presents a very real challenge that's hard to combat.",

And so, the question becomes, how do you become radicalized, and what happened here? He clearly had an ISIS flag on him on the back of that vehicle. He posted these postings, making clear that he had some desire or interest in that group. And so, that suggests there is some amount of radicalization.How that took place, though, we don't know the mechanism, but he is the kind of guy, as John Miller laid out, is vulnerable. He is the exact target that ISIS is looking for, somebody born in the United States, raised here with military training, right, who has easy access to conduct an attack on his own with limited resources. That's what ISIS is looking for. They are looking for that vulnerable American. Unfortunately, here they found one, and they took action.",

At the same time, there are aspects of the Las Vegas attack that don't fit with this attack. You had the association of a Tesla vehicle with the Trump Tower and the Elon Musk dynamic. So, it may be a political motive there. We're just not sure. We don't know enough. These are very strange coincidences for things to happen in the same day.

Officials are telling CNN, the man connected to the rental of the truck is an active duty U.S. Special Forces soldier. The explosion wounded seven people and killed the driver. According to police, he detonated the blast with fireworks, gas tanks and camping fuel. The vehicle was rented on the same platform used to obtain the truck in the New Orleans ramming attack. Now, investigators want to know if the attacks are linked and if the Las Vegas explosion was an act of terror as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERIFF KEVIN MCMAHILL, SHERIFF, LAS VEGAS METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPT.: Well, I mean, it's a Tesla truck, and we know that Elon Musk is working with President-elect Trump, and it's the Trump Tower. So, there is obviously things to be concerned about there, and that's something we continue to look at. The fact that this was a Cybertruck really limited the damage that occurred inside of the valet because it had most of the blast go up through the truck and out.

He said, we come down to this city to enjoy ourselves and to entertain ourselves and to be with our friends and with our families, because that's who we are. Louisiana invented hospitality.

And so, we're digging through more of the social media, more interviews, working with some of our other partners to ascertain just how -- to ascertain a little bit more about that connection.
