      "sentences": "The House plowing ahead and trying to take up legislation to essentially ban TikTok if the Chinesefirm, ByteDance does not sell it. They`re trying to force that sale because of concerns that the Chinese government is too close to private information of Americans. They are alleging that the Chinese government is interfering with that information and could exploit it, something that ByteDance has furiously denied. But nevertheless, this has wide bipartisan support approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee last week, 50 to nothing. That is something that is rarely seen on Capitol Hill, but that bipartisan support ultimately forcing the House Majority Leader to put this bill on the floor very quickly. Steve Scalise said that he would take up this measure, the full House would in just a matter of days. That doesn`t mean though that TikTok isn`t trying to kill it. In fact, that`s exactly what they`re trying to do. The top Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee told me that she is getting flooded with phone calls over people opposed to their efforts. REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R-WA): Yes, we`ve been flooded with calls, record amounts of calls. Any member of the Energy and Commerce Committee that voted yesterday has been flooded. The co-sponsors have been flooded. TikTok actually put up a notice where they blocked an individual to actually get on TikTok unless you called your member of Congress and told them not to vote for this legislation, but that`s just an example of how they can manipulate data and influence Americans for their agenda.",

Several Muslim countries announcedMonday as the first day of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, where Muslims may not consume food or drinks from sunrise to sunset. The exact start date of Ramadan changes because it`s based on clerics seeing a crescent or new moon as the Islamic calendar follows the lunar cycle. There were hopes of a possible ceasefire in the Gaza Strip before the start of Ramadan, but both Hamas and Israel could not reach a deal. While the war goes on, there`s a humanitarian crisis that continues to grapple the Gaza Strip. The U.S. is teaming up with several other nations by airdropping aid into Gaza, but aid agencies recommend that it would be much more efficient if these supplies were transported on the ground. Our chief international correspondent, Clarissa Ward, is here to give us the why. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

CNN cannot independently confirm that because international journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report on the ground. But it certainly gels with what we have been hearing from groups like the U.N., who have warned that hundreds of thousands of Gazans in the northern part of the enclave are one step away from famine, who have announced, as you mentioned, that four out of five people do not have -- or four out of five households, I should say specifically, do not have access any longer to clean water. And while these airdrops, you know, show a certain level of intention and goodwill, they, according to aid organizations, are not terribly efficient and effective in terms of the mechanism for actually distributing aid. We heard from one humanitarian worker who said they`re a great photo op, but they are terrible in terms of trying to make sure that people on the ground get the aid they need. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The National Treasury of Kenya attributes rapid economic growth and dominance in the region to factors like public investments, policies encouraging smallholder, agricultural production, and incentives for private and often foreign industrial investment. Let`s head to Kenya now, where the East African country is dealing with a rise in the rhinoceros population. Overcrowding in sanctuaries has caused problems such as rhinos attacking each other and competing for food. It`s such a concern that the Kenya Wildlife Service is transporting 21 rhinos to a new location. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

With the trackersecurely glued to her horn, she is ready to move 100 miles away. Kenya has an unusual problem. Rhino populations here are actually going up. So Safia and others at this overcrowded rhino sanctuary in central Kenya are getting a new home. Decades ago, 20,000 eastern black rhinos like this one ran free in Africa. But in just under 20 years, their numbers plummeted to below 400 as poachers hunted them for their precious horns. Now Kenyan rhinos are making a comeback, thanks to anti-poaching efforts. But overcrowding in sanctuaries has become a problem for the solitary animal. DR. ISAAC KELOLOOL, HEAD OF VETERINARY AND CAPTURE, KENYAN WILDLIFE SERVICE: When you get to these numbers, when they exit the current capacity, what happens first is you get territorial fights. So you find males killing each other. There`s also the pressure on the food availability for the individuals.",
