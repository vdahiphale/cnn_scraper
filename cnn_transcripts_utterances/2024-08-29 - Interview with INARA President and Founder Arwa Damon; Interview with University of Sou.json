Polio hits Gaza for the firsttime in 25 years, and Jeremy Diamond has a special report on the children who are suffering. Plus, how the lack of even soap is costing lives there. Humanitarian aid worker Arwa Damon joins us from the ground. And then, why the arrest of Russian Telegram founder Pavel Durov over accountability online. My conversation with New York Times London Bureau Chief Mark Landler and writer broadcaster Afua Hirsch. Also, ahead, from Shakespeare to The Lord of the Rings, legendary actor Ian McKellen has been firing up our screens and stages for decades. I speak to him about his new film, The Critic. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. In the occupied West Bank, warnings of, quote, a severe shortage of drinking water, which sounds alarmingly like Gaza, but in cities targeted by Israel's large-scale military operations there this week, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society says people are pleading for water and basic supplies. Israel's military says it's killed five terrorists, including an Islamic Jihad commander, as the U.N. secretary general calls for an immediate end to this operation in the West Bank. In Gaza, the level of need is deepening by the day. The World Food Programme has halted deliveries there after it said one of its vehicles was directly struck by gunfire whilst moving towards an IDF checkpoint. None of its employees were hurt. And now, disease is the latest danger for people in Gaza. In June, six sewage samples taken from there tested positive for the polio virus. In July, the World Health Organization warned that it was just a matter of time before the disease reached thousands of Palestinian children. And now, it has, as CNN's Jeremy Diamond reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  11-month-old Abdul Rahman is no longer the energetic baby he once was. He now sleeps most of the day, gently rocked by his mother, who is still grappling with how quickly he went from feverish and vomiting, to partially paralyzed. My child started to move and crawled at an early age, Naveen says, but suddenly everything went backwards. Suddenly, he was no longer crawling or moving or able to stand on his feet or even sit. Doctors delivered the devastating news earlier this month. Abdul Rahman has polio, the first known case in Gaza in 25 years. It is a shock for a mother to hear such news. Now, he is lying here in the tent in these unhealthy conditions. There's no treatment, no capabilities, and no supplements. The course of Abdel Raham's life cruelly twisted by the war that started just weeks after he was born, leaving him vulnerable to malnutrition, dirty drinking water, and missed vaccines. The fear now that Abdul Rahman could be the first of many.",

What we are seeing right now is a significant increase in diseases like hepatitis A. I went down to Nasser Hospital and the head of the pediatric department there told me that two children a week are dying just in that hospital because of hepatitis A. It also means meningitis is spreading. It also means that this horrific skin disease called impetigo, which is especially prevalent in children and highly contagious and can potentially be lethal because if left untreated, it can lead to kidney failure, which can lead to death is also all over the place. These are all diseases that can be controlled, which in return would empty up bed space in these hospitals to be able to deal with the catastrophic injuries that they're getting from the bomb blasts. But there's no soap. We go into these camps and families are begging us for soap. What do they use instead of soap? Well, one family I spoke to said that they were going down to the beach, getting sand, mixing it with a little bit of salt and lemon, and that's how they've been cleaning themselves for the last five months. So, if a ceasefire, which we've all been advocating for to be able to get more humanitarian aid in, obviously, hasn't materialized for the last 10 months, we are now trying to simplify it down to soap.",

And if that pause does not happen and if polio starts to spread, we are going to start seeing and hearing more and more horrific stories of more and more children ending up paralyzed of something that, again, is completely preventable. I do not have the words to begin to describe just how hard it is to provide people with even the most basic of items because things are not available. I just came back from a fresh vegetable distribution to a couple of the shelters that we work with, some of the families -- and we purchased this locally, by the way, because aid isn't really moving in, but commercial trucks are. We purchased some of these items at 20 times their original price. Either -- it doesn't matter because these families had not eaten a fresh vegetable for anywhere from five months.

And I mean, we can quote also, this week, the U.N. said humanitarian efforts ground to a halt because of new Israeli evacuation orders.

And I myself have, you know, moved around a couple of times in the last two weeks that I've been here. The problem we have with aid is the same as what it was two months ago, but significantly worse. We cannot access the aid that Israel permits to enter Kerem Shalom because the route that Israel designates for us to use to get that aid is basically run by looters and criminal gangs. And Israel is not securing that route, nor is it providing us with alternate routes. There are alternates that exist. We can use what's known as the fence route, where in theory Israel had at one point stated that it would allow 40 trucks to go through there, mostly trucks carrying medicine and fuel. These days, on a lucky day, and it's not even daily, you're getting about 18 trucks moving through there. Items that get into the north, through Eres, right now. So, that soap I've been talking about, those hygiene kits, they actually do get into the northern part of Gaza. But we are not permitted to move them from the north to the south.

Obviously, this is being linked to a bigger question about the accountability of tech founders for what happens on their platform. But the reality is, at the moment, nobody is being held responsible for all of the bad actors who have a free reign to use these platforms. Now, as a journalist. I'm not at all dismissive of the importance of having secure ways to talk to people. I'm sure we've all spoken to sources in countries that rely on platforms like Telegram, the only place they feel safe from their governments to express dissent and share information.

And so, one of the questions, for example, is Keir Starmer, within weeks of getting into government, faced these very dangerous riots, he clamped down on them hard. Some on the left might argue too hard, but in a true law and order, defending the rule of law. If Kamala Harris were to beat Donald Trump in a very narrow election, there's every chance that the U.S. could face that kind of unrest.

It's famous for human rights work, for protecting international humanitarian law, for fighting against war crimes, genocide. And that is his background before he became a prosecutor. It makes the fact that during the election campaign in the U.K., he took quite pro-Israeli stance, relatively speaking, all the more remarkable, because I think people had an expectation that he would be prioritizing the lives of civilians in Gaza, of whom, you know, tens of thousands have died as a result of this war. So, I think what we saw in the U.K. is a kind of normalization of the idea that Israel's right to protect itself was an acceptable -- that an acceptable price to pay for that was the deaths in Gaza. Now, it's even less surprising with Kamala Harris because her background is more as a centrist, more as a prosecutor and more as part of the Biden administration that was very pro-Israel.
