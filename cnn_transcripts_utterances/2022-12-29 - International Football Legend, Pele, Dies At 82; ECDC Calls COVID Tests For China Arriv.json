      "sentences": "Good evening, I'm Paula Newton from the CNN Center and we begin with breaking news.The legendary Brazilian footballer, Pele, dead at the age of 82. His daughter released a statement on Instagram saying: \"Everything that we are is thanks to you. We love you infinitely. Rest in peace.\" Now a medical report says Pele died due to multiple organ failure resulting from colon cancer. He had been battling that cancer for several months. Pele, though, really in terms of his legacy, quite simply changed the nature of football itself and is considered the original all-time great. That is the original GOAT, being the only men's player in history to win the World Cup three times. Don Riddell looks back at the life of this legend. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT HOST (voice over): When the world knows you by just one name, you have truly succeeded. Pele is regarded by many as the greatest footballer of all time, his humble demeanor and generous spirit have guaranteed his legacy as a global icon.",

Then I tried to be my best, I had to respect people. I tried to prepare myself, I try to be always in good shape. You know, the most important, respect for people. RIDDELL (voice over): Raised in the slums of Sao Paulo in the 1940s, Edson Arantes do Nascimento discovered football at a young age. He made his debut for Santos at the age of just 16 and within a year, he was scoring goals for the Brazilian National Team. By this time, he was better known by his nickname, Pele, and in 1958, at 17, he became the youngest man to play in a World Cup Final, scoring twice as Brazil beat Sweden. It was the first of three World Titles he'd help win for his country. He electrified audiences with his fancy footwork and ability to score seemingly impossible goals. So it was something of a disappointment that his 1,000th goal was a penalty.",

Patrick Snell, we will continue to check in with you. Now Brazil long ago declared Pele a National Treasure. I don't have to remind anyone, but he really belong to the world, right, to every football fan everywhere. Pele played for Brazil in four World Cups as we were saying and is the only player to actually win three. After a two-decade long professional career that included more than 1,200 goals, he went on to be an International Ambassador not just for sport, but for what could be achieved by such humble roots and they were humble playing barefoot as a child, kicking socks and rags rolled into a ball. But he became one of the most celebrated sports figures of our time, the undisputed king of what he called, he himself called the beautiful game. Now, one cannot overstate of course Pele's achievements nor his influence on the course of the popularity of the sport. Journalist, Stefano Pozzebon joins us now, significantly from Colombia on the South American continent, and so much reaction really now pouring in for Pele. And I know Stefano that you have had experiences like I have had experiences where you see children just come up on a random pitch. It's not even a pitch, they're playing in dirt. And you know that so many of them have the dream of Pele in their minds as they are kicking around any ball that could find.",

And still, he has remained relevant and an icon to this day, frankly. So really, for over 70 years. Another thought that I had just looking at these reactions that are pouring in about Pele is that he -- we often consider Europe as the capital of football, and the most talented players from South America normally go to play for rich European clubs, Real Madrid, AC Milan, Maradona played for Naples and Barcelona, Pele never did that. Pele went to New York to Cosmos to play in in the 1970s because he probably realized that it was time to open the frontiers of football, to bring the United States into the bigger football family all around the world. He truly was an Ambassador and an icon and one that really transcended the sport or transcended the football pitch. He served as Sports Minister, for example, in the 1990s with Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the first government of Democratic Brazil. So you can see a person that really was at the center, at the heart of the Brazilian nation, and there will be more and truly as a god, as an icon, as a true symbol of the 20th Century -- Paula.",

Stefano Pozzebon for us there in Bogota, Colombia. We will continue to follow reaction from the continent. Now we want to go now to Sao Paulo. These are live pictures outside the hospital where Pele died, where people are gathering. I want to say that in a statement, the hospital did say that he died of multiple organ failure. Again, the cause, colon cancer. He had been sick for well over a year and had surgery. His family, you know, right to the end, hoping that he would make it through, be able to emerge from that hospital or at least have more time at home with his family, but it was not to be. We continued to get updates from that hospital right there from his family as they showed pictures from his bedside. Again, that is in Sao Paulo, where Pele died in that hospital at the age of 82 from colon cancer, and we will continue to keep an eye on that for you as global reaction to Pele's death pours in, right. The government of Brazil has now tweeted that Pele was called to the Lord's team, declaring him of course, a Brazilian hero. The Brazilian Football Confederation simply tweeted, \"King Pele\" with a black and white image of the legend. Eternal, they say. Chelsea FC wrote that Pele was master of the beautiful game. And you know, really, they are too numerous to count the tributes that are coming in. There are some of course off the pitch. Olympic sprinting legend, Usain Bolt, posted an image of the two together right there. And as I said, we continue to have so many more tributes that are pouring in right now. Ian Stafford is the owner and founder of sporting club. He joins me now from London, and we're glad to have you with us and give us your thoughts. You know, we just had the reaction from South America. You know, Pele, what did he mean to Europe in terms of seeing a talent like that, who had had such powerful abilities and such longevity in the game?",

Copacabana Beach where they played football, where they honed their skills, so much because of the sand and the unforgiving terrain, the sea, the sun, the nice weather, that's for free. And that's what Pele had and that is all that Pele had, but he had this talent that was way above anybody else in his era. And so if you have that talent, and you have the belief, because behind the talent, you also had a strong determination, which shone through not just at the beginning, but throughout his life when he had political pressure, he had pressures from so many different strands. He was just a footballer, and he tried so hard. Don't forget, there was a revolution in Brazil. There was a coup d'etat, there was a takeover by the army, and the democracy of Brazil was shattered. And he was called upon to support this faction and that faction. And of course, all he wanted to do was play football. So you know what, when you look at the lack of facilities that he had, when people make comparisons, it's always one of those great public debates, you know, who was the greatest Formula One driver, the greatest golfer, the greatest boxer. When it comes to football, just imagine what that man could have done with today's technology, today's boots, today's diets, and nutrition, today's physical education.

They are finding 50 percent of the people on a flight test positive for COVID-19. You know, they're testing every single flight, and they're finding lots and lots of cases of COVID. And Italy has been through this before, they want to make sure that nothing bad happens again. They're particularly worried about the fact that people in China, the Chinese nationals, haven't been vaccinated with a vaccine that is as effective as those vaccines here in Europe and in North America, and that could lead to the emergence of a new variant and that's what concerns people here.

Now Russia aimed dozens of missiles at energy infrastructure and civilian targets right across the country. The ones that landed destroyed homes and knocked out power in several regions. At least three people were killed and seven were wounded. Ukraine's defense ministry says, Moscow, quote, \"dreams Ukrainians will celebrate the new year in darkness and cold.\" Ben Wedeman joins me now from Kyiv. And I know you've seen firsthand the effects of some of these strikes overnight. And yet, the danger again, right Ben? In the hours to come, you know, given how many incoming strikes Ukraine claims to have thwarted, what does that say to you about the battle ahead here and their efficiency in being able to, you know, thwart that Russian threat? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, certainly they did do relatively well, given that, according to the figures put out by the Ukrainian military, 69 missiles were fired at Ukraine; 54 were shot down, in addition to 11 drones. But there is always the possibility that, you know, the Ukrainian air defenses can be overwhelmed. And there are some reports that some of those early strikes did disable some of the air defenses. But certainly, 10 months into this war, the outcome is radically different from what President Putin perhaps was dreaming about. The Russians have lost large parts of the territory they controlled in the early months. And in some areas, they are still losing ground to the Ukrainians. But what we saw today was that, despite those intercepts, the missiles did hit targets, energy infrastructure, in the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. And in fact, I think behind me, normally the horizon, there are lights out there. There is still some parts of the capital that are without electricity. So, yes, the Ukrainians were able to stop many of the missiles from coming through but the Russians can still inflict pain, not just in this form of casualties but also in knocking out some of this country's ability to produce heat and electricity, two things critical in a country that, where sub-zero winter temperatures are a daily reality.
