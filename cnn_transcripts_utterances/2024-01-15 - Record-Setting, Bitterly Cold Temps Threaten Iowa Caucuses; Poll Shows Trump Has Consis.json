Minneapolis -- the temperature is eight below; the feels-like is 23 below. But Des Moines -- you're talking the feels-like temperature at the moment is 31 degrees below zero. Again, tonight in Des Moines, it's not much better. That temp -- feels-like temperature will be about 32 degrees below zero when folks are heading out for the caucuses. And it's pretty much around the state. Waterloo, Cedar Rapids, Davenport -- again, all looking at those feels-like temperatures at least 20 to 30 degrees below zero. One thing to note -- just to talk about how actually cold Des Moines is -- look at this comparison. The high temperature today in Des Moines compared to the high temperature in Fairbanks, Alaska. Yes, it's going to be colder today in Des Moines than it will be in Fairbanks, Alaska. Now, we've also got that cold air in place across the South and what that means is as this moisture moves in it's going to come in the form of snow and ice across many southern states that don't usually see weather like this. So you've got winter storm warnings for some of these places that could end up picking up three to even six inches of snow. That includes areas of Arkansas and Tennessee. Ice is going to be the concern for areas of northern Louisiana. But this system shifts off into the northeast. This could possibly end New York and D.C.'s snowless streaks in a couple of days.",

Iowa is gearing up for its coldest caucuses ever today. Let me tell you, I thought it was cold the last three or four times I did this. It ain't -- it doesn't have anything on what's going on here today. And look, I think the big storyline here as we head into the day is that Team Trump has really not let up, even here to the very end. We know that these frigid cold temperatures are really going to make it hard to convince people to come out into this weather. It's going to make it physically difficult. Gravel roads in rural Iowa are not plowed. The temperatures are, frankly, dangerous, especially if you are an elderly person, for example, it may be more dangerous. And those are some of the people that have said -- have told pollsters that they would support Donald Trump. But as I've talked to sources here on the ground, there -- they have told me that Trump supporters have been calling their precinct captains -- calling people that they know are going to show up and asking who has got a 4-wheel drive vehicle to get them to the polls. And I think it's really emblematic of what they learned from their loss here in Iowa in 2016. And it also shows you the effort that the whole team has -- the whole Trump team has camped out at the hotel -- Fort Des Moines -- down the road, including the former president himself who honestly hates spending a day away from his own bed -- his own home. So I think it's telling that he is here, especially in this cold weather. And, of course, the question -- the thing that predicts best whether or not you are going to caucus -- so, especially in a reality like this -- is if you have done it before. And that actually does give an edge to Ron DeSantis and his more traditional Iowa campaign. Those people are used to showing up. Donald Trump supporters are people that -- many of them are -- say they're going to be first-time caucusgoers for him. So, yes -- on the one hand, you have enthusiasm. But on the other hand, they're trying to convince them to do something new and that's never so easy in politics -- Poppy, Phil.",

Her background is really succinct to the current environment with all of the international issues going on. But we still see this stranglehold of Donald Trump. You talk about these evangelicals. I just still am amazed that they have stuck with him as long as they have. The math doesn't make sense, right?

And I think -- now, I think what we need to be looking at is how she does it. Does she -- you know, Trump continues to be weak with white suburban women. Does she pull those voters out? She's probably not going to get the evangelical vote, which is not just core in Iowa but core to any Republican victory in the presidential race. So, sort of, where she -- she -- also, a lot of her support we saw in that poll -- Democrats and Independents. Are Democrats and Independents really going to come out at minus 40 to change their registration and vote? So I think for her, if she has a strong second that can kind of slingshot her into New Hampshire where she's doing quite well -- I mean, obviously, Donald Trump very far ahead but she's actually -- she's leap-frogged ahead of the others. And then that gives her an argument for donors to continue to support her to see if she can actually be the alternative to Trump.

Instead, he danced at an Iowa rally despite his wife's request he stop doing that. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  You know what she said? \"Darling, I love you -- I love you, but this is not presidential. You don't dance.\" (Trump dancing) KAYE (voice-over):  There have been other 'only in Iowa' moments like this one from 2015 when Marco Rubio tried to have a friendly game of football with kids but instead, bonked one little boy on the head. If Iowa teaches candidates anything it's that voters are listening and what they say can get them into trouble. Like when Mitt Romney told caucusgoers in 2011 that corporations are people too.
