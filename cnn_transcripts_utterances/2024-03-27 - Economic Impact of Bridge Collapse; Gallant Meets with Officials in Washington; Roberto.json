Hopefully that economic impact is localized because we're talking about one of the biggest ports in the country that's been affected crippled. As a major employer of more than 15,000 direct jobs, 139,000 jobs rely on this - this port here. And again, it's been effectively shut down. This is a major hub of economic activity. It's the number one port for exports of coal. Number one for imports of sugar. It's a major port when it comes to farming and construction machinery, and also, of course, for autos. Last year alone, 850,000 vehicles went through this port. That was an all-time high. And a lot of major companies, household names, are going to be impacted because they rely on this port or the bridge or both, including everyone from Ford and BMW, GM Stellantis. We also know that Amazon, FedEx, Under Armour, they all have facilities nearby. And Carnival, that company has moved their cruises to Virginia. Another company, Domino Sugar. That refinery in Baltimore, it's not just a landmark, it's actually the biggest refinery for sugar in the entire western hemisphere. That's being impacted here as well. And listen, John, we all learned more than we ever wanted to during Covid about supply chains and about how if something breaks in one place, there can be stress everywhere.

The truck costs as well.And then when you think about the situation in Baltimore, of course, there's a lot of trucks and cars, more than 30,000 every single day that went over the Key Bridge. Now, most of that can get diverted. It can go to the tunnels. But not all of it because some of this is hazardous material. That can't go through the tunnels. I think that when we zoom out and we think about the big picture in the economy, it looks like the national economy, right, can be spared here because there are other options to this. Options. There's contingencies. We're not hearing about economists downgrading their growth forecasts or warning of price spikes.

He met with the secretary of state. He met with the secretary of defense. And he met with CIA Director Bill Burns, where the two discussed a potential plan to release - to get Hamas to release around 40 hostages in exchange for Israel to release about 700 Palestinian prisoners, something that Hamas really has yet to respond to and that the Israelis are waiting to see how - how it unfolds.But in terms of his meetings with Secretary Austin yesterday, look, the two sides still seem relatively far apart on how this operation in Rafah, in southern Gaza, is going to play out. Secretary Austin really emphasized the need for some kind of alternative to the plan that Israel appears to be weighing right now, which is kind of an all-out assault on Rafah, which would endanger the over a million Palestinian refugees who have taken shelter in the south as a result of Israel's campaign in Gaza. Austin really emphasizing that the Israelis need to think about a more sequential plan in terms of targeting senior Hamas leaders there, getting the refugees to a safe place, as well as fortifying the border between Egypt and Gaza so that Hamas terrorists cannot escape there. So, Gallant, of course, he told reporters last night that Israel still believes that there are about five Hamas battalions in Rafah and they need to eliminate them. And that is something that Israel has been extremely firm on. And so the two sides, we are told, they agreed to keep talking. They agreed to keep these discussions ongoing at a working level between the U.S. and the Israeli sides to figure out the best way forward here because, of course, really the safety of the hostages in Gaza and the safety of those, you know, 2 million Palestinians all across the Gaza Strip really depend on how this all plays out. And, of course, the U.S. and Israel, their relationship really he hit a new low point this week after Netanyahu canceled another Israeli delegation to the U.S. in objection to a U.S. Security Council vote that the U.S. did not veto. And so they're still trying to figure out the best way forward here. But as of right now it seems like they're just going to keep talking and hope, of course, that the Israelis take the U.S.'s advice about the best way forward in Rafah. Fred.",

We're learning a lot more today about potentially the timeline will be presented. The NTSB and officials say they are going to be able to board the vessel for the first time and actually interview the crew. A lot can be learned as a result. With us right now, Roberto Leon, professor of construction engineering at Virginia Tech, is joining us right now. Great to see you. So, with the NTSB and other investigators able to board the vessel for the first time, ask questions of the crew, what do you believe among the first questions ought - that ought to be asked, in your view?",

So, I'm not familiar with the Baltimore ones. But you did see that there were tugboats that took it out and basically put it on its way. And at that point, you know, the ship seemed to be in the right course.

And, in fact, try to track down exactly the source of the initial failure. And what human actions could have led to a worse result or to a better result.One of the things that we learned in accidents of this type is that human intervention is extremely important.

She was 25. She was spending the summer in Greece when she suddenly got severely short of breath. She jumped on a plane home. It turned out when she was seen by doctors she had had a heart attack at the age of 25. She had to have open heart surgery and they discovered that she had pulmonary arterial hypertension. Now, a while later she enrolled in a clinical trial of this medicine, who's experimental name was sotatercept. And she found over the course of a few years taking this medicine, she really started to feel like she improved, even dramatically. I think we have a photo here of her back in Greece a few years after starting this medicine, hiking up a volcano. So, she really credits it with this dramatic improvement in her outlook. Now, the FDA has approved this medication. This disease is a rare disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension. About 500 to 1,000 people in the U.S. are newly diagnosed with it every year. It typically affects women between ages 30 and 60, although not exclusively. This drug actually goes after what is sort of causing this disease. The arteries in the lungs start to become thicken and narrow, and that puts pressure on the heart trying to pump blood. And ultimately, over time, the heart starts to weaken. So, this actually goes after a protein that's important in that sort of narrowing of the arteries. There is a hope that potentially this could reverse the disease. We need more data on that. So far in the clinical trials we have seen that very many - fewer patients either died or had their disease worsen than placebo in the study. And, of course, they'll continue to watch the progress of this medicine as it gets out there on the market, guys.",

Well, you're exactly right, John, over the past few weeks Trump advisers have been asking current and potential employees at the RNC what their views are of fraud surrounding the 2020 election. And essentially, was the election stolen? And that's according to sources familiar with the interview questions. And they told me that they viewed it as an apparent litmus test for potentially being hired. And some of these people also described it as unusual for a job interview question. And, if course, it seems to - the impression they had is that it seems to be, are they questioning their loyalty to Donald Trump.Now, this new hiring question comes shortly after the Trump campaign and the RNC effectively merged their operations according to my conversations with Trump campaign advisors, as well as RNC officials. They essentially argue that they are now operating as one and the same. And I do want to just read for you what RNC spokeswoman, but an also a Trump spokeswoman she operates as well on both sides of this, told us regarding this reporting. She said, quote, \"candidate who worked on the frontline in battleground states or are currently in states where fraud allegations have been prevalent were asked about their work experience. We want experienced staff with meaningful views on how elections are won and lost and real experience-based opinions about what happens in the trenches.\" And that is from Danielle Alvarez, again, an RNC spokesperson, as well as a Trump spokesperson. And I do just want to take a step back here and give you some context around this, John. This comes as the RNC, one of their key focuses ahead of the 2024 election, is going to be on what they call election integrity and really focusing on potential claims of fraud in the upcoming election. Now, we know that Donald Trump, one of his key issues with the RNC over the past few years is that he did not like the way that they handled his false claims of fraud surrounding the 2020 election. And we know that that was part of the reasoning that he really, you know, his relationship with former RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel fractured. It was largely over this issue and how she handled that. And so, it's definitely a key focus for the new leadership at the RNC. People who were hand-picked by Donald Trump, including his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who's now the co-chair, as well as Michael Whatley. They're going to be leading some of these efforts.
