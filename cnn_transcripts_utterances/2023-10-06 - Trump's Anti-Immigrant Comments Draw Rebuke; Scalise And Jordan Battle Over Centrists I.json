We begin tonight Keeping Them Honest by taking a step back, a step back from what seems like a flood of words lately that the former president has said and followed by a flood of stories about those words and subsequent outrage that one side or another has about those stories. Before the whole cycle then repeats itself, and the latest outrage is forgotten, because it's old news by then. His former strategist Steve Bannon had a phrase for this. He called it flooding the zone with excrement, though he used a different word for excrement, and he considered it a feature, not a bug, a plus, and that it never gave anyone the time to stop, take a breath and take stock of what just happened or what someone just said. So tonight, we want to just stop for just a moment and give something that the former president said the consideration it deserves; to cut it out, if you will of the flow or flood of daily utterances, and I'm talking about what the former president said, the words he used during a recent interview with a right-wing outlet talking about migrants coming into America.

Mr. Jordan has been a longtime supporter, obviously, of the former president. He was served a subpoena by the January 6 Committee to answer questions about actions around the attack on the Capitol. He defied that subpoena. The other leading candidate for this speaker's job, Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise has been working the phones to his Republican colleagues, trying to convince them that he is the man for the job. Just to add to the overall chaos, both men agreed to a debate on Monday night and cancelled it after blowback from members. It is a fitting end to a chaotic end.

He is a congressman from Texas, and he said he is backing Jim Jordan because he doesn't want to go against Donald Trump's wishes. But this endorsement is going to do nothing to win over the moderates in the party who are going to be a key constituency in this race, and some of them are still deeply skeptical of Jim Jordan. So this Trump endorsement is probably only going to remind them of just how closely tied Jim Jordan is to the MAGA wing of the party. But Jim Jordan is arguing that his conservative credentials can actually be an asset because he can help corral the more far right elements of the party, the same elements that helped force Kevin McCarthy out earlier this week.",

The more burning question is, that's four minutes after she strikes him. That's three minutes after she sits still and then moves the car up 100 feet. Did she call anyone else? And that's why that third question, did they subpoena the phone records? Because what you want to know there is, was she texting while she was driving? Could she have been distracted?Was she on the phone or reading an email or answering an email? I mean, you want to know all that because it's a factor in a fatal accident. And the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office, which, you know, the Pagoda Police Department gave us all the records that they had the first day. And the last line and those records are the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office Accident Investigation Unit is going to subpoena those records. We asked all those questions yesterday. We got back an email that gave a description of their Accident Investigation Unit and said make a records request. At that moment, while they were telling us make a records request, the attorney general's office was in there gathering up those very same records. So it seems like a stall tactic.",

In fact, according to the NBC poll, what we see is that more voters today favor the Republican Party on immigration than at any point in NBC News polling history.

That's also nearly double, basically from where we were. We're about double from where we were during the 2022 midterm campaign.
