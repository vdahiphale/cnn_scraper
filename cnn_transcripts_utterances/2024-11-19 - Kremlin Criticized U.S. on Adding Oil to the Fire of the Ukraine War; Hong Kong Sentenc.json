The move sparked swift reaction from the Kremlin, which says the U.S. President is only adding fuel to the fire.All this comes as Russia ramps up its strikes on Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says at least eight people, including a child, were killed in a drone strike in the Sumy region Monday night. Mr. Zelenskyy, who met with troops in two frontline towns on Monday, says each new Russian strike confirms Vladimir Putin's true intentions that he wants the war to keep going.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: When you look at these missiles, they're actually a short-range missile, when you look at the designation of different ballistic missiles. And what you have to account for here is the fact that these missiles don't go beyond 300 kilometers. So they will basically affect anything that the Russians have within the border regions, anywhere from the Kursk region all the way down to the southeast, and even Crimea, of course. But these areas are going to be critical for the Russian effort to resupply their forces. They're going to be critical for the Russian effort, along with North Korean soldiers, to go into the Kursk region, parts of which Ukraine has occupied. So they're going to have a limited impact if they are used in quantity and the targeting is done properly. So that will be, those will be the two big ifs. Those can make a difference on the battlefield if they are used in concert with other strategies that the Ukrainians might have. So they could have a tactical impact that then would eventually cascade into a strategic impact for the outcome of the war.",

So the Russians may use an excuse to escalate the war, but the fact of the matter is that they are really bound by the confines of geography as well as their capabilities. They're bound from escalating in that sense. So it's going to be a tough thing for the Russians to respond to, but they're going to try to escalate it in perhaps unconventional ways, perhaps using elements of sabotage, cyber attacks. Those kinds of things could definitely be a possibility in the Russian arsenal.",

In fact, we've heard from Biden administration officials saying that they have had reactions from both sides, that they are having an exchange of ideas at this point. So certainly there appears to be some kind of optimism.We did hear from the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, saying that there is progress, but there is no agreement yet pointing out that both the Lebanese side and the Israeli side have indicated a willingness to get this done and to get it done within a short time frame. So certainly that is going to give some optimism that they're heading towards some kind of agreement. Of course one of the sticking points may be the fact that we understand from officials on all sides that Israel would like to reserve the right to be able to carry out strikes on Hezbollah targets if they believe that ceasefire is being violated. Something which we've heard from the Lebanese Prime Minister is unlikely to be agreed to. So at this point it appears as though what we've heard from the Lebanese Prime Minister, most of it has been agreed. There are just the final details to hammer through. But at the same time as we're listening to these officials talking about their optimism for the ceasefire deal, we're seeing an escalation in strikes against southern Lebanon and against, as you said there, just in central Beirut, at least five being killed in an Israeli airstrike there. And we've heard from the Israeli military as well that they have moved their artillery batteries from Israeli territory, firing across the border into southern Lebanon, into southern Lebanon itself. So certainly it does feel like an escalation. Just last week we heard from the defense minister that they were going to increase their ground operation in Lebanon itself. Now, we also know that there have been rockets and missiles fired from Lebanon into Israel itself in a Palestinian town in the north, at least one person was killed and others injured in a rocket attack. And so we are seeing on both sides that there is this continual escalation in hostilities, even at the same time as we hear that there could be some positive news when it comes to a ceasefire. We understand debris from an intercepted rocket wounded several people in Tel Aviv as well. And then just briefly on Gaza, we are seeing once again in northern Gaza more air strikes affecting people in that area, at least 50 having been killed in one particular, one of those attacks. We understand that at least 17 people of the same family were killed. This is the family of a cardiologist who was working at the Kamal Adwan hospital nearby at the time and we have reached out to the IDF for clarification on that strike. Rosemary?",

I mean, he's been focused on the departments that allow, that really could execute his threat of retribution and vengeance against those he thinks has wronged him. And the fact that he is putting, wants to put Matt Gaetz as the Attorney General and Pete Hegseth at the defense department shows that if those appointments succeed, there would be very few constraints. You would not see what you saw in the first term of officials at those critical departments resisting his plans to go against, quote, \"the enemy from within,\" whether on the legal front at the Justice Department or potentially with a sharper edge at the Defense Department.

And I think it's pretty clear from both the appointments that he has made and from his own statements that he's pretty much going to allow the Israelis to do, as he said once, whatever it is they need to do in these two conflicts.[03:44:54] From a Trump administration, you won't see the kind of letter that you saw come out from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin about a month ago, where they demanded that Israel allow in more aid to the Palestinians or run afoul of congressional legislation that could require a cutoff in weapons. Now, after they've done their review, they still haven't done a cutoff of weapons, and I doubt they will in the rest of the time that the Biden administration has left, about eight weeks. But for President-elect Trump, he's made it pretty clear that he does not plan to step in much on behalf of a settlement that creates a two- state solution. He's appointed a new ambassador to Israel, former Governor Huckabee, who has said at various moments that the Palestinians do not exist as a people, that the West Bank, is part of Israel, the list goes on. So it's pretty clear that he has put in a pretty pro-Israeli government, even pro-right-wing Israeli government set of representatives.",

A major security breach on Royal Land after thieves broke into the grounds of Windsor Castle in the U.K. and stole farm vehicles. CNN's Max Foster has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): You would have thought it was one of the most secure compounds in Britain, a base for all the U.K.'s senior royals. But that didn't stop burglars from breaking into Windsor Castle grounds. Police say thieves entered a farm building on the Crown Estate land late on Sunday October 13th, stealing a pick-up truck and a quad bike before making their escape. The farm just minutes away from Windsor Castle and from Adelaide Cottage where the Prince and Princess of Wales have a family home and they were likely there that night.",

And for their part, Kensington and Buckingham Palace both say they don't comment on security matters. FOSTER (voice-over): The break-in just days before King Charles and Queen Camilla's long flight to visit Australia and Samoa. The couple weren't at Windsor when the break-in took place. Incidents like this aren't new, and this one certainly not the most serious. In 2021, a man broke into Windsor Castle itself, wearing a mask and armed with this weapon, a crossbow. The 19-year-old was hoping to kill Queen Elizabeth II but he was stopped before he could harm her. Still, the incident raising serious concerns about security around the Royal Family.
