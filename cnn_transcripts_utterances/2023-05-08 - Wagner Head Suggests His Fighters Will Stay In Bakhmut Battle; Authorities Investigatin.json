And to the south, we're now learning that Russia has fired air launched long range missiles near the port city of Odesa. A food company warehouse and recreational area were affected, but there are no reports of casualties. Now, all of this comes as Ukraine accuses Russian forces of trying to exhaust the country's air defense system. Ukraine's military says Russia has been using a variety of missiles and air launched weapons against several regions in the past day.It says the regions of Mykolaiv and Kherson in the south and Kharkiv in the north all came under fire. Meantime, Russian appointed authorities in Crimea say their air defense forces helped fend off at least three Ukrainian drone attacks in the port city of Sevastopol. And a source now says the U.S. has high confidence in Ukraine's claim that it used an American made Patriot air defense system to intercept a Russian hypersonic missile last week. Now, meantime, to the front lines in the east, top commanders say Russian forces are increasing their attacks on Bakhmut as the Ukrainian military remains determined to keep Russia from capturing the city by Tuesday, when Moscow holds its World War II Victory Day parade. Now, Ukraine says Russia is doing everything possible to take Bakhmut, including sending in more forces. And those forces include Wagner fighters. Just days ago, the head of the Russian mercenary group had threatened to pull his men out of the fight because of a lack of ammunition. He now claims his fighters are advancing in Bakhmut as they wait for more supplies. CNN's Sam Kiley has our update now from Kyiv.",

This coming as the leader of the mercenary organization has backtracked on his threat to leave the city and hand over to Chechen fighters. This is very much part of an ongoing soap opera, effectively led by Mr. Prigozhin, who has been tweeting and making public statements since effectively the beginning of this war, highly critical of the Kremlin and particularly the Russian Ministry of Defense.He now says that he is getting the ammunition that he needs, so he won't be pulling his troops out for the foreseeable future. But all eyes really are on where and when or even if the Ukrainians are going to be launching a summer offensive. There have been mass troop movements. There is a lot of talk from the Ukrainians about an offensive, but no real signs yet on the ground that anything is especially imminent. Sam Kiley, CNN in Kyiv.",

We've had quite a few days, though, Wagner group leader, he made those dramatic threats to pull out of Bakhmut. Turned out it was quite a performance, right? It looks like his troops are staying put. Now, does this incident give you any insight into what's going on with either the Wagner group or the Russian military?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Paula, I think it's kind of the battle of the tantrums, if you will. And in this particular case, Prigozhin's tantrum seems to have won the day for him. In other words, he gets to get weapons and ammunition, gets a resupply line to, you know, his troops in Bakhmut that didn't appear to have that good of a resupply line, and he gets to stay in that horrible meat grinder. So in some ways, you know, it might, you know, be considered a victory for Prigozhin, but in other ways it's a pure victory because, you know, staying in that meat grinder doesn't do anybody any favors, and at least of all him. [01:05:19] NEWTON: Yes, but there seemed -- when I say that it's a performance, I'm, you know, not trying to be trite. It seemed that it was a message to someone and yet if you think all he wanted from that was ammunition, well, that would be pretty naive to think that.

And what this basically means to me is that Prigozhin let it be known that he has a military element that could be withdrawn and could potentially put at risk Russia's front line. And if that front line had collapsed, that would have been a calamity for the Russian forces. So what Prigozhin is doing is he's flexing his muscles in a way. He is in a position where he can, in essence, complain and make sure that he gets what he wants in this particular case, but he is basically vying for as much power as he can possibly get.",

And the only thing that's missing are the specific details as to time and place. But we believe it's going to happen this week. We believe it's going to happen probably in the south. And we believe it's going to affect the approaches to Crimea.So that is, you know, a major area that shouldn't be a big surprise to the Russians. But if the Ukrainians have learned mobility warfare, if they've learned combined arms operations, putting all the elements of the military force together in a coordinated fashion, then they could still achieve some successes, but they won't be as dramatic as they would have been had there been the element of surprise.",

They will need far more than that in order to mount an effective air defense and missile defense for their country.The other thing that, of course, is missing is required quantity of tanks and, of course, aircraft. The Ukrainians want the F-16. They're not getting the F-16 until after all of this is done, if at all.

He says that there was a 2007 Range Rover vehicle that was driving at a very high speed.

Now, according to this director, he says that he talked to some of the witnesses and that according to some of the witnesses, that this act was intentional. But I asked the director if based on his witnessing of this video, watching this video, if to him it actually looked like an intentional act. And he said no. He reiterated that what this video showed was that there was a vehicle that was driving at a very high rate of speed, that ran a red light, hit a curb, and then drove out of control. About the driver of this vehicle, according to Brownsville police, they have not identified this individual. This individual is not cooperating with authorities. This individual is under arrest, and they're being held on charges of reckless driving.

STUDIES: Well, it's unclear exactly what the scope of these conversations are going to be, largely because I think this was very ad hoc and last minute. Clearly, there's a need to get a genuine ceasefire on the ground so that we can enable better humanitarian access to people both fleeing the country and also remaining inside the country. So there's a whole host of priorities, not least of which I think we can't lose sight of the fact that, depending on how these talks go, that could set the country up for future political talks. And I think that most people on the ground in Sudan, as much as they want to see a ceasefire. What they're most interested in is a pathway towards civilian democratic rule.

Now, authorities say as many as 23,000 people have fled their homes since violence broke out in the past few days.The Indian army has been deployed and a five-day mobile Internet blackout is in force to try and contain the violence. CNN's Vedika Sud is following the developments for us from New Delhi. And it's good to have you on the story, and I will note thousands of troops are now on their way to the region. And when you look at the details of what went on, it is incredibly disturbing. What more do you know? VEDIKA SUD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Incredibly disturbing indeed, Paula. It's open, this violence is open. New fault lines in a state where there's already been a history of ethnic violence that has been reported for years and this is yet another one. There is uneasy calm in Manipur as I speak with you. This is a state that borders Myanmar as well. It's the northeastern state of India. And there were clashes last week -- intense, disturbing clashes between two communities. One is a predominantly Hindu community known as the Meitei community. It accounts for more than 50 percent of the population in Manipur which stands at over 3 million. And the other is a local tribe which is in the foothills of the region. Now what we do know is that there was a protest march that this tribe had taken out against the Meitei community's demand for tribal status. What that does, once you get tribal status, it gives you benefits, it gives you government jobs, the reservations in government jobs, in schools and colleges, in institutions for that community. Now the local community said that this is not fair because they are the majority population, the Meitei community is the majority population in Manipur and hence they should not be benefiting from reservations. While the protest was on there were clashes, it sparked those clashes between those two communities, which led to widespread destruction, arson, looting, deaths in that patch. Now we have reached out, CNN has reached out to the state government. We have asked them on direct questions on the death toll. We haven't got an answer from them yet. The army has come out and sent out a statement Sunday. They are worrying for (INAUDIBLE) by the Modi government. Now, what's also to be noted here is Manipur the state is also ruled by the BJP, Bharatiya Janata Party. That is the party that is ruled by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. What we do know from the army is that the situation is now under control, Paula. That is what we know from them. The chief minister has also tweeted to say the same. The chief minister is the head of state of Manipur. What we also do know is that there are these (INAUDIBLE) happening, flag marches happening, to ensure that there is peace in the region. But we had to independently go to those hospitals across Imphal, which the capital of Manipur to understand what the death toll stands at because the state government has not put out today yet. There has not even been a press conference from the chief minister of the state yet to his people. So we've got that figure -- 55 plus, that is the death toll, that's where it stands up for now. More than 23,000 people have been displaced, and they are placed in refugee camps across Manipur for now, Paula.",

So what we are seeing here is President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea trying to move closer to Japan. Now when it comes to things like wartime labor, for example, he has come under domestic criticism for trying to offer concessions to Japan without receiving anything in return. Some were hoping for another apology from Japan for the treatment of Koreans during the colonial period. Japan colonized South Korea and North Korea from 1910 to 1945. There wasn't a fresh apology which disappointed some. But he did show personal sympathy for what those victims would have gone through.
