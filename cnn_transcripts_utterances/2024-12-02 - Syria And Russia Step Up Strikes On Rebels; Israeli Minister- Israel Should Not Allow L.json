      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to what is the second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. For a special edition of the show, comingto you live from the COP16 summit in Riyadh, in Saudi Arabia. At this conference, the talk is all about fighting desertification and land degradation. Fitting debate for the Arab lands of the Middle East affected by the devastating impact of drought. But it's not just relevant for this region, it is important for every country battling climate change, because land loss sits at the heart of the climate and biodiversity crisis. All of this is linked. It is not merely a consequence of climate change, but rather, a driver of it, which explains the title of this event, this year: Our Land, Our Future. More on that coming up. I want to stay in this region and focus on a reignited conflict in Syria. CNN is hearing that Syrian and Russian jets are stepping up joint strikes on opposition forces in the northern part of the country. Syria's volunteer rescue group, the White Helmets, says air strikes on Sunday have killed dozens of people. This comes in retaliation for the sudden offensive that has cost the Syrian regime control of the country's second largest city, Aleppo. Rebel forces also say they are expanding their control across the country. They claim they've made significant gains in the northern countryside of Aleppo, capturing several towns and villages there. The rebels' lightning success, posing the biggest challenge to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in years. Well, my next guest is a Syrian activist, very well versed on what's happening in the country. He wrote recently, \"When the dust settles, one question will remain above all: who will fill the vacuum left by the weakening of the Iranian axis and Russia's distraction with the war in Ukraine? Can the U.S. or Turkey do much to influence events? The answer will shape not just Syria but the broader Middle East for years to come.\" Well, Ibrahim al-Assil is a political scientist and Middle East scholar. He is also a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C., and it is from there that he joins me live tonight. And I'd like to pose those questions to you, Ibrahim, but first, let's take a step back and set the scene. How did all of this what we are seeing today and in the past few days unfold? IBRAHIM AL-ASSIL, SENIOR FELLOW, MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE: Thank you for having me. It was really a major shock what happened inside Syria, because while it's not the first time that rebel groups enter a city in their opposition fighting against Bashar al-Assad, but it's the first time that we see the regime forces imploding inside Syria. It's the first time that Bashar al-Assad gets broken and defeated, not only in the eyes of the opposition, but in the eyes of his loyalists and supporters. The scenes of the -- of the Syrian rebels going into the city of Aleppo was a major shock for many Syrians and many observers. Aleppo is an incredibly diverse city. It's a huge city that's rich with culture. And what happened wasn't only a battle, it was a game changer.",

It's -- he is a major asset for them. However, this is not only about fighting on the ground. This is also about diplomacy, and we're going to see lots of talks between the Russians, the Turks, the Iranians, and possibly the United States.",

It should not, I think, intervene in any intra Syria fighting between different factions. However, it needs to support their -- its Kurdish allies so they remain inability to actually fight ISIS. So, ISIS doesn't get an advantage of what's going on and reemerge in the Syrian scene.",

      "sentences": "Ibrahim, I'm here in Saudi Arabia, which, of course, backed the opposition at the outset of the conflict, only to join other Gulf and Arabcountries more recently, in bringing Assad and Syria back into the fold. Now I just wonder how you assess the position and indeed role of the Gulf countries and other Arab countries in Syria's future, particularly given the fact that we are seeing Islamists in support of the opposition on the ground. Islamists, of course, no love lost between those groups, and indeed, Saudi Arabia, for example, the UAE. The architecture of this region is moving very rapidly. As how do you assess the position and role of these other countries now and going forward? AL-ASSIL: Right. That's a great question, Becky. So, the answer is two- fold. First, on the regional level, I understand that many regional actors, they do want to see Syria a stable country. They do want Assad to stop the smuggling of the Captagon outside of Syria to Jordan and then into Saudi Arabia. They want to see refugees being able to go back to Syria, from Jordan, from Lebanon and from Turkey. However, I also want to stress on the Syrian dimension itself and how all of this started around 14 or 15 years ago. Syrians do want to see a change in their own country, and we do have an international base for this, the United Nations Security Council 2254. That calls for a transition and calls for a credible non-sectarian government inside Syria. And I do see an opportunity here. While Assad lost Aleppo, and now, there is a talk about what kind of battle we will see in Aleppo, there is a solution for Aleppo to remain neutral. I do believe that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebels, should be pushed out of Aleppo, but Aleppo should not be handed back to Assad and his Iranian backers. Probably, Aleppo could be a start point to resolve the Syrian conflict by keeping the city neutral and allow Aleppans themselves to govern the city on a daily basis without being part of any military side in this conflict.",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, as you say, Lebanese leaders have been ringing the alarm bell regularly about whatthey perceive to be almost daily cease fire violations on behalf of the Israelis. And there is certainly a lot of anxiety, particularly, when you look at what's happening in Syria as well, that this is a fragile and fraught cease fire at best. And yet, people here, for the vast majority, are so desperately hoping that it holds. As of now, thousands of the 1.2 million who were displaced have returned to their homes, but there are many who are not able to. The IDF has placed an order that about 60 villages really close to the Israeli border are still forbidden. No one is allowed to return to those areas. They have issued regular warnings, telling people not to go to those areas, and warning them that they could be putting their lives in danger if they do so. There has also been a curfew in a number of these areas from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. Again, as you see the beginning of what I would call a sort of delicate dance, a highly choreographic -- choreographed transition that will need to take place over the course of the next 54 days, whereby, Israeli forces would pull back from their positions in southern Lebanon, whereby Hezbollah's forces would pull back from their positions to at least 25 miles from the border, north of the Litani River, and whereby, the Lebanese army will start to take control and to ensure that Hezbollah does indeed pull back from those areas. So, that's a lot of moving parts, a lot of things can go wrong. But as I said, the fervent desire of the vast majority of people here in Lebanon is that the cease fire will continue to hold. Obviously, it's been a tremendously difficult couple of months for people here, not just in terms of the cost, in terms of lives, nearly 4,000 people, but also in terms of the economic cost, Becky. Lebanon's economy already beleaguered, now battered, according to the World Bank. More than $3 billion worth of physical damage to buildings and structures and more than $5 billion in economic losses that have been incurred during this kinetic period of the last two months. So, very much a desire for that cease fire to hold, but it is a fraught and a lot of tension as people wait to see how it will unfold. Becky.",

As we sit here ahead of COP16, the land COP, what do you say to critics who accuse Saudi of turning its back on climate progress? AL-JUBEIR: I say, look at our actions. We have more than 80 initiatives domestically that deal from waste to energy, water recycling, planting of trees, redesigning our cities. And we have committed more than $180 billion in order to fund these invest -- these investments and these initiatives. We have adopted a pragmatic, practical problem-solving approach, non- emotional, non-political. We are not about grandstanding, we are about tackling this challenge and dealing with this challenge.

How often do people discuss or argue about agriculture or industry? No, they don't. Other countries, in the West, in particular, half the population does not want oil and gas production. The other half wants more oil and gas production, and none of them want higher gasoline prices. To me, this is hypocrisy. Contradiction in Saudi Arabia, a barrel of oil generates a fraction of the carbon it does produced in Western countries. We are one of the largest investors in the world in solar, in hydro, because we believe that the future demand for energy cannot be met by producing more oil. There's a limited -- there's a limit to how much you can produce, but there is no limit to how much energy the world needs, because you have more countries developing that need energy for development, and you have in developed countries, the need for more energy because of artificial intelligence and because of data centers.

We also saw him issue a tariff threat to both Canada and Mexico just last week, which actually prompted the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to fly to Florida on Friday, dine with Donald Trump and meet with him in person to talk over some of that. But look, there's a lot of conversation behind the scenes as well going on about this pardon in particular that Joe Biden has made particularly because many people close to the former president, now president-elect, are arguing that this is an example of their claims that Joe Biden has weaponized the justice system against Donald Trump and against their opponents. And what I've been hearing in my conversations with those on the transition team is that essentially they view this as an opening now to really gain more public support to carry out Donald Trump's agenda, including this idea of disrupting many government agencies and reforming places like the FBI, and that's what he's hoping to do now with his new pick Kash Patel, who announced he wants to be the next director.
