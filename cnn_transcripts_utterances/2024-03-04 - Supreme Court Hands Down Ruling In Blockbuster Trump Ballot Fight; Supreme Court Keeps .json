I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.And at any moment, the Supreme Court may release a major decision with major implications for the 2024 presidential election, less than 24 hours before the Colorado primary, the nation's highest court, could decide whether former President Donald Trump is eligible for the state's ballot and whether he can run in the general election. Some state election officials have objected to Trump appearing on primary ballots because of his actions on January 6 and are accusing the former president of being in violation of the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which bars any person who engaged in a rebellion or insurrection from holding public office. Let's bring in CNN Chief Anchor and Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash and CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig. Guys, as we're waiting to see what the Supreme Court decides here, let's do a little bit of a pregame because we don't want to presuppose what the Supreme Court is going to do. But, Elie, all weekend long, we were anticipating this could happen before the Colorado primary as part of Super Tuesday. And then yesterday, there was this indication from the Supreme Court that something is coming down, something is cooking.",

It sounded like they were going to rule that he's not disqualified.So, number one, how do they actually rule? And, number two, how narrowly or broadly do they rule? Do they rule in a way that will be narrowly confined to Colorado or will they rule in a way that's broad enough that will settle this issue across the entire country?",

The Supreme Court has reversed a ruling from the Colorado Supreme Court that would have removed former President Trump from the ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, the so-called insurrectionist ban.Now, this is very much what we expected based on what we saw about a month ago during oral argument. Justices on both sides of the aisle appeared skeptical of Colorado's argument that Trump could be removed by the state under the 14th Amendment. So, this is a huge win. It means that former President Trump will appear on the primary ballot. And this applies not only to Colorado, but also to states across the country, because as we've seen, many states have tried this way of removing Trump from the ballot. It was considered a novel, long-shot way to bump Trump out of -- you know, out of eligibility for the White House. But we've only seen Colorado, Maine and Illinois actually remove him. But here, the Supreme Court, as you know, the final word on constitutional questions saying, no, it is up to Congress, not the states to do this. So, an enormous win for former President Trump.",

It seems like they want Congress to actually make the decision because of ambiguity, maybe a little bit of vagueness. But this is very important because he was already still on the ballot, as you know.

But once you got that Supreme Court, a Colorado ruling, that removed him, it really seemed inevitable that the Supreme Court would have to take this up. Because even in states that had tried this and they didn't remove him, they left the door open. And without the Supreme Court clarifying this question, we would likely see litigation and arguably a lot of chaos and confusion throughout the presidential contest. So, this also, of course, applies to the general election. And for anyone that's confused, former President Trump will appear on primary ballots and assuming he is the nominee, as we expect him to be on the general election ballot.

And as you remember, the justices kind of stayed away from, A, mentioning the former president's name, but also this larger question of insurrection. Instead, it appears that they focused more on whose role is it to determine who gets removed from a ballot.

I'm just reading it now. Their concern was that the majority went further than they needed for this particular case and essentially is overfavoring Donald Trump. Ultimately, under the guise of providing a more, quote, complete explanation for the judgment, the majority resolves many unsettled questions about Section 3. That's Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, the anti-insurrectionist ban. It forecloses judicial enforcement of that provision, such as might occur when a party is prosecuted by an insurrectionist and raises the defense on that score. I mean, it's the language hints of what's happening with Donald Trump right now. So, I think that's their concern, is that the fuller majority has gone further.

This is not something -- I mean, some of them said it's because of the state law, but others just said that this is not the right way to go. That was not the case in Colorado and in Maine, and then just recently in Illinois. And even though there are some constitutional scholars, Jamie Raskin is one of them, the congressman from Maryland, who said that this is an appropriate avenue, others said, no, this is, never mind the legal part of it, just politically denying voters the right to vote for the person who their party says is their nominee is just bad politics, never mind the legal side of it.",

And they just think that he's just getting let off the hook, scot-free, left and right.But, I mean, let's dive into the legal part of this because you have to put those emotions to the side and talk about what's in this ruling and what the Supreme Court has done here on page six of the opinion where it says this, we conclude that states may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office, but states have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the presidency. It sounds like, Laura, what the Supreme Court is saying here is that Colorado can't decide what Hawaii and Oregon and Virginia, I mean, that they can't just do it and have that be sort of a blanket way of doing things across the country, that they can't force the hands of all of these other states. It sounds like what we were talking about in anticipation of this decision, that they were going to find an off ramp to not deal with the prickly question as to whether or not Trump committed insurrection and should be kicked off the ballot because of that.",

And they said that doesn't give the appropriate deference to the national consequences of a presidential election.And that's why we needed the Supreme Court to step in here. They will settle constitutional questions and also resolve disputes between states. This has been litigated at least two dozen times. We only have three states that haven't removed the former president, but we knew other states that opted not to remove him left the door open to re- litigate this. And without answering this question, this would have prompted a lot of chaos and confusion throughout the election, particularly if you had different outcomes would be very confusing for people. But I also want to get to Jim's comment about the insurrection. We saw in the oral argument, the justices didn't want to touch that question. They didn't even mention the former president's name. They did not want to get into the issue of what happened on January 6th, though in a month-and-a-half we will be back here dealing with Special Counsel Jack Smith's case against the former president, the efforts to interfere in the 2020 election. They will then have to look a little more closely at that issue as they contemplate whether former President Trump has immunity that would shield him from that question. So, anyone who's frustrated or feels like, in your words, Trump got away with engaging in an insurrection, it was clear the justices didn't view that as being the issue here. But when we come back in late April for the special counsel's litigation over questions of immunity, they may have to revisit some of that, some things around a little closer to that issue, though, again, he hasn't been charged with insurrection, though he has been charged connected with his efforts to subvert the election.",

Secretary of state is the one that you would sue to try to get a result you'd like. Other states may say, you know what, an allegation is enough. Others may say, I've got to have a criminal prosecution. And still, others may not have any way to decide this issue.

There has not been one prosecutor in the United States important to this decision has made a charge of insurrection, including Jack Smith.I think Jack Smith put together a pretty darn good case against the former president on defrauding the United States government, overturning the outcome of a valid election. It was a valid election. He attempted to -- the allegations of the attempts to overturn it. He's got strong evidence to show it from what we've seen from the testimony through the January 6th hearings and likely through the grand jury testimony that we're going to -- that will become front and center in this upcoming trial. We're not going to see that trial for some time, at least until this immunity defense is straightened out from the Supreme Court. I think the Supreme Court goes handedly against Trump on the immunity issue and rightfully so, but I think the Supreme Court got it right in this instance.",

And he can avail himself of those rights.But also, I think, Jim, the important thing here is these cases took a long time to break, right? So, this comes right back. Jack Smith's case didn't happen overnight. We went through an entire month of the Jan. 6 hearings, grand jury testimony, and then finally an indictment pretty late in the game. So, they knew when they brought this indictment that they were going to be up against it on a timeline and that there were going to be appeals, both interlocutory appeals, which are intermediate appeals that could be immediately taken up to the Supreme Court, and then appeals after the fact, after judgments rendered. So, that's part of the process. The justice system doesn't spin fast. This one in particular, though, given where Jack Smith's case was, when it was filed, is probably moving along faster than most other federal cases. Heck, in Philadelphia, we have a number of criminal trials that have been going on for four or five -- criminal cases that have been going on for four or five years in the political corruption realm.",

These opinions by the majority sweeps so broadly against federal officeholders in the future and any presidential candidate that it effectively makes sure that Donald Trump would never be held accountable under this provision and probably no one else down the line.But what happened because of how broadly they swept is that the three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, wrote about an oath-breaking insurrectionist. They incited that kind of a phrase, not specifically naming Trump as one, but certainly the tone is there. And it's strident enough that Justice Barrett, when she wrote separately, even though she didn't agree with how far the majority was going, she said, this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency. We should be taking the temperature down rather than bringing it up. But you can see why the liberals do this.",
