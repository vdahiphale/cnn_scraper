It's a new level of uncertainty tonight in the already volatile 2024 election. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We just learned that President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump had what is being described by the White House as a cordial conversation on the phone, that conversation just a short while ago. We're told the president conveyed his relief that Trump is safe after the apparent attempt to assassinate him. And this comes as we are breaking down all the new information from a briefing by federal and local authorities just a little while ago. CNN's Randi Kaye is on the scene for us in Florida and just filed this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Whether he was there earlier, our investigation is still looking to determine that. KAYE (voice over):  Ryan Wesley Routh may have been laying in wait from his spot in the bushes at Trump International Golf Club for nearly 12 hours. That's according to court documents unsealed today showing Ralph's phone was in the vicinity of the area starting as early as 2:00 A.M. Sunday morning. Prosecutors also revealed in court documents that the serial number on the rifle recovered from the area where Routh was spotted was unreadable to the naked eye. Just before 2:00 P.M. Secret Service noticed the barrel of a rifle poking through a fence at Trump International Golf Club. Trump was somewhere between the fifth and sixth hole at the time.",

But at this point with the second assassination attempt in two months they have upped the ante to the point that, to sustain this, they've literally had to borrow people from the presidential protection detail, PPD. So, basically, people who would be working the White House, Biden, his travel, have been diverted to the Trump detail simply because the president, now that he's not campaigning, is not making as much travel, as many trips, and is spending more time at the White House, so they can split off some of those teams.",

CHIEF OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE: Well, Wolf, I mean, many people don't know is the U.S. Secret Service has about 4,500 personnel sworn and undercover but they're spread out over about 150 offices. And so, you know, to secure a golf course, you would need a small army. And so I think that, you know, I want to take a step back. We've been very hard over the last few months on the U.S. Secret Service because of what happened in Butler. Everything that happened yesterday went exactly how it's supposed to. There was an advanced team. They were diligent. They found a threat. They thwarted that threat. They interacted with local and state officials who actually got a tip from the public. And so all layers of what's supposed to happen in terms of protection really occurred. You know, you've had people on today that talked about budget and authorities. I think that, as John just mentioned, increasing the former president's detail is going to be something that's going to be important. But he's out there, right? He's going to public events.

So, look, I mean, I think that just speaks to the, you know, very intense divide right now. But we all remember back to the Republican Convention when that unity sort of pledge and promise lasted about 20 minutes into his speech. And then we've not heard it since. So, I don't think this is surprising necessarily that it is a different moment. But to a person President Biden, Vice President Harris, Governor Walz, and other Democrats in the House and Senate reached out and said there's no place for political violence. So, the Democrats are basically saying the same thing that they did a couple months ago, but the Trump reaction entirely different.

I mean, you know, as an American, that concerns me.And so I think what I -- there's so much about what the president said that I find so disappointing, not the least of which he is ascribing motive to two people we don't know all of their motivations just yet, and that is part of the problem. Alex is right, this tinderbox, we are sitting on a tinderbox, and, unfortunately, the last time we were sitting on a tinderbox on January the 5th of 2021, we know what happened the next day.

That didn't last as long as we might have hoped.But here it seems not to have lasted at all. And he's already talking and blaming the Harris campaign for what has happened. It just makes me sad because there were two previous attacks in history where it really did change the tone of the race and of the person himself. When Teddy Roosevelt was shot in the chest, right, as he was about to deliver a speech. And the blood was coming out and he's still delivered the speech, 84-minute speech saved only by the spectacles and the speech that had been in his pocket. He really did change his tone. He talked about the fact that he would -- Wilson said he would give up the campaign until he was out of the hospital. He said no, go forward. It's important for that. And the last speech he gave, the only one he could give after the attack was not filled with invective. It didn't even mention his opponents. And this has been a really vitriolic campaign. So it did change the tone of that campaign. On the other hand, George Wallace, too, when he was shot in 1972 in the stomach and paralyzed from the waist down, he began to reflect on his mortality and he changed his whole attitude towards segregation. He talked about the fact that he'd been wrong. He reached out to the black community. He was able to win an election as governor again with 90 percent of the Black vote. So these things can have a change. I don't think its going to in this case for so far, it doesn't seem to be. You almost wish it had that it could change the tone of the campaign.",

So that it didn't affect much the approval rating of Gerald Ford. It's just seem they went on all they really did was they gave him a bulletproof trench coat, which he said weighed about 50 pounds and he hated to have to wear it. It's now in the museum, the Ford museum, along with the handgun. So this one I think is coming in a different time in a context where it just feels like how can this be happening again?
