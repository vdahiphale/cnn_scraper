      "sentences": "If I don't have that quote completely correct, I think my paraphrase is darn near accurate there. Does that reflect the reality, though, of what we're saying? If we take a look at the battleground state polls here, seven key states, Trump is ahead in four.He's also ahead in three, but there's no clear leader because it's within the margin of error, so it's a statistical tie in those. And that includes states that Biden flipped against Trump in 2020 when you're talking about internal polls, which I do need to note, CNN doesn't use those polls, but Democratic donors are looking at those. People inside the party are looking at those, and they're saying, oh my goodness, Biden is losing ground to Donald Trump in 14 key states. They are putting stock in that. Do you think the campaign is reflecting this reality in their language, a slight slippage? REP. AMI BERA (D-CA): You know, this was always going to be a really close race, and, you know, the Biden reelection would have had to run almost an inside straight, a perfect race. We forget that 2020 was less than 100,000 votes across a handful of states, so a slight slippage means you're losing. Can they make it back? You know, I don't want to base this campaign on beating Trump based on hope. I think we've got to make sure we get out there and put the best player out there and have an honest, objective conversation. It's not about one person. It's about holding on to the White House and preventing Donald Trump from getting reelected.",

I've known the Vice President for a long time, and she's a tenacious campaigner, and she's certainly been by President Biden's side.

And he said it brought him back to his own conviction about four years ago. He describes that as a surreal experience to have gone to Russia and then be arrested on these charges of espionage.Both he and Evan were both charged with that crime that both have been said is completely false. He said it's a really surreal experience to go through that. And so he felt a lot of sympathy and empathy, as he said, for Evan and for Evan's family to know exactly what it is to go through that. But he also expressed a good deal of hope that this development, this sentencing that has been widely condemned as a sham, could open the door for negotiations to bring both him and Evan home. In past cases with Brittany Griner, for example, or Trevor Reed, the Russians have wanted a conviction before they would move forward on any negotiations, on any potential prisoner swaps to bring these Americans home. So Paul sees this as a signal that perhaps those negotiations could finally get underway in earnest. And now I asked him whether he had any advice for Evan, having been in his shoes now that he has been sentenced to those 16 years in a Russian prison camp. And this is what he had to tell me.
