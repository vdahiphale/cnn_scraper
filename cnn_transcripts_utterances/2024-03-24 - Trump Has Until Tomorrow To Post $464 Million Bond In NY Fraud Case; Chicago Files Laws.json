And we've already seen what some say is the first step or the first sign that the New York attorney general is eyeing some of Trump's properties in New York, namely a golf course and a private estate putting in -- filing a judgment that does seem to indicate that she could move on to seize those assets if Trump cannot post a bond by Monday's deadline.Now look, there's also still the question of what an appeals court might do on this matter. Trump is asking the appeals court to intervene to allow him to post a smaller bond or potentially none at all. So that's still an open question. And the potential for intervention does exist. But Trump also has developments tomorrow in his criminal case in New York. That's the one dealing with hush money payments that were allegedly paid to porn star Stormy Daniels in order to allegedly cover up an affair she had with Donald Trump before the 2016 election. You know, that trial was supposed to start on Monday, but instead we're going to see a pretrial hearing where Trump's lawyers are going to argue that the case in the trial should be further postponed as they deal with some discovery issues. The judge has already indicated that that trial could be postponed until at least mid-April. But if the judge did not buy the arguments by Trump's legal team tomorrow, we could see the judge set a trial date for potentially as soon as next month. And if that does happen, that would be the first of Trump's criminal cases to go to trial and potentially the only one we could see go into trial before the 2024 election.",

Now two off- duty Indianapolis metro police officers were working security at a bar when the disturbance erupted into the parking lot and gunfire was exchanged. The officers involved are now on administrative leave as the investigation continues. This is the second mass shooting in Indianapolis in just a week.Now, nearby, the city of Chicago has filed a lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court to hold the gun maker Glock accountable for manufacturing and selling pistols that the lawsuit says can easily be turned into illegal machine guns with modifications called Glock switches or switches that are made by third parties. Now the lawsuit alleges these fully automatic modified Glocks are showing up across the country, and that Chicago Police have recovered more than 1,000 such guns in the Chicago area in just the last two years. So joining us to talk about this lawsuit and the growing problem of modified guns is Alla Lefkowitz. She's managing director for Everytown Law, the noted gun safety advocacy group. So welcome. Thank you for taking the time. Your group has described this as a first of its kind lawsuit. How so? ALLA LEFKOWITZ, MANAGING DIRECTOR, EVERYTOWN LAW: Well, it's the first of its kind lawsuit in two ways. First, it's the first lawsuit to use Illinois' Industry Accountability Law, which was passed last year to hold the firearms industry accountable for the consequences of a bad conduct. And the second wave of the first of its kind lawsuit, it's the first lawsuit against the major gun company for essentially knowing that it has this problem, that its firearms can be turned into machine guns, and refusing to do anything about it even though they know and we know that this problem can be fixed.",

The illegal aftermarket products are not Glock products.

They have known about this problem. They are refusing to fix the problem.And I guess what I don't really understand about that, about that approach to the issue is, if you are the company that is contributing to this problem, and know you have a fix that could result in less people dying, why you wouldn't make that fix?",

I'm essentially paraphrasing from JB Pritzker's office. But that's part of what you're alleging here, right? How does marketing play into your lawsuit? LEFKOWITZ: Well, I think it's the way that the firearms are made. The weight of the firearms are distributed, and the way that, of course, as you say, the way that firearms are marketed, one of the things that we alleged in the lawsuit, is there a couple of gun stores in Chicago or around the outskirts of Chicago that are known for, you know, engaging in illegal sales, and for -- and Glock, instead of cutting them off, has continued to sell through those stores, even though it knows that those stores are contributing to illegal firearms being found in Chicago.",

They've known that their pistols can be modified in this way. And they've known for a while that it can be fixed. And yes, that fix will likely cause a slight increase in price for the company. But that's not a good enough reason to make the fixed when so many people are being injured and dying from these machine guns.I mean, one of the reasons, you know, one of the things you'll see in our complaint that we took pains to point now is the real-life impact this is having on people. One of the stories that we highlighted in the complaint is a story of a family where there are two young kids getting gas at a BP station, and all of a sudden behind them a gun fight, you know, erupts, 61 shell casings. They had to flee for their life with their young children in their car. And our complaint is full of stories like that. So, again, you know, the goal here -- the goal of this lawsuit, and the point of this lawsuit is that Glock could stop this if it simply change, made simple changes to the way that its gun is made.",

And as you mentioned, we have not heard from Hamas yet on what their response to this is, so we will have to wait and see, but it does sort of set out quite a critical week, not just for the trajectory of this conflict, but it is also a test of American influence on Israelis as this conflict proceeds, and what you will see this week is two separate, but very senior level delegations coming from Israel to Washington to meet with senior American officials to discuss this conflict. The Israeli Defense minister left today for meetings in the beginning part of this week with his counterpart, Lloyd Austin, he will also meet with the Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He will meet with US National Security adviser, Jake Sullivan. So critical meetings expected to center around Israel's weapons needs as part of this war.

And you'll remember, Omar, last week, President Biden got on the phone with Netanyahu to tell him to send a delegation to the United States to discuss some alternatives to a ground invasion. Now since then, what you've heard from Netanyahu is really doubling down and emphasizing that that is the only way to go after Hamas, and that has caused a great deal of consternation here at the White House, including from the Vice President Kamala Harris who spoke about this issue today.

So it will say, oh, and also there is another side benefit. All the things that they uncovered during this CHEP, if they cooperate and fully work together with the FAA, they won't get safety violation dings. In other words, they won't get fined or enforcement action against them. So yes, in the short run, it is probably not something that they like going on, but in the long run, it could give them significant benefits in safety and also, they will get amnesty from their violations.",

But there is a federal law, the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which requires the Justice Department to do that. Now, then NTSB has complained that the records about this door plug repair are missing and that is very curious, it is very concerning because they have to keep records of that. So the FBI is the logical entity to go in and find out what is going on, why they are missing, if there was any sabotage or not, just because they're going in doesn't mean they will find anything. Remember, the FBI took the lead in the crash of TWA years ago, and it wasn't criminal at all. So once they do that, they will, if there is no crime found, they'll turn it over back over to the NTSB and they will proceed.",

Elisa Raffa, thank you so much.I want to turn now to the international gambling scandal that has one of the biggest names in Major League Baseball right at the center of it. The MLB is investigating after the Los Angeles Dodgers fired the interpreter of superstars Shohei Ohtani. Lawyers for Ohtani say his former interpreter stole millions from the baseball star to pay off gambling debts he had run up with a bookie in California where sports betting is still illegal. CNN's Camila Bernal joins us now from Los Angeles where the Dodgers are at home for the first time tonight. Sort of breakdown what is the controversy here? Why is this such a big deal?  CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It is a huge deal because of who he is. He is such a star, not just here in Los Angeles, but really worldwide and it has so many implications. Look, today was the day that so many Dodgers fans were looking forward to seeing Shohei Ohtani playing here at home in Los Angeles, but now what all the fans are looking forward to is tomorrow, because we are expecting Ohtani to address this controversy. We are talking theft, we are talking millions of dollars, gambling lies, and then now like you mentioned two investigations, the IRS and Major League Baseball. Now, I do want to say that the manager for the Dodgers spoke today and he said it was business as usual for Ohtani. He says that he is looking forward to speaking tomorrow. Take a listen.

And so the concern here or the questions that a lot of fans have is that the attorneys did not specify how those funds were stolen. Again, we are talking millions of dollars and the other problem that a lot of the fans have is the changing statements. So Ohtani's reps initially told ESPN that he was aware of this gambling problem and now they're saying that he had no idea, no clue what was going on. So again, a lot of contradicting statements and a lot of things that people want to clear up and Ohtani, hopefully will clear that up tomorrow -- Omar.",

He finally got out though, and I finally got to meet him as a free man. On Monday, he was officially exonerated by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He is legally innocent, and one of the most moving parts of tonight's documentary on \"The Whole Story\" with Anderson Cooper telling the story about the imprisonment and exoneration of CJ deals with the relationship between my 83-year-old father and CJ, and their correspondence, the letters they wrote each other since 2016.
