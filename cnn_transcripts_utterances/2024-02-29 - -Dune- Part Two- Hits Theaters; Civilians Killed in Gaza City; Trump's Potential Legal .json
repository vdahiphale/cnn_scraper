Obviously, the truck drivers tried to get out of that location. Clearly desperate people were in the way. We understand from the IDF that they did shoot at -- they said themselves, at some of these people in the legs. Well, maybe then they fell over. They were trampled.But the bottom line is that it speaks to a broader context that we've been warning about, reporting about, getting the expert witnesses, if you like, to talk about and explain to us over the last few months and certainly this week. Jan Egeland, who is of the Norwegian Refugee Council, spoke to me in detail on Monday about the risks of this looming famine in the north. They have been able to get no trucks there. And it's not because of lack of coordination. It's because there are checkpoints on the road. They say they aren't allowed to move past a certain position but by Israeli checkpoints. And they have not been able to do their job of getting aid to the nearly half a million who apparently are on the brink of a looming famine. He spoke to me about the dozens and dozens, if not hundreds of aid trucks that are waiting outside Rafah and trying to get in from Kerem Shalom, which is the Israeli southern Gaza checkpoint. And they just don't get there in time. They're constantly being picked over, you know, by the people who are checking them, and they're not able to get in. In terms of the quote/unquote looting that Israel is talking about. I specifically asked Jan Egeland how he would describe what he told me about voluntarily. Their latest convoy got in and yet it was so rare that, of course, people started to run after it and try to get what they could off it because they have had no aid. Officially, aid into Gaza has halved according to the U.N., in the last month alone. Halved. It hasn't increased, it's decreased by half, which means there are people who are starving there. So, I asked him, is this looting? He said it is not looting us. It is not looting each other. It is people, as we witnessed them, rushing to the trucks, trying to get whatever they can for their hungry mother, grandmother, niece, nephew, children. You get the picture. They are desperate. On top of that, according to the Israeli government and the Israeli armed forces, the only people responsible for security inside Gaza are the Israeli IDF. They have taken over Gaza. Prime Minister Netanyahu says this all the time. Nobody else should be in there, just the IDF. They are in charge of security. And I have witnessed enough food distributions from Somalia to Sarajevo under siege and all over the world to know that when you do this you have to -- you have to have proper coordination and security. The only people in charge of security inside Gaza are the IDF. And again, we've been warning about this in our interviews for the last several days.",

Overnight, the Supreme Court agreed to hear argument on the immunity claim that was already resoundingly rejected by lower courts in late April. That means Trump's federal election subversion trial that was supposed to start next month will be delayed.What we do not know yet is delayed by how much. And we also don't know how the Supreme Court is feeling right now about Donald Trump's name being on the Colorado primary ballot. A big question before them.

That case cannot go to trial in federal court until the Supreme Court figures out if Donald Trump has some sort of presidential immunity. If a president can be charged with a crime for something that they were doing while in office.The calendar there puts that case on hold, very likely until the end of the Supreme Court term, or sometime between April and June when they would decide. And then we have learned through the court that if they greenlight the case, if they say Trump isn't immune, and that he can be charged and tried for these allegations in federal court related to the 2020 election, the judge, Tanya Chutkin, has said that she would give them basically seven months from indictment to trial. So that would put us at her giving them as much as three months to prepare to go to trial. He does have one criminal case on the calendar already. It looks like its going to hold, at the end of March in New York related to falsification of business records, hush money payments to Stormy Daniels in 2016, and then there's a musical chairs of other cases, his Georgia case, and the classified documents case in Florida. A lot comes down to the supreme court there. Of course they're also looking at if states can decide what to do with this insurrectionist ban. The 14th Amendment, if Trump can be on the ballot, and if states can remove them, now it's going to be impacting three states as of last night, Illinois, Colorado, and Maine, which have all said they don't want Donald Trump's votes to count in their primary elections.
