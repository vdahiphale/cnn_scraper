That will be a Republican hold there. That is where Mariannette Miller-Meeks will win over the Democrat Christina Bohannon.And then in Wisconsin, Wisconsin 3 we have a Republican pickup with Derek Van Orden beating out Democrat Brad Pfatt. In New York's House race 2, we have a GOP hold with Republican Andrew Garbarino defeating Jackie Gordon. And New Hampshire 1 we have a Democratic hold there. Incumbent Chris Pappas winning over Caroline Leavitt. Also in New Hampshire, the Democrat there Ann Kuster in district 2 holds that seat against Republican Robert Burns there. Pappas will hold no. OK, so, listen, let's talk about balance of power. OK. Republicans are getting closer but they are still short about 218. That is the magic number. Let's go to the magic wall now and Mr. John Berman to see where everything is landing now.",

      "sentences": "So, the number you're looking right here, don't be alarmed. The 221 number four Republicans is where they're ahead right now. 214 is where Democrats are ahead. This would give Republicans control of the U.S. House but not in the numbers they were hoping for. This would be at the low end of the gain they were hoping for.Take a look at the competitive seats. The competitive seats there, you can see Democrats leading in 47 of the competitive seats. Republicans leading in 35. I would remind you, however, that Republicans only need to win 30 of the competitive seats to take control. Right now, they lead 35. So, they're doing what they need to do to take control of the U.S. House. There are some interesting stories as we go around the country. I think one of the most interesting stories -- and Democrats will be kicking themselves over this for some time to come -- is in New York. You can see 10 competitive seats here in New York. Republicans lead in eight. Lead or we've called the races for them and eight. Democrats lead in two. Those boundaries two years ago would have given Democrats an 8-2 lead in the seats. So, Republicans have completely flipped in these competitive seats and that includes for now -- we have not called this race or projected this race -- Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is trailing Mike Lawler in New York's 17th district. Republicans would love to knock off Maloney just for the bragging rights to knock off the DCCC chair. He is trailing 98 percent in. There's still some vote to be counted there but he's got to make up 3000 votes.",

      "sentences": "Well however, however, if you want to talk about that, look, Sean Patrick Maloney, he's going to take the blame for the bad redistricting for Democrats and New York. Funding election deniers let's talk about that. Because the most prominent race that that happened in was in Michigan's third Congressional district. Where indirectly Democrats backed election denier John Gibbs, right now -- in the primary. And Peter Myer who was a Republican incumbent who voted to impeach Donald Trump, he lost in the primary and Democrats may have helped get that defeat in the primary. John Gibbs won.But right now, the Democrat is leading there. So, it may have worked, right. That funding may have worked for the Democrats there. They may get a pickup, what has amounted to a pickup in that district. While we're talking about Michigan, let's also talk about Elissa Slotkin. You know, we call this race -- I believe we call this race -- 99 percent in. This is a seat Democrats desperately wanted to keep and they have. We call this race. She's got nearly 51 of vote. Liz Cheney, Republican Liz Cheney went out and campaigned for Elissa Slotkin there. A couple other places we're watching that I do think worth noting right now. In Wisconsin, this district -- which we just called for Derek Van Orden over Brad Pfaff -- what makes this interesting -- and this is the just that is now R plus. It's a Republican district by almost 5 points. Democrats had held most of this seat before redistricting. This was the one rural Wisconsin seat that Democrat still held. Democrats are losing control more and more of these rural districts that they had held historically. There just aren't that many left -- Don.",

Let me backtrack here just for people to see where we are in Arizona in general. You have Mark Kelly with the lead of about 6 1/2 points in this state with 66 percent reported right now.Victor was just talking about Maricopa County which includes Phoenix, his lead there is almost at 8 percent. Joe Biden won the district by 2. What Victor just reported, is that all of the election day, in- person voting now has been counted. What do we know about the vote nationally at this point. That skews Republican. So, in Maricopa County theoretically their best votes for the Republicans have now been processed and Mark Kelly still holds a lead there. It's a little quirky in Arizona is that they have a very robust mail-in ballot process. And you can drop off your mail ballots through election day. So, you can walk in rather than pull a vote in person. That counts as a mail ballot. Sometimes in Arizona what happens is the people who put in their mail ballots later also tilt a little bit Republican. So, it's hard to tell exactly how Democratic the remaining mail vote will be. We know the mail vote tends to skew Democratic. So, that might be good news for Mark Kelly. But that is interesting.",

So, I believe the votes we just got in is Lyon County which is the biggest of the rural counties. It's the third largest county, third most populous county in Nevada. But it only makes up 1.8 percent of the vote. You can see now 71 percent in. Adam Laxalt has got an edge of 8,000 votes. The overall statewide vote for him is now 22,000.

He talked to the unions, that's huge in Pennsylvania. Working class, right. Harry talked about this. And everyone has talked about this.He's been able to make that up for white working class voters, which is a huge part of the Democratic coalition. Has been historically. Trump won them. But for us, John Fetterman got them back. The other thing that I'm hearing and you know I'm really focusing on and tracking the Latino vote, Fetterman came out in support of so many of the policies that Latinos support. Latinos gave him 3 to 1 and gave him a big, big majority.
