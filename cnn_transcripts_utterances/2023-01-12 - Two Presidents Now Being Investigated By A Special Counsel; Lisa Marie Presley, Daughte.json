And by bringing in a special counsel to review the Biden side of this document saga, I think the attorney general has done exactly that.He needs to now resource it in the same way that he has the other special counsel. He needs to step away from it, not subjected to the sort of day-to-day oversight that you would have given maybe to a U.S. attorney. That seems to be the way he's treating Jack Smith. And I have no doubt that he'll do those things. But from this point forward, Laura, these cases will go, I suspect, in very different directions. They will follow the facts in the law.

That's been clarified post-Watergate and it's a very good clarification. So, the White House counsel should not be advising the president on what to do and not to do.

Well, former presidents don't take off a truckload of documents as he has.This is just a few documents. These things happen with some frequency, actually. And it's rare, unless there's some aggravating situation that -- where the documents and materials, secret material, the national security material has been misused. That aggravate the situation.

I mean, we say that a month is an eternity in politics. And I think that right now -- I mean, we saw the reaction to former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago raid where the base really rallied around him. And I think that in President Biden's case, I'd be surprised if this right now with the facts that we have pushes Democrats far away from him. I mean, right now, we're seeing Democrats in Congress say that they have faith in him, that they believe that he has handled the situation well so far. Of course, they don't like the fact that it gives Republicans something to hit the president with. We saw that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is saying that the House will investigate it although I thought it was interesting that he said he didn't think there needed to be a special counsel today. That was prior to the decision to the announcement being made. But again, you know, the White House is trying to say very clearly that this was a mistake. They used that word today.

And it gets really hard for Democrats to make this argument that we fully left behind the chaos of Trump and the disrespect for American traditions and intelligence committee, all of that stuff, if you have Republicans able to say, well, what about what Biden has done?

This is not uncharted territory for a president, but it's one that Biden hoped to avoid.BARRON-LOPEZ:  He did. I mean, to me, though, I think that the cases are very different. And at the beginning, they looked exactly the same because it's mishandling of classified documents. There's always typically should be a damage assessment in both cases, and we aren't sure yet if the damage assessment is underway in President Biden's case or not, but there likely will be one because of the fact that any time classified documents are mishandled or found in a place where they're not supposed to be found, a damage assessment is conducted. Now, then when we get beyond that about the potential for criminal charges, Trump's case is totally different. So, I think it's really important for the public to understand that because of the fact that Trump, even when he was still in office, there was a concern that he was going to take classified documents. The Archives were then alerted. \"The Washington Post\" reported that. In May of 2021, the Archives told Trump, hey, you have a lot of documents that you need to return. And for eight months, his team and he did not turn them over. Then they turned over 15 boxes. Then, the Archives said, no, there are still more. So, for more than a year, about a year and three to four months, Trump and his lawyers and his team refused to return all of the classified documents that they had, and that is why the FBI ultimately had to go search it. So, it's a very different set of events that happened and that is why Trump is potentially facing violations of Espionage Act as well as obstruction.",

She did not look as healthy as I've seen her in the past. She looked a little sallow. She looked a little curled into herself as she was walking by. That's actually when we saw her walking by right there, that clip that you see. She was walking a few feet ahead of her mother. Now, during the event, they were sitting next to each other, but she definitely just did not seem as robust as we've seen her before to the point that we had a little side conversation about it because it was so shocking how differently she looked.

Is this generational and is she doing something that is attractive to even younger voters?BARRON-LOPEZ:  I think some of the -- I think that the use of the term \"Latinx\" is generational. I think that -- you know, throughout my life, I've used the term \"Hispanic Latino\" interchangeably. And I know there are some older generation Latinos in my family that would only use Hispanic. When I have been out reporting, I've interacted with younger Latinos who like to use the term \"Latinx\" because they want to have a non- gendered term. The Gallup poll last year, I thought, was really interesting because it found that when you put Hispanic, Latino, Latinx, and then do you care, like, does it matter? Does it matter got like 57%, which is that Latinos don't really care, vast majority of them. Of course, the rest of the three Latinx did get the lowest number. I think, yes, this is -- you know, Sarah Huckabee Sanders trying to play to her base. It's something that Republican voters like. We saw -- but in a state that is a swing state and republic -- and states like Georgia, Herschel Walker was using a lot of anti-LGBTQ, anti- trans, saying, I'm not going to correct pronouns throughout his entire speech and he lost Georgia.

Even if there are conservative Hispanics that don't like the term, I don't think you should go as far as to then alienate a whole other generation of young Latinos who are living in your state. Why would you do that?Arkansas has seen 162% growth in the Hispanic community in the last 10 years. So, to me, it proves how unserious she is about governing, when you have issues like poverty, education, health care of which Arkansas ranks almost last, and those are issues that absolutely affect the Latino community.
