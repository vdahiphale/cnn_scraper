The United Center, the site of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, and we are getting new details about this unprecedented gathering, one that is completely different than what had been planned just four weeks and one day ago. That is when it became apparent that Vice President Kamala Harris would be the nominee. The theme of this convention is for the people, for our future. But tonight, the headliner kind of a reminder of the past, that past four weeks and one day ago, President Biden is the headliner tonight.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And we know he's been taking this speech incredibly seriously. He spent the entire weekend at Camp David, revising exactly what he wanted to say. And I don't think the weight of this moment is lost on President Biden. You know, he came to his first Democratic convention back in 1972. Then, he was a long shot candidate to become the youngest member of the Senate. Tonight is the end of that political arc. He's the oldest sitting president handing off to his vice president, his chosen successor.And I think his goal, according to Biden's aides, is to really present Harris as the best inheritor of the legacy and the best person to carry on what he started in office. Kamala Harris will be in this arena while Biden is speaking. She thought that was very important. But after that, the Biden's head off to vacation in California and essentially turn the keys of this convention over to Kamala Harris. And when you look at the program that Democrats have organized, you really do see this effort of two different themes. One is to try and reintroduce or introduce Kamala Harris to an American public that may just not have been paying attention until now. And she'll have a lot of help on that front. There are two former presidents on the speaking agenda, former first ladies, certainly a lot of high-profile Democrats to make the case for Kamala Harris. The other goal is to try and frame the stakes of this election and really make that warning about the risk of a second Trump presidency, and we are learning new information on that front as well. Democrats have given high profile speaking slots to members of the congressional committee that investigated January 6th, as well as a police officer who was injured in that riot. Of course, this will all culminate on Thursday evening, that high- profile address from Kamala Harris herself. She is working on this speech this week. Listen to what she said yesterday about her speech preparations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Essentially, it's much of what you've probably heard me talk about before in terms of just what I believe to be the promise of America and the fact that we're all in this and there's obviously a lot at stake, but there's also a lot to feel good about in terms of the future of our country. So, there will be a lot that is about what I believe is a way forward, a new way forward. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Vance, of course, looking to steal the spotlight, hitting battleground states every single day this week, traveling from Pennsylvania to Arizona and touching on a different theme every day. A senior Trump campaign official tells CNN, the message that we're trying to send, other than continuing to define Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, send a very clear signal that there will be no free shots on goal. If the Democrats are going to be out campaigning, then we're going to be out campaigning every single day. All right, our Kristen Holmes joining us now for more on what's happening on the other side, which is hoping to sort of steal the limelight. I don't know how successful they will be.

So, for example, this week, all of his events are at 3:00 P.M. Normally, they're in the evening. There's a reason they're at 3:00 P.M. They know they're not going to break through in the evening when those high-profile speakers, like President Joe Biden, like Hillary Clinton, are speaking. So, instead, they're going to try and seize the media narrative earlier in the day. So, let's take a look at where he's going to be Monday. He's going to be in York, Pennsylvania. This is being billed as an economic speech. Tuesday, Howell, Michigan, that is a suburb of Detroit. They're going to be talking about crime and safety. Wednesday. Asheboro, North Carolina. Thursday, he's going to be south of Tucson on the border there, obviously an issue talking about immigration. And then Friday, these are billed as two different events, one in Las Vegas, talking about the economy, and one in Glendale, Arizona. Now, of all of these, only that one on Friday evening is a rally. The rest of them are what are being called internally messaging events. These are smaller venues. These are smaller crowds and it is meant to keep Donald Trump on topic. Obviously, Donald Trump will do what Donald Trump wants to do, but they are trying to create a scenario in which he can at least give him the runway to stay on topic. Now, over the weekend, part of a very long speech that he gave in Pennsylvania was attacking Harris. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Her plan is very dangerous because it may sound good politically and that's the problem. And we have to be very careful. Because when somebody gets up and says, we're going to give you everything, $25,000 for a house, we're going to give you all sorts of little goodies, free health care, we're going to give you everything, universal health care, it sounds so beautiful.

And that's how he's describing this moment as an inflection point in these talks and perhaps the last chance for Israel and Hamas to reach some sort of ceasefire deal in exchange of hostage hostages. He has been expressing some cautious optimism, as have Israeli officials.But Hamas also last night as Blinken was arriving here, released a statement saying that Israel is introducing new demands into these talks, including about control, quite a sensitive issue, control of the border between Gaza and Egypt, as well as security movements internally in Gaza, Hamas describing that as new conditions in these talks and saying that Israel wants to prolong the war. So, the signs at this point are not quite as hopeful as the optimism we heard at the end of last week. Listen, it's a negotiation, John. Sometimes it could look darkest before the dawn. But the combination of that Hamas statement and this attempted terror attack right here in Tel Aviv certainly does not bode particularly well as these talks continue. Blinken will go from here to Cairo later this week to meet with the other parties. They are still making every effort.",

So, with this type of moisture held into the soil of places like Connecticut, into Massachusetts, even Vermont and New Hampshire, the threat of flash flooding still exists today. This is one of the scenes unfolding yesterday in Oxford. Just incredible to see that river of water just flowing over what would normally be a roadway.Now, some of the highest rainfall totals that we've seen in Connecticut, New York, they have top nine inches even approaching that ten inch mark in some locations. So, like I said, a lull in the activity. You can see how it's exited New York, Connecticut, much of Rhode Island. Just a few showers remain across Cape Cod and into Martha's Vineyard. And then we get a break, a bit of cloud cover. But later today, that's when things we expect to pick up in intensity once again. This is how much rain has fallen. You can see some of those pockets across Western Connecticut. That indicates anywhere from six to ten inches. That's why we still have ongoing flood warnings in place for that area. Look at the uptick in activity this afternoon and evening, right around that evening rush hour back home from work or perhaps dinner time tonight. National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center has a slight risk of excessive rainfall that could lead to flash flooding, so rapid rises in rivers and more waters over roadways as well. Kate?
