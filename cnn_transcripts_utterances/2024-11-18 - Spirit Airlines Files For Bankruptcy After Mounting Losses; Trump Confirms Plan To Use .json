      "sentences": "People really love to hate on Spirit, but the fact is that it really changed the industry in a really big way.First, I should mention, though, that we just got this message from Spirit CEO Ted Christie. This went to a lot of Spirit customers. He says that this will not be complete until the first quarter of 2025. So you still have some time to fly on Spirit and things should continue as normal. The big thing here about Spirit is that it ushered in the term \"ultra\" low-cost carrier, and that forced the major airlines to introduce the notorious basic economy fare. And bottom line here is that this could have big implications for every other U.S. airline. Pretty competitive industry. So this might lead to ticket prices going up on other airlines. Here's the good news, though. If you have a ticket or a credit on Spirit Airlines, you will not notice any change for now. Spirit insists in a statement this morning that \"guests can continue to book and fly without interruption, and can use all tickets, credits and loyalty points as normal.\" Also no impact to workers. We're hearing from Spirits flight attendants union that they will remain on the job. Their contract is still in place. No changes to pay or benefits, so no immediate job furloughs as we saw airline do at the beginning of the pandemic. Also, Spirit underscores that vendors will continue to be paid. Big questions now about what will happen to Spirit Airlines in the long run. Remember Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022. Just after that, JetBlue tried to do the same thing. But that acquisition of Spirit was blocked by the Justice Department on antitrust grounds. Frontier ended its merger plans with Spirit earlier this month, which led to this bankruptcy filing. No more apparent lifelines for Spirit Airlines. Saddled with about $3 billion in debt. And now it's really on passengers to pay attention here especially if you have a Spirit ticket or a credit, like I do. Top airline consumer advocates tells me that flights could be eliminated in the months ahead. So it's especially important to sign up for alerts, check in on your flight status obsessively online. The silver lining here, no real impact on Thanksgiving or holiday travel. Kind of hard to believe that the Thanksgiving rush is really just only a few days away now.",

But as Trump gets set to fulfill his campaign promise, experts in the food and agricultural industries are sounding alarms, warning that his deportation plans could lead to higher food prices. CNN's Matt Egan joins me now. Matt, this is something we heard economists warning, warning about during the campaign as Trump was making exactly these promises that there would be costs.

But what may surprise some is that mass deportations could make them go even higher.Now, the economic problem here -- and I know there's legal and moral problems too -- but the economic problem is that this is an industry that is heavily reliant on foreign workers. And, yes, many of them are undocumented. Just look at farms. If you look at crop farm workers, a plurality of them, 41 percent, are unauthorized according to the USDA. And I talked to a farmer in Michigan, and he told me that mass deportations would be devastating to the ag economy because there just wouldn't be enough people to pick the crops. But this is not just about farms. Undocumented workers play a key role across the food supply chain in everything from food processing to wholesale grocery, of course, and restaurants. A total of 1.7 million people are estimated to be undocumented in the food supply chain. Now we've reached out to the Trump transition, have not heard back in the past. They've argued that his policies will not be inflationary, and that inflation was not a major problem during his first term. Of course, that was before Covid. And economists warned that if you have fewer workers, it means less food. And, yes, higher prices -- Jim?",

And that's why they are relying on foreign workers.In fact, farmers say they need more foreign workers. They want more visas. They want to be allowed to keep the undocumented workers who are in the country now legally. They don't want them to be deported. Now, listen to this warning from Chuck Connor, a former Bush official, who's now the CEO of the National Council of Farmer Coop. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHUCK CONNER, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, NATIONAL COUNCIL OF FARMERS COOP: You take away from those workers, you're not going to have production. There's only one way prices are going to go. They're going to go dramatically higher. And when cows don't get milked, when apples don't get picked, when fruits and vegetables are not harvested, your supply is going to fall, probably fall dramatically. And that only drives prices up.

In a statement from President Joe Biden, he called the action, \"hostile to everything the United States stands for.\"Videos posted to social media show the masked group of about a dozen people parading down a sidewalk, with some carrying black flags with red swastikas. No arrests were made, but police briefly detained some of the marchers. In response, Columbus community leaders organized what they described as a pro-peace unity march on the same street. And this is coming after another demonstration in Michigan, where a group of people waving nazi flags demonstrated outside a community theater performance of \"The Diary of Anne Frank.\" The Anti-Defamation League says the Columbus event fits a recent pattern of white supremacist incidents. The group tracked 282 such events last year, marking a 63 percent increase from the year before. Columbus, Ohio, city attorney, Zach Klein, is with us now to talk about this.
