This is in Iowa; it's a big Republican Lincoln dinner. Of course Trump is dealing with these additional new charges in the Mar- a-Lago documents case.DeSantis is dealing with trying to reboot his campaign. CNN's Jessica Dean is in Des Moines this morning, where all of a sudden, Jessica I mean, this event was big to begin with, now it's got this supercharged feel to it.",

And so, that really sets the stage for tonight. When we have almost all of them here, as you mentioned, they're each going to be giving about 10 minute speeches pitching themselves to Iowa voters.And what we're going to be watching is do any of them start to change their strategy here? Does anybody start to directly go after former President Donald Trump who hasn't before? Or did they really stick to their stump speeches. And I obtained a memo from the Super PAC, that supporting former Vice President Mike Pence who has struggled to really gain some traction in this crowded primary field. They were talking about seeing what's happening with DeSantis is an opportunity for them that they want to position themselves in a more aggressive stance. The question is kind of can anyone effectively do that be it Pence or Tim Scott, Nikki Haley, and can they break through? That's what they're all hoping for tonight. But when Donald Trump comes to town, it usually sucks a lot of the oxygen out of the room. John?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Rahel, a really significant report from the Director of National Intelligence here, which is unclassified, but does have that assessment in it from the intelligence community that China is becoming an increasingly important buttress for Russia's war effort in Ukraine.Now, what the report says is that as of March, Chinese state defense companies have provided Russian defense companies with over $12 million worth of drones and drone equipment. And these companies these state owned companies have also provided Russia with dual use technology in terms of navigation equipment, jamming technology, and importantly, fighter jet parts. Now, these are obviously all things that Russia could use as part of its war effort in Ukraine, even if it is not necessarily lethal equipment, not necessarily weapons that the Chinese are providing to the Russians. But the report also details just the level of economic cooperation going on between China and Russia, saying that that has actually intensified since the war began. Despite efforts by the West to really dig into Russia's war chest tried to cut them off from the international community and the international economy so that they cannot continue to fund their war efforts in Ukraine. The report says that China has increasingly been sending semiconductors to the Russians. Obviously, those are chips that can be used in Russian defense technology that they continue to produce for the war in Ukraine. Now, the report says that it is difficult to determine just how much Russia or China is interfering with Western sanctions. But they do say in the report that they do believe that Chinese companies are helping Russia to evade the sanctions. Now, the Chinese did respond. And they provided a statement to CNN in which they said China does not sell weapons to parties involved in the Ukraine crisis and prudently handles the export of dual use items in accordance with laws and regulations. The Biden Administration has repeatedly brought up with the Chinese the fact that they're watching very closely to see what kinds of weapons equipment non-lethal and lethal the Chinese may be willing to provide to the Russians. The Chinese have repeatedly denied that they are doing so and say that they want peace. But obviously the U.S. is not necessarily buying it here saying the Chinese are actually increasingly supporting Russia's war effort, Rahel.",

Let's read the statement from the doctor at Cedars-Sinai, saying thanks to the swift and effective response by USC athletics medical staff, Bronny James was successfully treated for a sudden cardiac arrest. He came to Cedars-Sinai fully conscious at neurologically intact and stable.Mr. James was cared for promptly by highly trained staff and has been discharged home where he is resting. That doctor continues to say that they're very encouraged by his response resilience, family support. And we do want to point out that USC Medical Staff have experienced this before. Just last July another player Vince Iwuchukwu also had a cardiac arrest, same place also during practice. And according to the Los Angeles Times, and the team really got to him in a matter of 45 seconds. He took more than six months to recover.

They didn't give a timeline as to how long this investigation will take, but did say that they hope to provide their findings soon. And if you remember an office of the DOJ has already been doing work in Memphis. Way back in March, they started working with the Memphis Police Department. This investigation will run parallel to that work. And as you mentioned, it will look at use of force and stops by the Memphis Police Department to really you know, effectively to see if they participate or engage in discriminatory policing to see if they violated any constitutional rights or federal law. Now, it was at the announcement of this investigation that the U.S. Attorney in Memphis said that the city plans to fully cooperate with the feds.

There cannot be one rule of law for the rich and another for the poor. And there cannot be one rule of law for people who look like me and another for people of color.
