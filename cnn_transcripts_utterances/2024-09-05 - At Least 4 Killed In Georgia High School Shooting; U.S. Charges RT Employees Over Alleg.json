They should definitely have changes and more security and definitely more patrol. This should not be able to just happen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He will be charged as an adult with murder. It appears there's no known connection between the alleged shooter and his victims.

Indonesians, Catholics make up about 3 percent of the population. That is still 8.6 million people.

And this is not always easy because even among Catholic circles, there is tension about the value of inter-religious dialogue and collaboration. There are a number of Christians who have even opposition against Islam. So the Vatican is speaking as clear and strong stand that no, Muslim are not necessarily the enemy of Christian, not at all.
