All right, for 23 straight days now temperatures have exceeded 110 degrees in Phoenix and the record heat wave is showing no signs of breaking. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR KATIE GALLEGO (D), PHOENIX: The heat has been unrelenting in our community. We have to be innovative and that is the Phoenix way. We build for extreme temperatures in the summer so that we've made infrastructure investments that help us get out of these challenges but this summer has set some tough records. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Yes, there really is no industry that is immune to the effects of the extreme heat, especially when it comes to the most impacted, which we're talking construction and agriculture. These are industries where people want to work and need to work. There are many people that are out working in 110, 120 degrees because they need to make ends meet, and they're being reminded to take water breaks, to go in the shade, to stop working once they start feeling dizzy or sick in any way.And so there is that group of people that absolutely needs to work but then you also have to think when we're talking about agriculture that there are fruits and vegetables that need to be picked because otherwise the economic impact is going to be even greater. So officials in the most affected areas, say, Phoenix and Las Vegas, for example, telling people to remain indoors if they're able to do so. But again, keep in mind a lot of the people that are still working despite these temperatures, people in a food truck, for example, that can't be in a hot kitchen when it's 110 degrees outside, or think about your pets, the animals at the zoo, the people that actually who work at the zoo, and even people who work indoors who have to go to work, it becomes really difficult.

According to a local military official around 25 different architectural sites and monuments have been damaged. The worst was probably the Church of the Transfiguration. It's a cathedral that has a long history in Ukraine. It was destroyed in 1936 when Stalin was in power. It was rebuilt when Ukraine got independence.Remember, Fred, this is the fifth wave of incredibly intense attacks on Odessa in the course of the past week. They really started Monday night as Odessa -- as Russia pulled out of that grain deal that has seen Ukraine shipping grain to the world for the past year. And since then Odessa has escaped relatively unscathed. That is clearly no longer the case. At least one person was killed, as you mentioned. It was a security guard who was guarding the House of Scientists, as it's called, and now President Zelenskyy expressing his outrage, his sadness but also calling for better air defenses, more air defense systems from allies. He said that Ukraine needs a full-fledged sky shield and that would be the only thing that could defeat Russian terror -- Fredricka.",

And in that agreement, Prigozhin was supposed to go to Belarus with his troops. He has been seen in Belarus but he's also been seen back in Russia. We know that a lot of Wagner troops have gone to Belarus. We've seen them training Wagner soldiers. Interestingly, Fred, Lukashenko said that he is starting to be stressed by these Wagner troops who say that they want to go on an excursion westward towards Poland, which would obviously be a massive escalation. Poland being a NATO country. And so Lukashenko says that he is trying to keep the Wagner fighters there in Belarus. I should also note that Putin talked about the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive. He says that it has failed. Ukrainian and U.S. officials do admit that it's going slower than they would like and progress is not as much as they would like, but they still do have high hopes for the outcome of the counteroffensive -- Fred.",

He's wanted to convince people that he could take it over and remake it for the better, and remake it for the good. And so I think this is him just visually putting an anchor on that idea.The other thing is that Elon Musk has looked at this app as being mostly advertising supported, text based social media, and he's long said that he wants to broaden it. He wants to make it so that it has video streaming and payments, direct messaging that could do so much more than what it used to. And so in broadening it, I actually understand why he might want to rebrand some parts of Twitter. But again to rename the entire app, to get rid of the logo that people know so well, I worry for Twitter that that's a huge competitive mistake, especially as you have all of these unknown upstarts again like Macedon or Spill trying to come in and take Twitter's turf, to get rid of the one thing that you have going for you over everyone else which is over a decade worth of brand familiarity just seems so shortsighted to me.",

In fact most consumers who are using Google products they don't even know that they fall under a new parent company called Alphabet. Same thing goes for Meta. The Facebook app, that core blue app, remains Facebook, even though it's rolled up into a new parent company.And it's worth noting that even though Meta's rebrand came at a time when they are facing a lot of regulatory scrutiny, these types of rebrands came with new restructurings, meaning that they were reorganizing the whole company. What's happening here with Twitter is it seems like a fly-by the edge of his seat move in order to do whatever he thinks is interesting that day.
