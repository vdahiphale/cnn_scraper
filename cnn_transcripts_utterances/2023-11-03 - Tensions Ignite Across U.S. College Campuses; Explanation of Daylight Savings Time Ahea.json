      "sentences": "We have been working in recent years out here. We`ve done a few big projects. One ofthose projects involved mapping the bottom of Lock Ness. Now, we were using some very clever equipment. And using that equipment I can confirm to you all we did. In fact, find the Lock Ness monster. This is the very monster we found here. Well, not quite, not quite, I`m afraid because, because it turned out it was this. So it was actually built for a movie. But back in the real world, we`re going to sail out into the middle of the loch. You will get to see the size of Loch Ness. It`s fairly big, of course. Loch Ness is 23 miles long, but on average it`s only a mile wide and it`s deep as well. So right now we are 226 meters deep and 227 is maximum depth, big red dot. That`s going to be our monster. In 10 years that I`ve been doing this three times on the echo center in the big red dot. That would be my closest encounter with a monster.",

It didn`t deter monster hunter, Alan McKenna from organizing the biggest creature hunt for 50 years back in August. But the lack of concrete evidence over the years has done little to dampen the mystery for many.",
