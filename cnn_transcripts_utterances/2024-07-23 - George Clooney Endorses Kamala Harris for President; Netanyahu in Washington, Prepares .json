U.S. Vice President KamalaHarris is ready to put in the work and after just two days, she's already the presumptive nominee and hits the campaign trail. As the hostage deal remains elusive, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is in Washington to speak to Congress and meet with the U.S. President and Vice Presidents. And rival Palestinian factions sign a deal brokered by Beijing. What does the agreement between Hamas and Fatah mean for the Middle East? From uncertainty to clarity in a matter of hours, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has secured enough delegates to win the Democratic Presidential Nomination after a wave of endorsements from state delegations. And she's already in campaign mode, set to hold a rally today in Wisconsin and vetting possible VP candidates. Harris started out yesterday facing potential challenges after President Joe Biden's announcement that he's dropping out of the race. One by one, they started endorsing Harris leading to a surge of Democratic support and more than $100 million in campaign donations. The message from President Biden embraces the woman he hopes will succeed him in the Oval Office. MJ Lee has more on the stunning turn of events in the U.S. presidential race.

Now, Harris is essentially inheriting the campaign that belonged to President Joe Biden until he dropped out of the race on Sunday. And what advisors and people close to the campaigns have said is that they really want to ensure that these teams can continue to work together even as Harris likely will bring on potentially some new faces to this campaign. Yesterday, she spoke with staff at that Wilmington, Delaware headquarters, where she said that the campaign's Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon and the campaign Manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez would both stay on in those roles as she seeks the Democratic nomination. But there's also a likelihood that there are others who could potentially be brought in two names that have been floated around are Rahm Emanuel, the Current Ambassador to Japan, Former Chief of Staff at the White House as well as Mayor of Chicago. And another name is David Plouffe, who worked on President Barack Obama's campaigns when he ran for president. But still, it's very unclear how a lot of this will shake out. For President Biden's part, he has really tried to rally to Vice President Kamala Harris aside. Yesterday, he also called into that meeting at the campaign headquarters to really encourage his staff to come together in this moment, even as they really have seen this upheaval to the campaign since he dropped out on Sunday.

And that will certainly be the message he hopes to carry as he addresses Congress on Wednesday. But as you mentioned here scheduled to meet with President Joe Biden later this week on Thursday, he's also got meetings with Kamala Harris, on the books as well. And of course, relations between the U.S. and Israel long standing but relations between Netanyahu and President Biden have become increasingly fought in recent weeks and months as the war in Gaza continues. We've seen both sides take different approaches when it comes to foreign policy goals in Gaza. We've seen Israeli officials, including the Israeli Prime Minister vocally and publicly contradicting U.S. statements when it comes to calls for more aids to be led into the Gaza Strip and also crucially, when it comes to ongoing negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release agreement. So, we have seen those tensions mounting between the two despite that steadfast support from the U.S. to Israel. So, we haven't seen the U.S. pausing weapons shipments including the shipment of 2000 pound bombs to Israel following confirmation that they had been used in populated areas in the Gaza Strip. So, we've certainly seen some tensions in those relations and Netanyahu will be looking to solidify America support for Israel in his current visit, but whether or not President Biden can actually increase any sort of pressure on the Israeli government when it comes to that ceasefire negotiation process is questionable, given those relations that have become so fraught, but also given his announcement that he is dropping out of the race. Now, again, Kamala Harris won't be presiding over that congressional address. However, she is set to meet with Netanyahu later this week, as well be interesting to see what comes out of that meeting. And also, of course, what the reaction will be from both Democrats and Republicans to Netanyahu's address.",

But if we look over time, there has definitely been an interest from Beijing, in that part of the world as it deals with its own struggles within Asia, but it does see the Middle East as a place where it can establish itself as a political power player. Now as far as this most recent agreement between Hamas and Fatah, that is something that really began back in April when Beijing started to really help facilitate these discussions. But if we look even further back to the start of the Israel-Hamas war, China, as part of a broader effort to establish itself as an alternative to the west, really served as a leading voice for nations that didn't necessarily see eye to eye to Israel. And felt that there should be Palestinian statehood for -- calling for Palestinian statehood. So, we've seen this role of China before. Now, historically speaking, if we look at the Middle East, the United States has been a dominant player and a lot of experts have questioned if China has that same political clout. Well, if we look back in the calendar to last March, we saw China make a lot of headlines by helping to broker a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran after so much diplomatic friction, a story that I'm sure you are well aware, Eleni, from your vantage point in the Middle East. So, the bottom line, I think, is this China wants to establish itself as a power player, an alternative to the west, and it sees the Middle East as territory to perhaps lead that effort.",

But it would really be you've -- they can see where you're intending to move the joystick around the screen and engage with the system. They can't read your mind.
