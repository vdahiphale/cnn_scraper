Then they will travel to the Elysee Palace, where they will have a working lunch. The two leaders there are expected to discuss two issues in particular, in great detail, the ongoing wars in Gaza, where President Macron has broken with President Biden and the ongoing war in Ukraine, where President Macron, here in Europe has taken something of a leadership position, trying to galvanize the rest of Europe to spend more on their collective defenses, to produce more and manufacture more domestic weapons in their own countries, rather than outsource them and potentially have depleted supplies. If there is a potential that war moves past Ukraine into Europe, that is going to be one of the discussions that the two leaders have today and how to support the war in Ukraine for the long haul. They're going to be preparing essentially joint positions to go into the G7 summit next week and the NATO summit that will happen next month. We're also expecting them to discuss climate change, artificial intelligence and other matters of commercial importance. At that state dinner tonight, which has been moved to the Elysee Palace from the Musee d'Orsay, we expect luminaries from the business and diplomatic role to be on hand for President Macron to FET (ph) President Biden and a relationship that has deepened over the course of President Biden's terms. The two leaders had a very high profile falling out early in Biden's term, when he chose to essentially sign up with Australia and the United Kingdom to partner on the production of nuclear submarines for the Indo-Pacific, where a French contractor had previously been partnered to build some of those submarines. They were essentially excluded from that partnership, and it took several months to bridge that rift. Well now, after sharing a bond over several common goals, common themes, common ideals, the need to defend Europe, the need to secure Europe, and the need to essentially protect the West and Western ideology, they have grown much closer. But certainly, President Macron is keen to hear about President Biden's prospects for reelection and whether as President Biden has said, America is still back. Amara.",

Does his departure dramatically change the execution of the war by the IDF. He said that there could be more extremists who have louder voices within this coalition of Netanyahu's. What does the war cabinet without Gantt look like on the ground? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, good morning, Victor. I think it looks less moderate. And if you can use the term moderate in quotation marks, because the way the IDF has conducted this effort, it this war effort in Gaza, it doesn't look like it's a, you know, some in operation that they're handling with kid gloves. They're using brute force tactics in many instances. And as Ben described at the top of his report, there are, you know, still very major operations going on. So in the short term, the departure, the potential departure, of defense minister Gantz will not change those operations. And in fact, it could basically exacerbate the tensions that are already very high between the civilian population in Gaza and the IDF. So I think these are the kinds of things that we have to look for. I think that against this departure may result in an even less moderate approach when it comes to the conduct of the war.",

Obviously, new members joined and so forth. But you want to get to a point which President Biden thinks the Israelis are at right now, where the terror group cannot launch another major attack, which, of course, is just what the President said the other day. So Gantz has had much more of a direct channel back and forth with the Pentagon, with Secretary Lloyd Austin, the defense secretary, certainly with Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor and his departure is actually going to make it a little bit harder for the administration to talk to the war cabinet. They're accustomed against. He used to run the military. They consider him to be somebody who thinks in military terms, and it's going to leave them more dependent on talking than Netanyahu.",

So, you'll see a lot of great scenery. On the substance, it has been as you suggested earlier, Victor, a bit of a testy relationship. It started off badly when the United States went behind France's back, and did a deal with Australia for new nuclear submarines.

And they've had different strategies on Ukraine consistently with President Macron only recently, raising the suggestion that the West should be putting troops into Ukraine, something the president opposes.
