And Boeing's top quality control executives facing a second day in front of the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States about a door plug blow out. And the stock market in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now. We are midway through the trading week, and what a week it has been? That is what the futures markets are indicating on the opening back there half an hour from now, at 09:30 New York Time. Well, the prospect of a wider war in the Middle East is front and center today as regional foreign ministers meet in Saudi Arabia. Today's extraordinary meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation called at the request of Iran, which has vowed retaliation against Israel for the assassination of the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh a week ago in Tehran. Iran is presumably seeking backing for a response, even as diplomats worked furiously to de-escalate tensions. Well, an added complication Hamas naming Yahya Sinwar, one of the masterminds of the October 7th massacre in Israel, as the new head of its political bureau. We've got a lot to unpack here. CNN's Nic Robertson on the ground in Jeddah, at the site of that OIC meeting. Ben Wedeman is in Lebanon, where the Hezbollah leader is also vowing retaliation against Israel. Nic, let's start with you. Just explain the significance of the meeting where you are today, in Jeddah, and what could come out of this?",

I know Ben, having talked to sources that what is being taken into this meeting, and I know Nic will talk more on this when we get him back, is at the heart of everything that is going on in the Middle East today. The continuation of the conflict in Gaza, and much of the discussion around that table in Jeddah is going to be about how the international community can try and affect a cease fire in Gaza as soon as possible, which has been the sort of -- you know -- the at the crux of so everything else that we've been seeing of late? Hezbollah's leader has spoken to the importance of finding a cease fire in Gaza as well. He has also indicated that an attack on Israel is coming in retaliation for not only the murder, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, of course, a week or so ago, but very specifically, the assassination of a senior Hezbollah leader in Beirut over the past week or so.

Now during his speech, he also stressed that Hezbollah's goal at this point is not the destruction of Israel. It's to prevent an Israeli victory in Gaza. And he warned basically the entire Arab World that if Israel is allowed to be triumphant in Gaza, that it will be a problem for the entire Arab and perhaps Muslim World as a result. He also brushed off the American attempts to bring about some sort of end to the fighting in Gaza. He said it's sheer hypocrisy that, on the one hand, the United States talks about trying to bring about a cease fire in Gaza and perhaps even reconstructing Gaza at the same time that the United States has steadily supplied Israel with the means to conduct that war and certainly, that is something that is not just the opinion of Hassan Nasrallah. But across the Middle East, there is a feeling that the United States is being very hypocritical, that you see Secretary Blinken going across the region, meeting with everybody, calling for restraint. But at the same time that flow of weapons continues. Beyond that, the situation here in Lebanon continues to be quite tense. At about one o'clock local time this afternoon, four hours ago, twice, we heard the sound barrier being broken, not over Beirut itself, but close enough to be heard quite distinctly. As far as the situation on the border goes. Yesterday, it was quite intense. Six Hezbollah fighters were killed in Israeli strikes. And of course, as I was telling you yesterday, Hezbollah managed to fly drones all the way to Nahariya, which is about 10 kilometers south of the border. It appears to be completely unimpeded. Now, there are conflicting reports, but it seems that perhaps the Israelis fired some sort of anti-drone weapon at one of those drones, and possibly it actually hit a road that anti-drone projectile causing about 19 injuries. The situation is tense, but Nasralla's speech yesterday didn't necessarily signal a desire for an immediate escalation, an immediate escalation Becky.",

Alayna let me bring you inbecause many Americans have never heard of Tim Walz. So now the first order of business is to define him, and Republicans certainly trying to help out with that. They are painting him as dangerously liberal radical, a liberal extremist. These are some of the terms that they are using. From the Republicans perspective, I wonder what they genuinely believe Walz actually brings to the table for Harris? And apart from that language, which I've just described, how do you expect Republicans in the first instance, and very specifically, the Trump campaign, to go about trying to untangle any benefit Tim Walz brings to that Harris ticket?",

You know, they have beenstruggling over the last several weeks with how to define Vice President Kamala Harris? And so, they were very eager to try and jump out and get ahead of any sort of messaging on Walz, because they want to define him in the minds of Americans before Americans can make up their minds about him themselves. And that's how we're seeing them paint him. But I think you know in my conversations with Donald Trump's advisers, and what they'll tell me privately is that they recognize his appeal, that he is -- you know he's from a Midwestern state. He was in Congress more of a moderate Democrat, or, yeah, a moderate Democrat, I should say. He voted with Republicans to strengthen the border. He pushed for deficit reductions in trillions of dollars. He once had the backing of the NRA, even though the Trump campaign is now trying to paint him as someone who is anti-gun and anti-cop. I should note that the NRA ultimately later pulled their support of him when he became Governor. But they recognize that they -- that Walz could help her with the blue wall states. The states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, the ones that both campaigns believe that are vital to winning if they're going to be successful in November. However, they also believe that Walz has a lot of weaknesses. And they think that they have a lot of opposition research, which I know they have been compiling on him for several days now, that they can use to really needle him and criticize him on. And some of those things are focusing, I'm told, specifically on the last four years. He's been a Governor in Minnesota since 2019 but ever since he became Governor, he became more progressive. He signed one bill enshrining abortion rights into law. He's protected gender affirming care and gender protections and rights overall. He signed a bill to expand universal gun background checks, all things that they think they can point to. And again, this is how they're going to frame him. They want to make both Harris and Walz look like radical Democrats that they're far more liberal than the kind of presidency we saw President Joe Biden kind of rain over. And that's their overall message. Of course, they're really trying to figure out right now what is sticking with voters, particularly the more independent, conservative, leading Republicans. That is where we're going to see a lot of these tax unfold in the coming days Becky.",

Let's connect you to the United Kingdom, where I am today, which is bracing for another day of violence, with far-right groups set to turn out across the country. Police say 6000 riot offices are on standby as they monitor dozens of potential gatherings. Now the targets are reported to be immigration centers and law offices, with multiple rallies expected in London, something we've not yet seen during this unrest.

That's what we saw in 1987 which this bears a lot of resemblance to, Black Monday, 1987. If you try to look at what things fell the most, well, it would have been some tech stocks like Nvidia, Bitcoin and Japan. I'm not quite sure what the connecting thread is there.

The concern now is that the Fed and maybe other central banks are behind the curve.
