We'll share the losses for the next few years on any loans that happen to go south here.

And look, that's a sort of subliminal message, if you will. There ain't nothing to be afraid of in these big Russian tanks and heavy armor. And that's a message from the government. And that's certainly what you hear from people in these places that have been targeted. 34 civilians wounded overnight, five of them children when three Russian missiles managed to get through and impact in the country. No fatalities. But, you know, what we hear from the Russians is that they were able to hit all their targets. It doesn't add up. No surprise in that, that the Russian narrative is a completely at odds with reality. As you say, the missiles fired at Kyiv, none of them impacted to how Russia can claim that it hit its targets. There is, you know, defies logic that they say they hit their targets again. If they hit their targets, they were civilian houses in the south of the country.
