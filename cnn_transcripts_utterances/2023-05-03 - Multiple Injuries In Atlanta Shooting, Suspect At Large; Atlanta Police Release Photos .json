They have not found him. They're certainly deploying forces now, deploying police there, as you can see, showing the urgency of the situation. Police tweeted earlier in a statement that multiple people were injured. Our reporter on the ground said a number of those people have already been taken to hospital. We don't know the condition of all those people. We do know that at least some of them are in critical condition here. The situation on the ground remains urgent.

It looks like he's in some type of elevator.We don't know if this was perhaps before that shooting actually started. But this is the clearest picture of his face we're seeing from police because you don't see the mask. What that tells us is the police pushing this out as what they call a BOLO, a be on the lookout. They want the public if you see this person to contact law enforcement, obviously not approach this person. One positive development, if there's any positivity in any of this, is that, according to Ryan's reporting, the police know who this person is. So it's not like they're dealing with an unknown person. That's particularly important if he is able to flee this containment area. If he's already on the run, at least they have that identification. But we have not received the all-clear from police. We see from some of the images that the containment area is still up. Traffic control officers pushing people back. You have dozens and dozens of officers that are staged. One thing about a situation like this is that, for the police, it's all about control at that scene. We saw a number of tactical vehicles moving in, tactical officers. You know, based on the posture of law enforcement, it does not appear that the shooting is continuing or, in this era of shootings, we would see those officers headed toward the sound of gunfire. They're likely going through this facility trying to find this individual. And the fact you're talking about in the middle of a city with a multistory building that's a lot of ground police have to cover methodically. As they go through, you know, they're trained for this. What's called clearing operations, where you go floor by floor, room by room, you're looking for the individual. And until they find that person or they come to the calculation that he's no longer there, then they can issue an all-clear for that original area. But again, control is their ultimate goal right now. And if those SWAT officers are called in to try to make communication with the suspect, if they ultimately find him, they want time to be on their side. If there's not gunfire, they want to try to bring this to some sort of peaceful resolution to the extent they can.",

They basically squared off an area in midtown, closed it off to the public. We're also getting alerts from the Atlanta public schools, who are sending out alerts to have people lock down as well. So students are on lockdown in and around the area. As are, as we've been reporting, several businesses in lockdown as well. Still very much so an active situation that is deadly.

This is what a culture of which - you -- all of us are sort of together every day now, in terms of conflict resolution through guns -- because we don't know exactly what happened -- is leading to. Which is, of course, police departments responding and, in some ways, reacting to, say, Uvalde or some of these bad cases, are essentially just putting as much manpower, which has its own risk, and woman power, excuse me, onto the street.That is because you have to close areas. It's an urban area. You cannot have people out and about if you've lost the suspect. You have a lockdown. You have to have people run out of the way if the person's active. Then, as we now know, they -- the police department is being transparent. That immediate threat is gone. Now they're on a search. They're asking community members to -- or neighbors to figure out where he might be. I will say, because of the nexus between the mother and the place where the shootings occurred, that he may have a plan to have escaped. He brought a gun. He's with a sweatshirt. That might have been because of the weather. But this may have been something in which he comes in agitated, he has a gun, he has a weapon. One would assume that he wanted to use it or knew he could use it. And so this could take a little bit of time. But the communication has been pretty good. But unfortunately, we're getting used to this, which is, you've got to put a lot of resources out there. You don't know how big it's going to get given the weapons.",

That officially is still not the case. They are looking at that as well. But one thing is clear, and officially on the record we are hearing from APD, they are looking at this potential medical appointment as being the cause of the shooting -- Jim? KEILAR: And what we learned from Ryan Young, right? He reported the suspect went to this appointment and became agitated. And we don't know what specifically made him agitated. But that is what precipitated the killing, we now know, of at least one person who was pronounced dead at the scene and three other people who are now in the hospital, including some with critical injuries, as the authorities are still looking for the suspect who is at large.",

They continue to describe how they are outgunned, particularly with some of the high-powered assault-style rifles that we see on the streets.In this case, at least according to one of the photos police had tweeted out, it looks like the suspect was holding a pistol, at least according to one of the grainy photos. But nevertheless, the reason why you're seeing this level of tactical response is because these officers don't know what they're facing. I'll give you an example. Here where I am in southern California, we just went through a mass shooter training with local law enforcement where they basically took a college campus on spring break, turned it into a simulated war zone. I asked them why are you doing this? They said because we may be the ones that who have to respond to the next mass shooting. This is happening from coast to coast around the country. We see law enforcement having to continually plan for that. One thing I wanted to point out, and this gets to what Nick and Ryan were talking about earlier, and that's these lockdowns that happen every time we have one of these shootings, these violent incidents. I don't think we, as a nation, talk enough about the psychological impact these are having on people. Obviously, our thoughts are with this deceased victim and their families and the three who were injured. But think of just this ripple effect of all the people who are now in fear right now around that area, where you have schools on lockdown, you have shelter-in-place orders that have been issued, particularly since, right now, we don't know if the suspect has been contained or is on the run right now. And this isn't happening just in Atlanta. Obviously, we've been reporting on the situation in Texas where you had a days-long manhunt for a mass shooter. There's a manhunt on the way right now for a stabbing suspect in California. It's that ripple effect that happens where, psychologically, people are so impacted by violence, even if you're not at the scene.",

They've moved us several different times because they are trying to keep up a hard perimeter around this entire area.You can see just off the side here, you can see the heavy SWAT personnel vehicles that are in this area. We are a block away pretty much from the location where this shooting happened. If you look down this direction here, that is the corner of the hospital right there that everyone sort of focused on. I've been to this place before. Every different floor has a different sort of practice on the inside of it. And for those who know Atlanta at all, the midtown Whole Foods is one block over. There's a lot of focus on that building right now, and especially around that parking garage area. They really shut this area down to make sure all that traffic that usually comes here during the lunch period was also not in this area. So officers are obviously concerned about the foot traffic. High foot traffic in this area during the day that they wanted to get out of this area. Now, when we were on that block right there, we could see SWAT Units setting up in several different locations so they could get closer to the building. But obviously with the several different units, they're pulling them back and forth. No sort of active moment toward that building. Now I've been talking to my sources and got that picture early on of that man in the hoodie. I've also learned some new information in the last 20 minutes or so where I was told that the medical appointment was for the man and not his mother. I've also been told he is a military -- former military servicemember and they were worried about his mental health before this happened. And so that was the reason why he was being brought to this location, to be talked to and evaluated, according to my sources within the Atlanta Police Department. And after that, something agitated that man. I'm not sure anyone was aware that he was carrying that bag that apparently had a weapon in it. And then the shooting started. And once that shooting started, I'm told several people were hit and, of course, we're not sure of the conditions right now. There were nurses inside the building who started locking their doors with their patients. Several different people calling 911. The initial groups that got here, of course, were this Atlanta Police Department that was already training for active-shooting situations. Several officers armed with those extended rifles set up a perimeter on the scene and they were able to lock the situation down. And that's why they started getting that picture out because they wanted to make sure if someone was in one of these buildings that they didn't get surprised by this man. And they've also been putting \"push alerts\" out on iPhones as well to let people know this area is something everyone should be cautious of. I want to show you something, guys. This building right here, there are some residents in this area as well. So they were also concerned with all these apartment complexes, that they didn't want that man roaming the hallways of some of these apartment complexes. And that's why setting this hard perimeter at the time they did was so vitally important. And so that is the question right now, do they have him located in an area and they're talking to him? I know they're talking to his mother at this point. They're trying to get information from her exactly about his condition, what may have been going on in his life. There are several dozen other people who were inside that building who were terrified about exactly what was going on. They were calling 911. And then you have the massive police response from all the agencies in the metro Atlanta area to try to make sure this block -- midtown area was sort of cordoned off and shut down. You have all that happening and, at the same time, you have these SWAT Units setting up that soft perimeter as well so if they find out the location of this man they can move in if they have to. Not sure if he has more ammunition. Did he come prepared for this? So many questions about that part. But again, I was told from a source that this man was coming for a medical appointment for himself with his mother. There was a turn. Apparently, there was some intervention before. And now all these extra units have flowed in this space to try to lock this area down -- guys?",

That's how I'll say it.So when we were on this block right here, they made sure they pulled us off this block several minutes ago. So we've seen several different pockets of law enforcement in several areas. And then there was a focus of one building over there. So there was a concern at one point that he may have been moving to the building next door. That's what one of the initial calls was. I think there were some 911 callers that helped the police know what direction in which the man was moving in. One of the big questions now is, you saw him with that heavy, gray hoodie. It was cooler this morning. Did he shed that hoodie once he started running? And, of course, maybe that bag that we see in that picture will help someone see him and see that military style sling bag over his shoulder, and that would indicate to some whether they see that picture, whether or not they need to call 911. And I can tell you, the program here, in terms of people calling 911 has been pretty good in the early steps. There's a lot of people who were out here with their cameras shooting video. Iso 'm not sure what they've been able to gather from there. The command center is about two blocks over my shoulder in this direction. That's when they moved us off that point. So we can see a lot of people at the command center. I've been asking people involved, do they think they have him pinned down? No one can answer that question right now. And, of course, you can assume, if he entered a medical office, is he watching television and getting information? So maybe they're not giving the flow of information that they would want to tip some of their positioning off. And that could be the thing they're thinking about because obviously you want to think about officer safety and you want to think about the safety of the people who may be in these buildings, who don't even know that this active-shooter situation was going on just about a couple hours ago.",

I think this is -- what the source was telling me is the family was concerned for this man's mental health and that he was a former military member.What I was told is he was a member of the Coast Guard and served there for quite some time. And after serving there, something went sideways when he came back and his family was concerned. And as you can imagine, I think his mom wanted to get him some sort of help and they've been trying to get him to see some doctors. I feel comfortable saying this because the person who is involved in this is really concerned about this, the general area. They wanted people to know what was going on. That's how that started to build out from there. And then during that appointment, something was said and that may have tipped him off to a certain side. So we're still trying to put the nexus of this together, Jim. You know how this works. The flow of information comes in drips. And then, all of a sudden, it's a flow. What I do want to say, though, you see how quickly APD not only moved in but pushed out the information of that picture so fast because they wanted this entire neighborhood to know exactly what they were dealing with and what they were looking for. Instead of just giving a basic description of a black male, they put out a picture so you could see the fact that he is probably about six feet tall, looks like a pretty athletic build, was wearing a heavy gray hoodie, had the canvas bag over his shoulder, more than likely was carrying a handgun. All of those things sort of flow together. So if you saw someone moving in that sort of way, you knew how to handle yourself, maybe you call 911 and maybe you get out of this situation. Especially since there's a grocery store just about a block that direction, you would hate for an active-shooter situation to be happening one block over and then the guy runs down into the lunch crowds at the Whole Foods on the corner here. I think that's what they were thinking about in terms of putting this together. And I can tell you, the Atlanta Police Department has an extensive communications department and that's what they were thinking about in terms of getting that information out there. And then bringing in those tactical squad officers who train for this situation all the time, who are not normally officers on the street. And then you had the officers on the street, who were also set up for the active police situation who got their A.R.15s out, which many of them buy themselves, and set up a perimeter so the man couldn't extend this throughout the midtown area in the middle of lunch.",

I think Northside Hospital is on the top but every single floor could be a different practice. So we all understand that, at this point, and you hit the elevator and, of course, every floor might have a different doctor, right?

Again, at this point, we did just see those Bearcat vehicles move, the armored vehicles that the SWAT personnel were on. We don't know where they're moving at this point.",

The latest update from police, which came 27 minutes ago, a half hour ago, noted there had been no shots fired since the initiation of the shooting.What police have not said is whether they're making any progress as to the suspect's current location. Ryan Young, he's been on the ground. He's been talking to police sources. Ryan, tell us what's the latest you've learned?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I was talking to some sources and, of course, they were just sort of going through what the next steps are.And so, as I'm sitting here talking to you now, I'm getting several text messages from police officers in the area. They say, right now, they don't have him located in terms of the situation. But he could be in this several blocks area so that's why they're keeping this hard perimeter. That's what's been said to me at this point. As we work through this, of course, everyone is trying to figure out exactly what the next steps will be. And again, what they are being cautious about is nobody wants to give up too much information as this person could be watching television and/or, you know, hey, we live in a new world, they could be streaming on their phone. So they asked us to move back several different times. As you see, we are at the tape line right here. The police have set up a perimeter. We can't go past the perimeter. It's set up that way all the way around this like four-or-five block area that they're making sure they have locked down. So they set that up. Obviously, there are certain points where you can get a camera into and see a little further down. But also, we are being cautious. I don't know if they cleared the airspace just yet. But again, you have to start wondering, in a situation like this one, whether the person involved in this is streaming on their phone or listening to the continuing coverage to figure out exactly what's going on. So that's all a part of at least they were able to neutralize and stop the fact of the shooting going on in midtown at this point.",
