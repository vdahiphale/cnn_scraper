But as we've discussed all this week, lots of investors' concern over the relentless pace of recession forecasts - the rating agency now seeing a mild U.K. s recession, U.S. recession beginning in the spring. Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics will be along later to give his outlook the state of the global economy, of course, hinging on the situation in Ukraine. And that once again, is where we begin today's show. And just a couple of hours ago, a declaration by the Kremlin that it's imposing martial law in four regions of Ukraine that Russia recently claimed to have annexed Vladimir Putin making that announcement.

We don't know exactly what powers he's given to the regional leaders. We do know that as well as imposing martial law on those four areas of Ukraine that Russia earlier annexed. But which doesn't entirely control. It's also tightened restrictions around the border areas, between Russia and Ukraine. And so it's going to make it much harder, I suppose to access those areas. It's going to limit civil liberties in those areas as well. And tighten military control on those border regions, some of which have come under attack from across the border on the other side. And so that's sort of stretching this or expanding this martial law into Russia proper, as it were. And then, of course, that issue raised about the powers the unspecified powers being given to the regional leaders. They're still on disclosed. And I think there'll be various discussions about that in the hours and in the days ahead. But certainly, what we've seen as one tangible result of this announcement today by Vladimir Putin. Is that, in general, central control over the country has been somewhat tightened. We don't know to what extent but it's, we're definitely in a sort of more of a sort of, you know, it's towards the path of authoritarianism, rather than in the other direction.

Am I going to look at this now and go actually, you know what? I don't really think it's worth that price. I'm going to cut now my subscriber fee in half so that I can basically go down to the 699. Are we going to see more people do that? Or are we going to see more people burned come into the company who did not have Netflix before? That's the big question.

That was what was expected a strong revival from past quarters even before the launch of its cheaper ad supported plan. Context, as we always say is everything however; Netflix shares are still down more than 40 percent year-to-date.

Joining us now for the bigger picture Mark Zandi Chief Economist at Moody's Analytics Mark, always fantastic to have you on the show! You know what amid, so much recession discussion and timing and speculation one of the most popular questions I get is are we in recession here in the United States? Are we in recession? I hand it over to you a quick answer. MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYST: Thanks, Julia. A definitive no, we're not recession. I think you were just creating so many jobs and 300,000 jobs a month on average in recent months. That's just for context; we need about 100,000 just to maintain stable unemployment. So that's a lot of jobs. Unemployment is low, 3.5 percent and falling. Still very high number of unfilled positions, layoffs at record lows, people are quitting their jobs at a high rate, you just don't do that unless you think you can find another one. None of that is consistent with the idea that the economy is in recession now. Now, obviously, the risks of recession going forward are pretty high.

Because you talked about the prospect of inflation having over the next several months, we're talking about going from just above 8 percent to around 4 percent in what around six months or so time? What's going to be the mechanism that brings inflation down? Does it tie to those interest rates or to your point the risk of quite a dramatic softening?",

That's going to require a slowing and job growth, wage growth and, you know, careful kind of engineering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve. And that's why recession risks are so high, so eight to four, assuming oil prices don't go up and that obviously, that's a big assumption, given everything that's going on in Russia, Ukraine, the European Union, imposing sanctions, OPEC, so forth, and so on. So I don't mean to be pollyannish here, but if they stay around 90, we should get from eight to four, but it's the four to two that it's going to be more difficult.",

That's not easy, even in, you know, a reasonably typical time. But, you know, this is not typical, you got a lot of things going on here. The pandemic is still raging over in Asia last week and in Tokyo, and you know, you get a real sense that the pandemic is still an issue of supply chains and labor markets. And I, you know, mentioned Russia's invasion, that still, you know, a problem. And, you know, oil is still a big deal. So, those and those are just the known unknowns, what about the unknown unknowns that can come out of left field, particularly when the Fed is raising interest rates, putting pressure on the financial system, and cracks start to develop? You can see what happened in the UK a couple three weeks ago, when that the announced policies pushed gilt yields up dramatically and caused a problem in the UK pension system. That's just an example of the unknown, unknown so a lot of risk here. So I'm very nervous about the next 12 months.
