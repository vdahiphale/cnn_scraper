I'll be joined by my colleague Anderson Cooper in Tel Aviv.Right now, I want to show you these images just now coming in with these breaking news. We're seeing pictures from just moments ago in Gaza where explosions are lighting up the night sky. Right now, it's 8:00 p.m. in Israel and sporadic fighting has continued throughout the day following yesterday's shocking attacks by Hamas over air, land and sea. And now, some 30 hours or so after the initial attacks, now we're seeing new images here of new explosions. Officials say at least 600 Israelis have been killed since yesterday's attacks. More than 2,000 people wounded overall. Israel's cabinet now officially declaring war on Hamas one day after Israel's prime minister said, quote, we are at war. Sporadic fighting has been seen throughout the day and now these latest lighting up the sky, explosions taking place. One gun battle was captured on video by people caught in the cross fire. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (SIREN) (GUNFIRE) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As we've been driving along the roads near the Gaza border there have been scores and scores of tanks, reservists and troops all very much on the move and all very much on a stay of high alert. We actually had to turn around at one point because we came near to an area where there was clearly a firefight going on. And this just underscores how real the danger is here. It's just not a question of rockets. It's also a question of Hamas fighters who are still inside Israel, who continue to be able to infiltrate and the battles that Israeli forces are still waging to try to got rid of them altogether, seal off that border completely. We also saw a huge amount of building equipment be moved to try to repair the damage to the Erez border crossing.

The fact that no one really seems to have a good grip on just how many there are.We know it's a lot, though, and this will certainly complicate efforts when you're talking about a potential ground offensive or something to do with trying to really route out Hamas once and for all. How can you do that when you have potentially dozens of Israeli and also other nationalities as well, I should add, hostages being held in undisclosed locations in safe houses throughout this densely populated area? So it does become very complicated, and as I mentioned before, it's a very visceral, powerful tool of instilling terror and fear into people who are desperately looking for their loved ones, looking for answers who are, many of them still, too afraid to leave their homes. You walk around some of these area, Anderson, there's nobody out on the streets even when it's quiet because until many people hear the word from Israeli forces that all of these Hamas militants have been successfully killed or captured, they are simply unwilling to leave the shelters where so many of them are still hunkering in place.",

It is now in the 8:00 hour Sunday night in Israel and there are still -- there's still fighting going on, on the ground in areas in a number of locations, we are told, near the Gaza border in the south -- southern part of Israel, and obviously, offensive operations. We've seen explosions. You are looking at those images from \"Reuters\", explosions happening inside Gaza as Israeli forces and Israeli artillery planes are firing into Gaza City, a tightly packed city of some 2 million people. Israel has put out warning of civilians in Gaza to move away from these area and there are not a lot of places to go in Gaza ruled by Hamas organization and the United States has declared a terrorist organization and we've seen them strike terror into the heart of Israel in the way we have not seen probably since the Yom Kippur War in 1973, and even that is a rough comparison. We've seen large-scale hostage-taking of elderly people, young people, just sickening videos that of people being shoved into vehicles and bloodied and hands tied behind their back and being paraded through the streets in Gaza as crowds jubilantly rejoiced over -- over this. I want to go to our Sam Kiley, who's monitoring events out of London. Sam, the other big part of this potentially would be, as becoming a wider conflict, would be the involvement of Hezbollah from Lebanon. I covered the war -- the fight against Hezbollah back in 2006.

They're costly for the Israelis in terms of potentially lives lost of troops and they are quite costly for Palestinians in terms of casualties because Hamas hides in the civilian population. It's a densely populated civilian neighborhood. So to achieve the goals that the prime minister has set out, Prime Minister Netanyahu has set out to take out the leadership and the whole Hamas structures means going into the neighborhoods in Gaza. And that's very difficult to do without collateral damage and we've seen this when there hasn't been incursions, when it's just been air strikes by Israel to take out Hamas positions when Hamas has been firing rockets into Israel.There is an international -- there is an international condemnation of the Palestinian depths which puts international political pressure on the Israeli prime minister of the day to stop the hostilities. This is a magnitude different of much more complex situation for the prime minister. Not only will he face that international pressure as he goes after Hamas leadership hiding out among the Gaza civilian population, but there's also going to be internal pressure because Hamas has so many Israeli citizens hostage and it is very clear that Hamas will exploit that to the maximum degree, putting them on videos, putting them -- showing them under duress, threatening potentially if there's a ground incursion that those hostages will be killed. The scenarios are horrible to contemplate, but Hamas can and will likely play this out over a long phase. They've never been in a strategically strong position as this facing Israel because of the leverage of the hostages. So, at a political level, this is difficult. At a military level, this is something that the IDF can do, but ultimately they get into those civilian neighborhoods and there's a limit to how far they can go without causing unintended Palestinian casualties and without taking inordinate risks themselves because they enter neighborhoods that are not known to them, they are known to Hamas, and they can be booby-trapped and the buildings can be collapsed on them. It is -- it is a frightening for anyone here, scenario that it is presented, but politically for the prime minister not to exact a deeper, lasting blow on Hamas would be not to do that would be -- would be very difficult, as well.

The way that Hamas can play this out, I mean, Hamas ultimately wants to exist, wants to be a political and military threat in perpetuity to Israel and the longer they play out their control and holding of those hostages, therefore the longer they think they will be able to hold back any potential Israeli response.It's having to make this decision is an absolute poison chalice for the prime minister because there is no easy or right answer. If he holds back because Hamas says we might release hostages they will play that game ad infinitum just to secure their own existence five years, 10 years, 15 years. As you say, they can actually look at how many Palestinian prisoners they exchanged for that one soldier who was hugely valued by the family and the prime minister and he was low ranked. Now, they have many, many more hostages. This is a situation where Hamas holds a lot of cards and how Prime Minister Netanyahu seizes back the initiative and can he seize back the initiative here and that isn't clear and potentially this is going to involve multiple nations engaging with the Turkish prime minister, Qatar often gets involved, Egypt often gets involved, can they engage and help Israel here? I would say the situation is too dire and too hard for them to be able to resolve it. Hamas is going to want to keep these hostages absolutely as long as possible because that, you if will, you know, is the thing that will protect them the longest, Anderson.",

The secretary of defense announcing that for the purposes of deterrence, in order to deter additional threats to Israel and the region, he has directed the movement of the USS Gerald Ford carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean and it includes U.S. Navy aircraft as well, as a guided missile cruisers, as well as guided destroyers as well as additional fighter aircraft squadron. So, all of this is being moved into the region again as a deterrence measure. In addition to that, the Defense Department has announced they will be providing additional munitions to the Israeli defense forces to help support their fight against Hamas which the Israelis said they expect to be a long and hard fight. So the Biden administration making clear here that they are moving to support Israel fast and in any way they possibly can and showing a sign of strength, a show of strength there in the region to deter any potential future attackers. Now, President Biden spoke to Netanyahu today and he did tell him that all of is assistance was on the way, but pretty significant force posture changes in the Middle East just announced in the last few minutes by the secretary of state of defense again as part of a broader deterrence in the region, Anderson.",

It started to come down a little bit no although having said that I can actually hear some booms in the distance and certainly, you are not seeing any civilians out on the streets at all, Anderson, but what you are seeing is a huge amount of military activity. You can probably see behind me here, you've got some armored personnel carriers, but just driving around the roads by the border with Gaza, a huge amount of weaponry, a huge amount of military hardware and a huge amount of troops who are presumably being put in place, whether that's for some kind of an incursion or whether that's for the ongoing battles that are still taking place to try to be rid, once and for all, of these Hamas militants who have successfully infiltrated through the Gaza border. We also saw a lot of heavy building materials, trying to repair the Erez Crossing, the huge breach where so many Hamas fighters were able to come into the country. We saw fire fights going on. This is still very much an active situation with the IDF worrying about not just what they're going to do inside Gaza and how they're going to get those hostages back and how they're going to deal with the problem of Hamas' leadership inside the Gaza Strip, but first and foremost, how to deal with the situation here in southern Israel which is still incredibly tense, volatile and dangerous, Anderson.",

A short time ago, the Israeli ambassador to the U.N., with very strong language and using video and graphics, called this a barbaric pogrom carried out by the deadly savages of Hamas. He showed a picture of a grandmother from Israel who he says was taken by Hamas and brought back into Gaza, a grandmother who survived the Nazi Holocaust. The other pictures and other pages that were shown were also dramatic as he tried to show why the Security Council should act in favor of Israel. But it doesn't seem like it's going to happen today.
