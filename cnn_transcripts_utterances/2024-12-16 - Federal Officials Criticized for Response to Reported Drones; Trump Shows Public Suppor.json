Up to this point, even earlier, like an hour ago, I mean, you had a great interview, you know, with the former head of NORAD, who kind of put it in plain terms about what it is. And it's probably a little bit of everything. Right? It is recreational folks up there with drones. It is commercial drones up there. It is copycats. Because guess what? I want to be famous, too. So, I'm going to throw a drone up. There were drones over, over where I live, and I live within -- you know, between three military installations. So, wouldn't be surprising if -- if they were to put up drones there. But on its face, let's just say this is absurd. It is absurd that, all of a sudden, where are these drones coming from? And the federal government can't tell us. MATT GORMAN, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: It's a word salad, right? As you said, you have Mayorkas. What he said, and Himes, he said, one was plain English. The other one was just evading the question, not having, really, any answers. And again, that's completely ridiculous on its face. And you're absolutely right. It's -- is it a mix of people trying to also find the drones with other drones and adding to the thing? Right. So, I think this is -- is -- is certainly like you step back a little bit, and you wonder why people lose trust in institutions, right? Lose trust in what the government is telling us, from COVID to now, is they don't feel like they're getting straight answers from the government. They're like -- I think you put it very well.
