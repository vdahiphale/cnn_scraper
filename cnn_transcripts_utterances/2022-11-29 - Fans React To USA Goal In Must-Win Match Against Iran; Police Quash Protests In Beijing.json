This crowd was just ready to erupt, and they got that chance in the 38th minute as Christian Pulisic was able to get a goal for Team USA, and that was important because Team USA cannot tie this game like they did their first two.

US markets have struggled for direction today stocks falling again, after sharp losses Monday over worries about China and global supply chains. The Dow Jones has whipsawed throughout the day. Traders are looking ahead. Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, he is going to be speaking tomorrow and we`ll get jobs data on Friday. Global markets caught a brief reprieve on signs China may be changing its COVID ways, but that optimism may be short lived. The Beijing government is vowing to strike hard to maintain order, and there are signs of that on the streets of Beijing. Police flooding areas where there had been gatherings of protesters at the weekend. Beijing is distancing itself from the issues that sparked this crisis three years of severe restrictions on movement. China`s health officials are blaming local governments for the way lockdowns have been imposed, and authorities reaffirm the government`s commitment to Zero COVID.

The Chinese powerful Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission issued a statement calling on authorities to \"Resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as criminal activities that destabilize social order.\" It appears there is no message of tolerance or compromise for people who came out into the streets to voice their opinions, and I think that`s being reflected in the shows of force that we`ve seen with police flooding the streets of the capital, Beijing, Monday night where there had been protests the previous night; also flooding the streets of Shanghai, erecting barriers to stop people from being able to congregate. And eyewitnesses say, stopping pedestrians in Subway stations searching their phones and we`ve even seen some video evidence of this. One eyewitness saying that phones were being searched by police looking for images of the protests, or apps or VPNs that allow people to circumvent the great Chinese Firewall, that system of censorship that prevents Chinese people from being able to use things like Google or Facebook or Instagram. While this crackdown is taking place, we also saw some signs of attempts at protests in the Eastern city of Hangzhou, for example, where videos emerged showing police detaining people in a Central Square Monday night. We`ve also heard from top health officials who are kind of tacitly acknowledging the enormous burden that the COVID restrictions have put on society, with top officials calling on authorities to lessen the length of lockdowns. We`ll just have to see if they actually follow through with this as China continues to count tens of thousands of new cases of COVID-19 a day in a country where the government says COVID shouldn`t exist at all.

In the final minutes of the World Cup showdown, the final score and fan reaction. The news headlines this hour: (MUSIC PLAYING) KOSIK (voice-over):  The United States is taking on Iran at the World Cup. The winner goes through to the knockout stages. At the moment, the USA is up 1-0. There is another Group B game going on, England versus Wales. So far England`s leading 3-0. The U.S. is considering sending the Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine, a senior U.S. official told reporters. The official said the system would be intended to support Ukraine`s air defense capabilities against Russian attacks. President Joe Biden says he is confident the U.S. can avoid a crippling rail strike if Congress intervenes immediately, voting to impose a labor agreement on rail workers. Without legislation, the walkout is set to start in less than two weeks. (MUSIC PLAYING)",

The sudden move may unnerve advertisers who fear Elon Muskwill let misinformation and harmful content run wild on the platform. In a tweet, Musk claims that Apple has already pulled most of its advertising. He also claims that Apple threatened to yank Twitter from its app store. Apple has not commented. Twitter`s former head of safety will soon speak at a conference in Florida. Our Donie O`Sullivan will be there. In the meantime, he joins us now from Miami. Great to see you, Donie. What exactly does it mean that Twitter will be dropping this misinformation policy on COVID-19? Is it going to be like the Wild West? DONIE O`SULLIVAN, CNN TECH CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, a lot happening with Elon Musk`s Twitter, especially these past 24 hours. What we have learned overnight is Twitter is removing its COVID-19 misinformation policy. They have had that policy in place since 2020, basically banned posts that they viewed as dangerous misinformation about the virus and also about the vaccine. That policy is no more. That kind of segues into all this talk about Apple. As you mentioned, Apple has not responded at all publicly to what Musk is saying. What we do know is Apple vets apps before they go into their app store and before those apps can go on to your phone. They vet the apps to make sure they are safe, make sure they don`t have viruses or spyware. We have also seen them crack down on apps that promote what they view as dangerous misinformation and also hate speech. There was a right-wing social media platform here in the U.S. last year, Parler, that was removed from the app store for a few months last year until it got its hate speech policies in place in a way that Apple was happy with. It is possible that as Musk tears up this rulebook and tries to make Twitter what he would call a bastion of free speech, Apple might have some concerns that there would  be a lot of hate and other potentially dangerous posts on the platforms. So that could play a lot into it. Also, finally as you mentioned, Alison, we are here in Florida, where Yoel Roth, who quit Twitter a few weeks ago, he was basically in charge of enforcing a lot of Twitter`s rules. He will be speaking out here at this foundation conference in just a few hours. It`s the first time we are hearing from a very senior Twitter employee who has left since Musk took over.",

And after that first match against England, as you mentioned, when the team did not sing the national anthem and that was seen as a show of protest, supporting the protesters back home, quite an embarrassment and humiliation for the Iranian regime. The source says that members of the Revolutionary Guard Corps met with the team members and intimidated and threatened them, saying that they will, quote, \"behave, sing the national anthem and not take part in any sort of protests or their families back home were going to face torture and violence. Then we saw what happened during that game against Wales, where they did sing the national anthem. And again tonight. So no surprise seeing them sing the national anthem. Not so enthusiastically but understandable when we hear about these kinds of threats that they have been facing. I could tell you a lot of Iranians, Alison, were looking to this moment. They were hoping that the team would use this moment, while they are on the global stage, while all eyes were focused on them, to try to show support for the protest movement, this popular uprising that has entered its third month. They feel very disappointed that the team didn`t carry on, didn`t really do that. When you see so many Iranian athletes over the past few weeks, who have really courageously stood up to the regime and shown support for the protest movement in different championships.
