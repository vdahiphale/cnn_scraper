Those are the markets and the main events, nothing but quiet. The White House now says President Biden is absolutely not considering stepping down from the 2024 race. Hurricane Beryl closes in on Jamaica. And on the eve of the election, British voters say they desperately want change. Live from New York. It's Wednesday, July 3rd. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, Joe Biden says no one will push him out of the US presidential race as pressure grows for him to step aside. Now, the president was defiant in a call with his campaign earlier, telling staff that he is in the race until the end. It comes as a source tells CNN that President Biden has privately acknowledged the next few days are critical in determining whether he can save his re-election bid. His poll numbers sour and concerns grow among donors. Publicly though, his team continues to say that the president will continue in this race. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president is moving forward. He is moving forward as being president, he is moving forward with his campaign as his campaign has been very, very clear about that. That's what I can -- that's what I can speak to and that's what I can say and that is the presidents focus. The president's focus is how does he continue to do that work and anything else that we are hearing or that is being reported is absolutely false. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think the White House had to come out and say that he is running because if it hadn't we would have seen the power ebb away from him before our very eyes. We probably would have seen the start of a pseudo-Democratic nomination race to rush to the convention, so he had to stop it. It is losing control of this story and this crisis this, but behind the scenes, there are even more Democrats on Capitol Hill who fear that the President could not just hand the White House to Donald Trump, but could hand the Senate and the House to Republicans and we would have an era of unfettered Trump-MAGA government.",

He said that night, he was suffering jet lag and a cold, and what we heard essentially was that these periods where he loses the thread are happening with worrying frequency.

Are they not doing these because they don't want to know if they think there is something else going on? It is very hard to even crawl inside and understand that, I think that the White House is trying to make the case that basically there is nothing unusual with his condition right now that would require a deeper investigation by his doctors and that is what I took away from that briefing today and maybe that's the case, maybe they are looking at him and thinking that they are seeing just the ordinary things that happen when you're 81.",

I mean, just within the last few hours, we've had two high-quality polls that come out and they show the same margin. You can look at the New York Times-Siena College poll among likely voters. Look at this, Donald Trump up by six points before the debate, that poll had shown Trump up by just by three points, so a doubling of his advantage there. There is also a \"Wall Street Journal\" poll that came out within the last hour. That poll had previously had a race that was basically too close to call, and now, Donald Trump ahead by six points, that matches the margin that we had yesterday. Yes, there are a few polls that aren't so bad for Joe Biden. You know, there is a Reuters-IPSOS poll yesterday that had the race tied. But when you average it all together, try and get rid of that statistical noise, what we see as a race that has moved towards Donald Trump since the debate. And I was actually thinking about this before I came on and I was trying to think, especially for some of the younger viewers at this particular point in the cycle, they have never seen a Republican candidate this far ahead in a presidential race. You have to go all the way back, I believe since 2000, that's 24 years ago for Republicans candidate to be doing as well in the National Popular Vote polls as Donald Trump is doing right now.",

You see Pete Buttigieg down by four, Gavin Newsom down by five, same with Gretchen Whitmer. But the thing to me that is so interesting about those candidates like Newsom and Whitmer, nobody really knows who these folks are. The unknown, no opinion on a Gavin Newsom or Gretchen Whitmer are through the roof. So the fact that nobody knows who they are and they are doing better than Joe Biden if even by a little bit, than the incumbent president suggests to me that although they may start off on the same relative level, or a little bit better than Joe Biden, their ceiling is significantly higher. So at this particular point, when you see Joe Biden, who is basically universally well-known doing a poorly, I think a lot of Democrats especially those behind the scenes are asking, can we really do any worse than Joe Biden?

And the fact that she isn't as well-known as Joe Biden, I think Democrats, at least a few of them are thinking in their heads, you know what? Maybe it is worth taking the shot because we've gone six months, or eight months, or ten months with Joe Biden against Donald Trump and essentially when we knew that this was going to be the rematch and the numbers haven't moved. And in fact, if anything, they've gotten worse. Why not take a shot with somebody else? See if the numbers can move, because the fact is, even if they're polling at the same level, I think there is more volatility available in the Kamala Harris equation than there is in a Joe Biden equation where we've basically seen steady polls or steady polls that have just gotten worse for the incumbent president.",

Now, in India, regional authorities formed a special team to investigate a deadly crowd crush. Authorities say more than 120 people died in the crush of an overcrowded religious gathering on Tuesday. Now, police say the preacher who led the event is absconding. Police have also accused the event's organizers of culpable homicide attempting to cover up evidence and providing false information. So far, the organizers have not commented. CNN's senior international correspondent, Ivan Watson has more, but a warning, this report does contain disturbing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This wasn't supposed to happen. Victims wheeled past as grieving relatives arrive at hospitals looking for missing loved ones. What was meant to be a time of prayer ended in tragedy in Northern India Tuesday afternoon after a religious gathering turned into a deadly crowd crush. It claimed more than a hundred lives. Most of the victims, women, and some children. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): As soon as the function ended, chaos ensued. Any person who fell could not get up. Everyone was crushed to death. WATSON (voice over): Authorities say organizers issued permits for around 80,000 people to attend the event, but as many as 250,000 may have showed up. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): There was a sudden commotion due to overcrowding and excessive humidity. WATSON (voice over): A government official said, attendees may have fallen into an open sewer and on top of each other as they tried to reach the self-styled godman, who led the prayer event. A day after the disaster, Subhash Lal awaits outside of main hospital, here to collect the body of his mother, 65-year-old Samdati Devi (ph). \"My son arrived first and said, Dad, your mother is no more,\" he says. \"If there was no carelessness,\" he adds, \"Then people would not have died like this.\" Police are accusing the event organizers of culpable homicide and covering up evidence. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed condolences to the victims' families, but deadly incidents like this happen all too often in India. In January 2022, at least 12 people died in a crush at a shrine in Jammu in Northern India. Authorities say they'll pay compensation to families of the victims of this week's tragedy, cold comfort for people who suffered a sudden and shocking loss. Ivan Watson, CNN, Hong Kong.

She also faced a lot of questions about the president's new explanation for why he debated so poorly a couple of days ago. Fatigue and jet lag coming from the two foreign trips that he had had in the run-up to the debate, though, again, we should note there were nearly two weeks of time when the president was back in the States and doing a lot of debate prep. So there's no good answer for why the president may have been still fatigued and still jet-lagged some 12 days later, and no good explanation for why this is the new sort of excuse that we're hearing from the president only last night when it's been days and the White House press secretary yesterday are also facing questions about this, hadn't pointed to those factors. And she said that this was because she was so focused on pointing out that the president had had a cold and that is why she had not pointed to those other factors that the president is now talking about. We are seeing the president, I should note, doing a little bit more outreach. The kind of outreach that a lot of Democrats have been hoping to see a little sooner. We know that he has made a couple of phone calls to Democratic leaders. We also know that he is going to be hosting a number of Democratic governors here at the White House this evening.

Right now, though, not too many people, are breaking ranks. I do think, you know, the reporting does suggest that a lot of Democrats would have preferred to hear from him sooner.

So we'll see what these efforts of -- you know, to do damage control amount to, but right now, as you note, he's insisting he's going to remain in the race, but also if there's a fresh round of polling, I mean, there's already some polls after the debate showing that Trump is widening -- former President Trump is widening his lead against President Biden, you know, if President Biden truly craters in some of these polls and that could, you know, really change the trajectory of the race and perhaps his own future at the top of the ticket.",

But what that debate disaster did a few weeks ago will mean is that every time that he appears in public, he's going to be scrutinized from now until the election. Every time he hesitates or stutters or appears to make some kind of verbal mistake that will be highlighted. His problem now is that he created the impression that he was diminished in that debate. And every time there is something that doesn't quite work, it's going to fill into that template politically. So he's going to be under a great deal of pressure here going forward.",
