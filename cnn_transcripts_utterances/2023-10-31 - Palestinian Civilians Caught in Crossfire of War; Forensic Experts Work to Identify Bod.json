Now, the Israeli ground operation is expanding, and it's believed Israeli forces are at least several kilometers, perhaps a little bit more than a couple miles, inside the enclave. The Israeli prime minister is making it clear there will be no truce comparing his government stance to that of the U.S. after the attacks on Pearl Harbor and 9/11. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
