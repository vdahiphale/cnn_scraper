      "sentences": "Good morning. We start this hour with the breaking news.Hurricane Idalia is now a powerful category 4 hurricane. It has been a rapid intensification over the course of the last several hours from a category 3, now officially a category 4 hurricane according to the National Hurricane Center. Catastrophic storm surge and destructive winds are nearing Florida's Big Bend region as we speak. Idalia is about 50 to 60 miles away from the shore right now, churning with 130-mile-per-hour winds. Now, we just got that new forecast from the National Hurricane Center just moments ago, and I want to go straight to Derek Van Dam who is on the ground for us in Tampa. Sara Sidner is with us as well. Derek, we start with you because you understand what these forecasts mean and what we're seeing right now in these very critical moments, better than anybody. What does this tell you?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, exactly what we feared, the rapid intensification now to a category 4 major hurricane Idalia, wow, really eyeing the Big Bend coast. But where I'm standing now on Bayshore Boulevard in Tampa Bay is proof that you do not need to be near the center of where the storm makes landfall in order to feel its impacts.What you are looking at is storm surge from Tampa Bay. This is what we were forecasting, 4 to 6 feet and it is certainly being realized. This is Bayshore Boulevard and you can see the waves coming crashing over the seawall. We get sprayed every 30 seconds or so. Here comes another push of water. Remember what is happening here, we have a high tide that just occurred at 4:00 this morning. But we also have inland flooding. And that with the surge of water from the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, all of these working in combination and almost in symphony together to create this rising water that you see below me. We are in a safe location. We have the ability to duck under cover. But we want to set the scene about why the storm is so incredibly dangerous. It is not necessarily the winds where we are, even though it is gusting tropical storm force, but it is the surge of water. And, unfortunately, as you work your way further north into the Big Bend of Florida, that is where we anticipate even more significant impacts than what we've experienced here. Let's take you around the corner, show you this major intersection. Here is Bayshore Boulevard and look at the houses behind me. This water is not only on Bayshore Boulevard, but it is also pushing inland. I saw it about one city block up from here as well. So it is knocking on the doorsteps of some of these homes, threatening these homes with water and inundation. Just look down this road. Both sides of this beautiful, beautiful avenue are completely inundated with water. More spray coming every few seconds, there is another one just surging up from the Tampa Bay region. That's downtown Tampa Bay. This is a major thoroughfare. You could call it an artery for Tampa Bay. And there is just no way that people will be traversing these roads today with storm surge this high -- Phil.",

But during a super moon, which is occurring now, the moon is roughly 18,000 miles closer than it typical is during the cycle, its full moon cycle. So what it does, at effect, it has a greater pull, a greater tug per se. And that creates greater and more exaggerated tidal swings from lower low tides to hire high higher high tides.We've just crossed a high tide here, and getting the combination of storm surge but also enhanced tide from the super moon. And the water from inland flooding all leading together in this conglomeration of rising water levels here along the Tampa Bay Boulevard where I'm standing -- Sara.",

It is beautiful when it is not in the situation that it is in now, which is inundated with water. It is completely -- when you say it is a beautiful boulevard, we know that is true. Anyone who's ever been there.Thank you so much, Derek Van Dam, for your reporting there. Please, please, please stay safe you and your crew. I know things can get really dicey really quickly. We appreciate your time. And like I said, I'm about 80 miles from him in Crystal River. We are in -- the entire town is in a flood zone, by the way. There is about 3,400 people that live in this small town but it is a destination for tourists. People who want to see the manatees, the favorite animal of Florida. They are these beautiful calm sweet animals. They will be fine. They are in the water enjoying their lives. The humans however need to evacuate. They can still evacuate. It is very interesting to see the difference between -- and we're getting another one of those gusts. The difference between where Derek is which looks like where the storm is hitting and where I am, I'm actually closer to the eye of the storm than Derek is. But he is getting the on shore bands of wind from the outer part of the hurricane. And we have not seen a massive push just yet. This place, of course, hoping to avoid that. But the entire west coast of Florida is feeling this in some way, shape or form. And the big fear here is the water. You saw what was happening to Derek and what was happening to the homes there. Here, they are expecting potentially 7 to 9 foot storm surge. Which means the water that you are seeing behind me gets pushed up and over way -- over my head. All right. Now, we're starting to get the rain. We're starting to get one of those bands of rain and wind from Hurricane Idalia that is coming through here in Crystal River. We have not by any means seen the worst of this storm yet as it is now a category 4 storm -- Phil.",

But the fact that they had to stop so far away to avoid the floodwaters and then lay 1,000 feet of hose to get to the hydrant and then another thousand feet off of that to get to the actual structure, that's time consuming.

It means sustained winds of between 130 and 156 miles per hour, a very dangerous storm.Yes, the wind is dangerous, but the most dangerous thing that people need to be aware of is the storm surge, is the water. And as all officials will tell you, you should run from the water and hide from the wind. That is why there is an evacuation order in dozens of counties here in Florida. I want to get to a place that is under evacuation order as well as the one I'm here in Crystal River, because we are in such low lying area here. I want to get to our Bill Weir who is in Steinhatchee, Florida. Tell us what you are seeing there, Bill, as these outer bands of the hurricane are slapping into you.",

The actual SteinhatcheeRiver is just behind us here. We're about 28 feet above elevation. This is the highest spot we could find in our hotel there. So the worry is we're keeping an eye on as the sun will come up on the water shoving up that river, and that's in this part of the Big Bend, this is the nature coast, there are so much fresh water, tributaries, rivers feeding into the Gulf of Mexico that will become recipients of all that water as the wind shoves it up inland as well. But a lot of the folks we met here followed the evacuation orders, but there are always a few who refuse to leave. We met a couple who had done the math and thought that it would better serve their families staying here. They are worried if they leave and can't get back in, that was a bigger risk than actually riding out the storm. And we'll see. It's always that decision folks make right now. But we're not anticipating the heavy winds for another hour or so before it really starts kicking in. So this is still stereotypically or sort of in a saying way as the calm before the real storm.

It is the pushing of all of this body of water up and over into the town that is the big worry here. The water is going to be the story. The water is the thing, the storm surge is the thing that takes lives, the storm surge is the thing that ruins homes often, all though -- and here we go, we're getting quite a gust of wind here.
